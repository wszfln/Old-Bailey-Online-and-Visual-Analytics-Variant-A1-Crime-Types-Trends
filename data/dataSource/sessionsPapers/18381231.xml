There are nearly 3000 pigs of tin there similar to this, but with different numbers—after the prisoner was stopped I searched over the pigs, and found No. 550 deficient—this is the stab I missed—I have a tally which was found about two yards from the stack near the door going up to the warehouse—I had tied it to this slab myself—this is the property of the London Dock Company.</p>

On the 22nd of December I was at Hungerford-wharf—the prisoner came there with my employer's van—I delivered to him forty-eight sacks of potatoes—he was to take twenty-four to Mr. Morritt, of Lombard-street, and twenty-four to James-street, Drury-lane-about twelve o'clock the same night I was sent for to his loding,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tide-surveyor, and have known the prisoner from childhood. I knew her at Plymouth—she has exhibited flightiness, and a confused state of mind—at times she decidedly appeared not con<lb/>scious of what she was doing—I saw her last about two months ago—she said she was going up stairs for a minute, but she did not return—I thought she would have returned, and wished me good night, but she left in that state, and I made the remark, that she was in the same state of mind as I had seen her before.</p>

Mr. Thomas Peckham Grout lives there—I had the care of that house for him—it is a lodging-house—the prisoner lodged there—on the 21st of December, I made the beds and locked the doors, as usual, about four o'clock-about seven o'clock, a lodger came and asked me if I was aware that a second<lb/>floor room was open—I went up and found four beds stripped, and some things lying on the floor—I missed the articles stated, which are the pro<lb/>perty of Mr. Grout—I sat in the shop to receive the money from the lodgers—the prisoner passed and repassed me three times that evening—he said it was very cold—about seven o'clock he went out, and called his dog to follow him, but it would not go—the prisoner then went out, and I did not see him again till he was in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on the business of an engraver, in Regent-street. On Monday morning, the 13th of August last, the prisoner came to my house, and said he had several orders to give for engraving, and di<lb/>rected me to call on him the following morning, at Beety's hotel, Conduit-street, where I should receive instructions about it—that is the principal of what passed—I had never seen him before—he was with me some time, and looked at a great many impressions, and that sort of thing—I went next day to Beety's hotel, and found him there in the coffee-room—he pro<lb/>duced this genuine note on the Toronto Bank—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it was then perfect—the piece now detached then formed part of the note—he told me that he wanted the note re-engraved, and asked me what I would do it for—I agreed to do it for fourteen guineas, and he ordered me to <hi rend="italic">go</hi> on with the plate immediately—I looked at the note, and saw the names on it at the time, and he stated, after giving me the note, that he was one of the part<lb/>ners of the firm—he had previously told me that his name was Mr. John Hannon—he requested I would be particular in doing it like the original note, that he should require a great many done, having other notes to be engraved—it was arranged that it should be done in three weeks, I think—I then left, and proceeded with the engraving of the plate—he came to me constantly during the three weeks, every day, I should say, and saw the plate upon which I was working—he took it from my hands repeatedly to examine with the original, to see if I was doing it correctly—when it was nearly completed, he asked me to put the names of "Rorden Wright, Hatch and Co., New York," on the note, as it was on the original—their names appear at the bottom of that note as the engravers of it—I de<lb/>clined doing that, and offered to put my own name—he said that was of no use, and offered to give me a sovereign if I would do it—I refused to do it altogether—finding I would not do it, he said it was of no con<lb/>sequence, he would get it done in America—two or three days prior to the 10th of September, I made inquiry of a friend of mine, who had just returned from America, and in consequence of what he told me, I commu<lb/>nicated with the Bank agents in London—on the 10th of September the prisoner called for the plate and notes, which, according to appointment, I was to deliver to him that morning, (there were eighty notes,) but in con<lb/>sequence of what I had heard, I refused to part with them—I put him off with some excuse, and made another appointment with him—I think the 14th was the day fixed—I was then acting under advice—on the morning of the 14th, I think, he came and paid me, altogether, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I de<lb/>livered him the plate, and the eighty impressions—I was aware at the time I delivered them to him, that the police were on the watch—I had an im<lb/>pression taken from the plate, in addition to the eighty which I kept—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—the eighty were fac-similes of this—on the 18th of September the prisoner came to me again—he told me that he had lost the</p>

               <p>notes, and the plate, at some house of ill fame, where he had been some few nights before, and that he should require the same plate re-engraved, and another exactly like it, with the exception of its being for five dollars instead of ten, and two other plates for the City Bank of Montreal—he at the same time produced an original note for the City Bank" a price was fixed on, and I agreed to do it—I was in communication with him up to the 27th of September—I went immediately to the solicitor, in consequence of his giving me these further orders, and made an arrangement with the police—I afterwards made an appointment to see the prisoner at a coffee-house, where he was taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, and live in High-street, Aldgate. On the 21st of December, at half-past ten o'clock, I met the female prisoner in High-street, Whitechapel, and went with her to No. 9, Essex-street—I went up stairs to the top room of the house, where the male prisoner was sitting by the fire—she told him to go out for a few minutes—at that time he had a jacket on—he went outside the door about two minutes, put on a smock, and came. in again, and immediately said, "What do you do</p>

               <p>here?"—I was standing in the middle of the room, towards the fire-place, talking to the woman, and the woman was standing nearly close to me—I was doing nothing but talking—there was a bed in the room—I should think I was about a yard from the bed—it was a small room—we were not about to lie down on the bed, at the time—when he said "What do you do here?" I said, "You knew I was here when you were told to go out"—he ran up to me, knocked me down, and fell on the top of me—he then got up and kicked me—I said, "For God's sake, don't kick me any more, and I will give you 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he said, "Give us hold of it then," and I gave him one—the woman was standing in the room—she never offered to touch me—just at that time, the people in the room below <hi rend="italic">sang</hi> out, "What it the matter young man, do you want a light?"—I said, "Yes, I do if you please, for I have been ill-used, and robbed of three half-crowns"—I missed the half-crowns from my left-hand waistcoat-pocket, at the room<lb/>door, before I got down stain—I had seen them not ten minutes before, as I came out of Whitechapel—I had just changed half a sovereign at Couts's wine-vaults in Whitechapel—when I called out, somebody came up and brought a light—I went down and sat in a chair, in Walker's room, for five or six minutes—I told him the same story—he then lighted me down stairs, I went and fetched a policeman, and gave the man in charge—I went to the room for the purpose of going with the woman, but I had not laid down with her—she called the male prisoner by name, and asked him to go out for a few minutes—there was no other woman in the room—Walker's wife lighted me down stairs—I was kicked all round my body—he could not kick my head, as it was under the bedstead—I was quite sober—I had not been drinking, except a quartern of gin-and-peppermint, with two friends—I did not know the prisoners before—I missed my money just as I was coming out of the room-door, not before—it was then that I called out to she people below that I was robbed—the man had let go of me then, and I was coming away—I felt in my pocket, and missed my money.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 16th of December, about ten o'clock, I was applied to by Mrs. Tilley, to lock up her husband's warehouse, as he was in the hospital at the time—the warehouse is about a hundred and fifty yards from Tilley's house—it is a sort of broker's warehouse—there was a copper on the first-floor then—next morning (Monday) I went and found the street-door a-jar, the lock broken off, and put behind the door, and the copper gone—I went in per<lb/>suit of the prisoner in consequence of suspicions, and found him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner,</hi> I want to know what purpose the warehouse was taken for—it is my house—I rented it at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I have the key of it in my hand—I have witnesses to prove he gave me possession of it. <hi rend="italic">Witness.

I was on duty in Webb-square on the 16th of December, about eleven o'clock at night, and met the prisoner with the copper on his shoulder—I asked where he was taking it to—he said to No. 9, Webb-square, to his own dwelling-house, and he had brought it from Ratcliff-highway, from Mr. Tatham's, the brazier—I said I did not think he had brought it from there—he said, "Well, you can very easily overlook it, it belongs to a relation—it belongs to the Excise"—I said I suspected it was stolen, and should take him to the station-house—he then said it had been repaired at Tatham's, and he had paid for the repairs—I went to Tatham's, and made inquiry, then returned, and charged him on suspicion of stealing it.</p>

If you do not forgive me, and you do prosecute me, you will transport me for life, I am sure you will forgive and forget as the Scripture teaches us to do, and to love one another, if it is only for the sake of our two poor babes. All you have to say when you go before the Magistrate is, that you have forgiven me, and that you will not prosecute me, and that you should like me to go home with you: if you will say this, you will never have cause to regret it. Do not suffer yourself to be advised by any one, look to your only protector in your husband; forgive me this once, my dear Ca<lb/>therine, and let us be happy all the rest of our life.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Brown, and live in George-court, St. Anne-street. Last Monday I went over to my daughter's at Lambeth—I returned at a little after eleven o'clock at night, and going down St. Anne-street, I saw a young woman run across the street—she came up to me, pulled my cloak with main force, and tried to get it from me, but could not succeed, as it was fastened across my back—I had an umbrella in my left hand—she dragged that out of my hand, ran across the street with it, and went up a court—I called a policeman, who went up the court after her, but I was afraid to go myself—the policeman pro<lb/>duced the umbrella—It was thrown out of a window—the prisoner is the person who took it from me—when I came into the room, I said, "She is the person, I am certain of her"—I found her in the house up the court, after the policeman came.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 6, Bedford-street, Bedford-square, and am a surgeon; Dunn lived with me as cook. About ten o'clock, on Thursday evening, the 27th of December, I was coming down Bedford-street, and saw Dunn come up the area steps and give Matthews a basket, which she placed under her cloak—I took hold of her, and said she most come inside my house, that I might examine the basket—she did so, and in it I found some potatoes uncooked, some mashed potatoes, some roast beef warm which had been taken out of the oven in a plate; a towel, two jars, a glass bottle, and a plate—these are the articles—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—there were also some candles—I cannot swear to them, but I had such things, and the bottle has on it a label, of my writing—I told Matthews I had seen her within the last two months frequently at the door, and the policeman had watched her—in consequence of that, I gave them both into custody, and previously to their being removed, my wife wished Dunn's box should be opened, and there was found, in my presence, three aprons, three napkins, two collars, one a lace one, a pillow-case, and a baby's bed-gown—they bear our mark on them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Howell and Co., of Waterloo-place. On the 19th of May last, Norrington came to our shop in a phaeton, at<lb/>tended by a servant, who I believe was Caton, for the purpose of giving an order for a variety of goods—he ordered shirts for himself and servant, stockings, drawers, cravats, and gloves for himself and his servant—he said he had just arrived from Boulogne, and that he was about taking a house in the Regent's-park, but was in the mean time staying at the Carl ton Hotel, which is nearly opposite our house—he took some goods away, consisting of satin, crape, and satin cravats—the value of the goods he took came to 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—afterwards, on that same day, I went to the Carlton Hotel, and saw Norrington there—in the mean time something had occurred which excited my suspicion—he had not paid for any of the goods he had—I went to get the money or the goods—I saw him there—he said he could not pay for the goods, he had not the money, he had not received his remittances, but he should have them on Monday—that was on Saturday—a satin dress was part of the articles he took away—he said he had been a customer of ours the season before, and he thought it was extraordinary conduct on our part—I went to ascertain if that was the case—I went again over to him, and he then said, he could not give me the satin back again, as he had given it away—that was on the same day—he said if I would call on the Monday, he would give me a cheque for the money—in consequence of that I went on Monday, and he was gone—s month or six weeks afterwards I met him at the end of Piccadilly—I asked him if his name was Norrington—he said it was not—I said it was, and he had not paid for the things he had of me some time before—he appeared as if he suddenly recollected it, and said he had not received his remit<lb/>tances, when he expected them—he had given me the name of Norrington when he first came to the house—he gave me his card—he did not persist in saying that his name was not Norrington, but he said if I would call at his lodgings on Monday at Thistle-grove, Brompton, he would give me the money—I did not agree to that, and refused to leave him—we walked some distance, he then proposed that I should go to Thistle-grove with him—he walked a little way and a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was called—he told the man to go to Down-street, Piccadilly, as he thought he could <hi rend="italic">get</hi> the money nearer than by going to Thistle-grove—we got out there, and went down Brick-street; Norrington rang a bell at a stable door, and a person who stood inside said there was nobody at home—we got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> again, and Norrington gave directions to the man to drive to Thistle-grove—I was not satisfied with that, and desired the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-man to drive to my employers, Howell and James—Norrington refused to go there, and attempted to leave the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he opened the door—I took his arm, pulled him back, and threatened to give him in charge if he attempted to leave—I took him to Howell and James,</p>

               <p>and the clerk of our solicitor was sent for—we agreed that he, and I, and Norrington should go to Thistle-grove, where Norrington said he had 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was all he could pay at present—we went there, and Norrington went in—there was a back and front door—I waited at the back door, and the clerk at the front door—Norrington came out two or three times while we waited—he found us there and went in again—Sidford* came out after some time—he said Mr. Norrington had come to him, bat be could do nothing, or something to that effect—and he said he had recommended Him, as his uncle must know of the circumstances, to go to his uncle and state it to him at once—his uncle's address was men<lb/>tioned, as at Lower Eaton-street, Pimlico, a Mr. Chambers was mentioned—we all went to this uncle, in Lower Eaton-street, accompanied by Sid<lb/>ford, who went at Norrington's request—we found a young woman in the shop—Norrington had some conversation with her, which I did not hear, and then Norrington said it was very unfortunate that his uncle was not at home—he then had some further conversation with the young woman in the passage—she then came back from the passage, and Sidford asked her if Norrington had stated the business on which we were come—that at<lb/>tracted my attention—I rather listened, and while I was listening Norring<lb/>ton made his escape—he must have gone out at the back way and crawled across the yard, or I should have seen him through the window at the back of the shop—he must have crouched down—I saw Norrington about a month afterwards at the George and Blue Boar, Holborn—and I gave him into custody there—I took him to Marlborough-street, and he was dis<lb/>charged.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot-maker, and live in Stafford-street, Bond-street. Norrington called at our house on the 15th of May last—he stated he had just arrived from abroad, had taken apartments at Mr. Fisher's, * Sidford is in custody, indicted with the other defendants, but traversed till next Session.</p>

               <p>in Duke-street, St. James's, and he wanted a stock of boots and shoes—he said Mr. Fisher had recommended him, or something to that effect—he ordered goods to the amount of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—he ordered some boots for himself, tried on a pair or two, and found there was not any to fit him—he gave me the order, and said he would send his servant, that the things must be done in very quick time—that he had only just taken his servant into his employ, and he wanted him to go out with him in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I made the boots—the servant Caton came running in about five minutes after, as if out of breath, and asked if his master had been there—he said he came from Mr. Fisher, where they represented that they had taken lodgings—I knew Mr. Fisher to be a respectable man, and that he would not take any one in if they were not respectable—I took Caton's measure for a couple of pair of jockey-boots—he saw a pair in the window and wanted to take them, but I would not let him—he saw a pair of Oxford shoes, and he took them, put them on his feet, and said they did very nicely, they would do for the stable—he took them away with him—the next day Norrington came again to inquire about the boots—he tried on a pair of slippers that were in the window, or somewhere near at hand—they had the misfortune to fit, and he had them—about two days afterwards he called to see how the things were getting on—on the second or third occasion he stated he had removed from Mr. Fisher's to the Carl ton, and the things were to be sent to the Carlton—I know Thistle-grove—on the last occasion that I saw Norring<lb/>tan, he called in company with another, whom I believe to be Sidford, and stated he had left the Carlton, and the things were to be sent to Thistle-grove—that was four or five days after he ordered them to be sent to the Carlton—he came on one occasion with a phaeton and a pair of grey horses to take the things away—he was in the phaeton, and Caton was driving it—Caton came in and took his boots—I went out and said that the goods were not all finished, they should be sent—I had made inquiries at Mr. Fisher's and at the Carlton, and had suspicion from what I heard—in consequence of that I produced the bill of the goods to him, the last time he called with Sidford—I took off the discount, and said I only did business for ready money—he said he had not any money with him, I had better send the things to Thistle-grove the next morning, and he would pay for them, but I must send early, as he should leave at nine o'clock, and Sidford said that Norrington was going to dine with him at No. 13, Thistle-grove, that evening, and he would he there all night—I cannot say which said that Norrington was going to leave before nine o'clock next morning, they were both in conversation—the next rooming I sent the goods, and the boy brought them back—the amount of the bill was about 10/.—he got off with his slippers, and Caton with the Oxford shoes—in August I took Caton before the Magistrate at Marlborough-street—he told the Magistrate he had only been with his master a few days, that he did not then live with him, as he had discharged him, and he knew nothing of the transaction—I had preferred a similar charge against Norrington, and the Magistrate thought he could not help me.</p>

On the 10th of September, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, Norrington came, accompanied by a lady, who was dressed genteelly in black—I think I see the lady in the gallery of the Court now—they came in a gig—in about an hour afterwards Caton came—Caton said the lady</p>

               <p>was Mrs. Norrington—I have every reason to believe that Sidford has been at the Slaughter coffee-house while they were there, as a visitor—he dined with them—when Norrington came, he wanted a sitting-room and bed-room for himself, and a bed-room for his servant, for one night—he was told, in my presence, that it was not usual to let the rooms for one night, but if he would take the rooms for three or four nights we should have no objection, and he consented to do so—Caton performed the duties of a servant—they staid from the 10th till the 17th—I made inquiries of Caton, who his master and the family were—he said his master was a man of very large fortune, and very high family—several persons came to see them—they have had three persons to breakfast, and about the same number to dinner—the lady who came with him did not stay the whole week—she left on the third or fourth day, which I thought was rather queer—one morning when I went in with the breakfast I asked Norring<lb/>ton how many I was to lay for, (<hi rend="italic">he was then sitting on the sofa,</hi>) he said, "Only for myself'—I said, "Is the lady not here?"—he said, "No, she is gone for three or four days on a visit to her uncle's"—the bill amounted to 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that included these breakfasts, and dinners, sherry, and champagne—they all appeared so respectable, we had no suspicion of them—on the 17th we had no notice that Mr. Norrington was going away, but his having no luggage in the house, I laid the bill on the table with the break fast-things—he went out after breakfast, and came home to din<lb/>ner with a friend, who I have every reason to believe was Sidford—they had dinner and went out, and did not return.</p>

               <p>a very nice cottage, he liked it very much, and he thought he should like to live in it himself—Mrs. Mickle then asked him what was to be done about the young people who were to come at twelve o'clock—he said, "That is not your business, it is mine"—I left him in possession, and he said to his man, "Scales, go and fetch me the old nurse, you know who I mean, and order me some coals"—Norrington came that same day, but I did not see him, I afterwards found him, and Caton, and the two ladies, in possession of No. 19, Park-road, next to where I live, and I had prepared an agreement to let that house to him for a year—while Norrington was in possession of No, 19, Keene called upon me, and said he would not be answerable for the rent of No. 19, unless it was made in very short pay<lb/>ments—after Norrington had been in possession of No. 19, for two or three days, he sent for me, I went and found Sidford there—in consequence of what then passed I gave Norrington notice to quit in a week—he wanted to remain a fortnight—I was never paid a farthing for his board and lodging there—I went to No. 33 1/2, and found a policeman there—Keene told me that Norrington had but 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week allowed him by his relations or friends, and he said—"As I have got you into this trouble with Nor<lb/>rington I will see you paid to that amount"—that was for the board and lodging, but he never paid me one farthing—I remember Norrington passing my door on the 13th, and he asked me to walk in with him—I had, in the mean time, made observations in the neighbourhood about these tenants—I went in, and he told me that as I had been in the neighbour<lb/>hood, and reported many things against him, that he would not pay me till the Monday—(<hi rend="italic">I understood by that he meant the Monday following</hi>)—on the Saturday following, the 17th of November, I found they were all gone—that was the Saturday before the Monday, till which he said he would not pay me—during the time Caton was in the" house he was in livery, and appeared as a servant—their board and lodging came to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I live on my means, at Eltham. On Wednes<lb/>day, the 6th of June, the last day of Greenwich fair, I was returning from Woolwich to my residence at Eltham—I had occasion to go down Well hall-lane—it wanted about twenty-five minutes to eleven o'clock when I was near the farm-house there—I met two soldiers in red coats, dressed as the prisoner is—they separated so as to oblige me to go between them—the one on my right hand wished me good night, and the other struck me with some weapon, which at that time I did not see—I was stunned by the blow, and fell—when I came to myself I found two men over me, one holding his hand over my mouth, and putting sand into it occasionally, and the other rifling my trowsers pocket—I had a purse in my pocket con<lb/>taining four half-sovereigns, and at least six sovereigns—there was about 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. loose in my pocket—when I came to myself the one who was rifling my pocket had not got my money out—he got it out afterwards, and as soon as they had emptied the pocket containing the money, they scam<lb/>pered off towards Woolwich—I had a very severe wound in my head, which bled profusely at the time—I had about a mile to walk home from the spot—I heard a clock strike eleven more than a quarter of an hour after this violence.</p>

I went off furlough to Woolwich, on the 23rd of July last, and soon after that I saw the prisoner in the Duchess of Wellington public-house—we had four pots of beer, each paid for two—he said, during the time he was drinking, if he had known I had been going on furlough so soon, he would have given me a sovereign to go on furlough with—I asked how he could give me a sovereign, for he had no more pay than me—he said, "Have you heard tell of the robbery that was committed at Eltham, on the 6th of June"—I said I had heard some<lb/>thing about it—he said, "Mind what I am going to tell you, and don't let it go any further"—I agreed that it should go no further than me—he told me that Perceval and he were walking in the Eltham-road, on the 6th of June, and they met a man, and the prisoner said he up with his fist, and gave him a b—good hit on the head—that they picked seven sove<lb/>reigns and some odd silver out of his pockets, and made the best of their way to the Black Boy, at Greenwich, and staid there till very early next morning; and the prisoner, Perceval, and two more marines, went to Lon<lb/>don, to sport with the money—that is all he said—I kept this secret till very lately, when there was some inquiry made about my being ill-treated, for giving information about something else, and then I made this disclo<lb/>sure—I have not had any quarrel with the prisoner—I do not belong to the same mess with him—I did once, but did not at the time of the rob<lb/>bery—when he paid for the porter at the Duchess of Wellington, I saw him take a little bag out of his pocket; and when he took the money out he said, "This is some of the money I had of him; it is not half spent yet;"—he treated me with two pots of ale, after he paid for the two pots of porter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the Justices at Woolwich. I re<lb/>member a marine named Perceval being in custody on this charge some time before the 15th of June last—another marine named Norton was a witness against him—the prisoner came forward as a witness on behalf of Perceval—he was sworn, and I took down his evidence, in the presence of the Justices—I produce the deposition which he then made—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Thomas Baker sworn, says—I belong to the 28th Company of Royal Marines—on Wednesday, the 6th of June, I met Perceval, opposite the dock-yard gate, in Woolwich, about half-past nine o'clock—he and I went together on the Lower-road to Greenwich—we went to the Black Boy at first, and there we remained all night—no one but Perceval and I went in—we met some comrades there—I am quite certain I did not leave the barracks with Perceval at six o'clock—I am sure Best did not go into the Black Boy with us—I am sure Perceval and I did not go half-way up the fair, or in it at all—on Thursday we went to London—we walked—I had half-a-crown—I don't know what Perceval had." This deposition was taken on the 15th of June, when Perceval was in custody—he was after<lb/>wards discharged—on the 14th of December the prisoner was himself brought before the Justice on this charge—the Magistrate then directed the depo<lb/>sition which he had previously made, and which I have just read, to be read over to him, and I made a note upon ft of what the prisoner then said, which is, "The said Thomas Baker declares, that he does not recollect what he then stated"—I should state that the latter part of the depo<lb/>sition just read were answers to questions put by the Magistrates, in con<lb/>sequence of Perceval's previous statement—and the last four or five</p>

               <p>questions were put by the Magistrate, to contradict Perceval—on the 14th of December, when the prisoner was charged with this offence, he was asked what he had to say, and I took down from his mouth what he said—this is the statement he made—(<hi rend="italic">looking</hi> at it)—after it was taken down I read it over to him, and he put his mark to it—he was cautioned by the Magis<lb/>trate, as well as by myself not to say a single word to criminate himself nothing was said to him in the way of promise—there were two or three Justices present—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Thomas Baker says—I was going on Eltham-road, on Greenwich Fair night, to meet a young woman, and I went to the side of the road to ease myself, and during the time I was easing my<lb/>self a man passed along the road—he appeared as if he had a bag on his back—he did not speak to me nor I to him—I went on the road, and when I came down by the side of the road, I saw something lay by the side of the road, which I walked up to—I could see it was some marines, with waist belts on—one of the men I directly knew at the time I stepped up, and he <hi rend="italic">throwed</hi> his head to me to go back—I did not go back, and weat down on my hands and knees, and looked in on the men—and I say another man right over the man's hips, and I saw it was Norton, and the other man I did not know—I got up and went, and Norton came and ran after me, after I had got some distance, and offered me some money, which I took, and I asked him what it was for, and I told him it was not his money, and that I should have nothing at all to do with it—he took it, and asked me what I was afraid of, and he gave me some silver, and said it was some money his father and mother had given him, to buy some things with—on the Lower-road of Greenwich I met Perceval, and him and me went to Greenwich together—we met Hunt, Jones, and a woman there, and there we stopped, till the policeman came and turned us out—I looked at that gentleman—(pointing to the prosecutor)—Norton told me the other man died at the hospital."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a street-keeper in the Borough. On the 22nd of last month I was in York-street, and saw the prosecutrix, who said that boy had robbed her of her purse—he was running with another lad—they ran about two hundred yards, and I after them—a young man who was a-head stopped the prisoner—he was rather out of breath—the other got quite away—I found nothing on him—he had a sort of green smock-frock on—I asked where he lived—he said, in the Mint—the other one had on a different coloured smock-frock, and was rather a bigger lad—they were not running till the prosecutrix spoke to me—he was taken with his smock-frock on—he had not time to pull it off—I am quite certain of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to James Butcher, a pawnbroker at Wandsworth—about half-past five o'clock on the afternoon of the 19th of December, the prisoner came to our shop, and brought this boy's jacket—she asked 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—I took it in for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in the name of Ann Smith.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mrs. Fanny Stewart, a pawnbroker at Putney—on the afternoon of the 19th of December, at near five o'clock, the prisoner came to our shop to pledge a shirt, but I did not take it in—not two minutes after she was gone out of the shop, I missed the corduroy jacket now produced—nobody had been in the shop after she was there—there were several present at the time she was.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> There were two women, I believe, named West and Griffiths? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were two women—I have known them I think about two months—as long as I have known the prisoner—I do not know their character at all—there were perhaps three other persons in the shop at the time—I am not sure whether there were five, seven, or three there.</p>
