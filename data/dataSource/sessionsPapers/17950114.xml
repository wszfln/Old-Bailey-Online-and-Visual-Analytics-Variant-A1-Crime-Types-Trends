               <p>I work at Blackwall-yard; I am a watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is this Blackwall-yard? - Down at Poplar, at Esq. Perry's.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say against the prisoner? - I know him very well. I was coming home from Blackwall-yard to the house where I lodge, and there I catched him with these things in the garden; it was about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the prisoner? - In Wright's garden.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mr. Wright? - He is a labouring man, a watchman in the yard; and the prisoner had these things on him, these two axes, and this tea kettle.</p>
               <p>Q. One is an axe and the other is an hatchet? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How had he these things? - In his hand taking them through the door, he was coming out into the street when I catched him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept the things from that time to this? - Yes, I am sure these are the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between you? - I asked him what business he had with them? he said he was fuddled or else he should not have come down there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear fuddled? - I really cannot say whether he was drunk or sober, I don't justly know what he was.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he appear to you? - He walked very well to the watch-house; we took him to the watch-house directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Wright come to the watch-house that night? - No, not till the next morning; I went up with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What time of the night was I taken? - Nine o'clock, as near as possible.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you find a bill against me last session at Hicks's Hall? I was turned out by proclamation.</p>
               <p>Court. What day did this happen? - The 16th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Why was not he prosecuted in December last? - I know nothing at all about that.</p>
               <p>Q. To Wright. You are likewise a watchman I understand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see this boy in your yard at all? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140004"/>Q.What time did you come home? - About six o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any property? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to the watch-house? - Gibson came down with an officer, and told me I must appear against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go on that information? - I went to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see these things there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The axe and hatchet did they belong to you? - Yes, I bought the small one, and the large one was given me by the carpenter that works in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any name on it? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you had it? - Nine months; I know it by the handle; I can swear to the hatchet, because I bought it and put the handle in myself; it was broke off, and I put it in again afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. The tea kettle what do you say to that? - The tea kettle was left in the room by a person who had rented the room, and went to sea, and his wife died, and I let the room again, and the tea kettle remained there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the name of these these people? - The man's name was

               <p>Q. What was it? - A guinea; he said to the other take this.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he any thing more about him? had he a box? - We took the box from him directly, and took the box and him to the White Horse cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the direction? can you read? - I cannot; I shewed the box to the coachman, and asked him if he knew any thing about the box? he said he did.</p>

               <p>Q. You say that in St. James's-square the prisoner offered you a guinea each; now on your oath did not Day and you tell him that if he would give you two guineas each you would let him go, and he offered you one guinea each, and you would not, except he would give you two each? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You chose to go after the man that had the box, in preference to the one that was in the rumble tumble? - I could not see the other man, nor could not have made the coachman hear if I had called.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. In the morning that this happened, I was going as far a Hammersmith, about a house that I was going to take in St. George's-fields, Blackfriars-road; in the Strand as I was going there, I had occasion to cross, and I saw something lay in the middle of the road; I immediately ran towards it, and found it was the box in question; I picked it up, there were four or five people present, one or two will come forward; after I picked it up I returned towards the Strand, to a part where I saw some light, to read the direction, and before I got to the light I was taken in custody by these two men; they asked how I came by that box? and I told them I had picked it up, and they insisted on taking it from me; I said it was not theirs, they did not seem to claim any right that it was theirs, but they insisted on my coming to the coach, and when we came to St. James's-street, there they both stopped with me, and said, if I would give them two guineas, they would let me go about my business; but before that, going along, Hicks said, he would swear it come out of the rumble tumble; when we came to St. James's-square they said if I would give them two guineas a piece I might go, and I offered them a guinea a piece, and they would not without the two guineas, and I said I would not give two guineas; and they took me directly up to the White Horse cellar, and there was the coach that it came from.</p>
               <p>Court to Record. Do you remember how you packed it in this basket? was there a possibility of its tumbling out? - It was impossible for it to tumble out, it was behind another box, stuck in edgeways.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. It must have shook a good deal coming along that way? - It could not have shaked out of its place, it was packed close, there was another box, a light box which was on it, that box was not taken, but there was a trunk taken at the same time, which we never found any thing of.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know of his losing any thing on the 8th of December last? - The property was taken before we knew of the loss, we lost three womens duffield<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140009"/>cloaks, and four childrens striped great coats.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that he lost them? - I know they were lost, because they were missing from the place where they were usually put up.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen them last, before you missed them? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Not even to a day or two? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen them a week before that? - We are very frequently selling these articles, and daily making application to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did they usually lay in the shop? - They lay on the shelf.</p>
               <p>Q. Having missed them on the 8th of December, where did you see them again? - I see them on the 8th of December, in the evening, in the passage of Mr. Barlow's house, a little way from the door, the outside of the door about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition were they? - Loose laying on the ground, I took them up, brought them into the shop, and the man was brought in after them, the prisoner at the bar, from thence he was taken to the magistrate's.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took him to the magistrate's? - The watchman and another or two took him to the magistrate's, I did not go with him, I followed him, and from thence he was committed. I was examined before the magistrate, and swore to the property being Mr. Barlow's, and after that Mr. Barlow was bound over to prosecute, and I to appear to swear to the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen any thing of the prisoner before the goods were missing? - I had not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. At the time you received this alarm, I believe neither you, your master, or any body was attending in the shop, you had left it to take care of itself? - Not in that shop, a glass partition was between the two shops.</p>
               <p>Q. I see they are the ordinary sort of goods? - They are.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you charge the selling price on them, you have put them at three pounds in the indictment, but, perhaps, you would not put them at above thirty-nine shillings, where a man's life is at stake? - They would fell for a deal more.</p>

               <p>I am in no business. I live at Deptford. On Monday the 8th of December, between the hours of five and six in the evening, I was going up the stairs of the two shillings gallery of the <placeName id="t17950114-4-crimeloc21">playhouse in Covent-garden</placeName>

I had my hand in the pocket where the money was, the left hand pocket. I said, you have no occasion to crowd so very much, it is time enough.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call making an attempt? - They tussled me and crowded me against the side of the stairs. The second time this Randal Smith he got one arm under my arm, lifted my arm up, and with the other hand he got the canvas bag out of my pocket; I am sure it was the prisoner. I collared him directly and I said, now I will hold you, and I held him till two men came and rescued him from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a good light? - Yes, and I held him two minutes, till somebody came and rescued him from me out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it is the same? - I am. As soon as they took him out of my hands he ran down stairs, and I hallooed out stop thief, and a serjeant of the guards stopped him till I got down stairs.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I was up stairs on the right hand side, and he charged me with picking his pocket on the left hand side.</p>

               <p>I am a serjeant of the Coldstream regiment of guards. I was at the playhouse this evening, on Monday the 8th of December, I was serjeant of the guard; I was walking in the passage of the two shilling gallery, and I heard the hue and cry of stop thief, repeatedly; and I stood at the bottom of the stairs, thinking the first person that came down would be the aggressor, and the prisoner came down first, and as he came down he jumped off several stairs at once, running as hard as possible, and I catched hold of him; there were several after him. When I seized him by the collar he was very strong, and he struggled with me, and desired me not to keep him; for he asked me if he looked like a thief or pick-pocket? I told him I would detain him till such time as the person came down who had lost the property.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it in any thing? - In a canvas bag. My pocket was hauled out.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he in the same room with you? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell us what you know respecting any tea? - On Thursday morning last we all came together to work as usual; I suppose there may be eight in number. We worked on till breakfast time together, after breakfast the commodore acquainted us that we were to go round to a different part of the building to bring down goods. He ordered

             and his partner to go to that part of the building to take some goods down from the pile of chests where they were piled up. He ordered me and my partner to stay behind to take them off the truck as they were brought round to us. They went round and could not get through, the doors were not unlocked, and so Thomas Yeaman and his partner staid behind till the doors were unlocked, and he came back to the room where we had been at work the former part of the morning. I was on the move to keep my feet warm, while the doors were being unlocked; presently I heard a rustling of paper or flags, that the tea is covered with.</p>
               <p>Q. The chest is made of boards? - Yes, but this chest was open.</p>
               <p>Q. And the tea is inclosed within side of the flags or paper? - Yes. I approached nearer to the found, and I suspected where it came from; instantly I heard

             come towards me from the spot where I had heard the found.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between him and you? - No, he walked on to the farther part of the room, and quitted the room. I instantly went to the place where I suspected the noise to have been, whereas I found some of the tea was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140012"/>spilled on the floor by the chest, at the end of the chest. This chest I had been mending the fore part of the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner? - In putting a piece in at the end to prevent the tea tumbling out.</p>
               <p>Q. You nailed it I suppose? - No, we put in the piece and then it was referred, we cut the dove tails and pushed it in.</p>
               <p>Q. In putting in this piece at the side, do you recollect whether any tea was spilled at that time? - No, it was not, because I had heaped the tea on a heap, at the farther end, and pressed it down with my arm, and no tea could fall out. After the prisoner quitted the room I went and examined, and found the tea spilled on the floor; I examined my partner whether he had spilled any of the tea or no, and I pulled the paper off the chest of tea, and I found a hole in the tea different to what I left it.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you discover from the appearance how much was gone out? - I did imagine in myself, as I told the commodore, there must be about a pound gone out. I communicated this to the commodore, and I reported it to the elder, and the elder ordered me to retire back to my work, at his request I did, and he went and got the King's locker.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect being sent for when the prisoner was taken up? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. How long have you worked with the prisoner? - At different times for near a twelve month.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe there are sometimes little differences amongst the men working there? - That I cannot say about, there was no difference between him and me.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner has some enemies, has he not? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. You and he were working together in this large warehouse, what size is the warehouse? - A very large piece of building.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard some noise like the rustling of the paper, or the rustling of leaves, and the prisoner was in that part where you heard the noise? - He was in that room.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the size of that room? - Between fifty or sixty feet square.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know that he was in that part of the room where the rustling was? - He was in that room.</p>
               <p>Q. The chest in which this tea was contained, was a chest out of repair? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Consequently with any body's touching it, or shaking it, some tea would fall out? - It would not.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been mending that chest, there was a piece out, you had not nailed it? - No, but it could not tumble out.</p>
               <p>Q. Any little motion must naturally shake out some tea? - There was no motion could be made.</p>
               <p>Q. If any accident had happened by shaking that chest, or any one in contact with it, some of the tea might have fell out, would it not? - It might if the chest had been moved.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. In point of fact, was there any tea spilled out of this chest? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left it could any tea fall out? - In the state I left it I cannot imagine that there was any tea could fall out.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you take him into custody? - I went with the constable; I was the person that searched him, and found the tea on him.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you take him? - I took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140013"/>him in the third building, in that part of the warehouse in Middlesex.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find on him? - Thirteen ounces of tea in his right hand pocket, loose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing at that time? - At that time he said that some malicious person had done it, and when he came down to the counting house, he said to the elder that he had a large family.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You attending this warehouse, perhaps you know whether it is not their custom to hang their coats up while they are at work? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't happen know of your own knowledge whether he had hanged up his coat that morning? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. If any man had the misfortune to have a malicious enemy in that warehouse, it was in the power of that enemy to put tea in his pocket? - Yes, that I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. And when he was taken up he said some malicious person had done it? - He did.</p>
               <p>- LANCASTER sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation are you in this warehouse? - I am one of the elders.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of some information you had given you, the prisoner at the bar was apprehended? - He was brought into the counting house where I was, and I saw the tea took out of his right hand coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this? - About eleven o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What tea was it? - Souchong tea.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say it was the company's property or not? - I can swear it is like the souchong tea that was preparing for sale.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. When this was found in his pocket, he said some malicious person had done this trick? - No, he said before the Lord Mayor that he had no defence to make, but he must throw himself on his mercy.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say at the time the tea was found in his pocket? - He did not make any defence at all, and when the warehouse keeper came he had no defence to make, but begged we would consider his family.</p>
               <p>Q.Was you in the room when he said some malicious person had done this? - That he said the second hearing before the Lord Mayor.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you not present when he said this to Mr. Boon? - No, I did not hear it then.</p>
               <p>Q. to Boon. Where was it the prisoner said that some malicious person had put it in his pocket? - In the third story; Mr. Lancaster was not there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney to Venning. Where was the warehouse situated, in the city of London or county of Middlesex? - I believe in the county of Middlesex.</p>
               <p>Lancaster. I know it is in the county of Middlesex.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses who gave him an excellent character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is a cruel and unjust prosecution. In the chests there are no mats put in. I had been labouring in that room but it was two hours before that they found the tea on me; it was in an old coat that I work with in the warehouse, not the coat that I come out with, and I had an opportunity of putting it from me, two or three hours, if I had known it. I knew nothing about it; I believe there is a guinea reward in this case, and some person wanting to supersede me in this warehouse.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she work with you? - Sometimes she did and sometimes she did not, she goes from one mistress to another when she pleases.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say about the cloth cloak? - This is it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in your house or in your employment at the time you lost it? - She came into the house and asked me for a little work, the 2d of January, which was last Friday was a week, and she took my cloak away.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the cloak? - It was on a table just by the door. I happened to want to go to the warehouse and looked for the cloak, and instantly missed it. I was going to the warehouse that minute, to Mr. Darby's, in Gracechurch-street; I missed the cloak as soon as she was gone out of the room. I went after her instantly and catched her with it in her apron; I pulled her apron on one side and see my cloak, and I said, what a wicked hussey you are to take my cloak when you know how hard I work for my living, and she said it was none of my cloak, she had borrowed it. She knows it is my cloak very well, and I know it very well; the lining is tore.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She agreed to make it up with the officer for two shillings.</p>

               <p>Prosecutrix. I told her I would not hurt her if I could any way help it; if I could any way get her off when I went before the justice, I would; and when I went before the justice I said, as long as I have got my cloak again, if you think proper, she may go about her business.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I borrowed the cloak of Mrs. Nash.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It is not true, indeed it is not.</p>

And do you take in women in this way? - She said, the first time she came that she could get a character from Guildhall, and she went, and she came back and said the person was not at home, and so I let it alone from day to day, and did not mind it afterwards, and she destroyed the things.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had you left the shop before they were taken? - About half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you alarmed with any noise? - Very great noise; the windows were broke, I took the candle and went into the shop.</p>

That night I looked and I missed nothing but the guts of an old watch. As I was at work on Saturday I missed one of the watches; I happened to think of it, I recollected that I hung up such a watch in the window, on Thursday, and I never saw it when I took them down at night, and after that I missed another on Saturday, and the third I missed on Monday.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect how long ago? - I have been in prison three weeks. About a month ago.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you an accomplice? Did you go with him? - Yes. He came down to my house on Saturday night for his shirt; my wife used to wash for him, he came for his shirt to put on a Sunday, he had a watch in his pocket. I said to him, you have a watch in your pocket; he said he had, he could fell me one, with that I asked him to let me look at it; in consequence of which he brought down to me on the Sunday following a green shagreen case watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know it again if you was to see it? - I did not take any particular notice. (Shewn the shagreen case watch.) This is very much like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe it to be like it? - Yes, I do. After he brought it down on Sunday. I did not like it, with that he made answer and said, I have got another, with that he fetched the other down, which I looked at; I made answer and said, sure enough, you have not stole them? you could not come by them honestly. Honestly, says he, what do you mean by that? I should not have thought of that; with that he left them at my house on Sunday for me to take my choice, if I was a mind to have them; they were there on Sunday, and on Monday night when I told him I would not have any thing to do with them, I was afraid he did not come honestly by them. On Tuesday I told him to come down and take them away, they should not be there; with that he came down and seemed very uneasy, with that he takes them and says, I will go and hide them; with that I walks along with him down to the barn, about a quarter of a mile from town, which he went in and asked me to lend him my bavonet, which he took from my scabbard, and scrapes a hole and buried them, and says, they would not be found there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the road to Cowley? was it in that part particular? - Yes, it was on the left hand side.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in West's barn? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know it by that name? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from town? - About a quarter of a mile, it may be a little more, I cannot say for that. After he had buried them he begged I would not say any thing about them. He then told me he had stole them from a watch maker's in town; that he walked backwards and forwards twenty times before he could find an opportunity, and that when he found an opportunity he broke the glass with a stick, and took out the watches, and I told the serjeant of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell the serjeant? - Because I thought it was more prudent to let the serjeant know of it, because I was afraid I should get into the wrong of it.</p>
               <p>Q.You told the serjeant of your own accord? - Yes.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140019"/>Q. What did you do in consequence of any information? - On the 17th I see Love, I told him I thought he was guilty respecting the watches.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body say it would be better for him to confess, or that it would be worse for him if he did not? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say? - He said he stole the watches out of the window behind the King's arms, on Thursday night before that, which was the 11th of that month. I asked him how he broke the window? he told me with a stick, and he took the watches out, that is all I know about it.</p>

On the 10th day of November last I was very ill and a-bed, and between the hours of four and five in the evening there came Martha Peelthorpe to my door and knocked, and I refused letting her in several times, and all that I could get from her was, open the door, it is a friend! I refused four, five or six times for what I know. At last I knew her voice, and ill as I was, I got out of bed and opened the door. It is a spring lock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before? - Yes, she used to <rs id="t17950114-10-deflabel55" type="occupation">work in the slop way</rs>

               <p>Q. How long have you known her? - About seven or eight months, I believe. I opened the door and she came in, and she asked me how I was? I told her I was very ill, and she sat down by the bed side and asked me if I would have any thing to drink? I told her if I had any thing to drink, it must be a drap of gin, and she took the bottle and went and fetched a quartern of gin.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that your usual remedy when you are ill? - When it came I could not drink it. I desired her to mix it among some mint and balm tea that was in a bason, and she mixed it, and seemed to lament over me that I was ill. I have no wife nor child; I have a single room, and have lived this forty years under the roof. Afterwards she withdrawed from the bedside and went to the fireside; she sat on the bed, when she was on the bed then she drank with me, and she withdrawed to the fireside where the watch hung underneath the mantle-piece.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140020"/>Q. When had you seen it last? - I wound it up at half past three in the afternoon. I did not miss it till I was called at eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q.Had any body been in the room between the time but her? - No living creature. When she had got the watch, I fancy she was so frustrated that she did not know what to do with it. At eight o'clock a little girl came and knocked at my door, and called me by my name, and told me the time of the night, and when she had so done I arose and got some part of my things on, and then I applied for a light.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought you the light? - I got it myself with the tinder box, as I usually did, and I took the light to see what o'clock it was and missed the watch, and it so surprised me that you might have knocked me down with a feather, and I put the remainder of my things on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of the number or maker's name? - No, I did not. I put on the rest of my clothes and went after the prisoner; I followed her to her lodgings, and she had absconded from thence by robbing the servant girl of a box of clothes. She had been gone a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do next? - I went to my duty.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have known this man some time, ask him if he did not strike a light and light me down stairs himself.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That was at eight o'clock when I struck a light.</p>
               <p>Court. She was with you before eight o'clock? - Yes, but she did not stay with me above twenty minutes, or half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q.How long had she been gone when you struck a light? - Three hours at least.</p>

               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. When had you gone to bed and locked your door? - Just at four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When did this woman come to your door? - A little before five. It is a spring lock; nobody could come in, and there was no key hole to the door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have known this man some time, and I used to cohabit with him, and he used to come backward and forward to my lodgings, and he wanted me to come and live entirely with him. I met him one day in Whitechapel, and he desired I would call on him, and this day I had been at Whitechapel-road and I called on him, and he asked if it was me? and I said, it was Mrs. Peelthorpe. He said he was very glad I come as he wanted some gin; I went for some for him, and he desired I would come and lay down in the bed; I told him I could not stay; I fat with him and then went about my business; he said if I would come back again he would light a fire, and he got up and struck a light to light a fire, and lighted me down stairs, and told me to go over to the public house to get something and he would come over to me.</p>
               <p>Court to Simkins. How old are you? - If I live till next April I am seventy years old.</p>
               <p>Jury. How do you get into your room when you are out? - I have two locks on the door besides that spring lock; a padlock and a wooden lock, and I put the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140021"/>spring lock back when I go out.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to Worship-street. On Monday the 29th of December I was standing at the office door, a gentleman came up to me and says, there is something going wrong in that waggon, which then was past our office almost.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was driving the waggon? - The waggon was then stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the care of the waggon? - Both the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe? - I saw Watkins take a sack of coals out of the waggon by the assistance of Russell, I see Watkins take them into Brockwell's house; I followed him in, and instantly I got in there was a little closet that was behind the door on the right hand, in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140022"/>stantly he got in he shot them into that closet, I laid hold of him and I said, I think you are doing that that is not right; he makes answer and says, I know nothing at all about it, Russell is my employer; I am ordered to do what I do by Russell. I took him into custody; I apprehended Watkins first. I sent over for one of the other officers to take him into custody, and went then with Russell to the place where the coals were going to be delivered at Hoxton. Watkins delivered me the ticket of the coals, I asked him for it, and he very readily gave it me out of his pocket; I saw that they should be thirty-five sacks to be delivered to the place where they were going to, and when I got there I was particular in seeing to the number of sacks taken out of the waggon, and when done so, there were thirty-four sacks in the waggon that was taken out of the waggon, I am positive of it, and as such, then finding it was wrong, I took him into custody, and brought him to the office, then being with his waggon and horses I then proceeded over to his master at Bank-side with him, and see him deliver his horses and waggon safe, and then I took him into custody and brought him back again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Well, Mr. Officer, this was in the day time, was it not? - No, it was not, it was between six and seven in the evening; it was quite dusk, I will not be particular to the hour.</p>
               <p>Q. In what place was this? - In Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Q. That is pretty near in the way to Hoxton? - Oh, it is certainly.</p>

               <p>I keep a chandler's shop, and am in the coal trade, in Gloucester-street, Hoxton. I was to have thirty-five sacks of Mr. Bee, delivered. I was the person that bought the coals, and there were only thirty-four delivered.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp to Bee. These coals that you have described, you have seen, I take it for granted? - I see them when they went away from the wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had seen them afterwards, would you have taken upon yourself to swear to them? - Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't mean to swear that they are your property? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them put into the cart? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how they were fastened? - With a tail rope quite fast.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Russell. I did not load my waggon with the coals, neither did I tie it in. I offered to pay for the coals when the tail rope broke off my waggon.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Watkins called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

Presently after I had picked up the first pair, I was sent of an errand, and in passing by I see something lay white against the wall, and I went up and found it was another pair of breeches in the same alley.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with these two pair of breeches? - I brought them home, I gave them to my grandmamma.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the man, did you see him stopped in the street? - He kept running on, one Mr. Merchant ran after him, and followed him, and I went home with the breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. During all the time that this man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140024"/>run, did you lose fight of him till Mr. Merchant followed him? - Yes, just when he turned the corner of the gateway, I did not see him till I got to the bottom of the alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the man; did you see his face at any time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you prefectly sure that is the man that had the breeches on him? - Yes, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see him after he was taken; after you see him with the breeches? - About ten minutes; but first I was sent into Grub-street, before I see him at my grandmother's house he was at a shoemaker's shop in Grub-street, he went in to cheapen some shoes.</p>
               <p>- MERCHANT sworn.</p>
               <p>I fell coals just by Mrs. Ballard's. I was standing at my own door that night, and heard this little boy crying stop thief; this prisoner was running along the middle of the road, I followed him along Whitecross-street, till he turned up Chifwell-street, and then he walked leisurely, and I walked after him, he ran but a very little way; he turned down Grub-street, and I followed him about a quarter the length of the street, some way down, and he crossed over, and he went to look in at a window where they sell shoes, and he went in there and began to cheapen some shoes, and I went to Mr. Davis, a constable, and acquainted him that he had certainly done something that he should not do at Mrs. Ballard's, because they cried out stop thief; but he said I must go and fetch the prosecutrix, and I went and fetched them, and this little boy, and he said he was the man. I left him in the shop while I went to the constable; all I know is, that he was the person that ran up the road at the cry of stop thief.</p>
               <p>- DAVIS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable. I produce two pair of breeches, I got them from the prosecutrix before the justice; I had got the charge of the prisoner, I have had them ever since. (Produced.)</p>
               <p>Q.to Bird. Are these the two pair of breeches that you carried home and gave to your grandmother? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they of that colour? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in a part of the alley where the prisoner had been? - Yes, where he stood.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. They are my breeches, I missed them from the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they on the counter when the prisoner was there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Were they the very breeches he cheapened? - Yes, the same.</p>
               <p>Q.How many might be on the counter more than these two pair? - There were four or five pair.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going up to my sister's, through Whitecross-street, to let them know my wife was very bad in bed; with that there I was coming along Whitecross-street, and there came a man just as I got about the middle of the way, running along, and had liked to have pushed me into the kennel, with that I steps out into the highway, and walks on (my sister lives in Grub-street, up a turning) and I went to Grub-street, and this man came and followed me into a shop, where I was cheapening a pair of shoes; he came in with a woman and this lad, and she said, it was a lustier man than I; and the constable says, please you, will you go with me to the shop? says I, where is it; says he, in Whitecross-street; says I, I will with all my heart. The young body would have let me gone about my business, though I was willing to go back to the shop; I have gentlemen to prove my character, that I never was before a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140025"/>justice in my life, nor ever wronged any body of a farthing. The man came running against me and pushed me down almost, and I went out into the highway.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses to his character, who said he was brought up a weaver.</p>

               <p>Q.Then we must not hear of any confession, after that, did you find any thing in the room? - She delivered up three hat pins in consequence of my interrogating her to acknowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. So that night if she had staid away you would not have prosecuted her? - It was not my business to do it.</p>

               <p>Q. You attend the shop? - I do. On the 17th of December, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I had some business to go into the shop, and I saw the prisoner at the drawer where the gold feals come out of.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that drawer kept under lock and key? - It was not locked, it was behind the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner was she at the drawer? - I saw it open with her hand in the drawer; I said nothing to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any suspicion at the time? - I really had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not occur to you an odd thing that a domestic servant should be at that drawer? - I told my master, James Norton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him of it the same day? - No, I don't know whether it was the same day, or perhaps a day or two after; I do not recollect. When I went into the shop she seemed to be rather surprised, and she shut the drawer in a hurry, and the words she said are these, Tommy, where are the candles? She spoke to a son of Mr. Thornhill's, that was in the counting house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. So that at the time this past there was a young man entrusted with the care of the shop, in the shop as well as you? - Yes, in the counting house.</p>
               <p>Q. So you could not have any suspicion because you found there a person whose interest it was to watch her? Where was this drawer? - In the shew glass, in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this young man? - In the counting house.</p>

               <p>I was the officer that was sent for. I produce three pins and a silver patch box, I believe they call it; I received them of Mrs. Norton. The Lord Mayor's clerk gave them to Mrs. Norton afterwards, and I called upon Mrs. Norton to day to get the things to go before the grand jury. I believe they are the same things.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker. I produce a pair of buckles, two cornelian seals, set in gold, I believe they are. I bought them, of whom I don't know, it was a woman.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it? - On the 17th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept them ever since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Norton deposed to the pins being his property, by his mark being on them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Mr. Norton. I observe the marks that are on them would of course accompany them to any body to whom they might have been sold? - No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. That only enables you to say that they were once your's? - Certainly.</p>

Though you are inclined to think that they were not sold, yet you cannot venture to swear that they had not gone out of your shop by sale? - I don't chuse to do it. With respect to any promise that has been made, I know nothing about it; I come forward, only as a citizen, to do my duty.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Thornhill. I think you said nothing about the box in your evidence before; did you receive the box from the prisoner? - I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Norton. The box is mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You don't carry your evidence further to the box than you do to the pins, though you believe it has not been sold, yet you cannot venture to swear that it has not? - Certainly not.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. That piece is my property, I know it from a seal that it has, and the character of the cost price.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who said, his father was a coach-maker, he had been to sea, and was now with his father, and they knew nothing but honestly by him.</p>

               <p>I am constable and patrol of Dowgate ward. On the 24th of December, a little before six o'clock at night, I was in Thames-street, I saw the prisoner at the bar with this package on his shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. Has that been in your custody ever since? - It has; it is in exact the same<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140031"/>state as when I took it from him. I see him go along Thames-street, there was another man along with him in company, they walked on by the side of each other, I stepped to him, says I, my friend, what have you got here? says he, what do you want to know for? or, what is that to you? I said, I should be glad to know what is was; he said, he believed it was grocery. Says I, you must know what it is; says he, it is grocery, I tell you; says I, where are you going with it? says he, to the Borough. I asked him where he had brought it from? he hesitated a good deal on that: the other man that was in company said to me, what have you got to do with the man? it is my property? says I, pray where had you it from, young man? says the prisoner at the bar, it is not his property, it is mine; I said it was very strange that one should say it was his property, and the other should say it was his property; says I, I insist upon knowing where you brought it from; he said, he brought it from a grocer's in Newgate-street, opposite St. Martin's-le-grand, I cannot recollect the name he mentioned, I told him I was not satisfied, I should be glad if he would go back with me to his master's, where he said he had it from. I then took him to our watch-house, now says I, you shall go with me to your master's in Newgate-street; he said it was no use going there, for he found it in Cheapside; I told him it did not appear that if it had been dropped in the street, as the bag was quite clean and it was a dirty night; then he said he saw it pitched up against a door way, and he took it up; he thought he had as much right to it as another.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure he used the word pitched? - He said it stuck up against the door.</p>
               <p>Q.Can you say whether he used the word pitched or stuck up? - I cannot possibly recollect, he said it was at a door; I then told him I should detain the goods and take him to the compter. I left the goods at the watch-house, and a young man in care of the goods, while I went to the compter, with other assistance, as there were some men came to the watch-house and said they knew something of him; one man that came back to the watch-house was the man that was with him, that said it was his property first, and afterwards denied it; and so I left a young man with the property, left they should take it away while I was gone. When I came back the young man said, I have found a bill of parcels and permit at the top of of the bag, which led to a discovery of the master it belonged to. I knew nothing of that till I came back from the compter. I then went to Mr. Bateman, and informed him of the matter; Mr. Bateman saw the goods the day after Christmas Day, before the Lord Mayor, Mr. Bateman's man saw the goods the same night he lost them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Christmas Eve I was going to see a friend over in the Borough, I was asked to come over and sup with them; I was coming through Bow church-yard, there was another strange young man coming along; I see something laying against the church wall, and he and I goes and looks at it, it was a parcel just by the pump; so says I, here is a parcel here, and he took it up on his back, and carried it a considerable way past Garlick-hill, when I took and carried it till that gentleman stopped me with it. I knew nothing of it till I see it lay up against the church wall in Bow church-yard; that is all I know of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of a funnel? - Yes, the funnell was put into my care, Mr. Bramwell found the funnel on her.</p>
               <p>Q. To Bramwell. What was the reason for sending for the constable? - Because I detected the funnel on her. I <rs id="t17950114-18-viclabel109" type="occupation">keep a public house</rs>

               <p>Q. Had she been employed about your house? - Occasionally, to go of an errand or so, for these six or seven years past; there was a black man that used to black shoes at the door, and she passed for his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. What led you to suspect any thing? - I see the funnel under her cloak as she was going out of my house, I was just coming to the door as she got out; I see a large bulge, and I suspected, and I lifted up her cloak, and found the funnel just under her cloak; I know it by its general appearance, I have had it about five or six or seven years; as to the pot I know it to be mine, because it has my name on it.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the effects last, before they were missing? - My wife was saying before this woman, that she had lost a dozen pots this week, and this woman made a reply, and said, I wish their hands might drop off who took them.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen this pot before? - I cannot say, they are in general use about the house.</p>

               <p>Q.When had you seen that watch before it was missing? - I see the watch on Christmas Day, about four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss it? - About four minutes after.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to miss it? - The prisoner came into my house on Sunday, and he was there then, and he says, give me a dinner as it was Christmas Day; and I told him I was in distress enough, I could not think of any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q.Was he a perfect stranger to you? - I never saw him before Sunday. He said it was a common rule to give a dinner on Christmas Day; I told him I had it not for myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this? - Four o'clock. He then said he would go and treat me with something to drink; I told him I would not taste any thing, if he brought it I would neither drink it nor touch it; I beseeched him to go out of my house and I would forgive him the four days he owed me.</p>
               <p>Q.Then he had been with you before? - Yes, as a lodger from the Sunday before Christmas Day.</p>
               <p>Q. You missed the watch then? - No, not directly. My husband is in a club, and the steward of the club came in at the providential hour that this man came, and the steward stood leaning with his stick at the foot of the bed, and an old gentlewoman, an old acquaintance of mine, stood at the side of the bed, and I saw the steward to the door, and I said to this old acquaintance of mine, pray come and sit down and warm yourself, and sitting down I found the loss of the noise of the watch, I jumped up, and it was only four minutes after four by the clock.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did the watch usually hang? - By the fire place, by the side of the chimney.</p>
               <p>Q. If I understand you right, the steward of the club on this Christmas Day came to your husband's room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.He was then ill in bed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the prisoner in the room at that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If I take you right, you was discoursing with the steward of the club? - Both the steward and myself were discoursing with my husband.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you miss the watch after this conversation? - I see Mr. Lister and the steward both go out together to the door; Mr. Lister told me if I did not chuse to give him a dinner, he would fetch me a pint of brandy, or any thing else I chose. I told him I would not drink with him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss the watch? - Presently on shutting the door after the steward and this man likewife, I fat down, a gentlewoman, an intimate acquaintance of mine was by the bed side with my husband, and I said, Mrs. Poplar, sit down by me, and I missed the found of the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell what fort of a watch this is? - It is a metal watch, tortoiseshell outside; only the day before I bought a key to regulate the watch, like a bellows, with my own hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hang that key to the watch? - Yes, with my own hands.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see it again? - I see it again in about an hour afterwards, at Mr. Chambers's, in Glass-house-fields, the Nag's-head. I employed four men to go different ways, and myself went to all the pawnbrokers to stop it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Chambers a pawnbroker? - No, he is a publican. After I missed the watch, I went to a public house I commonly use, I went and told them that the boatswain, (not knowing his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140036"/>name till I saw him before the justice) had taken my husband's watch, and they all said they would do me the biggest service they could, and through their going out every way to make this description, there was a young fellow that was his bed fellow some time past, and he came into the public house where I use, and he said, I will tell you where the watch and man is, and these men that I employed ran and found the man and the property.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you go yourself to the house? - I did, and they enquired of me what the watch was like; the man was in possession then. I would not wish to prosecute him if I possibly could help it.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Mr. Chambers's? - Yes, but I did not see the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the watch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the watch here? - I dare say Mr. Chambers has got it.</p>
               <p>- CHAMBERS sworn.</p>
               <p>This prisoner came to my house on Christmas Eve about five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q.You keep a public house, do you? - Yes, he called for a couple of pennyworth of bread and cheese, and a pint of purl, which I served him; after sitting a bit I asked him for the money, and he could not find any. He said he had been receiving some pension money and bought a watch that cost him four guineas, and he asked me if I would buy it? I told him I would have nothing to do with it; he asked me two guineas and a half for it, a little while after he said I should have it for a guinea, I would not have it then. There was a young man in the house, and he asked him if he would go and pawn it for him, he would give him a shilling. I told him he should not go out of the house till I was paid the reckoning; says he, if you will give me half a guinea on the watch, I will call in the morning, I told him I would not have any thing to do with it, I told him I thought he had stole it; he told me he had not, he was a very honest man, he had bought it. There was a young fellow that came in that knew where he lodged, and I said to him, I wish you would take a step to see whether he has not stole that watch from his lodgings or not, and the young man came back and said he had stole this watch; there were three of the neighbours came down after the young fellow, and the young fellow called me on one side and told me he had stole the watch from his lodgings. As soon as ever these people came I went and accused him of it; and this young fellow says, you have stole your watch from your lodgings, and he owned directly that he had, and he pulled it out of his pocket and gave it to me; then when I got the watch, I asked the people if they knew the marks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Ross come down with them? - She came down afterwards; I asked her what sort of a watch it was? and she described it very exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got it here? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a key to it? - Yes, just as it is now, two keys and a seal.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Ross. Did you use to wear it, or your husband? - I used to wear it some years ago, but my husband has wore it of late. I know it perfectly and there are the keys, one I bought the day before of a person that is since dead.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have no occasion to say much, I took the watch in my drunkenness, and I put it in my pocket the same as if it belonged to me; I kept the chain out and went into the public house. It is the first thing I have done since I was born, I always got my living without<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140037"/>thievery or drunkenness. I said to the landlord, here take care of this watch, and give it the mistress.</p>

I said, I was going to take it no where, but if it was his, why did not he take it out of the path way?

               <p>Q. Did you leave the things there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened then? - It staid there a while, I sat a while in the window, I don't know how long. While I was drinking my beer I thought I could perceive it was moved about two or three inches nearer the other end of the block, which made me to take more particular notice of it; I think in about five minutes after I see it going off, I ran out and found it on the prisoner's back.</p>
               <p>Q. Quite taken from the window? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In what street was the prisoner? - It is Butcher-row, Wych-street is the name of the street I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was it from the house when you found it on his back? - To the best of my knowledge, about thirty yards. I seized him and asked him what he was doing with my goods? I cannot justly say what he said then, but he said soon after that a man gave him sixpence to carry it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop him? - Yes, and brought him back to the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the goods, or what did he do with the goods? - To the best of my knowledge he carried them back, but I cannot really say whether he did or not, but I think he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send for a constable, or what did you do? - I believe somebody went for a constable, I did not go myself. I went with him to Bow-street, and took the goods to Bow-street; I did not go to my master at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had the goods ever since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you brought them here? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have kept them separate from other goods? - Yes. (Produced.)</p>
               <p>Kenworthy. I know them by the number and mark.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have got a wife and three children, and work hard for them every day, and go out every morning to get a shilling if I can; I went out that day to the Bank-side and earned a shilling, and out of the shilling I spent sixpence, and I went home and gave my wife the sixpence; I asked her if she had got any thing for supper, she said she had not, I said I would go out and get her something; going down to Butcher-row, I stood to make water just at the Magpie stand, and I see a man who said, coalheaver, if you will carry this load for me I will give you sixpence; says I, I will. Says he, take and carry it up for me to Boswell-court, and I took it on my back, and he went on and I followed him up Newcastle-court, when I got about two yards up the court from the stone steps this man followed me and said, what have you got here? I said, what is that to you? he said, why it is my property; says I, then God bless my heart, I will carry it back again, and I did carry it back to the Magpie. I have been in prison ever since, and what my family have done for victuals and drink I don't know; I am a man well known.</p>
               <p>Court to Marland, Did you see any body in his company? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called seven witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

On the 12th of December, about four o'clock in the afternoon as near as I can guess, I was called into my shop to serve half a pound of lump sugar, I perceived a strange young man about five yards from the shop making water, seemingly a stranger; I watched and see he went about ten yards up the lane, and passed the trap door of the cellar, and looked into the house, and he went about thirty yards farther, and my eye watching that man round, I saw the prisoner at the bar in the garden, unpegging the linen from the line; when he got them off the line he threw the pegs on the ground, and put the linen over the sence on some planks, and jumped over the sence, and I ran up close to him, and asked him what he did with that linen?</p>
               <p>Q. Did he jump into the same place where he put the linen? - One hand was on the linen when I came up to him. When I came up to him I said, what do you do with that linen? says he, they are not your's; says I, are they your's? yes, says he; no, says I, they are not, they belong to the landlord, Mr. Pruden, with that he attempted to knock me down; says I, don't strike, but go up with me to the landlord's, and he went with me to the door, and I called out, Pruden, here is a man that has stole your linen; and he ran up a lane about half a mile long, but Mr. Pruden ran out and took him before he was out of my sight. I am certain of the man because he has lost his left eye.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. At the justice's you said there were three handkercheifs, and afterwards you said they were not hung out, and afterwards the magistrate scratched it out, he cannot deny it.</p>
               <p>Finch. There was a cloth put at the bottom of the basket that the things were put in, and that was put down at first, and we told the magistrate the next morning that that was not stole, and it was struck out. I put my mark on the linen, and I have never seen them since till now; they are the same, there is my mark on them, three black stitches that I put in every one.</p>

               <p>Q. Why do you believe that they belonged to you? - Because they are very much like the oats that I have; I have a great many sacks about my yard that are stray sacks.</p>

On the 21st of last November, I was robbed, Sunday morning, about half an hour after five; the gown was behind my bed under my head, the rest were in a bundle by my bedside, I was in bed at the time at my own lodgings; the prisoner was a lodger in the same room, she awaked me taking the gown from underneath the head of my bed; she slept in another bed in the same room, it was before daylight, about half after five; she awaked me, and I missed my things, all my things. I said, Oh, dear! Oh, dear! I have lost all my things; she made answer, I will get up and get you a light; she went down stairs to get me a light but never returned.</p>

               <p>Q. If it was so dark, how could you make your discovery that your things were gone? - My gown was under the head of my bed, and she awaked me in pulling it from under me, and I felt about immediately and missed my other things, they were altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see her after? - I see no more of her till I met her by chance in the street, three weeks after, and she had the gown on, and I stopped her and asked her how she could be so cruel to rob me of all my things? she said I was deceived in the person; I said, no, I am not, you know you have got my gown on now, and she made a laugh and ran away, and I catched hold of her and called the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop her at that time? - I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140043"/>Q. With the assistance of the watchman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen any of your things any where? - I went to the pawnbroker's and redeemed my apron myself, at my own expence, for I had not one to wear.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the pawnbroker here? - No. I told him my situation, and he told me I should not have them without I paid for them; the apron and handkerchief were pledged together for one shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. There is nobody here from the pawnbroker at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the only thing that you recovered? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She told me at Marlborough-street if I would give her the things again she would forgive me; she is nothing but a girl of the town, has never done a stroke of upholstery for this twelve months.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I said if you will return me my things, I don't want to prosecute you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I borrowed this woman's things to go as far as Hounslow in; there were three more beds in the room besides the bed where I slept in.</p>

               <p>Q. Who did you borrow them of? - Of Ann Edwards.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. Did you ever lend her the things? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you get your livelihood by working at upholstery? - I do, and when I do not work at the upholstery I work at the army work.</p>
               <p>Q. You see the situation of this woman is a very critical one, I hope you are swearing that that is true. Had you any quarrel with this woman? - I have had no quarrel with her, she lived there a very little time.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the story you have told here true? - It is.</p>
               <p>Jury. What induced the pawnbroker to give you the things? where had you the ticket from? - The prisoner gave me the ticket, and I got my apron out with it.</p>
               <p>Q. What upholsterers do you work for? - Mr. Morris, in St. Martin's-lane.</p>
               <p>Court. What time was it she gave you the ticket? - At the justice's, for the apron and handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the ticket for the apron and handkerchief in one ticket? - Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My friends are all in the country, and I only came to London quite big with child.</p>

            , who asked me if I would go home with her?</p>
               <p>Q. Was you drunk or sober? - I was not sober, otherwise; I should not have done as I did. She asked me if I would go to sleep with her, (this was near the corner of Field-lane, in Saffron-hill,) I consented, she took me to the house of the other prisoner, Mary Maccleugh, I believe, I cannot swear to her name; she is the housekeeper, I believe. I then went into a bed the woman shewed us, in about an hour I felt my breeches,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140044"/>(which I put under my head) being moved, I was heavy to sleep, but this disturbed me.

             immediately ran down stairs, I immedaitely searched the pockets of my breeches, and I found a deficiency of ten guineas, half a crown, and four shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last observed this money to be in your pocket in this house? - When I put my hand into my pocket to pay for the bed and give the girl her compliment.</p>

               <p>Q. You had paid that? - I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it loose in your pocket, or in any sort of bag or purse? - It was not in a bag; all loose, the gold and silver together.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you by trade? - I am an officer of the excise.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do on this? - I immediately called out, the woman of the house immediately came up and asked me what was the matter? I told her I was robbed of ten guineas and some silver, that I considered her as a party concerned and would call the watch to my assistance; she told me that the girl had gone without her knowledge, and left the street door open; I still insisted on calling the watch, and called repeatedly for some time; she would advise me, she said, to go to bed and sleep till morning, and she would find the girl. I told her, I thought by going to bed I might lose my life as well as my money, and therefore I must insist on having her secured; I went down stairs and still called the watch, at last, after I had been down stairs some time, Mary Maccleugh took up the candlestick from the table, and said, is this your money? There were three guineas and two shillings on the table. I said, that is part of my money; there was one bent guinea, the same as I had had in my pocket; she then said that the girl had robbed me, but she should give me my money again, the girl then came into the room, but where from I know not. The girl confessed she had robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say? - She said she would give me the money again; she then gave me a guinea, half a crown, and I think two shillings; the rest, she said, she had not got. At the time she was laying this money down, the patrol came to the door and said, if the door was not opened he would break it open; the door was opened and the patrol came in, and after some little time the girl consented to be searched; she was not searched in my presence, it was in another room, I heard money drop. When the patrol came to me he said, she had got four guineas, concealed about her somewhere.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you receive from the patrol? - I received four guineas by the order of the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. How much had you been drinking? - Upon my word I was pretty much inebriated, or else I should not have gone to such a place.</p>
               <p>Q. But you are positive in your recollection of what you have now been telling us? - I am positive.</p>

               <p>Q. You are the patrol, I understand? - Yes. Between three and four o'clock in the morning, on Sunday last, I was going down Sharp's-alley, I heard murder and watch called in the house the prisoner lives in, then I called for the assistance of the watchman that was near at hand, and we went to the door. I said, there is murder called here, and I insist on the door being opened, on that the door was opened by Mary Maccleugh, I went in, and see Mary Maccleugh and Mary Merchant standing together by the side of the table; I asked what was the matter? the prosecutor said, he had been robbed of ten guineas by Mary Merchant, then I told her she was my prisoner; he then said that he had had three guineas<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140045"/>and two shillings given him back that was under the candlestick; then I asked her if she had any more of the property about her? if she had to deliver it as it might go better in her favour; she denied the robbery for some time. Mary Maccleugh said, deliver the man his money for you have got it, then I still persuaded her to deliver up the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search her? - Yes, in the same house, not in the same room. She told me if I would come with her she would tell me all about it; then accordingly I went with her into another room, and I called two watchmen likewife with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the watchmen go into the room with you? - Yes.</p>

            ? - Yes. She then declared that she had got four guineas of his property that she had robbed him of; I found the four guineas, she pulled it out of her bosom. She offered me a guinea if in case I would settle the business.</p>
               <p>Q. Before she pulled the money out of her bosom? - Yes. Says I, if you will let me see the money I will settle the business presently, then from that I kept the money, she wanted three guineas out of the four. I kept the four guineas, and I said, now you are my prisoner, you shall go to the watch house. I took her up to the watch-house, and from thence to the magistrate on Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the four guineas there? - It was delivered up to the prosecutor by order of the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Maccleugh. I would wish him to speak the truth, I told him to search the woman, for that she must have the money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Merchant. I met this man, I cannot say where, and he asked me to go with him, and I told him I would go with him, as I was very much distressed; I thought I must go to the workhouse the next week; I went to this good woman's house and he changed a guinea and sent for half a pint of liquor, before he went up stairs. Mrs. Maccleugh said to him, if you have got any thing to leave, give it me, and I will take care of it. No, says he, I have got nothing to take care of, but what I can take care of myself. I went up stairs and he gave me some silver into my hand, but I did not know what it was till I went down stairs, and when I went down stairs to go home to my sister, I looked and saw what it was, and when I see what it was, I told Mrs. Maccleugh that she might go up and awake the man.</p>
               <p>Jury. What did he do with the money he gave you? - I put it into my pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. It is a very delicate thing to ask a prisoner questions she is not bound to answer.</p>

               <p>I am the pawnbroker; the prisoner pledged the gown with me on Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see her before? - Not that I know of. I am sure it was her; she pawned it in the name of Ann Ponrey, for half a crown.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Did you know the prisoner before? - Never saw her before with my eyes, till I apprehended her in Carnaby-market. I have got a poor wife that is blind and cannot come, and got two fatherless children. The gown was hung on the nail of the mantle piece wet, and here is a bit that was left on the nail, when it was snatched off, that matches.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was at Westminster, No. 21, Charles-street, when he lost his property; at Mr. Jacques's. I went to receive my week's wages, and I was there about nine o'clock at night, at Mr. Jacques's, that I can take my oath of, and coming home I felt something under my feet and did not know what it was, and went back and picked it up, and it was this gown; (I never saw the man in my life, nor know where he lives) and I went and pawned it on Monday, for half a crown, and I never saw the man nor he never saw me before in his life; I don't know where his apartments are.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Did you find any other of the property? - Yes, a half shawl on her neck.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The shawl was put about the gown.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how the shawl was left? - It was not on the gown, it was on another line.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I offered him two guineas to make it up at the justice's, and he would not take it.</p>
               <p>Court. He was very right not to take it.</p>

               <p>Q. to Messenger.

               <p>Q. Who took in the other two? - I cannot say which of my lads it was, but I have produced all I have in her name here.</p>

               <p>Q.You are sure it was the prisoner that brought them in? - Yes; I asked her if they were her own? she said she never pledged any thing belonging to any person but herself.

               <p>Q. to Messenger, Shew her the two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140048"/>duplicates that relate to these things found on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. To Davis. Were those two duplicates given to the prisoner? - They were.</p>

               <p>Q. To Davis. With respect to the other goods, you can only say they are goods pawned in the name of Elizabeth Dickson? - No, they were pawned in the name of Mary Smith, they are none pawned in her own real name, but all in the name of Mary Smith.</p>
               <p>Messenger. Them in the Armory, pawned at Mr. Wright's, are in the name of Elizabeth Nix.</p>

               <p>Q. And the tickets found on the prisoner correspond? - They are cut one from the other, they must match the same as a bank note.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there any thing else besides these two separate sheets? - Yes, one window curtain, the 10th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. The ticket and the duplicate tally? - Yes, they all do that.</p>
               <p>Q. To Webb. Look at these effects, and tell me whether they are part of the effects let to this woman, as part of the furniture of her lodgings? - Yes, they are.</p>
               <p>Davis. Mrs. Webb did see them at my house, and at the justice's, and swore to them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was very much distressed, or else I should not have done it; I never left my lodging, I only begged for the next morning, and I would replace every thing; I paid a week's rent, and six-pence off the other; I owed her but a fortnight, I never meant to leave my lodgings till I had put every thing in its place, and if she had only granted the favour till the next morning I should have put every thing in its place, but she was very much enraged against me, and ordered the door to be locked and bolted, least I should get out of the place, which I never wished to leave the place till I had replaced the things.</p>

               <p>Q. When was this you went? - The 9th of December, the first day I went to that house, I went there with a friend who went there to recommend me.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to confine your evidence to the 10th, the next day? - I went on the 10th day again, the same person went with me as before; and him and I were nearly two hours in a back room in that house, one Simon's house, who keeps the Black Lion, in Petticoat-lane. We asked the servant whether Jacobs was there or Lazarus? they neither of them were in that house at that time; he came in afterwards and asked what was wanting.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did that? - Phinehas Jacobs; he came in and opened the door, and knew the person that was with me, that recommended me, and asked what was wanting? he knew him, he had purchased before that; he then went out with him to the back door and had some conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go with him? - I did not go out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. What past after that? How long did they continue together? - I look upon it about ten minutes. Then Lazarus came in and told me there were eighteen shillings for my half guinea; I asked him if that was all his master could afford for half a guinea? and he said yes. I understood by the appearance that Jacobs was his master.</p>

               <p>Q. They were both in the house at this time? - Yes, both in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. It was Jacobs and your friend that went together, and conversed at the back door? - Yes, Jacobs and my friend. I beg your pardon, gentlemen, I am wrong in the sum, that day I had twenty-four shillings for the half guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that question of his master's not affoding any more, was not on the 10th? - It was not, it was on the 9th; on the 10th I had twenty-four.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day was it your enquired for the prisoner, and they were not there at the Black Lion, and soon after Phinehas Jacobs came and and asked what was wanted? - Equally the 9th and 10th.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Lazarus give you the twenty-four the 10th? - Lazarus gave me the four and twenty that day, twenty-four shillings for half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him half a guinea? - I gave him a guinea, I had never an half guinea, he went to the bar and got change, and returned me half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Jacobs again that day? - I saw Jacobs at that very time. I asked if any of these shillings were to turn bad, whether he would change them? he said, bring them back, that either he or Lazarus would give other shillings for them at any time.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with that money you got? - Immediately after I received it, I took it to Esq. Colquohoun and shewed it to him.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140054"/>Q.What is become of them now? - I have them, I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Produce the tenth day's purchase. What were done with the prisoners? were they apprehended? - They were apprehended on the 13th, and taken before the magistrate, at Worship-street; I was present at the examination and search.</p>
               <p>Q. What was found on them? - Ten Shillings found on Lazarus to the best of my knowledge, and I think there was one bad shilling found on Jacobs and a bad sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they bad or good found on Lazarus? - Bad; the officers has got that money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Let us understand a little. You went them to this Black Lion public house? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. By the desire of the magistrate? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask for these two persons? - My friend that was with me asked for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Your friend went with Jacobs to the back door? - They did.</p>
               <p>Q. The twenty-four that Lazarus gave you, was at the time that Jacobs was talking to your friend? - Yes, at the time that they were conversing.</p>
               <p>Q.At that very time the transaction took place of Lazarus giving you twenty-four for half a guinea? - Lazarus was dispatched by Jacobs.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't tell us about dispatch. Did it not pass during the time of the conversation? - It did, they were in conversation the whole of the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Pinnicad, this is not the first time you have made your appearance here as a witness for the mint? - It is not.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you had the good fortune to be employed in prosecutions of this sort? - Once before.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the last session? - The session before last.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been employed to apprehend different offenderd? - That is not what I am sworn to.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been employed by the Mint to apprehend different offenders? - Once before, Esq. Colquohoun ordered me.</p>
               <p>Q. Let us ask whether any thing past between you and Lazarus, before he gave you the twenty-four shillings? - No, there had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to him before that time? - No otherwise than this, when he came into the room he said here is this for you for half a guinea. I did not speak to Lazarus that day at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you have the goodness to tell us what line of life you are in? - I am a bricklayer by trade.</p>
               <p>Q. You do business for yourself? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray have you always gone by the name that you now have? - I have, upon my oath.</p>

               <p>Q. You can give me a plain answer, on your oath? - Upon my oath I never went by any other name than that I go by now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. You have been asked whether at the time Lazarus gave you that money, that Jacobs and your friend were not conversing together? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were they to you? - About as near as that gentleman is to me</p>
               <p>Q. In the same room? - There was a door come out into a passage, and they stood at the left hand side of that door way, and I was in the room</p>

               <p>I had warrants to go and apprehend each of the prisoners; in company with the other officers on Saturday, the 13th of December, we went into the house and shut the door; I said to Pinnicad is the men here; he pointed them out and we took them; I see Mr. Ferris search Lazarus and find ten shillings have money, and three or four penny worth of halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. You have had a good deal of experience of had money, look at that money, and tell us whether it is bad or good? (the twenty four shillings shown him) - They are bad; the ten-shillings shewn him) they are bad.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp submitted to the court that the act of parliament upon which this indictment was forward expressed it to be counterfeiting milled money and this money had not been so proved.</p>
               <p>The court observed there was a case before the judges of that sort not yet decided.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp likewise submitted that this was not a case to go to the jury on the part of Jacobs, because he had not put off the money, but Lazarus alone.</p>
               <p>The court observed that was a fact for the jury to determine, how far he was concerned in the transaction.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you see this gun before it was taken? - The gun was in a woollen bag, and I had seen it about two or three minutes before I missed it. I then threatened Williams to send for a constable.</p>

               <p>Q. You have got a gun? - Yes, I was sent for on the 1st of January, by Mr. Hobson, about seven o'clock in the evening; at that time he had one Williams in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by the gun? - I went by the directions that Williams gave him; I pursued the prisoner and took him at a public house along with a girl; the Blue lion, Red lion passage, Red-lion-square, and brought him back with the gun; he said, he only borrowed it to go out a shooting one afternoon and he would have brought it back the next day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Was he drunk or sober? - To the best of my recollection he was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Q. You took him at another public house, and he came from the Orange-tree? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my property; I know it by the particular figure and general appearance; I have had it to the best of my recollection two years, or two years and a half</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it? - None in the least.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing more to say than that I was brought up in the navy, and till now, have ever borne an irreproachable character. According to the prosecutor's own account I must be in liquor, for I had been drinking gin and water in the morning and afternoon; I did take the gun, but with no intent to sell it or make away with it; I was inebriated when I did it, and did it in consequence of a wager; Williams laid me a wager that I dare not take the gun out and go a shooting, and I took the gun out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Williams was taken up on this? he has been pressed, has he not? - I was informed so.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140059"/>Q. Did the mail from Stamford, on the 21st of July, arrive in due course on the morning of the 22d? - It did, I opened the Stamford bag.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time of the morning did it arrive? - Between the hours of six and nine, the usual time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear regularly sealed as it came from Stamford? - It was as it usually comes</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to look at that letter, and see if it appears to have the post mark of the arrival on the 22d? - Just so.</p>
               <p>Q. Looking at that with that mark, which is a Post office mark of the 22d of July, have you any doubt that it was transmitted from Stamford by the post which set off from Stamford on the 21st? - I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. That is a mark on that letter of a stamper belonging to the Post office; Farmer, who was tried here last session, was a stamper in the Post office, was not he? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. He was tried for a capital offence, and convicted last session? - I believe he was, I was not concerned in that.</p>
               <p>Q. All that you mean to say is, that it has the appearance of a letter that comes from Stamford, with that mark on it? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. It must have come into the possession of a stamper to be stamped? - Certainly so.</p>
               <p>Court. Does the stamper receive it before or after the forter? - Before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. By that stamp you have no doubt it was transmitted regularly to London? - I have not the least doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Who stamps it I don't care any thing about.</p>

               <p>Q. You are deputy inspector of the letter carriers in the Post office? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 22d of July last was the prisoner employed there as a sorter of letters? - He was employed as a letter carrier and resorter of letters; he resorted them after they came to the letter carrier's office, in the division he was in.</p>
               <p>Q. When the mails are opened, what is the first thing done with the letters? - They are carried to be faced and then stamped.</p>
               <p>Q. The letters brought by the mails are stamped with the day of the month? - They are.</p>
               <p>Q. And then they are distributed into twelve divisions and sorted? - Yes, in the letter carriers office.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140060"/>Q. In which division did the prisoner at the bar act as a sorter on the 22d of July? - In the eighth.</p>
               <p>Q. He was likewise a letter carrier on that day? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q.Was Mansion House-street, within the district of which he was a carrier on that day? - No, it is not, nor in the division.</p>
               <p>Q. In the regular course and without the intervention of some mistake a letter to Mansion House-street would not have gone to the eighth division? - No, it would not.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a previous sorting before they come to the twelve different divisions? - There are, into the twelve divisions in the inland office.</p>
               <p>Q. If I understand you right, the division No. 1, is intended to take in a certain number of districts in this street and this street? - It does.</p>
               <p>Q. And No. 2, a certain number of other streets, and after that they are delivered to the letter carriers to sort for the conveniency of their delivery? - Yes, and therefore I call it resorting.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it sometimes happen that the first sorting in the inland office is not correct, so that a letter that belongs to division 12 finds it way to division 8, and so on? - It happens every day repeatedly so.</p>
               <p>Q. In that case is it the duty of the letter carrier who finds one that does not belong to him to throw it to the division to which it does belong? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Then after they have gone through the resorting, each of the letter carriers takes his letters of his own division to deliver them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you look at this letter? does this letter appear to be brought to London on the 22d of July? - It has the post mark of that day and should have been delivered that day, I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a new stamp for every day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So that a stamp that is used for a letter that comes to day cannot be used for a letter that comes to-morrow? - It cannot.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The prisoner at the bar was a person in the office known by the name of a letter carrier? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a description known by the title of sorters? - Sub-sorters we call them; they are employed in the inland office, for the letter carriers office.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there it is that all the letters are sorted as you call it? - Yes, and they are resorted again by the carriers in each division among themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner is not at all employed in the inland office? - I rather apprehend the prisoner at the bar could not be employed in the inland office, because he was taking charge of his own division that day.</p>
               <p>Q. On that day, the 22d of July, was not the prisoner employed as a charger of letters? - He was employed as charge-taker in the division where he was.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the business of the charge-taker? - To take the amount of the letters to each of his partners.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was busy in resettling the different charges with his partners, and not in resorting letters? - If there was a letter that did not belong to him, either he or his partners should throw it over to where it did belong.</p>
               <p>Q. The charge-taker is so far occupied with taking the charges that he has no time to sort them at all? - If there are any missorted he has to give them round to where they do belong. It is very seldom they have time to resort themselves, only those that come wrong to throw round where they ought to be.</p>
               <p>Q. In general, the charge-taker is more occupied in settling the charge than to find time in sorting the letters themselves. How many charge-takers are there? - One in each division.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140061"/>Q. If the letters are sorted correctly it could not be in that division? - It could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Before they get to the sorting there is an operation which they call stamping? - There is.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a man of the name of Farmer? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. He was tried here last session for secreting letters? - I understand so, I was not on his trial.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not he a person employed in stamping letters? - I cannot take on myself to say whether he was employed on that day.</p>
               <p>Q. He was a stamper of letters? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. The letters first of all come to the hands of the stampers, and may, if they are dishonestly disposed, be conveyed away by them? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The person who is employed as charge-taker is not likely to be much employed in sorting letters for the particular division, but if any letters are sent from the inland office into his division through mistake, it would come through his hands? - Most likely.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose a sorter in the inland office had sent a letter into the eighth division, directed to Mansion house-street, would it have been likely to have fallen into his hands as charge-taker? - It would so.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a thing that happens every day you say? - It does.</p>
               <p>Q. If there is an enquiry about a letter that is not delivered, who is questioned about it? - We make a general enquiry. When a letter is missing we are in the habit to make a public enquiry among all the letter carriers when they are there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner, in point of fact, a person employed in sorting letters and packets in the General

             office? - So far as this, if any were misplaced he had to throw them to the proper box where they ought to be.</p>

               <p>Court. On July the 22d, was the prisoner so employed as a sorter of letters? - In resorting those that were missorted to him.</p>
               <p>Q. If I understand you right, this man was employed in the eighth division? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his business in the eighth division? - As charging the letters, making up the charge with his partner in that division, and resorting any letters that were wrong in that division.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then supposing it to have happened in the course of that day that twenty letters were missorted to the eighth division, was it his duty to have sorted them right? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. And in point of fact, hardly a day passes without such missorting? - Hardly a day passes without.</p>
               <p>Court. In the first place, there is the business of a sorter in the office? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This man was not engaged on that day as a sorter of letters? - He was not employed that day in that, to that eighth division that man was what we call a charge-taker.</p>
               <p>Q. It is his business to sort the letters? - No, it is not, by reason he is occupied in making his charges.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you have other men that sort the letters while he is making up the charges? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any different description of people in your office, the letter carriers and sorters, or do the letter carriers sort? - They resort among themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when they come to the resorter of letters, how many are appointed charge-takers? - One man in each division.</p>
               <p>Q. If I understand you right, the man that is charge-taker of that day, is employed in taking the charges, and other peo<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140062"/>ple are employed in sorting the letters, but if it happens that in any other division any letter is missorted, does it come to his hands or to the sorters? - It comes to his hands by the sorters in the division to which it belongs.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that a letter that belongs to another division, and comes to the right division, goes through the hands of the charge-taker? - It most likely comes to the sorters first. If the letter happens not to be in its place and missorted, and happens to be in the division where it ought not, that sorter would give it to the charge-taker to take it to its proper place.</p>
               <p>Q.What does the charge-taker do with them? - He has an alphabet of all the other divisions in the office, and he sends it down to the proper division.</p>
               <p>Q. But what does he do with it? - He carries it to the proper division.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there are alphabets, and the letters that are missorted are put under those alphabets; are those that are missorted applied to the general mass of letters, or separated and kept by themselves? - They are thrown into the proper boxes where they belong to.</p>
               <p>Q. Where are these letters carried by the charge-taker? - They are thrown into the boxes, and the people who are there take them to where they belong. There are boxes numbered with all the other eleven divisions, over the charge-taker's seat, where they throw the missorted letters, and the charge taker or some of his partners take them round.</p>

               <p>On the 29th of October I was fetched from the Bank by the comotroller of the Post office, to take Pepperdy in custody, and after we brought him before the comptroller, I thought it right to search Pepperdy and Farmer. Pepperdy gave up the keys to Ferguson and me; Ferguson and myself went to his lodgings, No. 5, Leonard-street, Holywell street, and we opened the bureau where there was a large quantity of letters together, with some bills of exchange, which I put my hand upon first, six, I believe, and brought them away. (The bill of exchange shewn him.) This is one, and there were many more letters, a great number indeed. I did not find any in letters, I put my hand on these six, and I said to Mr. Ferguson, here appears to be a good group. (Five others shewn him.)</p>
               <p>Q. Are these the other five? - Yes, they are all marked with the initials of my name, and the day of the month; I marked them at the office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You did not mark them the moment you took them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you mark them before you parted with them? - As a matter of course.</p>

               <p>Q. Where the bags sealed? - It is a rule I always make, and also it is by an order of the office, to seal the bags.</p>
               <p>Q. Fix your attention to any one of the bags, and describe that first? - The first is the inland bag unpaid.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe what it contains? - That is the quantity of letters that are put into my box free, the same as it is in the General Post office.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that sealed or unsealed? - Yes, that is sealed. Then there is another bag with paid letters, and another bag with news papers, that are all entirely put in the first bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these bags put in any thing else? - In a sack; and I take another bag from the Armitage, and another from Tower-hill.</p>

               <p>Q. What time was he dispatched that evening? - I think at about a quarter to six a person came to inform me that my boy was stopped in Nightingale-lane, I immediately went up with the man to the last examined person, Mr. Butcher's house. When I came there I was told he was gone to the office; I immediately proceeded to the office in Shadwell; when I came to Shadwell the magistrate examined the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the bags there? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you got them here? - I have; here they are.</p>

               <p>Q. Where have they been since? - They have been locked up at my house, and the money that was in the bag, the money for the paid letters.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they in the same exact state and condition as when you see them at the office? - Yes, only that the solicitor told me to separate the money, the two shillings and sixpence from the ten-pence, which I did when I got home, I could not get a bit of sealing wax to do it at the justice's, but I did it as soon as ever I came home, and marked the separate parcels of money.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure these are the bags you seat out that night? - I can swear to the bags.</p>
               <p>Q. And you marked the separate parcels of money as soon as you came home? - Immediately so.</p>
               <p>Q. Produce those that you sent.(Produces them) You are satisfied that all are the same? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. And the money sealed up as when you sealed it? - It is positively so. My money, my boy says, it is two shillings and sixpence, but I think it is two shillings and ten-pence.</p>

               <p>Q. Open it. - It is as the boy said, two shillings and sixpence; one shilling two sixpences, and sixpennyworth of halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you put in the bag that night? - Two shillings and sixpence, that answered to the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the sum in the bill and the bag the same as it was? - The sum is the same, I declare on my oath; I sealed it up myself, and I open it now here for the first time.</p>
               <p>Q.What money did the Armitage bag<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140070"/>contain? - Sanders's bag contained only tenpence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You cannot tell what was in the Armitage bag? - I can tell so far as this, that the bag was opened before me at the justice's office, and the money delivered to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these bags delivered to you from the post office? - They are.</p>

I spoke to a lady for him, that lady came to me, and that introduced him into our parlour. The next day he came when I was out, and he sat a long time in the parlour with my husband. On the 3d of December, he came again, in the afternoon, about four o'clock, he asked if my husband was out? I told him yes; he asked me if my little girl was at the school? I told him yes; he said, tomorrow he should paint her picture; he had agreed with my husband; he asked me if I fold writing paper? he asked me if I fold hair ribbon first; I told him yes, and he had a yard; and then he asked me if I fold writing paper? I told him yes; he said, could I permit him to write in my parlour, for his room smoaked so? I told him yes; and I gave him the pen and ink, and prepared him the table, and he would not write on the table, he would write on his knee, and he drew near to the drawer where the money was in. In five minutes before he came in, I had occasion to count my money, I had a gentleman coming with a bill, and I counted fourteen guineas, thinking I might have more money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock your drawer? - No, I did not lock it. At the time of his writing I had an occasion to go into the shop, to grind some coffee; I left him in the parlour, in the same place where he was writing, close to the drawers. I ground the coffee, I was about twelve minutes in the shop, and when I went back again, he asked me for a water, and asked me for the post; I told him where it was; and he wished me a good night, and said, tomorrow morning at ten o'clock he should come and draw the child's picture. When he had been gone about five minutes, my husband came in, and I asked him if he had taken any money out of the box? he said no, and I said, why we have but fourteen guineas, and I know we ought to have near twenty; he said, he had no money in his pocket, and I took the money out of the box to shew him and there was but eleven in the box.</p>

               <p>Q.

            's, his wife received me rather ill, called her husband and quitted the room; the husband told me that money was missing, that he had ten or twelve guineas and a bank note of ten pounds, that he found two guineas less. This declaration she made also, before the justice of peace; and that he suspected me to be the person who took it, because I had been and wrote in the parlour, but he could not convince me, that he shewed me his resentment and indignation and went to carry me before a justice of peace, then he told me that perhaps he might be mistaken; that was not sufficient for me, I returned to my lodgings were I had been four days, it was given out that I was a thief, and they would not receive me there; I returned again to Le Comte, his wife had been to the justice of peace; I saw myself attacked by a number of people, stop theif is cryed out, surprized, a stranget in this country, not knowing the usage or customs, I went to run away, I was stopped, I was beaten, they took from me what I had about me; a guinea and half and two shillings, which I had in my pocket, and I was carried before a justice of peace; the wife of Le Comte was there already; she declared that I had taken three guineas out of a box that was in the drawer, wherein there were fourteen, and a ten pound note, and the husband who did not think proper to have me arrested, declared he was not positive as to the sum he had in that drawer, that he only missed two guineas; see there is a manifest contradiction, and the wife of Le Comte, declared to an emigrant of my acquaintance before I was arrested, that she had missed nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is that emigrant? - He is a priest. Nevertheless, the wife of Le Comte told the justice that she suspected me to be the person that took the three guineas, because, I had remained alone in the parlour, she declared that the drawer was not locked, but did not say that there is a door comes into the parlour which I informed myself of, that door goes into an alley going into a street; on this suspicion the justice of peace caused me to be imprisoned and caused the money to be returned that had been taken from me, and now, my lord and gentlemen, I will inform your lordship and jury from whence I got this money; it is necessary and proper for you to know that I have been treated very unworthily; Mr. Channelly, an em<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140073"/>grant, who raises a body of emigrants in the British pay, he is colonel of that body of troops; I not having the means of subsisting, not being able to partake of the bouney of government, not being of the age of fifty years; I engaged in Mr. Channelly's corps, and he gave me three guineas, and the guinea and half found in my pocket was a part of it; Mr. Maleet, an emigrant from France, deputy of the French slates general in the year 1789, had addressed me to him; the justice of peace sent to Mr. Maluet and he declared in writing that he knew me, from having been captain of dragoons in France, and an aid-de-camp during the serge of Lyons, and if it was possible to find three guineas on me it must come that was; that writing ought to be before the eyes of your lordship and you gentlemen, and Mr. Channelly also, will if needful, declare, that on the 1st of December, last past, that is to say two days before I was imprisoned, he gave me three guineas as a bounty, as being engaged to him. I now intend, my lord and gentleman of the jury, to establish my justification. First, when I came into the parlour there was a maid servant in the room, she quitted the room immediately; it is untrue that I remained alone in the parlour, the daughter of Le Comte, eight years of age remained with me during the time that the wife of Le Comte quitted the room for a moment. Secondly, my lord and gentlemen, could I guess that there was in the drawer which I knew nothing of and which did not lock money, that is not probable, and the justice of peace himself was surprized that fourteen guineas and a bank note of ten pounds. should not be under lock and key. I hurdly, if it had been proverty that had prompted me to rob, instead of three guineas, I would have equally taken the whole, the fourteen guineas and the bank note of ten pounds, and I could equally with the same facility have carried away two gold watches also, that were hanging in the room, belonging to Le Comte. Fourthly, If I had robbed the prosecutor I should not have returned the next day, that is not probable, besides there is a door in the parlour which belongs to that room which leads to an alley, and from thence to the street; is it not possible that somebody might have come in into the parlour before me? and can this woman in conscence swear that no person came in before me.</p>
               <p>My lord and gentlemen, a stranger as I am in this country an unhappy emigrant, I have not the faculty or means of getting a counsel, I do not speak the English language, be pleased to hear this my petition or memorial with your usual justice; I defended the cause of my king at Lyons, I have a thousand times escaped death in many battles, am I to fall here under the worst of calumny, an unhappy Frenchman, an unhappy father; am I reserved never to see my wife and children? now my lord, I persuade myself when I think I have for judges the wisest of men, who will weigh in your justice the justice of my cause, you will confound my enemies, and in rendering me my honour you will render me my life.</p>
               <p>Court to Le Comte. Was there any woman in the house before yourself at the time that you suspected him taking the money - Nobody but myself, my child came in just as he was going out.</p>
               <p>Q.Did any woman come in with the child? - No, she came in by herself just about two minutes before the man went out.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the drawer shut or open? - Shut.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140074"/>Q. Was it locked? - It was not locked, I had just taken it out, and alarmed at losing the money and shut it, but did not lock it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is there a passage door leading to an alley? - No, no passage, but what goes into the yard; passage and alley is the same word in French.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any access to that parlour but through the street door? - No other.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot come out of that parlour and go up stairs? - Yes, you can, but there is a door that shuts in the parlour that prevents it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you lodgers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Have your lodgers any business in the parlour? - They have no business whatever; I never permit them to come into my parlour.</p>

               <p>JOHN BROWN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am carman to Mr. Deykins; I was sent out with some parcels in the cart; Jenkins is my fellow servant; I went to deliver a parcel on <placeName id="t17950114-40-crimeloc237">Fish-street-hill</placeName>

When I came back to the cart I see a man discoursing with Jenkins, not this prisoner, and this prisoner at the bar was on the shafts of the cart, with a parcel in his arms taking it from the cart, upon which I runs and seizes hold of him, shoved the parcel from him on to the copse, and pulled him off from the copse of the cart; he had it completely in his arms off from the copse of the cart. He did not get away from me, but it was some time before I could get him secured to take him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the parcel? - I took the parcel where it was directed to go into Wapping; I was afraid to go back with the parcel; I left it there all night and went for it the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I would ask you whether it was the same parcel you received the next morning? Did you put your mark on it that night? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the directions sufficient to know it again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you deliver it to the next morning? - I delivered it to the hands of my master's son.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has had it ever since? - I delivered it to Mr. Deykins, junior.</p>
               <p>Q.Perhaps you see that parcel before the magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know it again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brings it here? - I received it of my master this morning, Mr. Deykins, junior. This is the parcel, it was cut open at the Mansion House.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman belonging to Aldgate, I was crying the hour of ten, and I met this man, Myers, and his wife, and his father, and he said you must go along with me, says I, where? says he, I have been robbed; says I, you must go up to the constable of the night and let him know, that he may know where to find me; so after that my partner came down to me, he had an order to go and take the thief, and when we came into the room there were two in one bed, and the taylor laid in the other bed, and so we looked into the first bed where the two men lay, and he was not there, and we looked into the other bed and found him and we fetched him up to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH WRIGHT sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the other watchman I suppose. What do you know of the matter? - The man came up to my stand in Houndsditch, and said that his house had been broke open, and I went to the constable of the night and asked him whether I might go out of the city to take the thief? and he said, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you went with the other watchman that took him? - Yes, and carried him to the compter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say at all, the prosecutor settled so far with my father that he took half a guinea and made it up.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? how do you get your livelihood? - I am a <rs id="t17950114-44-deflabel263" type="occupation">hatter</rs>

               <p>Q. Do you know the defendant? - Yes, she came to our house the 27th of December last, about eleven o'clock in the morning; I served the prisoner with a skein of silk, a pennyworth, she was very particular in having a very small skein, and would not give more than a penny for it, and she gave me a good deal of trouble in changing for her. She gave me a good shilling, I gave her a sixpence and five pennyworth of halfpence, and particularly noticed the sixpence when I gave it her to be a particular large one, larger then they usually are; she returned me a counterfeit bad sixpence and told me I gave her that, as soon as I had given her the good sixpence she asked me to change the silk for a smaller skein, I then turned my back on the prisoner to change the silk, and I could not find one smaller than a penny, she then gave me a bad sixpence, she said she did not think it was a good one; it was a very bad one.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you sure that the sixpence she gave you, after you had given her one, was not the same that you had given her? - I am certain of it, or else I would not take an oath. I told her the sixpence was a bad one, it was not the one I had given her, she said it was the one, she had no other about her, I then asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140082"/>her to open her hand, she seemed to have her hand shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she open her hand? - She refused to open it. I asked her again, and she refused it; I told her if she did not open it I would, I then got over the counter and opened her hand, and I found the sixpence there that I had given her, and four other very bad sixpences with it, all brass.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you returned the bad one she had given you? - No, I kept it in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there were five bad sixpences in all? - Yes, five in all.</p>
               <p>Q. If I understand you right you have kept that bad sixpence she uttered to you in your custody? - Yes, I have had it in my custody ever since, I have got it in my hand now.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the sixpence that she gave you in return? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep the others separate when you took the other four out of her hand? - I put the four together with the other, but I noticed it, and took the four from it, and gave them to the constable, and kept the one she uttered to me myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the other that had been mixed with the four, was the same that she uttered to you? - Yes, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q.Now let us look at the good sixpence? - This is it, a very large one, if it had not been a very large one, I should not have known it perhaps.</p>
               <p>Q. What else did you do? - Then I sent for a constable, Mr. Reeves, and he took her into custody, and took her to the compter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The gentleman speaks very much out of the way, he gave me the sixpence I returned him.</p>
               <p>Court to Turton. She still sticks on it that the sixpence she uttered to you was the sixpence she had of you, will you venture, cooly and deliberately, to swear to the circumstance that the sixpence she returned to you, was not the sixpence that you gave to her? - I will.</p>

               <p>Q. You are a constable? - I was at this time. I was sent for by Mr. Strafford, the prisoner was in the shop when I came down, and this young man produced five sixpences in the whole, I desired him to pick out that sixpence that she uttered, which he did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the other four? - He delivered them into my custody. I went to her lodgings afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know they were her lodgings? - The prisoner told me; I found there thirteen shillings and fourteen sixpences, all bad. They are in the state I found them in this bag.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My husband is at sea, and I took in a woman to lodge with me, and she gave me one sixpence to go and buy some butcher's meat, and the butcher objected to the sixpence; and I went to this shop and offered him a shilling, and he gave me the sixpence that I offered to change again; they searched my box and found nothing in my box; if I had known the money was in my place, I should not have sent the gentleman to my place.</p>
               <p>Court to Reeves. Where did you find these at her lodgings? - In the cradle under the child.</p>

               <p>Q.Had you hackney horses? - Yes. In consequence of what Mrs. Cross said I looked through the window behind, and I see the prisoners who are now at the bar, almost close to the carriage.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time was this? - About twenty minutes past four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they on horse back or on foot? - On horseback.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the colour of their horses? - I cannot positively say; I have some recollection of the colour of one being a bay or sorrel, but I cannot recollect the other. Very soon after, I heard somebody cry out, stop! very loud, two or three times; and the prisoner on the right hand, the one in the red collar, Austin, demanded my money; he was on the right side of the carriage; Mrs. Cross was very much alarmed at the fight of the pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he presented a pistol? - He presented a pistol; I requested him to take his pistol from the carriage, I had nothing worth contending for, and he should have it; he begged us not to be alarmed, he would do no injury, and he requested we would give our money; he conducted himself as civil, I suppose, as any man could do. Mrs. Cross had just given over her money, and she found a noise on her left hand, which alarmed her very much, and she put down the window, the man on the left hand ran his pistol into her neck, I gave my money, and the prisoner who last attacked us, insisted on our watches and diamond rings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he present a pistol also? - He presented a pistol also, which he did not take away for some time, though repeatedly d-mned and cursed by the other man for not doing it. I think I gave him eight or nine guineas, it was more than seven, but I am not certain whether it was eight or nine; the other man still persisted that the lady had a diamond ring and the man on the left hand,

I opened the watch and found it was advertised from Bow-street, as stolen; he said he believed the chain was gold, I then gave the aqua fortis and the Turkey stone to my young man to try it, during which time I went out to get assistance in taking of him; a few doors from my own house I met one of our patrols, I told him what I wanted, and in returning with him into the house, just at the door I met the two prisoners at the bar coming out. Austin Flowers, he stood in the passage during the time that

               <p>Q. You carried them both to the magistrate, I suppose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. What are you? - A pawnbroker, No. 92, St. John-street, West-Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you went out of your house, and left the two prisoners in the house? - I only saw one in the house.</p>
               <p>Q.How long did you leave him in the house? - About two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You found him there when you returned? - I found him coming from the house in the passage, coming out both of them together.</p>
               <p>Q. To Cross. You have stated very fairly to the court, and it is natural to suppose you would, that this was on the 17th of November, about twenty minutes after four o'clock in the afternoon? - In stating it so precisely, I conjecture it so. It was between four and five, and rather nearer four than otherwise.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what sort of a day it was? - It was a sharp frost, I rather think it was, but I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not much daylight? - It was so much daylight that I could have read in my carriage, because a very short time before I had a book in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you was able to see the person through the glass behind the carriage, the glass you say was dim? - No, I did not, I said, it was high, I could not see the colour of the horses.</p>
               <p>Q. First of all, if I understand you right, you observed the prisoners you say,(if they were the prisoners) from the back glass, the glass of the back part of your chaise; the glass is not very large? - It is a square glass and rather large, it is as much as eight inches square.</p>
               <p>Q. By that means you was enabled first of all to discover the persons? - No, Mrs. Cross supposing somebody was getting up behind the carriage, I looked and see the two men distinctly behind the carriage, not thinking they were robbers at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the man on your side behaved very civil? - Uncommonly civil, I never was robbed before and so I cannot tell how others behave.</p>

               <p>Q. But the other man was not so civil? - He was not, he swore to the other man for not taking the things.</p>
               <p>Q. The man on the right hand, he said, all I want is your money, and I beg the lady will not be alarmed? - He did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140085"/>Q. You say you lost your watch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that is your watch now produced? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were the prisoners apprehended after you was robbed? - I see them only yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they taken into custody after the robbery was first committed? - I see them yesterday at the police office, Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. They had been committed to Tothill-fields, and brought to Hatton-garden? - I don't know that. There were none in irons but these, and therefore I must mark them as the prisoners, I must say very fairly.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore they were pointed out? - No, not pointed.</p>
               <p>Q.When you got to the office you recognized two men in irons? - Of whom I could have no doubt, if I was to see them among ten thousand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Austin. Were not your eyes bad then? - No, that has arisen since in consequence of an inflammation from the gout.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you perfectly recollect, you say it was eight weeks since the robbery was committed? - The question is perfectly fair, and if I had the smallest doubt on my mind, I would not in this place, swear so positively; I am sorry I am obliged to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you was on your journey to Barnet, robbed at some little distance from that place. Now I ask you which side of the carriage you sat on? - On the left side. I recollect you perfectly at the turnpike; you remember looking into the carriage; you remember stopping some time to do it. I had a perfect recollection of your face before you stopped me, I had a perfect fight of it from the hind glass, I could not be mistaken afterwards; you was extremely civil, and if I had any doubt I would express it, but seeing you now and seeing you yesterday, I cannot do otherwise than say I am certain; I wish I was not obliged to say so.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been repeatedly wrote to by the magistrate on this business? - And very unwillingly came up on this business.</p>
               <p>Q. And returned for answer that you could not swear to the persons? - I think that when Mr. Bond wrote to me in Yorkshire, I was ill with an inflammation in my eyes; under this circumstance, Mrs. Cross wrote an answer, that coming up so far at the uncertainly of been able to swear to the persons, would be putting me to a great inconvenience at that time; I felt a repugnance at coming up, but that was from the uncertainly of figuring to myself the persons of the men that had robbed me, but seeing these men again I have no idea of doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any such letter wrote by you? - I think I wrote one letter to excuse myself from coming up,</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp to Briggs. The prisoner Austin, wishes me to ask you whether before the justice you did not say, that John Flowers informed you that he had received the watch from a friend? - When I asked him whose watch it was? he said it was not his own, but he had brought it for a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he add any thing, did he say he had brought it from a gentleman for whom he had made a coat? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. In short he disclaimed any property in it, he said it was not his? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you knew him very well? - I have known both of them for some years; one of them Austin Flowers, lived at our beadle's.</p>

On Thursday, the 20th of November, between seven and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140086"/>eight o'clock, I was walking on my duty as a patrol, I see a young lad coming out of a butcher's shop, which is Mr. Spencers, and I heard him utter the word here is one of them; that gave me reason to suppose that there was something amiss, that he was in persuit of one of the patrols, I happened to be there; I turned myself round and see Mr. Briggs speaking to Mr. Spencer; I asked what was the matter? Mr. Briggs he said, there was a person that he wanted immediately to be taken to prison, he told me that he was in the box, a place which I did not know what it meant at that time, at last the boy told me I will come and shew you; the boy shewed me; this place is in the passage, the passage leads to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with Mr. Briggs? - I went on and the butcher's boy shewed me, said there, it is there; I just stopped and I saw the two prisoners there present coming out of the door; Mr. John Flowers who is there prisoner, he was obliged to squeeze himself to come by me; at that instant of time I did not know they were the party that I was to apprehend, and by that they got by me, there was an immediate cry, there they go; Mr. Briggs called out that to the best of my knowledge; accordingly I see John Flowers run up St. John's street, I followed him, I called out stop thief, accordingly he was stopped by one

               <p>Q. Who brought him in? - I cannot tell you who brought him, and therefore I did not observe that; then there was the coach ordered and they were both charged, and we took them to the magistrate's.</p>

               <p>Q.Now tell us what you know of this matter? - I saw John Flowers bring the watch into our house, on Thursday, the 20th of November, he asked two guineas for the watch.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he speak to you or in your presence? - In my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard him? - Yes. He said it was a gold chain, I tried the chain and it was good gold; in the mean while I was trying the chain my master went to get assistance; in the mean while he was gone, Flowers asked me where he was? I told him I believed he was at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do on that? - He then took away the watch off the counter and went out; it was laying on the counter, I saw no more of him till he was brought in by the patrols; while they were both standing in the shop a woman told me they were emptying their pockets; I immediately went round the counter, and I found this pair of spurs in a paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them come out of the pockets of these people? - No, I did not see them; a short time afterwards there were three shot found just on the same spot.</p>
               <p>Q.But you did not see them come out of their pockets? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Austin. The evening on which my brother went to Mr. Briggs with the property in question, I met with my brother, he asked me to go home to sup with him, which I did not refuse to do; he told me he wanted to call at Mr. Briggs, the pawnbroker's, he had something to pledge; he then went into Mr. Briggs and I waited at the door, I stopped there some little time when I see a patrol come up with a hanger drawn, I thought there might be something going on that might hurt my brother, I ran away and Mr. Briggs followed me till I came to the pens in Smithfield; I turned about then and asked Mr. Briggs what he wanted? he told me he wanted me to go back with him; I turned round on him and went back, had I wished to have done it I could have made my escape from Mr. Briggs I make no doubt; I went into the shop and he told me that my brother had brought a watch to pledge that was not his own; my brother said it was not his own property but the property of a friend; he had for some time been acquainted with Mr. Briggs, if this watch had been improperly got he would not have taken it to Mr. Briggs. With respect to myself, I am totally ignorant of the watch, neither for some time prior had I seen my brother; had I the idea of this watch being improperly got I would not have waited so near the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner John. On the evening I took the watch to the pawnbroker's, I took it of a person who had ordered a coat of me; I measured him at the George, in Aldermanbury, on the 13th of November, a person who called himself a Mr. Smith, who had used that house for some time; I was to make him a coat and waistcoat, he told me when I brought it he would pay me, I made it and took it to him, the value was 3l. 10s. he said he had not got money to pay me then; he said if I would leave the clothes he would pay me the next day, which I refused to do, not knowing him; I asked him that if the landlord would be bound for the coat I would leave it, and he offered me this watch till the next day, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140088"/>told him I would take it to a friend of mine and know the value of the watch; he told me it was a gold chain and seal, which I told him I did not believe it was, and as such I took it to Mr. Briggs; if I had known this watch was stole I would not have took it to Mr. Briggs, were I must be known.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you observe? - I observed two men outside of the rails, and the window open of Mr. Burton's house, the prisoner at the bar was in the parlour; on which I went over the way, and as soon as I went over, one of them went off; the other stopped outside of the rails; I asked them what business they had to do there? on which the prisoner at the bar came to the window, and shewed himself to me; on which I asked the prisoner who he was? he said he belonged to the house, and if I did not get out of the way, he would jump over me; on that he came up, and said, now you see who I am, I belong to the house; I told him it was very well if he did belong to the house, but I insisted on his going into the house; on which he went up to the other man, and drew a stick from the other man, which he had under his coat, and aimed a blow at me with the stick; on which I got into the middle of the road, and evaded the blow, and called out, stop thief! and he ran off, and I pursued him into White's-alley; he was out of my sight at the corner, but I see him again before he got to the corner.</p>

               <p>Q. To Chavaree. Where were these effects left that you lost? - Down in the kitchen, in a chest, and the chest locked.</p>

               <p>Q. To Antoinette Amelia. Tell us how you connect this with the prisoner at the bar? - The prisoner at the bar was a lodger of mine before, he does not lodge with me not now, he was not a lodger when he robbed the house.</p>

               <p>Q. What steps did you take when the house was robbed? - I thought he was the person by the breeches that were left behind, and I employed two officers to go and catch him, and they catched him in a public house asleep.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you apprehend him? - I went up into Blue coat fields to a house in the parish of St. George's, by the information of that good man there that had his thumb partly bit off, and we see him there, and took him into possession, and brought him down to the office, but first before we went to the office we went up stairs to his lodgings, where he ran from, and took the prisoner at the bar with me, and found these shirts in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to the house and found the prisoner at the door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You and the prisoner and all went up stairs - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they check shirts? - Yes, in the Spanish way; he went and sat down on the bed and I took this cap off his head. I took the breeches off his person at the office.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. That man catched hold of me by my throat as I lay asleep. The door I did not break, it was on a latch, and they robbed me of clothes that I gave them five pounds for.</p>
