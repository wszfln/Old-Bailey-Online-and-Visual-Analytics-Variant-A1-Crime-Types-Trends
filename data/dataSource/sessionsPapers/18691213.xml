                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman in the employment of Hugh Jones &amp; Co., of Wood Street—on the morning of 15th November the prisoner came into the silk department on the ground floor—he brought some patterns with him, which he wished to match—I showed him silks, but they were not near his patterns, and while I was getting some others he turned away from me—I afterwards saw him stopped, and this piece of silk (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) taken from under his coat—he had not left the warehouse—this piece of silk had been lying in a fixture on the top of some more goods—it is the property of Messrs. Jones, and is worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner had been at the premises on the Monday previous, and about three hours after he had left I missed a piece of black satin, worth about' 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—here are two pieces of paper, produced by the constable, which I recognize; and here is the buyer's mark on this piece—it is similar to the piece that was round the satin which I missed.</p>

Q.</hi> This is a very large warehouse, is it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I swear to this piece of silk—I had seen it in the fixture a short time previous—we have some hundreds of pieces in the warehouse—I had not taken this piece out to show to the prisoner—the mark on the paper is a pencil mark—I can swear it is the mark of our buyer—he is not here—I had not complained to the police of the loss of the satin before the prisoner was given into custody.</p>

I am a solicitor—I acted for Mr. Johnson in this matter—on 1st October I was present in Court—I saw Savory there—in accordance with the notice I had given, I applied for an adjournment—I heard Savory sworn, and heard what he said—I did not take any note—I handed in a medical certificate with reference to Johnson's absence, and Savory got up and said, "Oh, that is all nonsense, I have seen him"—the judge said, "Well, let this man be sworn"—he was sworn, and said, "I saw him yesterday, at his office in Basinghall Street, and in the Bankruptcy Court, and I saw him this morning in Basinghall Street"—I then Cross-examined him, and said "Now repeat where you saw him," and he said, "I saw him in his office in Basinghall Street, yesterday, and I saw him this morning in Basinghall Street"—I said, "This morning, that was after you got my notice"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "In the face of that notice, why did you come here with counsel and witnesses; and, if you had seen the man, why not say you had got a notice of his being ill, and you were sur<lb/>prised to see him in the street"—he said "He was over the other side," or something of that sort—I had given him notice of my intention to apply for an adjournment—after this evidence a verdict was taken for the defendant for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was not able to go into the set-off—the Judge would not hear any remarks.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you take any note of what was said? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I could not—I was examining him at the time—he did not say, after saying that he had seen Johnson that morning, "He was also seen at his office in Basinghall Street," nor did he point to a man named Hart—there was a man examined, I can't tell his name, who repeated Savory's words, word for word—I acted for Johnson from the commencement of the proceedings—his claim was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more than Savory's, it was 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—Johnson was not present on 23rd July, and I paid the costs of the day, through his absence—I communicated to him that the verdict was against him, two days after-wards—he has not applied for a new trial—he has paid the money—he has taken no other proceedings than these.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MOODY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you not apply for a new trial? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I believe the rule is that you must indict for perjury first, and apply for a new trial afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an attorney, at St Martin's Court, St. Martin's Lane—I acted for Mr. Lewis in the matter of "Lewis against Clark"—I attended at the Sheriffs Court when the case came on, on the 2nd August—Mr. Lewis was with me—I saw Mr. Hey there—he told me that Mr. Wood was the counsel engaged, and then I spoke to Mr. Wood with reference to making terms—in the midst of my conversation with Mr. Wood the case was called on—Mr. Lake was then absent, having gone to his office, and Mr. Wood asked for an adjournment—the case was then adjourned to the 12th August—the same day, after the adjournment, Mr. Wood and myself agreed to settle the action upon Mr. Lewis, paying 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the costs upon the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I think Mr. Wood endorsed his brief to that effect—we then went to the registrar, down stairs, and arranged to have the order drawn up upon the terms agreed; but a clerk in the office said that, as it had been called on and adjourned, we must attend on the adjournment day, unless a written notice was forwarded by Mr. Lewis to the Court; in the meantime a written consent was given—I went into the office; the prisoners went in as well, I think, I am not certain of that—they were about the Court, at any rate—I did not know them before, and I did not know their names—I did not know Mr. Biggenden before I saw him at the Guildhall Police Court—in the interval between the adjournments the consent paper came—Mr. Lewis signed it, and it was sent to the Court on the 12th, the adjournment day—I did not attend on the 12th—I got the bill of costs about ten days after<lb/>wards, and I went with Mr. Lewis to the taxing-master's office, to tax it on his behalf—both the defendants attended on the other side—the bill of costs was set out upon the higher scale, and I objected to it, and ultimately the taxing-master taxed it on the lower scale—the defendants wanted it taxed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186912130019"/>
               <p>on the higher scale—the taxing-master rejected that bill, and said he would tax under the Act of Parliament, under the scale of allowance—he put that bill on one side, and allowed them only the lower scale—I acted throughout under the belief that there was an attorney in the matter, and that Mr. Biggenden was the attorney because his name was at the bottom of the brief, and at the bottom of the bill of costs—that was the only reason—the practice at the Sheriffs' Court is, if there is no attorney there is no taxing; the costs are allowed in Court—the bill of costs does not profess to be signed by Mr. Biggenden; but it is usual to put the name at the bottom of all the papers.</p>

               <p>import German and Belgian boards, manufactured from straw, which afterwards have paper put on them for the purpose of making boxes—some time in July the prisoner Clark with his wife came to my premises—I did not know him before—he wanted work—he said he knew how to line my boards, and could do it at a reasonable price—I sent him some afterwards—I supplied him with all the materials, and he did the labour—I supplied him with materials from time to time, he put them together and returned them to me, and I paid him the price agreed on, so much per ream—I have my book here—his wife seems to have been the manager in this business, and she came for the money, and signed "J. Clark" for him—a settlement was made on 1st October up to that date—boards were delivered out to him after that settlement, on 1st October, 27th October, and 3rd November—I sell the boards wholesale at 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt—on 1st October a ton and a half were delivered out to him—this entry is in my writing—he did not return the whole of that manufactured, there was about 1 1/2 cwt. deficient—on 27th October the entry is my brother's, he is here, 148 bundles, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> 64 cwt, were delivered out, twenty bundles after<lb/>wards on 28th, and another twenty on 29th, altogether 74 cwt in 1/2 cwt. bundles—the whole of those were not returned to me manufactured—there was a deficiency of about 8 1/2 cwt.—on 3rd November here is an entry in my writing of 1 ton delivered out; of that 6 cwt. was returned, leaving a deficiency of 14 cwt.—the paper was sent in at various times between 1st October and 16th November—I have the entries here—here is one lot that I have a receipt for, sent on 16th November—that went from my office while the prisoners were there, for a special purpose, to line the 14 cwt. of boards that were to be returned to me on the Thurs<lb/>day morning—it was a small quantity of four reams and ninety-six sheets—altogether I find sixteen reams nineteen quires short—I can tell if necessary the way in which I arrive at that—I have gone carefully into it—on 16th November, I had an interview with both the prisoners at my warehouse—they came there and demanded money from me; an amount that I certainly did not owe them—I forget the amount just now; I think it was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told them in the first place I did not owe that amount, and in the second I would not pay the small amount I did owe until my goods were returned—Clark said (he and his wife were both there) that if I would send sufficient paper to cover the 14 cwt. of boards they would let me have them on the Thursday morning—that would be two days afterwards—I told them I wanted the boards very urgently for an order, and they promised to send them—that was the remainder of the ton sent on 3rd November—I sent the paper for those boards while they were at my office, four reams and ninety-six sheets to their residence, in 11, Paradise Street, Finsbury—this is the ticket, signed by Mary Bradshaw, for Clark—I saw nothing of them on the Wednesday, and on the Thursday I went to Clark's workshop, 6, Primrose Street, Bishopsgate, about 10.30 in the morning—I found no one there—it was locked up on the outside—I looked through the window, I could see every part of the building, and I found all my goods were gone—I had been there previously, on several occasions, and seen my goods there—I then went to Clark's residence, in Paradise Street—I got there about 11 or 11.30—I inquired for Clark—I saw the person living in the front room—Clark occupied the back room up stairs—I endeavoured to get access to that room, but it was locked—I could not see into that room—on the 19th I</p>

               <p>went to Mr. Toy's, 215, Queen Street, Bethnal Green—he keeps a grinder's shop, and sells leather, and all sorts of materials for shoe makers—I saw in his possession about 2 cwt. of boards, which I identified as my property from the size, the mark, and the quality—I have specimens of them here—they were not in the same state in which they left my premises, the bundles were altered, and the outside marks removed—there was a mark on the outer bundle of every hundredweight—they were all removed—that same evening I went with two officers to Mr. Hubbard's, of 14, Ashwell Road, and saw about 4 cwt. of boards there, which I identified as mine from their size, thickness, and quality—I also found this board marked "25 by 30, N. B." thrust into the centre of a bundle, it was originally an outer board, and the bundles were altered into 1/2 cwts.—that was the only marked board I found, all the other marks had been removed—on 20th November I went to a person named Balls, 148, Green Street, and there found about 7 cwt. of boards, which I identified as mine—they were part of a lot I had sent to the prisoners on 3rd November, and part of another lot—they are covered with paper—on the same day I went to a person named Cole, at 4, Royston Street, and there found about 1 1/2 cwt. belonging to me—I knew them from the marks, the size, thickness, and quality—the marks were not removed from those—the quantities I have mentioned are lying at the police-station—the police have portions of them here—the value of the boards, after the white paper was pasted on both sides, would be 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cwt.—that is my wholesale price—about 1 1/2 cwt. of the quantity I traced is lined on both sides—that was found at Balls'—I gave the prisoners in custody on the evening of 19th November—I had never seen Hopkins at work at Clark's workshop.</p>

GRIFFITHS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you a large warehouse in Thames Street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it is not large—my principal stock is kept at the wharf—I don't employ any men at the warehouse, only one clerk, nor at the wharf, that is the wharfinger's affair, not mine—the mark on these boards is placed on them abroad—I buy them in Prussia, of Messrs. J. Kammeran—they are the manufacturers—I dare say they make millions of these boards—I am not the only person who deals with them—I don't know how many do; quite a dozen, I should think, at any rate, or more—they would not all have the same mark—nearly every importer has his own mark—this particular lot I bought at the wharf—they were marked "N. B. 12"—the "N. B." merely designates the particular parcel, and "12" means the number of ounces to the sheet—other parcels might have the same mark—it is a private mark of the manufacturer, not mine—there was a lot there marked "N. B. 12," which I did not buy—Clark used to work for a Mr. Pound, a packing-case maker, but he left there some time ago—I called there on 19th November, and the principal clerk told me he had not been to work for ten days—the last lot of boards I sent to Clark was on 3rd November, and the last lot of paper on 16th November—he was not working for Pound then, he had left long before that—I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per ream—I can't say what I paid him in July, I have no entry of it—I have not entered all these amounts in the book, I did not think it necessary—the entry on 1st October, is 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., signed "Settled" by Mrs. Clark—she did not say that any money was due to her then—that was a full settlement of the account to that date—I gave it her in cash—they did not offer me an account on 16th November, I swear that—I have received no account from</p>

               <p>them—I did not tear it up and say I would not pay anything until the goods they had were returned—I saw a copy of account attached to the summons on the 24th, when they sued me—they certainly did not tell me on 16th November that I owed them 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and that they gave me credit for my cheque for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., leaving a balance due to them of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and if I did not pay it they would not return my goods, but would sue me in the Court—they never said anything of the sort—they did sue me four days after I gave them into custody, on the 24th, before Mr. Commissioner Kerr—he referred it to Mr. Buchanan—I don't know that Mr. Buchanan made an award—I did not take up the award—there was no award—I don't know that his decision was not in my favour; I swear that—I gave the prisoners into custody on the 19th—I did not receive the summons till midday on the 24th—it was dated the 18th—I gave them this cheque on 6th November—it was more than I owed them at the time—that cheque was not dis<lb/>honoured—the bankers did not pay it—they referred it to me, because it was not presented till long afterwards—I had plenty of money at the bank to pay it, and here is my pass-book, if you wish to look at it—Mrs. Clark has applied to me for money on a great many occasions, and I have fre<lb/>quently advanced her over and above what I owed her—she has not com<lb/>plained to me that I have not paid her in full, the facts are the other way—a man named Tilley worked for me—he has not complained that I did not pay him his account—he owes me an account now—he has kept back some of my boards—he does not work for me now.</p>

I live at Princes Street, Drury Lane, and am a carpenter—on Monday night, 22nd November, I was at the Black Boy and Apple Tree, in St. Martin's Lane, between 10 and 11 o'clock—I saw the prisoner in the parlour when I went in—I knew the deceased Mr. Home for some years—I did not notice him there—ho was not in the parlour—when I came out of the parlour it was a little before 12 o'clock, and I saw Mr. Horne sitting in the snug facing the bar—I was going out, and had to pass through the snug—he was sitting on a little barrel—he was a man about 5 ft. 6 in., or something of that sort, and rather stout—I have known him eight or ten years, and I never knew him to have a day's illness—I never knew a man with a better disposition—I had a little conversation with him as I came out—Mr. Fraser come out of the parlour, and called him some names two or three times—the deceased replied in something which was foreign to me—French or something, I did not un<lb/>derstand it—Frazer then went out, and shortly he came in again, and made a rush towards Horne—I got up, and said, "What is all this about, you are looking very white; what makes you look so white"—he said, "I am always white when I am in a passion"—I said, "You put me in mind of Scotch hares"—he pulled his coat off and wanted to fight me—I said, "I don't mind just a round with you," and Mr. Baird got hold of me, and I was put out into the court—I went home, and saw no more—the prisoner is about the same height as I am.</p>

               <p>deceased, John William Horne, was my only son—he would have been forty-two the day after Christmas-day—up to the 22nd November he had excel<lb/>lent health—I saw him on that morning having his breakfast—he was in his usual health then—he was about 5 ft. 2 in.—I went to bed on the Monday night, a little before 12 o'clock—a candle was left in the passage for him—it was not lighted—we have a lamp in the passage—the deceased had a latch-key—I heard him come home—my bed is close to the wainscot, and I heard him come up stairs—he usually left his boots at the bottom of the stairs, so as not to disturb me, but that night he went up with hit boots on—he seemed to go up heavily—I did not hear him fall—I should have heard it if he had fallen—the servant came up to me next morning, about 9 o'clock—I went down to the kitchen, and saw him sitting in the fender—it was a fire-guard, about 18 in. high—I said, "John, what is the matter?—he made me no answer whatever—I tried to unfasten the collar of his shirt, and he pushed my hand away—I was afraid he would put it on the oven, and I told the servant to put a chair for him to rest his hand upon—he put his hand on the chair, and she and I helped him up on his feet—there was a Are in the grate—his waistcoat was burnt—he had two stock<lb/>ings on one foot, and none on the other, and no boots or shoes—he was sitting upright in the fender when I saw him—my daughter and the servant had then pulled the fender about 2 ft. from the fire—I had no idea that he had burnt himself in any way—as soon as he was on his feet he walked out of the kitchen—when he got to the top of the stairs, I said, "Don't attempt to go up stairs, for you will fall"—he went on up stairs—the servant put her hand on his back, and went up with him—the servant said something to me at dinner-time, and I went up stairs and found him in a fit—the doctor came on Tuesday, about 7 o'clock—he died about 7 o'clock on the Thursday morning—he never spoke at all—I heard nothing of a fall, or any injury received by him in the house—his room was a very small one—my impression was that his jaw was locked.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at 20, New Street, Spring Gardens—on the afternoon of Tuesday, 23rd November, I was called to 19, Leicester Square—I saw the deceased, Mr. Horne, there—he was up stairs in the top room—he was insensible—I continued to attend him to the time of his death—he died on Thursday morning, at 7 o'clock—he was not sensible the whole time—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination on the Saturday—there were several extensive bruises on the body, externally; on the head and neck, the front of the chest, and on each side of the trunk, from the arm-pit to the hip; the scrotum was very much enlarged and blackened, especially on the left side; upon taking off the scalp there was a large extravasated patch of effused blood at the left side of the crown of the head; I then took off the skull cap, and corresponding with that patch was a large clot of blood about the size of my fist, extending into the sub<lb/>stance of the brain itself; the surface of the brain was in a state of congestion, and upon moving the brain I found a fracture at the base of the skull, at the right hand side; the length of the fracture was about three inches and a half; I found quite sufficient to account for his death and insensibility, and to confirm me in saying the wounds were inflicted with violence; I found a fracture of the fifth and sixth ribs on the left side; there was blood in the pleura, but that was from the injuries received—the actual cause of death was pressure on the brain, caused by the clot of blood—I have heard the evidence as to the blows, and I consider that death was consistent with that evidence—the injuries would result from the blows which I have heard of—I looked on the injury to the head as a counter fracture, that the blow was on the left, and the fracture on the right—the evidence is not incon<lb/>sistent</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186912130047"/>
               <p>with that—sometimes the fracture occurs at the same spot where the blow is given.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You can't say whether that was caused by a blow, or from the fall; is that so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that is so—a counter fracture is not an unusual thing—it is more likely to happen from a fall than from a blow with a hard instrument—I have no doubt that this fracture was caused by a fall, but with violence, not by a fall itself—it must have been accompanied by violence—a man falling violently on the back of his head on a hard substance might occasion a fracture at the base of the skull—there is no external mark at that part at all.</p>

I have read the article on "Sir Joseph Soratohawley"—I understood it to refer to Sir Joseph Hawley—I have heard the terms, "milking," and so on; they imply swindling—there was nothing in the least irregular in scratching these two horses; it was quite a proper thing to do, and quite in accordance with the rules of the Jockey Club, and the practice of honourable men.</p>

               <p>kind of scratching that would be dishonourable, and which would be called, in <hi rend="italic">slang</hi>, "milking"—if that is not done it is quite honourable to with<lb/>draw a horse at any time before the race; for instance, a man may have three horses in a handicap; he has a right to elect which of the three he runs; perhaps he would not run them till three or four days before the race, and then he selects one, and scratches the others.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Defendant.

There was nothing irregular or improper, or anything contrary to the laws of the turf, in the entry of three horses for the Liverpool Handicap, and scratching two of them—by the terms "milking" a horse, I understand anybody who beta against a horse over which he has the control, and then scratching it; that would be considered a most dishonourable and dishonest action.</p>

               <p>"Representative Sportsmen. Sir Joseph Scratchawley. Numerous as have been the occasions on which we have pointed a moral or adorned a tale by a reference to some bright example (unhappily rare) of nobility and upright<lb/>ness, of honesty, straightforwardness, and sportsmanlike conduct, thank God we have never been invariably betrayed into citing the name of Sir Joseph Scratchawley. Life on the Turf is proverbially one of ups and downs. Its losses, as a rule, for exceed its gains, and if, therefore, little men or needy ones descend occasionally to rascalities, and milk, and rope, and cheat, and lie, and thieve their way to winning a handicap now and then, it is greatly to be deplored, but scarcely to be wondered at. What can then he said for the spoilt darling of the Turf, the Little Jack Horner of the racing world, who has not only put in his thumb and pulled out out plum, but has had a whole grocer's shop full of plums fall to his share, and yet tries all he can to bespatter his ancient name before, in the course of nature, he is compelled to resign his seat in the Jockey Club, and his place</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186912130051"/>
               <p>in the Stewards' Stand, to a better man. Sir Joseph Scratchawley has had the good fortune to win four Derbies, a St Leger, the Guineas, and other races too numerous to mention; but, as we said before, comprising among them all, the prizes that can make a turf life worth living for. He might, if he chose, get drunk every night of the year out of a different cup won by the representatives of his stable, and yet his soul craves for something more. He already loathes the fleshpots of Egypt; the noble ambition of carrying off a coveted prize, or of leading back to the scales the winner of the Blue Riband amid the acclamations of thousands, begins already to pale upon his satiated palate, and he casts a longing eye on the gate-money, milk-cans, and the corpses of the boiled, the stiff, and the dead, that taint the atmosphere of the ring. 'Quem Deus vult perdere dement at.' One cannot but foresee the illustration of the proverb in this instance, and moralists will doubtless ascribe it, as they always do, to the demoralizing effects of equine upon human nature when<lb/>ever they are brought into close connection with each other. Among other eccentricities of popular opinion, there is no jacket among the 'silks and satins of the turf' that the public more eagerly support, or for which they more vehemently applaud a victory, than that of Sir Joseph Scratchawley. But the fiat has gone forth, and Sir Joseph has decreed that the confiding public shall no longer be permitted to have its own way—that the reliance they have heretofore placed on having from him a straight and honest run for their money shall be snapped like a bulrush. If they want an idol let them seek one elsewhere—for himself he has tried the square, and, on the whole, prefers the crooked—and, in fine, that he has taken for his motto, 'Emulous et scalptus,' and defies any one to say that it is not appropriate. The school to which the late Lord Glasgow and Lord Derby belonged is unhappily all but extinct, and it is the ambition of Sir Joseph Scratchawley to sever the last links that bind us to the traditions of the past in the new code of turf morals of which he desires to be the exponent. Although Dame Nature cannot he said to have been over prodigal to Sir Joseph in her gifts as regards figure and face—the latter especially being characterised by an exceedingly mean and crafty expression—Dame Fortune has amply made amends in bestowing upon him the possession of some of the noblest specimens of the equine race, alike as regards their beauty and their general superiority to the rest of their species, the exact opposite of their master. Matters prospered well at 'Lame'um Grange,' the breeding establishment of the wealthy baronet Derby winners begat Derby winners. The two-year-olds made havock among the Champagnes, Troys, Criterions, Woodootes, and Middle Parks; and the four-year-olds carried off their full share of cups and other important stakes. Who, therefore, can tell what demon cast his evil eye on the place, and caused Sir Joseph to become <hi rend="italic">ennuyed</hi> with so much success? Yet so it would appear to be, and so everyone judged to be the case who saw his wretched, discontented, scowling face, as he leaned with his chin on his stick in the Stewards' Stand, and almost cursed his good horse, 'Blackleg,' as he cantered home a Derby winner, because, forsooth, he had made a mistake and had backed the stable companions, while he had given the office to lay against the best horse of the present century. It is reserved till the Liverpool Cup to place the coping stone to this edifice of caping proceedings. On the appearance of the weights 'Swind<lb/>lerite' is voted the pick of the handicap, and, strong in their belief in the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186912130052"/>
               <p>old formula that Sir Joseph Scratchawley always goes straight and gives a run for your money, the public put down their coin, rush deliberately into the lion's jaws, and pour their money into the laps of those who have been 'put in to lay.' Those who love a good horse, however he may be weighted, back Blackleg at fair prices. Suddenly a suspicion begins to dawn, and the knowing ones get on Sir Joseph Scratchawley's lot, including 'Pickpocket,' and not a day too soon. The pails are full of Swindlerite and Blackleg milk, the market begins to be agitated, Pickpocket comes hot in the betting, and Swindlerite and Blackleg are scratched. Sir Joseph felt such epithets bestowed on him by the sporting press as 'fine sportsman,' 'straight-for<lb/>ward.' &amp;c., so totally underserved, that he henceforth took the resolution to prevent, if possible, any such misplaced approbation. Since that time, whenever any of his horses have been fairly handicapped, the public have been allowed to get well on them, and they have been scratched. We are sick of hearing the defenders of the Turf 'diary' tell us that a man can do as he likes with his own. He may do so, but he must take the con<lb/>sequences. If Sir Joseph Scratchawley knew that Pickpocket was the best of his lot, he ought to have scratched the others as soon as he arrived at that knowledge, and not have left them in, in order that Messrs. Saltfish and Bloater might operate against them. A man who practises these market movements, as they are termed, is like a man who runs wires throngh his hedges, or sets traps for the foxes. As far as any claim to the title of sportsman is concerned, they are in the same boat, and in that category we place Sir Joseph Scratchawley. The bloody hand on his escut<lb/>cheon is emblematic of the victims who have fallen, not in actual strife, but from the stab of the stable commissioner, and it will be many a long year before even the spurious popularity he once enjoyed will be restored to him. Before these lines appear, victory or defeat will once more have been declared for the Cherry and Black. We sincerely hope poetical justice will overtake the stable, and that as this is the culminating point of. Sir Joseph Scratchawley's frauds upon the public, so it may be the 'turn of the tide' of the fortune which has hitherto attended him, and which his grasping policy has converted from a blessing into a curse. Signed, Caustic,"—"Facts and Fancies, by 'The Favourite.' Siderolite's scratching for the Cup was one of the most barefaced cases of picking the public's pocket, that remember for a long time. While I hold that an owner has a right to strike out a horse <hi rend="italic">at once</hi>, if forestalled, he has no right to keep a horse first favourite for a week, and to strike him out after the milk-pails are full Blue Gown's case, Sir Joseph could not run him for the 2000 Guineas, on account of the large sums his commissioners had laid against him. Vagabond, in the City and Suburban, was another case. It is to be hoped the public will in future, see Sir Joeeph in his true colours."—" Racing, Past and Future, by 'Don John' Last week I remarked upon the absurdity of accepting 5 and 4 to 1 about Sir. Joseph Hawley's lot for this race, so long before the day, and my observations have been verified by the fact that 5 or 6 to 1 can at this moment be obtained without difficulty, against the solitary representative of the stable; Siderolite and Blue Gown having been shamelessly milked and scratched, without the slightest regard for the interests of the public"—(<hi rend="italic">The following paragraph, from the paper of</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th December, was also read</hi>: "The Scratchawley Libels.
