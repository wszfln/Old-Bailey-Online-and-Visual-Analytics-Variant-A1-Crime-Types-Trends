I traced the footsteps of a man out of the fold, to a field about one hundred yards off, where I found the skin of the sheep - I knew it by the mark. I traced the footsteps out of that field through two others - They lead in a direction towards the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far did you trace them towards the prisoner's house - A. Within a quarter of a mile of it. I compared the carcase with the skin, and it matched it. The bones fit the joints left in the skin exactly. I produce the skin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It was on a Wednesday, about eight o'clock in the morning - I saw them on the Saturday before. There are only the prisoner's house and another farm near the field. The sheep had been killed a very short time-the skin was warm, and not stiff.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went to the prisoner's house on the 16th of April, about four o'clock in the afternoon, and found him up stairs, in bed. I told him I had a warrant to search his house, read it to him, and proceeded to search. I went into the back room, and found a breast of mutton undressed, and very dirty. On searching further, I found the head in a pail of water, split open, and ready for dressing-it was not cut in a butcher-like manner. I searched the cupboard under the stairs, and found the remainder of the carcase, except the two loins and the fat of the entrails - I took them to the magistrate; they were matched into the skin. One shoulder had a piece out of it, which piece remained in the skin, and matched with it. I asked the prisoner for his shoes, to compare them with the footsteps in the field - He gave them to me without hesitation - They exactly fitted the footsteps.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not keep the shoes. I took them to the magistrate, and returned them to the prisoner.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181805060004"/>They were right and left shoes, and had a few nails in them. There were nails in the impression.</p>

The young man told him his shoes were in the field the overnight, the prisoner said they were not. Soon after that the prisoner looked at me, and said, "Mr. Cane, it is not your sheep." I said it was not mine, but my kinsman's. We searched the house in consequence of information.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not search other houses - A. Yes - They were not near the prisoner's. I had observed the footsteps lead towards the prisoner's house. The entrails were left in the skin. The prisoner did not say he bought the meat.</p>

I took the prisoner to the watch-house. Four skeleton keys were found upon him. I returned to the shop, and found a bag with two waistcoats in it-the bag did not belong to me.

As I returned the prisoner came and held me while the other took a watch-case out of my pocket, and held it up to the prisoner - They both ran off; I pursued, but lost them. On Sunday evening, the 26th of April, I saw them again in Smithfield; my brother took the prisoner. I am sure he is the boy who held me. The watch-case has not been found.</p>

A man of the name of Williams first came up to me; my apron was tucked up over my watch. He asked a man if he wanted any thing? and said if he did, he would punch him in the mouth. I thought I would get out of the mob, but they all surrounded me, with several others. Williams seized my left arm, and Major seized me round the waist, while the others kept shoving me about. Greenfield struck me. I put my hand over my watch and money in my trowsers. At that time I felt it go from me, and called<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181805060006"/>out, "Let me go, Major!" I felt a hand in my pocket. One of them squeezed me in a certain part, by which means they got a half-crown. I called for assistance, and was dragged into a cart by the people - I then lost my senses. When I recovered I saw Major, Greenfield, and Williams, in the crowd. I remained there for two hours, till the bull-bait was over, being fearful I should be molested before I got out of the field; I then gave Gillmore information-the prisoners were afterwards taken. Major and Greenfield robbed me. I do not know that the others did any thing.</p>

The people pulled the prosecutor into the cart-the gang called out, "Turn it over!" the prosecutor then said he had lost his watch: he was afterwards insensible. The gang did not leave the field. The prosecutor remained in the cart for two hours; he said he was afraid to go - He could hardly walk. He went away with a man named Judd.</p>

I went there on the Tuesday about three or four o'clock - We came home about nine o'clock in the evening. I left my father at home.

            . I am a constable of St. Dunstan's in the West. On the 4th of April, about a quarter before six o'clock in the morning, Davis and I were standing by St. Dunstan's church, and saw the prisoner coming with the coach-glasses, wrapped in an apron, under his arm. I asked him where he was going with them? he said he received them from a coachman of the name of Oakley, at Mr. Goulder's, Swan-yard, Knightsbridge, and was taking them to Mr. Windus, the coachmaker, in Bishopsgate-street. I told him I must detain him and the property until I was satisfied. He said he did not know to whom the glasses belonged; that he received them the night before, but being futigued he could not carry them that night, but kept them till the morning. We went to Swanyard - They knew nothing of them or the prisoner. While we were there a man came and claimed them.</p>

Scott, to know how Mrs. Scott was, and offering to set up with her. She brought me word that they would expect me to sit up the next evening. On the 3d of April I asked her if she was afraid to be left alone in the house? she said she would rather be alone than have any person with her. About half-past nine o'clock at night I left home, leaving her in the house, with a strict injunction not to leave it; she said she would not. When I arrived at Col. Scott's, which is in Coburg-place, Brunswick-square, the Colonel was surprised to see me, and said he had sent a verbal message by the servant, to say he should feel obliged by my spending as much time with Mrs. S. as possible, but would not trouble me to sit up. I immediately returned home, suspecting all was not right. I rang the bell for nearly a quarter of an hour; at last the prisoner put up my bed-room window, and asked who was there? I said it was me. About five minutes elapsed before she opened the door. I asked her if she was gone to bed when I first came to the door? she said she was. When she opened the door she was dressed. She said she did not hear me at first. I went into the parlour, and instead of finding it as I had left it, I found a large fire, and the table spread with all the provisions that were in the house. I searched my own and her bed-room, and found no person there. I searched the garrets. When I came to the third garret I found somebody inside resisting my opening the door. I called out; she came up from the kitchen. I threw the door open, and found a man there. I asked him what business he had there? he said he meant no harm. I told him it was improper for him to be there - He said he was the girl's sweetheart, and had known her many years. I said that was impossible, for she had only lived a fortnight with me. I told him that finding him in that improper situation I insisted on giving him in charge. The prisoner said he had lived fellow-servant with her for three years. I insisted on giving him in charge. He instantly seized me by the throat, and attempted to throw me on the floor; he said he would not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181805060008"/>be exposed. He attempted to get down; I got before him just by the street-door, and told him not to make any disturbance, for I insisted on giving him in charge. He seized me again, prevented my calling out, and made his escape. I followed him along Newgate-street - two officers secured him, and took him to the Compter; they then fetched the prisoner there, and found the articles stated in the indictment in her pocket. The key of a drawer, in which I keep property of great value, was found in her box. The man was discharged by the magistrate.</p>

The cork belongs to the decanters-they were not on the table, but on the sideboard. The table appeared to be disturbed, as if the things had been moved in a hurry. The pantry door was wide open.</p>

            . I am a painter and glazier. On the 9th of April I had some business in Rutland-place, Upper Thames-street. As I returned I saw three men and five women together by <placeName id="t18180506-12-crimeloc68">Puddle Dock</placeName>

Two of them immediately separated from the others and followed him - They passed me on the opposite side of the way. I saw one of the prisoner turn round and beckon to the other six at Puddle Dock - They came up very near to them. I followed them on the other side of the way. When they came a little further on, I saw the prisoner, Birch, open the prosecutor's pocket with his left hand, and take the handkerchief out with his right hand-the other was covering him. I instantly crossed over, and followed Birch. I called to the gentleman, to know if he had lost any thing. At that moment one of the prisoners dropped the handkerchief on my foot; the gentleman turned round, and said he had been robbed of his handkerchief and claimed it; the others immediately joined. A scuffle ensued. I got the prisoners into a public-house, and secured them both. My coat was torn off my back before I could get an officer - I am sure Marrs was one of them. While I was getting them into a public-house the gentleman went away.</p>

            . I am a shopman to the prosecutors. The prisoner was porter to Mr. Gordon, who is our bookbinder. On the 11th of April he brought home a load of bound books; he was waiting for more work; I stooped below the counter to get him some sheets - He asked to go several times, but was desired to stop for more work, and in the interim I communicated my suspicions to one of the partners - He was desired to walk up stairs, where he was accused with taking books off the counter, which he at first denied, but afterwards confessed it. I was sent down for his bag, and found it contained the sheets he had to take back to bind, and four bound books, three of which he had brought home that day from his master-the other was taken off the counter. He was given in charge.</p>

On the 22d of March (Easter Sunday), I and my husband were returning from Finchley in a one-horse chaise; about seven o'clock in the evening we were stopped in <placeName id="t18180506-19-crimeloc105">the New Cut, by the Highgate-archway</placeName>

We were stopped by two men, but I did not see them until they had hold of the horse - I had an umbrella before me which prevented my seeing their faces then; they said, "Stop! your money or your brains, in a moment." They repeated this twice. I got up and gave them what money I had, which was about ten shillings-part of it was in shillings; they did not ask me for mine, but I got up and gave it to them. My husband gave what he had. The man who was at the head of the horse said,"Your watch! your watch! or your brains, in a moment." He held his hat for it, and my husband put his watch into it. They then turned the horse round, and desired us to go back the other road, or they would blow our brains out immediately.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see either of them, so as to know them again - A. I noticed the man who stood at the horse's head the most. The prisoner, Miller, is the man; I have no doubt whatever of it. It was between dark and light, the moon was not up. He stood on the London side of me - I was on the left side of the chaise. I forgot to mention, that when they turned the horse round, one got on one side and the other on the other, and turned my husband's pockets out; I then had a better opportunity of seeing the man who was on my side. I saw him again a fortnight afterwards at Hatton-garden. My husband had seen them before me.</p>

            . I am the husband of the last witness. On the 22d of March I was coming home - I was not at all in liquor - I had been spending the Sunday at Finchley, and was stopped on the highway, as my wife has described. The men were full three minutes at the chaise</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you, during that time, an opportunity of seeing the face of either of them - A. I did not see the man at the horse's head-there was no light to assist my seeing them. I saw the other man - He held a pistol to my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181805060010"/>head, and spoke repeatedly to me. I gave a description of him at Bow-street the next day. I was on the right side of the chaise; he was on that side, either on the step or the wheel-his face was rather towards London. I saw him again on the 17th of April, in custody with two other men at Hatton-garden. Hearing there were two men in custody, I went there to see if I could identify either of the men who robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you enabled to say whether either of the prisoners is one of them - A. Fernandi is the man who was by my side; I dropped my watch into his hat. I have not the least doubt of his being the man. He spoke rather thick while he was in custody-his voice corresponded exactly.</p>

               <p>COURT. If you have any doubt say so - A. I have not the least.</p>
               <p>FERNANDI. Q. Did you not say, when the officer brought me out, that I held the horse's head - A. No. It was seven o'clock; I did not tell the magistrate it was nine.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards said I stepped up to the chaise, and the other man held the horse, and that you called to the men, and said, "If you are honourable you should return the watch" - A. No; when the men turned the chaise round, I looked back and said, "If you behave honourably, and bring the watch back to me to-morrow, I will give you the value of it," and told the magistrate so. I gave you my name and address when you robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. How many men stopped you - A. Two jumped out of the lane. I did not say there was another man behind the chaise.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you give him first - A. Three shillings. The man then stepped off the chaise. The man at the horse's head then called out, "His watch!" The same man then came to me again, and I put my watch into his hat, they then stepped off. I said, "I may go now" - They called out, "No, no; you must turn round." They turned me round, and then the same man jumped up on my side, and rifled my pockets-the other man got up on the other side. Miller is about the size of the other man. I can neither say that he is or is not the man; he is very much like him in every respect. I never found my watch.</p>

            . I am an officer. I received information of the robbery, and took Miller. He came to the office and said he was a witness for some men who were in custody for stealing lead. I turned him out of the office. It then struck me that he answered the description I had received, and took him into custody. Fernandi was one of the men I saw him talking with.</p>
               <p>FERNANDI'S Defence. Is it possible that two or three highwayman, after robbing the prosecutrix, would stand bargaining about the watch? He says they were not with him above two or three minutes-it must have taken five minutes. I declare to God I am innocent; he would swear to anybody. He said I stopped the horse, and the other man robbed him-who is to believe their stories? Limbrick persuaded the prosecutor and prosecutrix to swear we were the men, right or wrong, at the office. Read noticed it, and blamed him for it.</p>
               <p>MILLER'S Defence. I went to the office to see a man. Limbrick turned me out; he then said I was a highwayman. Read said he was sorry for us, as Limbrick had persuaded them to swear to us, right or wrong.</p>

               <p>ESTHER MEVER. Miller lodged with us. He was at home on Easter Sunday all day - He dined at home. He went out after dinner, returned in half an hour, and drank tea at home; he stopped at home the remainder of the afternoon - We supped about eight o'clock. We had table-beer at supper, which I fetched - I always fetch it.</p>

On the 1st of May, about a quarter before nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came into the shop with another person, who asked to look at some silk handkerchiefs-the prisoner stood behind the other man, towards the door, and spoke to him. None of the handkerchiefs would suit. The prisoner said, "Buy a cotton one" - I took some down; they would not suit. The prisoner then went out; the other bought nothing, and did not remain above a minute after the prisoner. I heard a neighbour call out, "Mr. Connelly, you are robbed!" Mr. Connelly went out, and brought the prisoner back-there had been no other persons in the shop. I missed a piece of four-quarter Irish linen, worth 4l. 7s. 6d. - it cost my master that. The prisoner was close to the pile on which it stood. I had occasion to go behind the pile, and could not see what was going forward.</p>

The prisoner came to the door, and gave him a roll of linen from under his coat - I and my man ran out and followed them. I saw the prisoner running, and never lost sight of him until my man took him-the other man escaped with the property. I am sure the prisoner is the man. I did not see him until he came to the door with the linen.</p>

I found my horse in Mr. Watts's yard, Maiden-lane, Battle-bridge, the same day that I lost it, and am sure it was mine - I claimed it; it was killed-the foot is preserved, which enables me to swear to it (looking at the foot) - I know it by a particular shoe, which I had put on it because it was lame - I knew the horse as soon as I saw it.

The prisoner then turned back, went into Mr. Hare's warehouse, came out with a roll of carpet under his arm, and turned up the other way, towards Abchurch-lane-the other man followed him. I went into the warehouse, and told the porter - He went after him, and brought him back without the carpet. I am sure he is the man who brought the carpet out of the warehouse.</p>

On the 21st of April, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I went to Fore-street; on my return I went up stairs. When I got half way up, I heard some person in my bed-room - I thought I had not left the key in the door - I felt, and found it in my pocket. I looked up, and saw a woman at the door; I asked her what she wanted? she said she had been to the shoemaker's in the garret to get her shoe mended. I told her I had no lodgers in my house, and suspected she had robbed me. She put her hands on my stomach, and tried to throw me down stairs - I caught hold of the banisters with one hand, held her petticoats with the other, and called my husband, who came to my assistance and took her.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she get in - A. With a false key - I saw it in the door. She had moved the cash-box and another box off the drawers, close by the door, ready to take away.</p>

I had moved the boxes out of the cupboard on to the drawers between ten and eleven o'clock - I am sure I did not put them behind the door. The prisoner was locking the door when I caught her. I could see the marks of her feet in the room, which had been cleaned that day.</p>

            . I live in Pemberton-row. I heard the cry, ran out, and saw the prisoner - Mr. Ellis said he had robbed him; we took him to the Compter. He wanted to go through several bye places. At the corner of Newgate-street he kept looking behind; he then said,"I will not go." The gang came up, and tried to rescue him-Reeve was knocked down. We got him to the Compter with difficulty. I was struck.</p>

Ten days before the day stated in the indictment, he came to the sacristy, and spoke to an English chaplain of the chapel. On Sunday, the 1st of March, the prisoner presented himself at the altar of the chapel to receive the sacrament. I conceived him not fit to receive it, and so I passed him over, as I thought him mentally deranged. I could not have refused it if I had not been confident of his derangement. I said nothing to him, I only passed him by. Immediately as mass was over, he came into the vestry, and asked me why I refused him the sacrament? I told him I had no intention to affront him, but that I considered him under mental derangement, and if he would give me the name under of his confessor, I would speak to him, and that if he said he was fit to receive it, I would give it to him immediately, and make any apology he wished. He did not appear satisfied, but went out quietly. I saw nothing of him until Sunday, the 15th of March, about eight o'clock. After I had blessed the palm, and at the end of it was going to pateronster, I heard a little noise, but did not notice it-my back was toward the congregation. I heard a shriek, turned round, and saw the prisoner getting over the communion railing just by me, with a double-edged sword. I jumped over to the vestry - He followed, and gave me a stab, which cut my vestment. I went to the door, and tried to push it too - He put his feet between the door, and prevented my shutting it. He tried to stab me. I struck the sword, it cut my arm - He passed it to me and cut my arm. At that time I grasped the sword - He cut five of my fingers in struggling for it. In two minutes about thirty of the congregation secured him.</p>

            . I am a bookseller, and live in Foley-place. On the 18th of March, about eight o'clock, I was at the chapel. I saw the prisoner enter with a drawn sword in his hand - He advanced to the middle of the chapel; the women screamed out. When he got to the railing of the altar, Mr. Mathias turned his head and jumped from the altar to the vestry door. The prisoner got over the railing, and struck Mr. Mathias with the sword - I saw him put his sword between the door and the post. I ran to the vestry, and found Mr. Mathias bleeding in both hands. Several people seized the prisoner, and took him to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did your Lordship observe who fired the pistol - A. I did not. I felt that I was wounded in the back - I went up to the office, and sent for a surgeon.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your Lordship know the prisoner - A. I know him by seeing him at Queen-square, when I was examined on this charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BROADRIB. Q. Did not your Lordship know that he was returned in a state of insanity - A. A lieutenant of that name in the 62d. regiment, was returned to me as insane in the beginning of the year 1816. I saw no pistol presented at me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181805060017"/>Q. If the pistol had been loaded with powder and ball must it not have gone through your Lordship's body - A. If it had taken a right direction. The distance between me and the person who fired must have been very inconsiderable. It struck about the middle of my back-it only grazed my back. It depended upon the direction in which the pistol was presented whether it would go through my body. I continued to ascend the steps, without assistance. When the surgeon came I was engaged, and desired him to stop a short time before he examined the wound. I received a severe confusion, from which I recovered in about a week.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Can your Lordship ascertain what direction the ball took - A. I believe it was fired obliquely, as it did not go through my body; it only perforated my clothes and grazed the skin. I did not see in what direction the pistol was fired. It made a considerable hole in my coat, a smaller in my waistcoat, and penetrated my braces and shirt.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Can your Lordship say whether the pistol was loaded with a bullet - A. From the appearance of my clothes I conceive it must have been.</p>

             was with me. I saw Lord Palmerstone come in. There is a door with a glass window, which looks on the staircase. I went out of the room to look after his Lordship, and immediately saw a flash of fire on the wall of the stairs, and heard the report of a pistol. I heard Lord Palmerstone give a heavy groan. I rushed forward, and caught the prisoner in the back part of his arms - He was retreating, apparently from the second step of the stairs from the ground, and exclaimed with an air,"I have killed him!" He had a sort of grin on his countenance-the pistol was in his right hand. I caught his arm; he turned round with an air, and said, "You know me, and know my wrongs." I told him I did not, and asked him who he was, and what he had done? he immediately exclaimed,"Is not that Lord Palmerstone?" pointing towards the stairs, in the direction his Lordship had gone. I told him it was him. He immediately exclaimed,"I have shot him!" or "I have killed him!" I do not know which - I sent for a surgeon. I held the prisoner, sat him on a bench in the passage, and kept hold of his arms; he let the pistol fall at my feet, and I took it up-the barrel was then very warm, as if it had been recently fired. I took him into the next room, and asked him if he had another pistol? he said,"No, upon my honour" - He was sent to Tothil-fields. I produce the pistol-it is a screw one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was talking to Colonel

            . The window in the door is about two feet six inches wide. I did not see the prisoner until immediately after the flash. There was no other person near - He was then near enough to touch him. His Lordship goes up stairs very quick - He might have turned round. I do not remember seeing the prisoner before. I believe there was no other person on the stairs. He did not endeavour to escape - I was so near him he could not.</p>

On the 8th of April I went to Lord Palmerstone's office, and waited to see him-his Lordship entered soon after me; I stood immediately opposite the window, and saw the shadow of some person pass, just as his Lordship entered; at that moment I heard the report of a pistol. Owens rushed out, and I after him-Lord Palmerstone had then got to the top of the stairs - I heard him on the stairs, I did not see him; I heard his Lordship call out. I left the prisoner in Owens' custody, ran up, saw his Lordship enter his room, and order a surgeon to be sent for.

            , ESQ. I was called in to see his Lordship. I arrived there at twenty minutes after one o'clock, and found his Lordship writing - He begged me to take a chair till he had finished; he sealed and directed the letter. I then proceeded to examine. There was a hole in his coat, a smaller one in his waistcoat, one of his braces and his shirt were torn. There was a bruise on the right side of his back-bone, about as large as the extremity of my little finger; it was surrounded by the appearance of a larger bruise, about the size of a half-crown. I could not at first positively decide whether there was a wound or a severe contusion, or whether the ball had entered or not. Upon further examination I found it was only a contusion.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you suppose occasioned it - A. I am decidedly of opinion that the smaller bruise proceeded from a ball.</p>

I told him my master was not at home and I could not tell him. He said he wanted six dozen to take abroad to sell - He went out; he had been to the shop before.

I put the things on the counter, the woman received them of me, and said I was to fetch the bacon which she had looked at. She looked at the things, and asked for the bill, which I gave her - She said I was to fetch the bacon; I left the things. My order was not to leave the goods without the money.

I searched him, and found a pocket-book in his breeches-pocket, containing two good 1l. notes, half a guinea, and some silver; in his other breeches-pocket I found a small bag and a purse - I put them into a hat which was on the table; the prisoner made a rush and threw the hat off, Warwick picked it up - He could not seize them. The bag contained three 1l. notes, which I gave to Warwick, after marking them-(looking at three)-these are them; they were new and had never been in circulation. I told him they were forged, and asked him where he got them? he said he knew nothing of them, and they were not his. When he returned from the magistrate, he said if he could be permitted to go at large, he would assist in detecting the person who had supplied him with the notes, and who had been the means of bringing all his family into the situation they were in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. He said he bought them of a dealer in forged notes. His mother had pleaded guilty to this offence a short time before.</p>

Rawlings secured him, and took him to the watch-house. The lead was afterwards fitted to the sink. I am sure the prisoner is the man. The door was left open.</p>

I found two bags hanging under his apron, one of which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181805060024"/>contained two bad shillings, and the other eight bad sixpences.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 24th of April I was in Holborn about nine o'clock-it rained fast. I saw the prisoner following the prosecutor very close, until he came to Featherstone-buildings; the prisoner, Miller, then went up to him, raised the handkerchief about an inch out of his pocket, and fell back-they talked together. Parton then went up to the prosecutor, took the handkerchief out, and turned towards Eagle-street - I ran up. Just before I got to him he threw the handkerchief away. I laid hold of him, brought him back, and found the handkerchief in the road, where he threw it down. Forbes, who was with me, took Miller. I found another handkerchief concealed in Miller's breeches.</p>

I told him he might go and lay down, and if they began to work I would call him. He went down to the fore-scuttle; he could get to the coffee-bags there - They were all safe before he went down. He staid there about half an hour, then came up, and went over the ship to the Berwick, which laid about five ships off. About six o'clock I saw him again coming ashore. Leckey told him to be sure and return by six o'clock in the morning-Leckey was come to relieve him. I noticed to Leckey that his coat pockets knocked against his legs, as if something was in them-Leckey followed him. I had seen the bags all safe half an hour before he went down. The hatches were all locked-no person went down but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>ROBERT LECKEY. On the 20th of April I was extra excise watchman, and was put on board the Bainbridge, which laid opposite Alderman's Wharf. The prisoner and I were to relieve each other - I watched at night and he by day. I first went on board on the 18th; there were 500 bags of coffee on board, which were stowed fore and aft in the main hold. About a quarter before six o'clock I went to relieve the prisoner. In consequence of what Cole said, I followed him through Ratcliff-highway, and saw some coffee drop out of his hat as he walked. His grent-coat pockets were bulky - I overtook him. We went into a public-house together, and I sent for an officer, who<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181805060025"/>found coffee in his hat and coat pockets. He begged forgiveness, and said it was his first offence.</p>

On the 18th of April, I was calling five o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoner lurking about Frances-street; I suspected him. I called the hour twice round Thorhnaugh-street, returned to Frances-street, and missed him; I went in search of him, and found him coming out of Frances-place, with the property on his back. I said, "Is this the way you conceal things until the watchmen are gone off duty?" he said he was going to take them to a broker to have them repaired. The wash-hand stand being broken, I thought it might be as he said, and told him I would go with him to the shop. He staid at the door while I rang the bell twice; as I rang it a third time he ran away. I pursued, and took him, with assistance, in Montague-market. I never lost sight of him.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Sunday, the 26th of April, I apprehended the prisoner, Smith - I neither threatened or promised him. I told him it was a sin to rob a poor widow. He said he should never have thought of robbing Mrs. Savage, if it had not been for Holland. I took him to Hatton-garden, and then went and took Holland at Mrs. Savage's house, and told him what Smith had said; he denied it at first, but afterwards said Smith got in at the window, and that he was very drunk, or he should not have done it. I asked Smith what he had done with the money? he said he had bought a new hat and two pair of stockings; and that Holland bought a snuff-coloured coat with his money. On the Monday following I examined the place, and saw footsteps in the garden, and in the chair under the window. I went to the House of Correction and got Smith's shoe, which fitted to the marks in the garden and on the chair-there was a mark where a piece had come off the toe, and had been mended, I could see that mark in particular. Smith said that Holland stooped down, that he got on his back, and got in at the window. They both told where they sold the property. I went to the place, but found nothing.</p>

             re-examined. The 1l. note belonged to my brother Edward. On the Monday, when Limbrick was taking Holland to the office, I heard him say that he was very drunk, and he should not have done it if he had not been persuaded by Smith, and that they sold the things to a man in St. Giles's for 5l. I said, "You surely did not sell the five guineas?" he said, "I do not know what there was, I was so drunk."</p>
               <p>HOLLAND'S Defence. On the evening of the robbery I was at the Duke of York, public-house, Somers'-town - I came home about eleven o'clock-my wife told me I was suspected of the robbery. Next morning I was going for some porter, and met Smith in Hart-street; next night I heard he was taken. I was much agitated, hearing I was suspected. I might have escaped if I had liked. I was taken on Monday, and told Savage I was innocent.</p>

As he was helping me up again he must have drawn the watch out of my fob. I had my hands in my breeches pocket, and could not help myself - I did not suspect him at that time. He asked my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181805060028"/>pardon, which I willingly granted him; we wished each other a good night, bowed, and parted. He went one way and I the other. I went ten or twelve yards further, and missed my watch. I had seen no other person-he must be the man who took it. I looked round, but he was out of sight, and I thought it useless to pursue. On the 13th of April I was coming down Oxford-street, just below Stratford-place, and met him. There was a strong light from a cheesemonger's shop - I had a friend with me. I said he was very much like the man who took my watch. I went back, and walked by his side two or three yards - I was not certain that he was the man. I asked him how he was, and if he did not know me? he said, No. I said, "I think I know you; and if I am not mistaken, you are the person who took my watch the other night." At these words he said, "D-n it! if you will walk a little way I will settle it with you"- this convinced me that he was the man. I took hold of his arm; I suppose he thought I intended to walk with him, which I did for a few yards, till we met a watchman, I then gave him in charge-we took him to Marylebone watch-house - He then said that he knew where the watch was. He did not choose to tell where it was, but he had pledged it. He asked me to go to his friends, I refused. My watch was found at a pawnbroker's in Prince's-street.</p>

About a quarter of an hour after, he knocked at the prison-door, and asked if there was any person I could send for a friend of his? I told him there was not at that time. He then asked me what I thought of his case? I told him I thought it would go very hard with him. He then said he had taken the watch from the young man, and it was pledged at a pawnbroker's, of the name of Dobree, be believed, but did not rightly know the name. I asked him where the duplicate was? he said a person had got it, but he should decline telling who it was, as he did not wish him to know where he was. Next day I found the watch at Dogherty's, in Prince's-street, pledged in the name of Maclean. He said

Next morning, as we were going before the magistrate, Le Keux told me to say I did not know who robbed me, and he would get my handkerchief and return the money. He came into the room out of a loft.

About half-past one o'clock in the morning of the 16th of April, I was fetched to Sugarloaf-court, and saw the prosecutor lying down with his head against the door of the house - He said he had been robbed. I broke the door open, and found the prisoner, Le Keux in the loft-Dyer was in the top room. I asked her how much money she had? she said half a crown - I found that and 5s. more on her.</p>

On the 28th of April, about half-past eight o'clock- I was fastening my shutters, and saw the prisoner, Wynn, standing at the corner of my house; he was singing very loud, and appeared agitated, which made me suspect him. I turned the corner of the court, he then called out "Wooey!" quite loud. I ran up the court to Levene's house, as she was out. The prisoner, Bambridge, ran out with some linen under his arm - I knew him before; he dropped it at the door; I pursued, and caught him about the middle of the court, and asked him where he had been? he said, "Nowhere." I saw some linen in his hand, which was behind him, and took it from him. As I was taking him back to the house Murphy ran out with a load of linen, which he also dropped at the door. I took Bambridge to the watch-house. I knew Murphy before - He had a remarkable ragged coat on. They had a light in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181805060029"/>the house, which they extinguished when they ran out. As I returned from the watch-house, I was told he was at a public-house in Brick-lane- I went, and found him standing at the door- I am sure he is the man; I gave him in charge. I went to the house, and found they had broken the bolt off the shutters- it was quite dark.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I knew them both before. Bambridge had a candle in his hand, I saw his face. When I took Murphy, a gentleman said he had something about him; he immediately unbuttoned his coat, and threw out the table-cloth.</p>

            . I am the watch inspector. On the 29th of April I was going on duty, and met the prisoner, Wynn, and Gordon, who is not here, about a quarter before one o'clock in the morning. As they passed me I heard Gordon say to Wynn, "Hold your tongue!"-Wynn used a bad expression, which made me notice them. I turned back, and followed them to Paternoster-row, opposite Spitalfields church; I then heard Wynn say, "If we had had a little more patience we should have done the trick." I immediately took them both. Wynn said he lived at No. 15, White Lion-street - I found it was false.</p>

            . I am a timber-merchant, and live at No. 8, Mortimer-terrace. I came home about nine o'clock, Mr. Mensal gave me information - I staid there listening, and thought I heard something rattling. On coming out of my door, I saw somebody open the door of No. 7, and peep out. I then went and supped with Mr. Mensal. While we were at supper Segnier fetched us- we all went to the back of the terrace. We got some pistols, went on the top of No. 10, and got on the roofs of the houses. I found a large hole in the roof of No. 7. We returned, and went to the front of the house, and found the constable demanding admission, which was refused by persons within. I went to the back of my house to prevent their escaping behind. I heard them climbing over the palings to make their escape. I ran through my own house, gave information, and returned to the back again. One of them came running back and climbed over the paling into the garden of No. 7. I told him to stand, or I would blow his brains out- he ran into the house. I got over, tried the back-door, and called out that I would fire if they came out. Segnier and the constable came to my assistance. We broke the back-door open and got in. Meyers ran from the back-door into the front parlour; I followed, pushed the door open, and told him I would fire if he resisted- we secured him. I found John and

             called out, "For God's sake, what is the matter? here are only me and my brother." We secured them, opened the back-door, and let the witnesses in. I went down to the kitchen, and found the copper and range, which had been fixed, was removed. When we got to the upper floor we found a ladder under the trap-door, which communicated with the roof, and a great deal of dirt on the floor, as if something had been taken off the roof. I found a quantity of lead rolled up, and put in the fire-place of the front room- it was fresh cut; there were two or three hundred weight. We took the prisoners to the watch-house - We found Fernandi and Thomas White there.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live in Green-street. On the 2d of April, after nine o'clock at night, I was informed that some persons were stealing lead, I went through No. 10, got on the roof, and saw a person on the roof of No. 7, handing something down to the upper room. We came down, went to the door, and demanded admittance. Sarah White said that Meyers was not at home- that no person was at home but her, and she would not open the door. I went through Vizer's house, next door, to the back, which is close to the back-door of No. 7, and heard a scuffling over the palings which parted the gardens of the empty houses from No. 7. I went round to the back of the empty houses to No. 7, and heard somebody running before me. Vizer and I broke open the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181805060030"/>door; we found John and Sarah White in the passage- I found Meyers in the front parlour behind the door. I told him he appeared a very different character than when he came to my house two days before; he was then like a gentleman, but now he was like a plumber's labourer. He was dressed as a labouring man, and appeared to have been working very hard; his hands were very black, as if he had been getting lead off the roof. I found nineteen pieces of lead folded up in the fire-place of the upper room- it appeared to have been recently cut. There was a hole in the roof; the tiling had been taken off and the lafhs broken-the trap-door only goes into the cock-loft. I took Meyers to the watch-house - I found a false frill on him. He came to my house two days before, and said he had taken the house, No. 7, Mortimer-terrace, and a stable in Glocester-place, and wanted hay, straw, and corn. John White afterwards came with an order from him for hay and corn, and represented himself as his groom.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The girl would not let us in. I heard her voice. The people called to her from the top of the house to refuse admission.</p>

            . I keep a second-hand book-shop in Carnaby-market-the prisoner has sold me books three times. He said he had lived with a clergyman, and when he lost him he lost the best friend he had, and that he gave him the books. On the 4th of April he brought a quantity of books; having some suspicion, I paid him for them, and communicated my suspicions to Mr. Sewell, whose name was in a Watts's Hymn-book, which the prisoner sold me. Mr. Hunt, and another gentleman called on me on the Monday following. We agreed that I should stop the prisoner when he came again. On the Thursday he came, and I stopped him. I produce the books he sold me.</p>

A window had been opened by taking out a pane of glass, they then entered the chapel, and broke the vestry open in the same way - A great many books and other things were taken; they broke open a desk. I lost seven books out of the drawer in my pew- I had them safe on the Sunday. Rippon's Selection, which has been produced, belongs to me. I saw the chapel on the Friday night; it was not broken open then.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Whitechapel. On the 23d of April, about a quarter past ten o'clock at night, I came up with three men in French-street - each of them had a bundle; I attacked the last man, he dropped his bundle and escaped-the other two turned the corner. I sprang my rattle and pursued, calling Stop thief! I picked up another bundle at the corner of Halifax-street, the prisoner was taken in Halifax-street. He is not the man who escaped.</p>
               <p>JOHN COKELEY. I am a watchman of Spitalfields, which joins Whitechapel. I heard the rattle sprung, went to the corner of Halifax-street, and saw the prisoner with a bundle; he laid it down on a step. I pursued, calling Stop thief! A man who stood at a door, stopped him - He did not run above ten yards, and was not out of my sight. I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 6th of April, about twelve o'clock at night, I was in Charles-street. I heard the alarm, ran out, and was told the man had ran up another street; I found the prisoner behind a privy at the bottom of Eastwood's stable-yard - He said he had not got the watch? I had said nothing about it. I took him into a public-house, Mr. Rue came in, and said if he could have his watch again he should go about his business. The prisoner said he would go and get it. I asked him to tell me where he had dropped it; he said,"Just down by where I ran." I went to the yard, and brought it in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I heard the alarm, and pursued some person, whom I did not see. The man who said he had ran down the yard, was shorter and stouter than the prisoner.</p>

On the 2d of April, about half-past five o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner in Back-lane, with some lead in his apron - I asked him where he got it from? he said he got it from a house in Church-lane, and was going to take it home - I took him into custody. As I was taking him to the office he made his escape; I afterwards saw him at the office, and am sure he is the man. Back-lane is close to St. Ann-street. I fitted the lead to the gutter of the house, No. 21, St. Ann-street, and it fitted exactly.</p>

            . I was with Shields - He has spoken correctly. On the 13th of April I took the prisoner at the Black Eagle, in Nightingale-lane - I am certain he is the man. I asked him how he came by the lead? he said a man named Hammond cut it off the roof, and brought it to the door to him.</p>

I made inquiry about it-the prisoner said he had been there, but had not seen it. I offered him 2l. to give it up; he still denied having it - I gave him in charge. I found the watch at the pawnbroker's.</p>

I got my gardener to go through the adjoining house, and get in the back way. He opened the front door, and let me and the watchman in. I found the copper unfixed, and taken into one of the parlours, and the lead pipe, which branches from the cistern, wrenched from the wall, but not taken away. I found the prisoner behind one of the bedroom doors, and gave him in charge - I knew nothing of him. Next morning I found a skeleton key, a screw-driver, and a file in the house.</p>

I took Merredew, and asked him what he had got? he said it was flannel; it was rolled up in two aprons. He said, if I would go with him he would shew me where he got it from. I took him to the watch-house. Hurdsfield was outside the door; I sent for Prince. When he saw Prince he ran away; I took him about a fortnight after. I am sure he was with Merredew.</p>

I went to the prisoner's house in consequence of what my wife told me, and asked him if he had any lead to sell? he said he had; I asked him if he came honestly by it? he said he did - He did not shew it to me. I thought I would make further inquiry; I heard Mr. Winch had lost some, and told him. On the 16th of April I went to his house and weighed the lead; I again asked him if he got it honestly? he said, Yes, but would not tell me where he got it. The constable and Mr. Winch came in and took him. We found 212lbs. of lead there. I took the pipe to the house, and it fitted in every respect.</p>

            . I am porter to Messrs. Metcalfe's. I took the goods to No.15, Nightingale-lane, which I found to be a hair-dresser's shop; they knew nothing about them. I had heard Nicholls, the night before, telling Mr. Joseph Metcalfe that they had taken a shop in King Henryyard. I went there and could not find them, and was returning with the goods. As I came out of the yard I met the three prisoners together. I am sure of their persons. They said they had been to my masters', who said I was gone with the goods, and I must go back with them, for the house they had taken was at the bottom of the yard - I returned with them. When I got to No. 20, Splain helped me down with my load-there was no appearance of a shop there; there was only a shutter put across for a counter. I was ordered not to deliver the things without the money. They took them out of my basket and put them on the counter; Nicholls put her hand into her pocket when I delivered her the bill, and said, "I have not got money enough to pay for them, my husband is at the Crooked Billet, in Rosemary-lane;" and sent Splain to tell him the porter was come with the goods. Splain returned and said Mr. Jones was so busy settling masonic affairs, that he could not come, and I must go to him to receive the money; I said I did not know where the Crooked Billet was-Fitzgerald went with me to shew me where it was. I expected I was going to receive the money, and did not intend to part with the goods without the money. I left them behind. She took me there, and told me to wait at the bar-door while she called Jones down, instead of which she ran out of the back-door. I asked, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181805060036"/>could find no person of the name of Jones there. I returned to the house, and found the prisoners and goods gone. I was not absent above ten minutes. On the 18th I saw the prisoners together at the back of the Crooked Billet, and gave them in charge. I have never seen the goods or Jones.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. There were neither goods or furniture in the house. I left the goods expecting I was to receive the money. I am not authorized to give receipts for my masters.</p>

The prisoner left me and went into the stable to look after his horses. In about twenty minutes I came out again for a better sample, and found the prisoner was not in the stable - I called him, but he did not answer. I found a candle burning in the stable - I suspected something, and concealed myself; I then saw the oat harn-door open, and the prisoner come out with something in a sack; I collared him, and found two bushels of oats in the sack; he said it was to give to the horses, as he liked to see them look fat. I asked him when he had his corn out? he said, that night; the bailiff told him he had given him three bushels of oats that night. I found his corn-chest full of oats-there was plenty for the horses.</p>

I put my watch in a box at seven o'clock in the evening, it was not locked - I missed it next morning between eight and nine o'clock-the prisoner slept in the cellar that night; he sat by the fire when the watch was put into the box. He went out before eight o'clock the next morning - I did not suspect him. There are four other lodgers in the same room. I found it at the pawnbroker's.</p>

            . My, husband keeps horses at Mr. Badcock's stables, Queen-street, Chelsea. On the 16th of February, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I saw a country-looking man come to the stable with the saddle on his shoulder. He said he had three bridles and a saddle to sell. I told him my husband did not buy such things, but that I would shew him a man who would probably buy them. I took him to the prisoner, who was by the water-side. I left them, and did not see the prisoner purchase them. It was by the Yorkshire Grey.</p>

Her mother said she told her I had given them to her, which I had not.</p>

I told him No - He came down the area; I saw the coat lying at his feet. I took hold of him, thinking he might have some plate, and called Hilson. The prisoner pulled me up several of the area steps, trying to get away - I still held him. A crowd gathered round. He returned to the hall, and the butler and footman secured him.</p>

About six weeks after I met Webb selling pearl-ash in Holborn, secured him, and asked him where his brother was? he said he had none - I am sure he is the man. He said if I would let him go he would pay for the property. I let the lodging to them as two brothers.</p>

I returned before my usual time to look after them, having lost linen myself. I met the prisoner with a large bundle of linen under his arm-another man was with him; I took him into custody. I took him to a public-house, and sent for a constable, who found the articles stated in the indictment in the bundle, and some in his hat.</p>

The moment he received the money I caught him, and asked him what money he had in his hand? he said, "1s. 9d., which I have received for this truss of hay." He said his master ordered him to sell it, for it was a returned truss from the barracks. He said he was going with the load of hay to market. I told him it was strange his master should send a single truss of hay ten miles for him to sell, and detained him. I took the team to market, and delivered it to the salesman. I returned for the receiver, but he had absconded. When I went back the prisoner said he picked up the truss near the Edgware gate.</p>
               <p>MR. ELLIOT. I had not ordered him to sell it. I had none returned from the barracks.</p>

In the beginning of January the prisoner came to me, and observed I had a number of carriages standing idle, and that he was about agreeing with a customer of his to let a number of carriages, horses and coachmen, out; he said he would call again, but asked me to let him see some to give him an idea. I shewed him a plain yellow chariot, which I offered to let him at a guinea and a half a week; he said it was more than he could give, as he had made an arrangement with a gentleman. He called again eight or ten days after, and wanted me to let it him for less, saying it was for an invalid, who would make very little use of it-that it would only be used an hour or two in the day to take him into the Park, and that he would only engage it for the first two or three days, not knowing whether the gentleman would continue it longer; but if he found benefit from the air it might be kept two or three weeks, or, perhaps, a month; but he could only give a guinea a week, as he had agreed with the gentleman for 16l. per month, if he kept it, for carriage and horses, and he was to pay a coachman nine shillings a week out of it. I agreed to let him have it at three shillings a day, but told him not to consider that as a regular price always. On the 12th of January he fetched it away himself with one horse, instead of sending the coachman, as he proposed - He repeated the agreement to my clerk, and gave his address at Stephens'-mews, Rathbone-place. I had frequently seen him pass my house before, but did not know him - He said he lived opposite to me. When I came home I had information, and gave my man directions to go there every day for a month, but he never could see it. About a week after it had been out the prisoner called, and said the gentleman did not exactly approve of it, and wished another. I offered to change it, and shewed him two others - He said the step of the first was not convenient. I meant if I could get the first returned to keep it - He never came to change it. When the month was up I went to demand it; he said it was at Southampton, and that on the 14th or 15th of February I might rely on its being returned, as the gentleman was coming to town. I sent repeatedly for it. On the 11th or 12th of February I sent there every hour in the day. Early next morning I went to him - He was denied to me at first. I found him in the hay-loft at Rathbone-place; he then came down, and abused me very much; said he did not care for me, nor all the police-officers in town; that the carriage was in his possession, and he would keep it, and if I was not satisfied with his character, I might go to Messrs. Lubbocks, the bankers', where he had six or 7000l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. I found him where he said he lived. I found neither straw nor hay in his stable. I understood I could not demand it before the month had elapsed.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came about changing it, why did you not tell him to return it - A. I meant to coax him. I never said I would sell it to him - He has not paid the hire.</p>

            . I am the prosecutors' clerk. The prisoner called about the carriage. He said he had engaged it a few days previous, of Mr. Barnes; that it was for an invalid; I told him I knew nothing of it, but did not doubt but all was right. He called for it on the the 12th of January, with a horse. I noticed he did not go to Rathbone-place, but turned towards Soho-square. I ran out soon after, but could not see the carriage. I went to Stephens'-mews, and could not find it there. About a week after, he called, and said the step did not suit the gentleman. Mr. Barnes shewed him some others - He never returned. On the 8th of February the month was up, I went to him, and asked him to return it; he said a Mr. Janson had it at Southampton, and he expected it up every day-that it certainly would be up by the 15th, but if it was not he would call - He did not call. I went to him again, he abused me, and said the gentleman would remain till April. He would not give me the gentleman's address.</p>

I saw Francis put a paper into his hat, he then got out and joined the other three. I told the carman. While I was talking to him they ran up a court - I pursued, and heard the halfpence rattle. I seized Francis, and told Lincoln to take Bowyer, by the Red Bull steps-Francis had some halfpence in his waistcoat-pocket, and the paper broken; Bowyer had some in his coat-pocket, loose. I found the amount of 4s. 6d. on them. I believe that they took the other paper of halfpence - They offered to return them if we would let them go. Bowyer ran away, but I took him again immediately.</p>

On the 9th of April, between twelve and one o'clock, the prisoner came to my room about putting two children to my school; she said her mother would send the children, and asked for my address. While I was writing it she went to the shelf - I heard the spoons rattle, turned round, and saw her arm under her shawl; she came and took the address out of my hand, and wished me a good morning. I went towards the shelf; when she saw that, she came into the room, and asked me to show her down stairs. I followed her, but she got away. I have never found the spoons. No person but myself was in the room - I saw the spoons safe when she came in. On the 28th I met her on Mutton-hill, and charged her with it. I am positive she is the woman.</p>

They were to be paid for on delivery. She called herself Mrs. Ellen; she was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181805060042"/>about ten minutes with me.

When I got there she and two other women were there. I delivered the goods to her. There was nothing but a few greens in the shop. I gave Nicholls the bill-the other two women were, I believe, present, but cannot be certain as to their persons. Nicholls looked at the bill, and one of the others also looked at it. Nicholls told me to take out the goods - I told her I did not like to take them out until I had got the money - She said she had no money with her, but that her husband would soon come in. I waited a few minutes; she sent one of the women to him - She returned and said he would be there soon. I waited there a quarter of an hour, but he did not come. She sent again; the woman returned, and said Nicholls's husband was very busy, writing at a club, and if I would go there with Nicholls he would pay me. I went with her, and took the bill and receipt, leaving the basket and goods behind. I refused to go at first, she said it was not far. She took me to a public-house near the street. She asked if Mr. Ellen was there? the servant told her to inquire at the bar-the landlord said he knew nothing of him. She went out, and I went back with her to Peter-street, found the shop shut up, and the door open. I thought she went into the shop, instead of which she ran out the back way, and got from me-the goods and the two women were likewise gone. I called out, nobody answered me. About a fortnight after I saw her in custody, and am sure she is the woman. I will not be certain of the others.</p>

            . I am a constable. I received information on Monday morning, examined the prosecutor's premises, and traced the footsteps over two walls to the prisoner, Hilton's, lodgings, in Lisson-place, Little James-street. At eight o'clock in the morning I went there, and found him and Green together. There was a chopper in the room, on which were marks of copper, and had, apparently, been used in chopping copper. I took the key of Green's lodging, which was next door, and found a sack in his room, which was sooty, and the prosecutrix claimed it. (Sack sworn to.)</p>

I suspected him, got a search-warrant, and found them there on the 18th. Three pinks were in his bed-room window-the roses were in the ground-floor window; the rest of the pinks were in a basket behind the door of his shed - I am certain they are mine. The pinks are of a particular kind, and so are the pots-the baskets were at the prisoner's house. The prisoner has a wooden leg-there were marks of a wooden leg in the garden.</p>

The prisoner and Mrs. Hill were behind the counter. I gave her the bill. and asked for the money. She said there was half a hundred weight of soap ordered, told me to fetch it, and she would pay me when I returned. I said I would not leave the goods without the money. She said her husband was out, and she had not got enough. She sent the boy out to change a 10l. note - She went out after him. She returned, and said she could not find the boy; he came in soon after, and said his master would return in half an hour. She sent me back for the soap, and said she would have the money when I returned. She called the boy into the room, gave him a paper, and sent him with me, desiring him not to give the note till I gave him the change - I thought he had a note. I took him to the shop - He told us to send half a hundred weight of soap; he had not got the note. I returned, but they were gone. The prisoner was in the shop when I delivered the goods.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM HALLETT. I can swear to one of the feet by its being bit. Spalding said he saw my boar at the prisoner's house that night. Another of the feet had been trod on-the blood remains in it where it was bruised, and salt will not take it out.</p>

               privately stealing goods, value 7s. 6d., in a shop
            </rs>; there was no doubt but the prisoner and the others were out for the purpose of felony. The other two were in the shop, but the prisoner was not. There was a doubt whether the prisoner not being in the shop would entitle him to his clergy, or not. The Judges were of opinion that the words of the act "assist and command," meant persons aiding or abetting, whether in the shop or not, therefore the prisoner was not entitled to his clergy.</p>

The prisoners had broken a square of glass immediately above the division of the window, unfastened the latch, and pushed up the sash; they had made an incision in an inner shutter but not cut the piece quite out; this incision not being opposite the broken square of glass, but much lower down, a hand must have entered the space between the window and the shutter to turn the latch aside; the question was, whether that space was within the house-the Judges were of opinion that it was, therefore there was an entry into the house.</p>
