               <p>I am a constable; on the 5th of September, I was on duty at Bartholomew fair; it was Tuesday; me and Boutflower went into a public house; I saw the prisoner go past, and attempt Mr. Parker's pocket, feeling under his coat; I immediately told my brother officer; he went close to him; I was about four yards behind; I saw him take hold of the prisoner by the collar; and says he, he has picked that gentleman's pocket; and I saw the prisoner drop the handkerchief out of his right hand; I believe this to be the handkerchief; I asked Mr. Parker if he had lost anything; he said he did not imagine he had; he felt for his watch, and then for his handkerchief, and said he had lost his handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going across Smithfield, and they took me; they attempted to swear away my life last session *, and they said now this will do: if it is not true may God never receive my soul.</p>
               <p>* This prisoner was acquitted last session of a highway robbery, by the parties not attending; and this larceny was committed within ten minutes after his discharge from Newgate.</p>

               <p>How long might this robbery take up? - A few minutes; I am sure of the man; he was pitted very much with the small pox, and he had a long nose, a short thick set man; he stood facing me when he spoke to me.</p>

               <p>Look at the prisoner? - I am sure the prisoner is the man; the property has never been found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, my friends are not come.</p>
               <p>How was the prisoner taken? - My uncle gave information; I saw the prisoner in the Borough at the Justice's in Union-street.</p>
               <p>How long was that after you was robbed? - About a fortnight after.</p>
               <p>Was any body else in the room? - Yes, there were plenty of people.</p>
               <p>You went there in expectation of seeing the prisoner? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did the magistrate, or any body there say that is the man? - Yes, they did.</p>

               <p>Can you recollect the particular expression they used? - Stop; upon which he stopped: the first man in the white coat came up on the left hand side of the coach, and the other man went to the other door; they opened both doors, and told me to deliver my money; I saw three men before the doors were open, and when the d oors were open, I only saw two; one kept behind the wheel; they told me to deliver my money, or they would blow my brains out; after I gave them my money, which was about eight guineas, they asked for my watch; I said I had none, upon which they pulled out something very much like a pistol, but whether it was or no, I cannot say; and told me, if I did give my watch, they would blow my brains out, upon which I gave them my watch; it was a small gold watch; they then shut both doors, and told the coachman to go on; he went on very fast; I then perceived a watchman running under the wall after a man in a darkish coat, upon which I told the coachman to let me out and I would pursue them, but he drove on a great deal faster, so that if I had tried to get out, I must have been run over; I said stop, stop, as loud as ever I could, three or four times.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether he heard you? - I cannot tell whether he heard me or not.</p>
               <p>Were the glasses up? - Both the side glasses were down.</p>
               <p>Had you any string? - I did not perceive any; I did not let down the window at the back of the coach, nor I did not put out my head, I only called out very loud; he drove fast till I got into Conduit-street, where I lodge; I directed him to No. 31; he did not know the number; he drove into the middle of the street, upon which I told him to let me out; and I told him, I believed from the circumstances of the robbery, that he was privy to it; and I would go and swear against him the next day; I took his number; he said he wondered how I could think he was guilty, he was a very honest man; I took his number, and went to my lodgings, which are about the middle of the street; the coachman followed me, and I paid him his fare, and he went away.</p>
               <p>Have you any knowledge of the persons that committed the robbery? - I could not swear to them, I can swear to the coachman; I have since heard his name is Mills; I gave a description of Wright, as being like the man that I saw in the white coat.</p>
               <p>What do you say about the other man? - The man that took my money, was a taller man than the man that came up to the horses first.</p>
               <p>Was it a dark night, or a light night? - It was rather dark.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I think in your examination before the Justice, you said that it was so dark you could not discover what weapon it was that he approached with with? - No, Sir, I did not say so, I said I could not see whether it was a pistol or not; when a man tells another he will blow his brains out, he cannot tell exactly what the weapon is.</p>
               <p>Then from the darkness and the alarm together, you could not distinguish what weapon it was? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>What is he? - A mason by trade.</p>
               <p>Does he happen to buy watches? - Not in particular as I know of.</p>
               <p>Did he buy it? - Yes, for a guinea and a half.</p>
               <p>What became of that watch? - One of Sir Sampson's men has it in his custody; I know nothing more.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with the two prisoners Wright and Lawson? - I have seen them before, but I never spoke to them before that day.</p>

               <p>Where was this that these people came to you? - In Old-street.</p>
               <p>Did they come to your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you deal in watches? - I live at a pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>You said you was a cooper? - I am a cooper by trade, but I lodge at a pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>What business do you follow? - A cooper.</p>
               <p>How came they to apply to you? - There was nobody else at home.</p>
               <p>Do you ever serve in the shop? - Sometimes.</p>
               <p>Do you ever work at your trade of a cooper? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where? - Why, with different masters.</p>
               <p>Who did you work with last? - Mr. Kemp.</p>
               <p>How long ago? - I cannot justly say.</p>
               <p>As near as you can recollect? - It may be about three months.</p>
               <p>What may be the pawnbroker's name? - Mrs Harris.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you have some interest in the shop? - No interest at all in the shop</p>
               <p>Was you in the shop? - I was in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>How came these two people in Mrs. Harris's kitchen? - They came in at the back door which leads into the kitchen, and I was in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Is that a door that people use to come to, to pledge their goods? - There is a way at the back door as well as the front to the shop; this back door also leads into the shop; they came into the kitchen; they wanted to sell the watch; they did not ask to pledge it; so I brought Pearce to buy it.</p>
               <p>I suppose it has happened to you before this time, that people have come to this pawnbroker's shop to sell things, and you have got them a purchaser? - Yes.</p>

             the man you usually get? - No; this watch was a small one, and I did not know the value of it, or else I should have bought it myself; he lodged at the same pawnbroker's as I did.</p>
               <p>Where did you find Pearce? - I found him in the Old-Bailey.</p>
               <p>Then perhaps though Pearce bought it, you and he went halves in it? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>What did you let Pearce have the benefit of the whole job to himself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So you had not been acquainted with Wright and Lawson before? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>You said something of having seen them before? - Yes, I had seen them before; I had a knowledge of their faces.</p>
               <p>How often might you have seen them before? - That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Had they ever been at your friend Mrs. Harris's shop? - No, Sir, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Where had you met them before? - I had seen them go along Old-street.</p>
               <p>Do you know what occupations they follow? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you know their names? - Not till they were given in at Sir Sampson Wright's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Mr. East, how long have you lived at this house of Mrs. Harris's? - Ever since I first took my lodgings there.</p>
               <p>How long is that, pray Sir? - I cannot justly say to a day or two; I very often lodge there, particularly when I am out of work I go there; Mrs. Harris is my own sister; sometimes I work at one end of the town, and sometimes at the other; when I work near there, I lodge there.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250008"/>Are you constantly changing your work that you are changing your lodgings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You do not live with the people where you work? - No only lodge near them.</p>
               <p>You are often with your sister? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long ago is it your sister was tried for receiving stolen goods? - You must ask the Court that; I do not chuse to answer that; it does not concern this matter.</p>
               <p>In fact your sister has been tried for receiving stolen goods, has not she? - What occasion have you to ask me that.</p>
               <p>Court. If you know it you must give the answer? - It does not concern this fact.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Give the answer, and give it immediately? - I cannot tell to the time.</p>
               <p>Was she tried for receiving stolen goods? - She was tried for a misdemeanor.</p>
               <p>What was that misdemeanor? - You must apply to the record for that.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with Pearce? - Ever since I first knew him.</p>
               <p>Court. I will not suffer you to insult the Court in that manner, by giving such impudent answers? - If he asks me impudent questions, I have a right to give him impudent answers.</p>
               <p>Court. You will not go from hence my friend at liberty if you go on so; you was asked a fair question; if there had been any doubt about your character, your answering in this manner fixes it forever; if you dare give such another answer as that I will send you to Newgate instantly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Now Sir, how long have you been acquainted with Pearce? - About four years, he lodges in the same house.</p>
               <p>How long has he lived with her? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Upon general knowledge, speaking to a month, or two months, or three months? - I cannot justly say.</p>
               <p>How long has he lived of that four years with your sister? - I cannot say; I am not always at home; it is very seldom I am at home.</p>
               <p>Tell me as near as you can guess how long he has lived in the same house with Mrs. Harris? - That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Do not you call on your sister very frequently? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Have you a reasonable belief that at that time he has lodged, and had been intimate with your sister? - My sister's affairs are nothing to this matter; it is not a fair question.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not see any necessity to enquire into the degree of intimacy between his sister and Pearce.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Have you ever known Pearce tried for any offence? - He might be and I not know it.</p>
               <p>Do you know in point of fact that he has been tried or not? - I do not recollect that ever he was tried for any offence of theft, not since I have known him.</p>
               <p>If such a circumstance had happened should not you have known it? - I am positive sure he never was since I knew him.</p>
               <p>Do not you know in point of fact that this man, Mr. Pearce, has been capitally convicted? - No, Sir, I do not know that.</p>
               <p>What part of the Old Bailey was it that you found Pearce in; was it not in that building there? - It might be.</p>
               <p>Was it not in Newgate? - Yes; he was talking to Mr. Pitt the turnkey when I found him.</p>
               <p>Was not he a prisoner at that time in Newgate? - No.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - Yes, I am, or else he could not have gone home to have bought the watch.</p>
               <p>Was not Mrs. Harris, your sister, in Newgate at that time? - You may ask Mr. Akerman.</p>
               <p>I ask you Sir?</p>
               <p>Court. Was she in Newgate confined at that time, or was she not? - Yes, Sir.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250009"/>Mr. Knowlys. Did these men call you by your name when they came in? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>How came they to come to the kitchen? - Why, many people make a mistake and take the kitchen for the shop.</p>
               <p>How came they to apply to you there? - Because there was nobody else present.</p>
               <p>How long have you been in the habit of recommending people to buy watches? - I never recommended anybody.</p>
               <p>Then this is the first time you have recommended a bargain of that sort? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>The very first time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you give information at Bow-street? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Do you work when you are not in this place at your business as a cooper? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long have you continued to work? - Ever since I first went apprentice, when I could get work to do; I have been out of work at times; I worked ten years in one yard, and never was out of work; I did not know the prisoners at the time.</p>
               <p>Court. If I took your evidence right, you said you knew their persons and not their names? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How often have you given evidence against prisoners before this time? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Have you never shared a reward with a person who has given evidence against them? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Never with Mrs. Harris and Mr. Pearce? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Court. Is it a fish-skin case? - It is a species of fish, that they make spectacle cases of; I lost nothing more.</p>
               <p>What was your chain? - A steel chain; I have the likeness of Cowdery perfectly, and the other by his height, and by the habit he was in.</p>
               <p>Do you mean by the word perfectly, that you have no doubt of him? - I have not a doubt of him; the robbery might take up in all about two minutes and a half.</p>
               <p>With respect to Wood, what do you found your belief of his person on? - By his height, and by his size, and by the habit he appeared in at the time of the robbery; I saw him at Sir Sampson's on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Was you particular in your description in the information? - Sir, they were apprehended according to the description I gave of them at Sir Sampson's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. What sort of an evening was it? - It was a cloudy evening; it was between twenty minutes and half an hour after seven.</p>
               <p>Was there any moon? - No.</p>
               <p>So that you had nothing but the light of the evening, and the atmosphere a good deal obscured? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you anybody with you but Mrs. Chilcott? - No, she ran away and screamed.</p>
               <p>I have no doubt but you was most alarmed for her? - I was.</p>
               <p>This transaction did not occupy above two minutes and a half? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you always as certain of Cowdery as you are now? - Yes, I described him before the magistrate, as having the greater knowledge of him of the two.</p>
               <p>I wish you to recollect yourself; I am sure you will not suspect I am questioning you with a view to entrap you; only to know how the case is? - I did not swear to either of them positively before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>You expressed before the Magistrate a belief as to Cowdery, and spoke more dubiously as to the other? - Yes, he was closer to me, and I paid the greater attention to him.</p>
               <p>What circumstance has induced you to be rather more positive to Cowdery now than you was then? - The matter I considered there was upon committment; and for that reason I thought it was not necessary for me to be so positive as I might be at another time.</p>
               <p>Was not the question put to you whether you knew them? - It was.</p>
               <p>And there you distinguished as to your degree of knowledge, you was sworn before the magistrate? - I was.</p>
               <p>You was sworn to tell all the truth relative to the prisoners? - Certainly I was.</p>
               <p>At that time was your watch produced? Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you hear the examination of Chant and East? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After all these circumstances together, the boys being produced to you within three or four days after your watch was produced, as you still spoke dubiously, I want to know how your memory comes to be improved now? - I thought the committment was all that was requisite at that time.</p>
               <p>But you know the Magistrate must have the information upon oath, which bound you to tell the whole truth upon the subject; now, as on that oath, you spoke dubiously, what has improved your recollection? - My recollection is not improved.</p>
               <p>It is wonderfully altered! and I want to know what are those circumstances that have been hatched into positiveness, matured into positiveness, which some time ago were nothing like positiveness?</p>
               <p>Court. The question is a very plain one whether you have had any occasion to confirm<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250013"/> your doubts, or to make you more positive? - I can give no other answer, but that I thought it was not necessary for the committment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was not you asked, and repeatedly asked by the magistrate, whether you could speak positively to this man? - I was asked.</p>
               <p>Recollect your answer? - I cannot not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Here are two men that are to be committed to take their trial upon a capital offence, you admit the magistrate asked you, not once or twice, but repeatedly, whether you knew them; now you can recollect his question? - He asked me whether I did or not.</p>
               <p>Now upon your oath, what was your answer? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean that the Court and the Jury should seriously believe you? - I most probably gave him some answer, but what it was I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was it not, that you did not mean to swear positively? - No, it was not, in my opinion; I cannot swear positively that it was not.</p>
               <p>Court. You have told us, that you have said you was not positive, now what was your answer? - I cannot be positive to the answer I made to Sir Sampson; I cannot recollect the answer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. However, you recollect it was repeatedly asked of you by the magistrate? - I do not know it was repeatedly asked.</p>
               <p>Was not you pressed upon it? - I was not pressed.</p>

               <p>I was in company with Mr. Chilcott on this night of the robbery; as we were coming along the city road, about a hundred yards from the Toll-gate, I observed two men go on the other side of the way, and they had sticks in their hands, short sticks about the length of my arm; I was not apprehensive of any danger at that time, not thinking they would make such a public shew of their sticks; presently I observed footsteps running after us; Mr. Chilcott turned round, and so did I, and presently came two chaps, one I did not take particular notice of, that was him that came on the side of Mr. Chilcott; the shortest came to me on my right hand side, I made way for him to come by me, which to all appearance I believe to be Wood; in the mean time he held a stick in his right hand; he lifted up the right hand side of his great coat; he took the pistol in the same hand he had the stick; it was a drab coat; he held up the pistol, and bid me stop; I cried out pretty loud, O Lord! and slipped by; he came after me, it might be the space of two or three yards, then he turned back; then I went on, I run on as fast as I could near the toll, and I saw no more of them.</p>
               <p>What kind of hats had these young men? - A round hat, rather done up a little; Wood had a round hat, and a drab coloured great coat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I shall trouble you with but one or two questions; you used the expression, if I heard you rightly, that to all appearance, Wood was the person you saw? - Yes, Sir, so far as to his person, the features of his face, the lower part of his face; but as to his eyes, and the upper part of his face I could not see.</p>
               <p>The man that came to you, had a drab colour coat, and a slouched hat? - I am pretty positive I said the same to Sir Sampson Wright, that I verily believed that he was the man.</p>
               <p>I was just while he was pursuing you about two yards, that you had an opportunity of observing him? - His height and his person I had an opportunity of observing.</p>
               <p>Was not you frightened a little for your husband? - I was in a great deal of fear for myself.</p>
               <p>Court. I understood you, that these men came behind you? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Who keeps the house now; to whom have you sold it? - Why, to a widow woman, but I do not know her name.</p>
               <p>So you sold your house last week to a widow woman whose name you do not know? - I never enquired much into her since I let the house.</p>
               <p>Did you enquire a little before? - No, Sir, she paid me for what things she had, and it did not matter to me.</p>

               <p>You have assigned your lease? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To this widow lady, and do not know her name; I hope they have had the goodness to take your old housekeeper; she continues perhaps to be your housekeeper still, though you have only a room? - I do not know, she is in the house still.</p>

               <p>What other name does Mrs. Anderson use besides that of Anderson? - I never heard her go by any other name.</p>

               <p>That you swear positively? - Yes.</p>

               <p>How long have you been acquainted with a Mr. East? - He lived in Old-street at this time; my house is in Golden-lane, it goes out of Whitecross-street, into Bunhill-row.</p>
               <p>Where did you find Mr. East when you sold him the watch? - At his own house;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250015"/> I carried it to sell the next day; I never bought any thing before.</p>
               <p>Attend to this question, and recollect that Mr. East is coming and does not know your answer; upon your oath, did not you buy this by the desire of East? - No, Sir, he knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Had he never desired you to lay a trap to get forty pounds of somebody? - No such conversation passed; I wanted such a thing at that time; I never wound it up.</p>
               <p>Did it chance to you to go to any gaol to Wood, since he has been committed? - No, yes, Sir; on the Sunday morning; I say nothing but what I know to be the truth.</p>
               <p>So on the Friday you bought it, on the Saturday you sold it, and on the Sunday morning you went to gaol to see Wood; what did you go there for? - I only went to ask him how he did.</p>
               <p>Did you go for any other purpose? - To ask him questions.</p>
               <p>That was all, was it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him you had been taken up yourself about this watch? - Yes; I do not know whether I might not; I was taken up on Saturday night; I was not in custody when I went to him.</p>
               <p>Who took you up on the Saturday night? - Mr. Townshend.</p>

               <p>What on the information of East? - I cannot resolve you that question.</p>
               <p>So they let you go again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon what condition? - I was taken up on the Saturday, and I went home, and they went home.</p>
               <p>Was not you let out in order that you might get these two men; had you been to Wood before they took you up on Sunday morning? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did neither Townshend nor East, nor any other person desire you to go to Wood? - Yes, I can say so.</p>
               <p>What else did you tell Wood? - Several affairs between ourselves; several little things</p>
               <p>Why you never had any little things but this watch; now, upon your oath, did not you tell him if he could give you a direction to Cowdery, you would keep Cowdery out of the way? - I said, I would go and tell Cowdery, in order he might get away; when I went from Wood's I went home, and Townshend was waiting at my house for me; and they took me to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Was not he waiting there by your appointment? - No, Sir; I did not go to Wood by his desire.</p>
               <p>One question more; would you have said any thing about this if you yourself had not been taken up? - I certainly would, if I could have left my house; I would have gone to Sir Sampson Wright's people; I did not like to leave my business to every body.</p>
               <p>Did you voluntarily tell them? - Yes, I told Townshend in my skettle ground.</p>
               <p>Why did not he come to take you up? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>What did he come for? - I did not ask him his business.</p>
               <p>May be he came to play a game of skettles with you? - I do not know what he came for; he did not take me up when he first came in; he was in half an hour before he took me up.</p>
               <p>Is not Townshend a thieftaker? - Yes, he is.</p>
               <p>Townshend was used to come to the house? - He never apprehended a man out of the house in his life.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you paid them, whom do you mean by them: - I paid two pounds to Wood; I was left at large to produce the watch, and how it was come by.</p>
               <p>Did Wood, when you went to see him in gaol, say any thing respecting himself? - Wood said, he had sent a letter to tell Cowdery to go out of the way himself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Had you any other conversation respecting this business about Wood? - No, no more than he said, he could not think what he was there for, and he sent a letter to Cowdery.</p>

               <p>I was in company with some other of the officers of Bow-street, we received an information that there was a robbery in the City Road, we went in order to see if we could not apprehend the parties, and in consequence of that we went down the City Road, we met with nobody, I thought it right to call at Chant's, it was near ten or rather more, I am not certain as to the time, I called in there to see who was there.</p>
               <p>Court. What is Chant? - He kept Lord Rodney's Head at that time, I looked round the tap-room and saw nobody there that I wanted; I called Chant backwards into the tap-room, and asked him if he had not heard there was a robbery in the City Road; he said he had; and I got out of him that he bought a watch; I asked him if he had it by him, he said no, but it might be at Mrs. Harris's.</p>
               <p>What is Mrs. Harris. - A pawn-broker.</p>
               <p>Where does she live? - In Old-street; I thought it right to leave one of our people with Chant, and to go and see whether the watch was there or no, I went, and found what he had told me was true; I then went back to Chant, and then he went to shew me where to find Wood; I went to Wood's master's, I found he was an apprentice; I knocked at the door, and with some difficulty got admittance, I went up stairs and took the prisoner out of bed; then I searched about the room to see if I could find any thing, I found nothing of any material consequence but a light coloured great coat with white buttons, which the gentleman described to be worn by one of the persons that robbed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250018"/> him; I desired the prisoner to get up and dress himself; he asked me what I wanted with him; I told him he must go with me; says he, you are not going to take that great coat? I said, yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you had any account at this time of the coat? - Yes, my Lord, I then took him to the Compter; I then asked Chant if he knew where the other lodged, and he told me he did not; we let Chant go home that night, in order to go to

             the next morning, to get out of him where Cowdery was to be found; the next morning I saw Shallard, we came down to the Compter with Chant, in order that Chant might go into the Compter; for you will please to observe, that at that time the prisoner Wood did not know that Chant had laid the information against him, nor did he know in fact what he was apprehended for: Chant told me where Cowdery's lodgings were; he was not there; we thought it right to wait till he came home; we waited for him, he went to the little house where his brother lodges, for some of the people happening to know me suspected something, and we found him in his brother's lodgings in the garret, with a shoe in his hand; I then took him to New Prison; I found nothing upon him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did you bring this great coat away? - Yes, I did, and I put it on him at the

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you search the pockets of it? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Where you have a suspicion you always do? - Always.</p>
               <p>Did you find any pistols or any bludgeons on either of these young men? - No, Sir, in the lodgings of Cowdery there was nothing but the bare bed.</p>
               <p>The first place you went to, or that you have mentioned to us, was at Chant's? - Yes, after taking a regular round.</p>
               <p>Was that the first house you went to of this sort, positively the first house? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>How long have you known Chant? - I believe these two or three years.</p>
               <p>Have you had frequent occasions to go to his house? - Several times since he kept the Rodney's Head, because people, which I am very sorry to say, under the description of that kind of people, used to use that house.</p>
               <p>Have you occasionally found any people there that you have wanted. - We have found people there that we have wanted, but it has so turned out that the evidence would not bring them to public justice.</p>
               <p>Did Chant know that? - He could not be ignorant of that; I know Mrs. Harris and Mr. East, I have known East about two years.</p>
               <p>How long has he been what you call a private trap? - Why, upon my word, Sir, that is a very unfair question, and I shall apply to the Court; for my own part, I do not know what a private trap is; I know a good many things, I know I am a public trap, but I really do not know what a private trap is.</p>
               <p>No! my Lord and I seem to know it pretty well, and you seem to know it because you decline to answer it; I certainly must not ask you what quantity of ill you have known of him, but I may ask you if you have known any sort of good of him? - Upon my word and upon my oath I never knew any ill of him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester to Mr. Chilcott. You saw this great coat produced? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Had you made any observation on that coat before? - No particular observation, it looked the same as other people's coats.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any thing about that coat that made you think you had seen it before; suppose that coat had been produced to you at any other place, should you have known it? - Had it been upon the same person's back I should.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You was taken to Bow-street to see these people? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You went with Mr. Chant. - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who fetched you? - Townshend.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250019"/>For what purpose was you taken? - To see the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Then you was told they were taken up for your robbery? - Certainly.</p>

               <p>What do you think may be the real value of the horse? - At that time he was not worth eleven pounds, hardly so much.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What are you a licensed dealer? - Yes.</p>

               <p>He was brought and run in hand; the prisoner stood by? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He told you he could not take less than eight guineas, because the man had told him not to take less? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He did not say absolutely that he was found, as you and I jockies do when we go to sell a horse of our own? - No, he said he believed he was found; the man told him he was found; he continued at my house waiting for me half an hour, while I was gone for an officer.</p>
               <p>Was he in custody of any body? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he tell you the name of this gardener? - Yes, he did, but I have forgot it; we found by the people in Covent-Garden market that there was such a man.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. What sort of a mane and tail had this horse? - A long tail, a full mane; the mane was not hogged nor the tail cut short.</p>
               <p>He told you first and last, that some other man had given him the horse to sell, you went there, the man waited anxiously at last you came away, and he still continued in the same story? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. The horse's mane and tail were not altered? - No, not a bit.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Suppose they had hogged his mane, and docked his tail, should you have known your long tailed nag? - Yes, I should.</p>
               <p>Perhaps if they had cut his head off, you would have known him? - Not so perfectly I should not.</p>

               <p>Court. What did you give for this horse? - Eleven guineas; I have had him three years, and worked him at cart and plough.</p>
               <p>Jury. Were any two legs white? - All his four legs were white.</p>

               <p>On Saturday, the 14th of October, in the morning, I was in company with Mr. Armstrong in Bishopsgate-street; I had information in the morning that there had been some robbery committed in the roads, and Mr. Armstrong and me saw the two prisoners standing in New-street, by Bishopsgate-street; we looked at them and thought they seemed very suspicious, one of them had boots on, and one of them had white stockings covered with country dust; I saw one of them with a watch string hanging out of his fob; one of them parted from the other; this went out into the middle of the road to see which way he went, and I had lost him in a minute; Armstrong run into Petticoat-lane, before he came back Rayner came out of a pawnbroker's shop, the other then came and joined him; I followed them down Wormwood-street, they were discoursing together; the shortest gave the watch to the tallest; then Armstrong came running after me, we took them into custody, we brought them the office, and took them before the magistrate; Armstrong took Davis and took away the watch; I saw the string hanging out of his pocket: they told where their lodgings were, we went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250029"/> and searched their lodgings, and this coat was upon the bed, and in the coat pocket was this knife (a broken case knife), and this stick was in the room (a stick that might be taken for a pistol); but when they were committed and going to gaol, I believe Armstrong said, you have got a very bad knife in one of your pockets, we had like to have cut our hands; they answered aye, that is the knife we used to have on the roads, and there is a stick in the room, that is the pistol we used to have; says we, it is a wonder the patrols never got hold of you; they said the patrols could not have hurt them, for if they had come up they would have dinged the knife, and then they could not vagrant them; because your Lordship sees if they had pistols or cutlasses about them, they would have been vagrants; they said it was an old codger; that he had nothing but a stick with him, and they never pulled out the knife or stick to him; on the Monday they were brought up before the magistrate again; and the magistrate asked which of them had that knife; the prisoner Rayner said he had that knife when they robbed the gentleman; the tallest said he had the stick.</p>
               <p>Court. They seem to have been very frank with you, what induced them to tell you all this? - My Lord, they told it going the road; there was no manner of promise made to them; Armstrong had taken the watch from Davis's pocket before this.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Did not the father of one of these men attend at the magistrates? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>He is a Quaker? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did not this Quaker father use a great deal of persuasion with these young men, and tell them it would be much better for them? - No, upon my oath he did not, I am sure of it; I heard him say to his son you have done this, and you must abide by the consequences of the law.</p>
               <p>Had not somebody used such persuasions?</p>
               <p>No, Sir, I swear they had not.</p>
               <p>Had not the father of Rayner conversation with him before this? - He talked to him, but there was nothing of this sort mentioned.</p>
               <p>ARMSTRONG sworn.</p>
               <p>I know nothing of the robbery, I was with Shakeshaft.</p>
               <p>Tell us what you first saw? - The first seeing of them was at the corner of New-street, both in company together; and Shakeshaft giving the information; he is a jailor belonging to New Prison; seeing one of them in boots, and the garb not being so decent for boots, I suspected them; one of them separated and stood looking at the other; Shakeshaft said he had missed the other, I went after him, and took Davis in Petticoat-lane, and Shakeshaft took Rayner; I saw Davis coming out of a pawnbroker's; I asked Davis what he had been pawning, he said nothing; I took the watch out his pocket; says he, it is mine; says I, where did you get it; he said, he was a midshipman on board the Southampton frigate, and had it before he left that ship; I then asked him the number; he differed in the number; and I told him then I suspected he did not come honestly by it; he said he had, and he would tell me where it had been left so long; I said if he did I would not keep him long, but I would go and see it was so; then he replied, he would not have me go high his friends on any account whatever; Mr. Harper was in the room when I took this watch from him; I took him to the magistrate and searched him further there, and in his waistcoat pocket I found this seal; then we asked them where they lived, and we received this answer, in Vine-street, St. Martin's-lane; I asked him with whom, he gave me the landlord's name, and Davis gave me a key out of his pocket; I went to the landlady to know which was their room; she at first did not know them, I shewed her the key, she knew that; we opened the door, and on the bed was this coat; in putting my hand into the pocket I run it against the knife; we then returned to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250030"/> office, and in that time the prisoner Rayner had sent for his father, and they were both committed to New Prison; I heard Rayner's father say to him, for the love of God whether it be good or bad tell me the truth; what he said to his father I cannot say, he persisted in knowing about it at that moment; his father desired then to see the magistrate, and the magistrate told him, in my hearing, they were committed, and he had nothing further to do with them; as we were going down to gaol the little one said, it would have been happy for us if I had been boned by myself with the watch, but two of us could not tell a story alike.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the meaning of boned? - Apprehended; it is a cant word; they were a conversing with one another about different things; but perhaps your Lordship will not think proper for me to mention them; when they were brought up on Monday Mr. and Mrs. Rutt attended, and the Justice asked the prosecutor, which he thought was the man that robbed him, he said the tallest; and he said he was the man; and the little one said, he was the man that robbed the woman, without our speaking at all.</p>

               <p>I am apprentice to the prosecutor, and have been so two years; on the Sunday afternoon I found this twist on the prisoner in the front of the kitchen; he was in the front kitchen playing with Mr. Da Costa's father; he was laying on his right side, and the twist was in his left pocket in a paper; I took the paper out of his pocket softly, to know what was in it;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250034"/> he did not know I took it out; I went into the back kitchen to see what was in the paper, and finding it to be twist, I thought it was my master's property; I told Russel of it about half after ten at night; I took it between two and three, but Russel did not come home before.</p>
               <p>How happened it, that you did not tell your master's father of it? - I was not certain of it; and I thought my master's father could do nothing in it.</p>
               <p>What colour was the silk? - There was some dark blue and some mixtures.</p>
               <p>Russel. This apprentice Walters gave me the first information of this silk within five minutes after I came home; I put in the bodkin as usual into the sliding place on Saturday night; I have the key of the cutting room always in my pocket since my master has been abroad; the bag of silk was in the cutting room; none of the apprentices have any business there; nor nobody had been in the cutting room on Saturday to my knowledge; the prisoner and the other apprentice were at home on the Sunday morning till I went out, which was about eleven.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Da Costa. What time did you go out on the Sunday? - Between twelve and one, the apprentices were both at home then; when I returned, Walters was at home, but not the prisoner; he returned between ten and eleven that night.</p>
               <p>Had you charged Walters with taking this silk? - No; he told me that evening.</p>
               <p>What is the character of Walters? - I always found him very honest.</p>
               <p>Court to Walters. You have taken an oath to tell the whole truth; you did not take this silk out of the bag yourself? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I found the twist in the same street as I came home.</p>

               <p>What was the dress of the other man? - He had a dark coat underneath; they had both light coloured great coats on; the head of one horse was in the coach; one was a grey, and the other was a dark grey horse; we then arrived at the turnpike, and then I saw two or three officers, as they told me they were; I told them of the robbery by two men on horseback; a few days after I saw my watch advertised in the papers; I then went to the office in Worship-street, Shoreditch; the watch was shewn me; I knew it again; I then described the people before they were brought to me, exactly as I told your Lordship; as to swearing to them I cannot; it was not light enough for me to see their faces.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoners, can you say from their general appearance they were not the men? - No, I cannot; one was very tall, the other very short; the words I said, were, that one of them sat very losty on his horse.</p>

               <p>On the 5th of this present month, I in company with three other officers, was at Justice Wilmott's office; there came an information, that there were two people in Petticoat-lane, near the end of Gravel-lane that were suspected to have committed a highway robbery; we went into Petticoat-lane; the people were described to us; we went to the house where they were; they were eating and drinking; they were the two prisoners; we told them we wanted them; I believe it was twelve at noon.</p>
               <p>How were they dressed? - Much as they are now; the prisoner Lightfoot was in black; they got up; we were in a very bad neighbourhood, and had many bad people about, and we did not think sit to handcuff them in the house; but Shakeshaft and me took Lightfoot, one by one cuff, and the other by the other; there was an entry; and when we came to that, which was coming out of the tap-room, then he forced his hand down to his breeches, and I saw him put his finger into his pocket, or into his fob, I do not know which; directly I saw him with the seal or seals of a watch, and part of the chain in his hand; I says to my brother officer, Mr. Shakeshaft, he is going to pull a watch out of his pocket; and we had a very hard struggle with him, having each of us a stick we had but one hand to hold him; after we had struggled with him some time, Mr. Shakeshaft wrenched the gold seals out of his hand, and the chain parted from the watch; when I said, he was going to pull a watch out of his pocket, he then said, he had no such thing to pull out of his pocket; he said, he had no watch about him; we got the seals out his hand, and Mr. Armstrong, I believe it was, said, as to the watch, I suppose, that is sold; no, says he, I had none; we then sent for a coach and took them to Mr. Wilmott's office; as to the prisoner Tyrell, the whole time he behaved very well, and never offered to stir from the place where he was when we went in; when we got to the office, Armstrong, in company with another officer, took Lightfoot up stairs, and he brought down a watch with him; which he said, he found upon him; I have nothing to say against Tyrrell, only being in company with the other.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You are an officer belonging to Mr. Wilmott's office? - Yes.</p>

               <p>How many trials for highway robberies are you a witness on in the course of this sessions? - No more than this and the last trial.</p>
               <p>If these two men should be convicted it will make four forty pounds? - That is hardly worth while asking me for doing my duty, and the hazard I run in doing it; if there is any thing for me I hope I shall have it.</p>
               <p>You either have or not the impression on your mind that you are to get something by the conviction? - I certainly have, and so has every man that works.</p>

               <p>These two men were at our house three Sunday evenings running; our house is the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250038"/> Three Tons, Kingsland; the first Sunday they were on horseback, on two black horses, the second Sunday a grey and a bay, the third Sunday a grey and a bay.</p>
               <p>When were these three Sundays? - I cannot say the days of the month, but one of them was the Sunday evening that the robbery was committed, they left our house a little before eight, they were there the space of ten minutes.</p>

               <p>Do you happen to know which way they came? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Court to Armstrong. Have you taken any pains to enquire where they had their horses? - Yes, my Lord, we have, but we could not find it out.</p>
               <p>Court. There was a plan, I remember, once in agitation of obliging all persons that let out horses to register them.</p>

               <p>Court. But how came you by it? - I bought it in Bishopsgate-street of the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Then how came you to deny so constantly to these people that you had any watch? - Because I expected that every thing they took from me they would keep, they took my knife and every thing from me.</p>
               <p>What business have you been in? - I am a <rs id="t17861025-16-deflabel90" type="occupation">silk-twister</rs>

               <p>Where does he live? - He did live in Moorfields when I knew him, he used to use the same house that I frequented much at times, I only knew him as using the house, I have drank many a pint of beer with him, I have been in his company very often.</p>
               <p>What is his business? - He is in the <rs id="t17861025-16-deflabel91" type="occupation">horse-dealing line</rs>

                        targets="t17861025-16-defend256 t17861025-16-deflabel91"/>, I used to see him exercising horses about Moorfields; I do not know where he lived when he was taken up. On the 1st of October my coach was in the rank at Moorfields, and somebody called coach about half after six; I was in a house and this Tyrrell was there, we had a pint of beer together at the Swan and Hoop at Moorgate, as soon as I drank my pint of beer I got off with a gentleman to the horns in Gutter-lane, Cheapside, and the prisoner Tyrrell went on the box with me, and the gentleman at the Horns in Gutter-lane paid me, and we had a glass of brandy a-piece; I believe the man who keeps the Horns in Gutter-lane is here, we had half a pint of brandy between some of us, the man at the Horns paid me, and I went away, and we parted; this was Sunday night the 1st of October.</p>
               <p>How came this man to ride on the box with you? - I asked him to have a ride with me.</p>
               <p>Why, by your account he was only a common acquaintance? - Only his being in the rank and using this public house.</p>
               <p>You say he was in the horse way? - Yes, I have seen him in the horse line, I have seen him exercising his horses.</p>
               <p>Is it a common thing for you to take people up on your box when you carry a fare? - Why it is common and it is not common; it was a little before six.</p>
               <p>Do you know who it was you carried to the Horns? - The gentleman that keeps the Horns knows because he paid me; it was half past six in the evening when I went off with the coach.</p>
               <p>Did you drink the pint of beer in the house or at the door? - In the house, in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Where was your coach during this time? - My coach was watering the horses at the door at the time.</p>
               <p>You carried one man only? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you get off your box at the Horns? - Oh, yes, we had some brandy there.</p>
               <p>What room did you go to there? - The public room, the tap-room?</p>
               <p>How long did you stay there? - Seven or eight minutes.</p>
               <p>What became of the prisoner? - When we had drank our brandy I bade him good night there, I left him at the door, he went about his business, and I went about mine.</p>
               <p>When you asked him to have a ride, did you tell him where you were going to? - He heard the man that was in the coach tell me where I was going to.</p>
               <p>Had he any business that way? - I cannot say, I did not ask him.</p>
               <p>Did you promise him any liquor when you came to the Horns? - No, the gentleman treated us that I carried there; the gentleman is either a cook or a waiter or something at the London Tavern in Cheapside, he is a servant I know, but the gentleman that keeps the Horns can tell you; I was not at the Justice's the first hearing, but the second I was sent for, but they did not let me in; it was Sunday the 1st of October.</p>

               <p>What day of the week? - On a Sunday evening between seven and eight, the clerk, I believe he is, to the New London Tavern was set down at my house at that time, he was intoxicated, he desired me to pay them, he desired me to give them half a guinea, there were four of them with the coachman; I thought half-a guinea too much, as the young man was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250040"/> intoxicated; I gave the young men three shillings, and a glass of brandy a piece, and I paid the coachman his fare, which was eighteen-pence.</p>
               <p>What was the three shillings for? - For seeing home the young man that was intoxicated; there were five in all.</p>
               <p>What was the three shillings given for? - - For their care I understood, my Lord; he desired me to give them half a guinea; he did not know what he said, and I thought it was too much; they seemed satisfied with three shillings; I called the coachman, and he said his fare was eighteen-pence.</p>
               <p>Do you know the coachman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is that the coachman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know any of the other people? - No, I know none, but the gentleman that was brought home in the coach.</p>
               <p>Did you go out when the coach arrived? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were they all in the coach, or upon the box, or behind, or where? - I cannot speak to that indeed.</p>

               <p>Court to Smith. How is this, you told me it was a single man? - I did not think it signified saying any thing of it; it was a quarrel, and I took my fare; this gentleman gave the men a shilling a piece.</p>

               <p>Has he been in any regular employ? - I have known him in two or three places; he was out of place when he was taken up.</p>
               <p>How long had he been out of place? - I cannot say rightly, I suppose a month or two.</p>
               <p>Or three? - I will not say rightly.</p>
               <p>Or four? - I will not say rightly.</p>
               <p>Six months? - I should suppose not so much as that.</p>
               <p>It seems as if by a month or two, you meant more than a month or two? - It may be more than a couple of months, I cannot say it is six months, nor I cannot say rightly how long, but I believe it may be a month or two, to the best of my knowledge; when out of place he lodged with me, and I always found him honest; he lodged with me constantly.</p>
               <p>Then you can tell pretty well how long he has been out of place? - No, I cannot upon my oath say within a month or so; when out of place, he used to be employed by the people; I knew a Mr. Hull, in Chiswell-street, used to employ him to take horses to the country; I believe Tyrrell is a very honest lad, I never found any thing to the contrary.</p>

               <p>Now as to Tyrrell, look at him, are you quite sure he is the man? - I believe them to be the men that were at our house.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about them? - I cannot say I can swear to them, because they did not come in doors.</p>
               <p>Did they speak to you? - No, I received their money once.</p>
               <p>Then perhaps you spoke to them? - I cannot say I did; they only drank at the door two pints of beer, and had a slice of bread and butter.</p>
               <p>Then you are not quite positive? - No, but I believe them to be the men.</p>

               <p>How far was that man you took from you? - About two or three hundred yards.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250043"/>Was he ever out of your sight? - Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that the man you took, was one of the men that robbed you? - Yes, I took particular notice of him; I was attacked within one hundred yards of the Three Cups.</p>
               <p>What sort of a morning was it? - It was pretty lightish, a very fine morning; the man came behind me.</p>
               <p>As you was knocked down before you was robbed, had any opportunity of looking at them? - Yes, when I was knocked down, I took particular notice of them by their jackets, and by the hairy caps they wore, and by their complection.</p>
               <p>What countrymen are they? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen them before? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Which is the man you took? - The prisoner Vallence.</p>
               <p>You say you are sure that Vallence was one of the three that robbed you? - Yes; the other prisoner came to the watch house afterwards, but nobody would stop him, and he was taken the next day; the watchman came to me again, after they were fully committed, and said a gentlewoman wanted to speak to me, and he took me to a strange house, and they wanted me to smother the robbery; one of the women asked me if I was going to hang her nephew; I said I never hung any body, nor never should, for if the law of the nation hung them, it was not me; then I was applied to by a girl, who said a gentlewoman wanted me; she gave me some rum, and told me not to hang her son, but she should not mind if he was transported.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys, Prisoner's Counsel. You are a labouring man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This was between two and three in the morning? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where had you been all that night? - At Paul's-wharf at work, and from thence to Newgate-market.</p>
               <p>When did you leave off work? - About half past one, I carry the loads all night.</p>
               <p>Was not it very dark that night? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>You are sure it was not dark? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not the watchman tell you, you was drunk that night? - No, Sir, not that I know; he abused me very much; the watchman shewed me the Three Cups; I knew the watchman; the watchman has been turned out of the parish on that very account, and his other misdemeanors, the day following, and two days after he was turned out of the parish in the vestry.</p>
               <p>You are sure Vallence was one of them? - Yes, Sir, very sure.</p>
               <p>Where did you get this money? - Worked for it, Sir.</p>
               <p>Court. I understand you, that you was going to ballast heaving? - Yes, I was.</p>

               <p>Who was the third man? - I do not know, I never saw any of them before; but I know these two young lads to be two of the men; I never saw them before, but when they came before the justice in the morning I knew them.</p>

               <p>I was a watchman in Shadwell-dock that night, the 8th of September, I have known the prosecutor these two years; I believe I came round about ten, and it began to rain; after the half hour I came and saw the prosecutor in my box; says I, what is this here, my officers will not allow me to keep any body in my box, you must move out of this; he was drunk, I could hardly keep him up; at eleven I found him drunk a second time, laying in the street, I then told him he should not be there; says he, I am waiting for the captain; says I, where do you lodge? says he, in the city; I went round about, as soon as I came round the half hour, there he was laying in the same place again; I thought as it was raining he would catch his death of cold; he asked me if I knew of any lodging; I told him no, except one public house, as I came round where I heard people up, I went there, and told them there was a man very much in liquor, and would catch his death of cold; I did not stay there three minutes, there I left him in an empty box by himself.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - I suppose pretty near twelve when I put him in there, then he was very much intoxicated with liquor, he could hardly stand upon his legs, I saw him afterwards, I cannot tell what time it was, may be it might be an hour and a half afterwards, when he came out of this public house there was a good many people backwards and forwards, I did not stop to hear what they were, there was a racket, as there most commonly are watermen and captains of ships and that, and so I went down, and the prosecutor was there, and two men had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250045"/> hold of him, whether they were lifting him up or what I cannot say; the prisoners at at the bar were coming one way; says, I do you know who robbed you? yes, says he; says I, did this man rob you? yes, says he; and I suppose if I had pointed out any other he would have said the same.</p>
               <p>Where was Vallence when you came up? - He and another man was walking towards us.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to ask him whether that man had robbed him? - I asked him whether he know the persons that robbed him, Vallence was one of the men that he said robbed him; I do not know who the other man was.</p>

               <p>Mr. Keys. Who took Vallence into custody that night? - I did.</p>
               <p>You took him to the watch-house I think? - I did.</p>
               <p>When you first came up was Vallence standing there? - No, he was coming towards the crowd; I have known the prosecutor for about two years.</p>
               <p>What is his character in that neighbourhood? - His character is like a great many labouring men, he makes ill use of his money, and gets drunk like a great many more foolish people.</p>
               <p>Is he supposed to carry much money in his pocket? - I believe he seldom has much money, I believe he is like me.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you any relation to Vallence? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know his aunt? - No, I know his mother.</p>
               <p>Did not you carry this Schooley to his mother or aunt? - No, I carried her to the public house; I never took him to her house.</p>
               <p>What house did you take him to? - To Mr. Swinney's, the Bull's Head, in New Gravel-lane.</p>
               <p>Who desired you to take him to that house? - I met him and took him up there with his mother to make it up.</p>
               <p>How came you to know that? - He told me he was willing to make it up; I told Schooley I believe the mother and you will make it up; so I carried him to the Dock public house, and the mother was not at home, I fancy there was some relation there, they had some discourse but what it was I do not know; I was not with him the next time; I have known his mother going on twenty years.</p>
               <p>How has the lad got his living? - I have known him to be a good scholar, and he is lately come home from Greenland.</p>
               <p>How comes it you are not a watchman for the parish? - I do not know, I am a watchman in another parish, now in St. George's, I was turned out about this affair.</p>
               <p>I suspect because you wanted to get this man to make up this business. - No, it was because I did not come down time enough when this man was robbed, I could not be at both ends of the street at once.</p>

               <p>I have known Vallence in the course of fourteen years since he was a baby; he was brought up to sea, and that vessel was car away, and the captain is not here at present; he has gone to Greenland backwards and forwards, his mother keeps him; Captain Scott is not in town or he would give him an undeniable character, he made his last voyage with him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four more witnesses who all gave him a very good character.</p>

               <p>Court. Can you satisfy the Jury where you was that night? - I know no more about it than I met this young fellow, we went into the Three Cups and had a pot of beer, the prosecutor was laying asleep in the box, we sat in another box, the watchman came in, who was an acquaintance of this young fellow's; this young fellow called for half a pint of rasberry, and drank about half a glass of it, and went away for fear of being locked out; then I heard he was taken up, I went to the watch-house to see what was the matter, and the prosecutor was there, and he said I believe he is one of the robbers, take hold of him;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250046"/> but nobody would; then I went away, I was going to work; and after I came from work, about ten, Mr. Forrester came and took me away: I have no friends in England.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any person belonging to the watch-house? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Sutton. Was you there when Collins came to see Vallence? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Court to Schooley. Where had you been the night before you had got down to Shadwell? - At Paul's Wharf carrying apples, pears, and all kind of garden stuff, as I always do when I am not in place; I suppose I went away from Paul's Wharf about half past twelve, and got down to Shadwell about half past one; I never was laid down at the Dock, nor he never bid me go away; he said you are a little in liquor; says I, I am fatigued and a little in liquor too, says I.</p>

Aldred, the evidence, had given a description of the two pistols, as long horse pistols, with a head at the but end, and this pistol answers to it; Armstrong in company with me at the same house found the other pistol in the same house; we found in one gunpowder and a screw and two balls; it is an alley at the top of Brick-lane, Old-street; she said, she had that linen of

               <p>Was all that linen drapery goods that were found at your house received from Athill? - To the best of my knowledge, they took a great deal more from us that Mr. Collier did not own; I was at home when the piece of cloth (the Irish) was brought; and I saw her pay Athill, in Mr. Athill's chamber; I went there on Friday night the 1st of September.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How long have you known Athill? - I cannot justly say, seven or eight, or nine years.</p>

               <p>Does not he bear the character of a most notorious receiver of stolen goods? - I cannot say so; I never knew it; I do not know that he does.</p>

               <p>Look at these pistols? - These are the very same pistols, for I made a remark of this head being at the butt end of it; then Fosset took the other bag, and brought it to my house with me; then I paid him the money that I agreed for, that was twenty-five pounds, one shilling and sixpence, I think to the best of my knowledge, all but three shillings and sixpence I paid for the coach hire; when he was going away, he asked me if I would have them pistols, to guard the property, I imagine; I told him, no, I did not want them; and when he went away, he desired me to let him have the bags again in a day or two, or rather before that; when I was in Brick-lane, I asked them where the property was from; and they told me, from Islington; he told me to leave the bags for him at the White Horse, in Petticoat-lane; accordingly I went there in a day or two, and there I saw Taylor and Stephens together; I did not take the bags with me; they asked me, if I had brought the bags with me, and I said, no, I would bring them the next day; the next day I carried them, and left them at the bar.</p>
               <p>Look at that bag? - This is one of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250050"/> the bags that I left, the other was a kind of a light blue bag; when we met at the house where Mrs. Bell was, she said it was her place; it had a field behind it, and I shewed it to Shakeshaft.</p>

               <p>Did any thing pass between you and the woman, or between Russel and the woman? - Nothing that I know of; the woman paid me, she paid me three shillings, or three shillings and sixpence, I canno t say which, and she gave me two-pence for a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Should you know either of these people again? - No, I cannot say I should; I cannot say what bags they were.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Fossett. I leave it all to my counsel; I know nothing of the matter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Stephens. I leave it all to my counsel; I know nothing of it.</p>

               <p>I never had any such thing in my place; I bought it of a shop, and gave it to the maid; I never wronged man, woman, or child since I was born, nor never did amiss thing in my life.</p>

               <p>Court to Athill. Describe me the place which the man carried you to at the back of Brick-lane. - It was by a public house, up a very narrow passage; I think it is the sign of the Three Jolly Weavers; there is a little narrow passage turns down; it was a one pair of stairs, the stairs was facing the door almost as you go in.</p>
               <p>Do you know whose room that was? - I know no further than what I heard Mrs. Bell say when she was in Clerkenwell, she said it was her things, but she knew nothing of the things being there.</p>
               <p>Court to Shakeshaft. What room was it where you found Bell? - It is the sign of the Three Jolly Weavers, and the place is called Ratcliffe-lair; we went there to search for

               <p>Did it appear newly cut? - I did not examine it more than I do now, but at the Rotation office I examined it, and it appeared to be lead that had been newly cut; we only opened it at one end to match it to the piece that we had got.</p>

               <p>Who had the most of this water? - I had the most of it; I begged for the most; I desired him to sling the most upon me, as she was so ill.</p>
               <p>How much water might she get? - What things she had were very thin indeed; she had but a trifle of the water; when we got down out of the lost, the same men began throwing dung at us; we were going to make our escape to get somewhere to dry ourselves.</p>
               <p>What did they throw at you? - The stuff out of the streets, out of the gutters, out of the yard; I made my escape, I was but just touched, except the clear water; Oliver had it very much indeed, she could not make her escape, she was so ill; then we went and made a fire, and dried our things a little, in one of the little narrow lanes; her nose bled as much as a pint; after we came to sit down by the fire, and she came to sit still, she complained of her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250057"/> breath very much after the water was thrown upon her; when we had dried ourselves a little, we went and sleeped upon the ricks; she got in at the bottom, where no wet could come; I lay till between one and two the next morning, then I moved; she spoke very frank to me indeed, and said her breath was something better, and in the morning she was found dead; the under hostler came and awaked me, and I found her dead; I know nothing more than this of my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>What time in the morning was it you was awaked? - Between five and six I had shifted away on the other side of the ricks, but we were both in the same ricks.</p>

               <p>Mr. Graham, Prisoner's Counsel. I think it was on the Tuesday that you slept in this hay-loft? - Yes, nobody slept but we; but there was a travelling man slept in the loft.</p>
               <p>Was there only one man? - There were two men, one was a stranger, and the other belonged to Hounslow.</p>
               <p>Did not he sleep with you? - No, Sir, he did not.</p>
               <p>Nor the night before? - No, the prisoners came to give drink and feed their horses; they were the yoke buckets; they belong to the regiment.</p>
               <p>After this little water that you say was thrown on this poor woman, you went to make a fire to dry yourselves? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay by the fire? - Till between eight and nine.</p>
               <p>What day of the month was it? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>What month was it in? - I cannot recollect; I am no scholar.</p>
               <p>You made a pretty good fire? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You dried yourselves well? - Yes, dried her; she was perfectly dry by nine o'clock; the hay-rick was very nigh the stables; we crept in between the ricks, there we slept; it had been a very wet night; the rain did not come between the two hay-ricks; but when she found she grew worse, she got out, and lay at a distance from the ricks.</p>
               <p>What time of night was that? - I do not know; I left her between one and two on the next morning; I was very wet and lay at the same end as she did; but there was not room enough for us both; the wet did not come in upon her, but it came in upon me, and I went to look for a better place; she kept in that place till she found herself worse; I do not know what time she got out; I found her laying under the rick, under the place where I left her; the water must come upon her.</p>
               <p>How long had you been in that situation before the morning? - I cannot tell, we found her in the wet after she was dead, and the place she was dead in, was quite exposed to the weather.</p>
               <p>I understood you to say, you had nothing for two or three days except those three rolls? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Had you no drink? - We had none but what was brought up to us; Adams brought us some water, and this man brought us some water.</p>
               <p>Was not Adams there the whole time of this story that you tell us? - No, Sir, he was not; we desired Oates in the morning to bring us some water, and he did; we told him we were dry.</p>
               <p>Did not the prisoner Oates when he came up complain that you had littered the hay about? - He said nothing to me about it.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you by laying there you spoiled the hay for the horses? - No, he did not; we had no ill words not difference; when they pelted us going out, we said nothing at all to them; then we went quietly away.</p>
               <p>Court. How long had you been laying about there? - I came from Windsor.</p>
               <p>Do you know how long the other woman had been laying about there? - She had been a long time in Windsor.</p>
               <p>Had she the bad distemper? - No, she had not.</p>
               <p>Had you? - No, Sir; nor they did not offer to meddle or make with us at all.</p>
               <p>Had you been with these soldiers? - No, Sir, nor I had not been in their company to be misused before.</p>

               <p>I live at Mr. Shipcot's; I am a chaise washer; on Wednesday morning, I was going in our yard, and I heard somebody talk up in the lost; I went up and I saw two women and two soldiers; I came down again, between three and four in the afternoon; the soldiers went to the stables, and I saw the prisoners carry water between three and four, up into the stable, and they threw it over the women, for what I saw; for I saw the women come out in less than a quarter of an hour, very wet.</p>
               <p>Court. Both of them very wet? - Both of them very wet; they came through our hog yard, and the prisoners threw a parcel of dung and muck at the girls; the prisoners horses were quartered at our house; the women went out of the yard; they were very wet and dirty.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any thing else? - Yes; just as I had got out of the yard, Oates took a handful of dung and muck out of a gulley, and threw it against Oliver, the side of her face, and one of the prisoners followed her, and said, he had well jobbed her; I saw no more; the next morning I was called as I was going in our yard, between seven and eight; says they here is somebody wants you up here; so I went up into our rick yard, and this poor girl lay dead; the other girl, Barrows, was on the other side of the rick; I did not see her then, the other people saw her; I suppose she might lay with her head, three or four feet from the rick, with her feet towards the rick, and her head out from it; she was laying dead on her left side.</p>
               <p>Mr. Graham. She was quite exposed to the weather? - Quite; not at all covered with the rick.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night had it been? - A very misling night; it rained in the morning when I waked; I know nothing about the wind; I did not hear at all what they said together, or what the women said; I heard no words; the deceased girl went out very quietly, because she could hardly walk; I saw three or four pails; they were carried; they were put into the lost; the horses were quartered at our house; this was about the time of feeding them; the men used to feed them; they got the hay out of the lost; the two men were standing up; the women were laying down; the hay was laid all spread about, and they were laying higgledy piggledy on this hay.</p>
               <p>Court. Do they water in the stable or fetch their horses out to water? - They water in the stable; it was watering time.</p>
               <p>Then this water was got for the purpose of watering the horses, though they put it to another purpose? - I do not know what they got it for.</p>
               <p>Were the other soldiers watering their horses? - They were all watering together,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250059"/> some in one stable, and some in another.</p>
               <p>- DEGGE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon at Isleworth; I examined the body of this unfortunate woman after her death; my observations were, that this woman was loaded with diseases, venereal, billious, flux, and an ill state of her lungs.</p>
               <p>Was the venereal disease in a considerable degree? - Her lungs were ulcerated and decayed.</p>
               <p>Was there any external marks of violence in any part of her body? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Graham. No bruises of any kind? - None to be seen; I examined her the next day.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the state of her bowels? - Yes, I examined them particularly; I found it was the chief disease of which she died.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you determine the time in which this woman would have died, if the water that had been thrown over her had aggravated her disorder; can you take upon you to say, in what time the death would have happened? - Yes, I think I can; for if this woman had died soon after this water was thrown over her, the death would have been by throwing water upon her; but she laid six or seven hours after.</p>
               <p>Do you think that that hastened her death? - Not in the least, it could not hasten her death.</p>
               <p>Have you always been of this opinion? - Exactly, always of the same opinion.</p>
               <p>You was examined before the Coroner? - I was so.</p>
               <p>Was you of opinion that this venereal taint was an old one or a very recent one? - An old one.</p>
               <p>Then it did not occasion her death? - It did not.</p>
               <p>Could you tell whether the billious complaint was of long standing? - I could see very plainly that the billious complaint was of long standing, and that there was very plain appearances of a mortification.</p>
               <p>Might not these symptoms have been matured, and increased by this treatment? - They would if she had died soon after, but as she lived they could not; there is a great difference between one and two hours, and six or seven hours.</p>
               <p>If she had died two hours earlier, should you have thought that was the cause of her death? - I expected her to die in a quarter of an hour, or half an hour.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to state at a professional man, that that would have been the case; would it not depend on the degree of sickness or weakness? - It would not; if a person receives an injury by water, certainly he should die soon after.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did it ever happen to you to be exposed to a hard shower of rain? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Wet through? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not die in an hour after? - No.</p>
               <p>Did all your patients under venereal complaints die in half an hour when they were wet through? - I certainly will make some allowance, if a sick person of that kind should be taken care of, and receive proper nourishment, and should die, then I would alledge it to be entirely owing to the wet.</p>
               <p>Suppose she should get her clothes thoroughly dry again, what should you think of it then, might not that delay the death a little? - My observation is this, that if a sick person gets wet, and this wet hastens his death, he probably will feel the effects of this wet in half an hour or an hour.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon at Isleworth, I inspected this body, there was no appearance of injury internal or external on the head, or any part of the body.</p>
               <p>You opened the head? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you find the brain inflamed or otherwise? - Not at all, it was in a perfect state, opened the body, the liver was in a sound state, the gall bladder rather more extended than common, the lungs in a very disased state and knotty, the stomach and the whole of the intestines perfectly empty, the extremity of the rectum a good<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250060"/> deal inflamed for two or three or perhaps four inches.</p>
               <p>What did you take that to have proceeded from? - From a billious flux.</p>
               <p>Could you judge whether that flux had been of a long continuance? - I should judge so, I cannot say whether days or hours; she had the appearance of an old venereal complaint.</p>
               <p>If a woman in that situation should have a quantity of cold water poured upon her, and then be exposed to the weather in inclement weather, do you think that would have increased the symptoms and have hastened her death? - It might.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing that would have induced you to expect the death so soon. - She might not have survived so long.</p>
               <p>Might she have survived two or three days? - It is hard to say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Graham. Suppose such a person was to lay out all night exposed to the weather, would that occasion her death? - It might.</p>
               <p>Court. Did it? - I should rather ascribe it to being exposed to the inclemency of the weather; there were all the symptoms of an old grievance and gradual decay, that could not be the effect of having water an hour or two before.</p>
               <p>Court. You mean to say that there were appearances that might have accelerated her death? - Yes.</p>

               <p>In general terms during the time you have known them what has been their character? - Three of the best men in the regiment since I have known them; since they have been in my command I never knew them in a fault, nor in any scrape; I came here to day attended by every officer of the regiment that are off duty, on purpose to give every testimony in their favour; they are men in whom I have placed great confidence, and I believe them perfectly incapable of doing any such thing.</p>

            ; on the 30th of September, I had been out to Covent-Garden market, and was returning into Bloomsbury, between eight and nine, where I live, two girls passed me and returned into the middle of the street, and the tallest of the girls struck at me, I was on the foot-path, the tallest of the two attempted to strike me, I shrunk back, I received a blow on my nose and the side of my face; she struck me again, and I received a blow on my neck near my throat, with her hand, with her fist; at the same time, the same person that struck me tore my locket from my handkerchief, and my handkerchief all down, she ran by me and went towards Covent-Garden; I was stupified with the blow for a moment, I did not call out for any assistance, but on recovering myself I turned round and saw she had turned into the Pizzas, I saw my locket in her hand with a piece of my handkerchief, she turned round and d - d me for a b - h, and held up her fist.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - It might be half an hour or thirty-five minutes after eight.</p>
               <p>You spoke of two of them? - Yes, the other stood by the side of me all the time, but did not meddle with me at all; she did not offer to assist me nor make her escape.</p>
               <p>Did she go away when the tall one went off? - No, she stood still.</p>
               <p>Have you any thing to say against the woman at the bar? - I will not swear to her, but I believe she is the woman.</p>
               <p>How soon after did you see her? - That was on the Saturday evening, and I saw her on the Monday night at the watch-house in company with two more; I saw the locket before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Did she say any thing to you before she struck you? - Nothing to the best of my remembrance.</p>
               <p>Had you pushed against her, or any thing of that kind? - No, I saw them there and gave way; they came from behind me, they went on before to the dark part of the street, and turned back and met me, by that time I was got to the dark part of Hart-street, which leads into <placeName id="t17861025-25-crimeloc145">James's-street</placeName>

            ; then we crossed all three of us into James's-street, and went to the wine vaults; I asked the other girl if she would go home, and she said yes; so, says the girl at the bar, I will go see you to the top of James-street, and before ever we got to the top of James-street, the lady laid hold of me; I asked her what was the matter; she said she was robbed of her handkerchief; then I went through the Piazzas and I met the prisoner, and she shewed me the handkerchief pin, and she wanted me to lay hold of it in my hand, but I would not: immediately then I went through the Piazzas and went home.</p>
               <p>How came she by that handkerchief-pin? - I do not know indeed.</p>
               <p>Where was the prisoner before the lady laid hold of you? - She was in James-street, she was about a yard and a half off, I saw her do nothing to the lady; the lady told me that the prisoner snatched the pin out of her bosom; she ran away in the space of two minutes before the lady laid hold of me, the lady was close to me at the time the prisoner ran away; I did not see any thing done to her.</p>
               <p>What became of that handkerchief pin? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What sort of a thing was it? - I only just saw it in her hand, it was all round trimmed with white stones, it glistened very much, I thought it had been diamonds.</p>

               <p>Does that happen sometimes? - Yes, sometimes, according how the bells are fixed; about half an hour after the last tingle, I heard a crash in the kitchen window where I lay; I heard the shutter fall in, and some plates fall; I sleep in the kitchen below; and I got up, I put on my stockings and breeches, and went up stairs and rang the parlour bell; nobody came down; I went up and told my father that somebody had broke into the house, and I looked out at the garret window and I saw the shutters of the kitchen pulled off; about half an hour after, I went down in the two pair of stairs room; and then I heard the plates crack again, which I thought was somebody coming in; when I was opening the two pair of stairs door, I heard like the handle of a drawer go; I said, there is somebody in the house, for they are at the drawers.</p>
               <p>Where did that noise seem to proceed from? - From a room that adjoins to the parlour; my father and me went down stairs, and looked about the parlour; we went into the surgery, and found the door open, and a green slider taken from off the drawer; says I, there certainly must be somebody in the house, for they have pulled this drawer out; there was a shutter that gives light to this room; I saw some clothes packed up, and a chair cover; they were laying on a chair in the study; I was going into the study, and the door would not go back; says I, there is something behind the door; I looked behind the door, and I saw the prisoner behind the door; with that he came out, and he said, let me go out, let me go out; my father and me would not let him go out; he had a scuffle in the passage; and there is a hatch door with spikes, and he tried to pitch my father's head on these spikes; I had a piece of marble hearth in my hand, and I hit him over the head with that, and staggered him; he recovered that, and ran to the street door, and tried to get out; my father ran to the door, and snatched the key out; then I ran to the parlour window, and opened it and let in a person; then he was quiet; he was taken into the parlour; in two minutes, he said, let me go, you have not got a constable; I got a constable and took him to the watch-house; I examined the kitchen window, and the bar of the window was broke near the middle; the sash was not fastened, so that he lifted that up.</p>
               <p>Is there an area to your kitchen? - Yes, he got down into the area; the bar is here; the things that were packed up were two coats, and two waistcoats belonging to my father.</p>
               <p>Was it day-light? - It was day-light when he was taken in the house.</p>
               <p>Was it day-light when he broke in? - It was twilight.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not the gentleman take his oath at the office that it was half past<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250074"/> six? - I took my oath it was between the hours of four and six.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I desire you will enquire into this young man's character; here are people now in Court to prove, that he has been committed for robbing a man of his watch.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you the impudence to talk about a man's character, when you was caught in the house, how came you into the house? you ought to have some sense of your own condition!</p>

               <p>At about half after five I received the prisoner into custody; I locked him up safe; I attended the best part of the day, and in the evening I saw many different people there; in the evening I applied to our clerk to have assistance; I thought I should not be safe; accordingly he ordered me to get three or four men; when I came back I got one Johnson, one of our patrols, and several of our neighbours came along with me; when I opened the watch-house door, the iron wicket door was broke down on the ground; one of the staples of the lock-up door was drawn; the cross bar that goes across, that was likewise knocked down; I looked at him, says I, my friend, you have been at work here, you must have some working tools; I must see what sort of working tools you have; he looks through the wicket door at me, says he, d - n your eyes, the first man that enters in here to me shall be a dead man; and I says to our patrol, draw your cutlass, and we will see who is to be the dead man; he drew his cutlass, and I said, if you see him lift up his hand, cut him; three or four of us went in and searched him, and I looked down and found this large iron crow; I imagine it had been handed through the door; the watch-house is contiguous to the street, and has iron bars about an inch asunder.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Boyden. Did not you say, that if I would give you three guineas, you would let me go? - Never was any such proposal; I have been thirteen years watch-house keeper.</p>

               <p>Answer the question, what are they worth to be disposed of? - They may be referred to any gentleman; I am upon the point of taking a man's life though he had no mercy upon me.</p>
               <p>What did you pay for them? - Four pounds ten shillings, when I have the breeches to them they generally put six pounds to me.</p>

               <p>I live at Stoke Newington; I bought a bullock, on the 11th of September, in Smithfield market, of Mr. Ireland; I went to breakfast between seven and eight, and when I came from breakfast about half after eight or nine, I met a butcher, and he said, is this your Scot? it is a little wildish, I would have you take care of him; I said I did not know of it; accordingly I went to the bullock, and the two prisoners stood at the hind part of the bullock, I looked at it, and either one or both of the prisoners persuaded me to have it locked up at one of the inns, and I gave then a pint of beer to lock it up.</p>
               <p>Can you tell which or them it was that persuaded you? - I cannot say indeed; I gave the pint of beer to one of them, I cannot tell which, they said they would put it into the Bell, I went to pay for it at the Bull's Head, and in about ten minutes I came to see about it, and I was told it was run away, when I had stood a minute or two, there was a mob of people coming back, with a poor man brought on a window shutter through Smithfield, which very greatly surprized me, I made all the baste I could home, directly I rode after the bullock to Holloway turnpike, I enquired about him, and found it was gone to Holloway; I found it laid down by a little public house on this side Holloway, on the right hand side of the way, I understood it had run at some people, and there it sell; I ordered my man to cut the tail a little bit, and it bled a little, but we could not get it up till we killed it, and we brought it to Islington; I meant to order it to the Bell till my own drover, who was a careful man, came from Stoke Newington, who would drive it carefully.</p>
               <p>These men had your authority and consent to carry it to the Bell-Inn? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is the name of the butcher that gave you advice to take care of it? - Mr. Peach of Shoreditch; the person of whom I bought it said he was not subpoened, and would not come; the salesman said he knew nothing of it, he told me repeatedly that he had not the least knowledge of it's being vicious, but the prisoners did.</p>

               <p>On Monday morning the 11th of September, I went to cheapen a bullock just by where this wild bullock stood, and this Plata, the prisoner, and another says, do not go nigh that bullock it is mad, it is wild, for I am obliged to tie it up with a double rope, or it would run at any thing when it came into Smithfield; I said to him if that is the case you should secure it before you take it off from the rails, that it may not do any mischief; he made no answer; I drew off for about half an hour, after that the two prisoners at the bar had got this bullock untied and loose, one was at the head and the other at the tail of it after it was loose from the rail, the prisoner Parker with a stick took and pricked it, and forced it almost upon me, indeed I was but a little way from it; after that he kept following close to the tail of it, and spurring it with his stick, forcing it away, forcing it on, with that I followed him, I saw what he was after, and he kept pricking it the same till he forced it away from the other beasts, with that it took to it's heels and ran up St. John's-street, and the two prisoners after it; I said to the person that stood by, that bullock will do some mischief which these rascals are after; I had not spoke a quarter of an hour before the poor man, Messenger, was brought back with his bowels out, carrying to the hospital; I understood the bullock was followed to Holloway and brought back to Islington; I went up to Islington in the afternoon to see whether the bullock was the same, and I found it was the same; coming to the hospital to see how the poor man did, I saw Parker in Long-lane, Smithfield, and I said to him you must be a very bad man to take this bullock out knowing it to be wild, whereby this poor man will lose his life; he gave me a good deal of abuse and ill language, and told me that he should have one of mine hunted off before a month's time; I said no more to him but I came away.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250082"/>Court. Did Parker hear what Plato said to you about going near the beast? - I do not know, he was not near at the time.</p>
               <p>Is the pricking and goading of bullocks at all necessary to force them from the rest of the beasts? - In order to separate them from the others, they do sometimes.</p>
               <p>Suppose for instance, they were going to put that bullock up at the Bell, would it have been necessary to prick it, and force it, to get into the yard? - No, my Lord, because I should take some others with it, and there were two other beasts with it.</p>
               <p>Jackson. My Lord, they said they would take two other beasts with it, in order to secure it.</p>
               <p>To Blackwell. Then there were three beasts loose in all? - Yes, I look upon it, that this bullock would not have gone away from the rest, if it had not been forced by the ill usage from this drover.</p>
               <p>Then supposing their business was to have driven the three beasts to the Bell Inn, in your judgement was they conducting them properly, in forcing them with their sticks? - Undoubtedly they were doing wrong, for they forced it in such a manner, that they forced it away from the others.</p>
               <p>Where was Plato at the time that Parker was urging the beast on? - He was on one side of him; Plato was keeping them together.</p>
               <p>Then according to you account, Plato was doing what he ought to do? - He was not doing any thing wrong in forcing it away, only knowing the bullock to be mad, he was forcing it from the rails.</p>
               <p>These drovers are dextrous fellows in the management of their beasts? - They do a great deal of mischief; they very often trust too much to their dexterity; this man Mr. Jackson lost three or four pounds by the bullock; it was not fit for any use at all.</p>
               <p>Court. How far did he follow the bullock in your sight? - He followed it quite out of Smithfield.</p>

               <p>What do you mean by daring? - Wavering his hat backwards and forwards, whether to keep the bullock from himself or no, I do not know: after it was dared a little time, the bullock ran between the post and the house, and this man that was behind the post, slipped on one side into the street, that goes into the high way, and the deceased was coming just to the corner, and the bullock caught him, and smacked him against the wall, and he tumbled down; and as soon as ever the bullock had done that, he set up the street as hard as he could run; and the man got on his hands and knees, and leaned against the wall, till assistance came to him; the man was taken to the hospital afterwards; I know the man's son very well, but I did not know it was the father till it was done; his name is Messenger; I saw him in the hospital after he was dead, the night the Coroner sat upon him.</p>

               <p>On Monday the 11th of September last, a little after nine in the morning, I was desired to attend an accident in St. Bartholomew's hospital; I immediately went, and found the deceased in bed, with a large wound on the lower part of the right side of his belly, through which about two-thirds of his intestines protruded; they were soon after returned, and the wound was sewed up; he lay in great<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250083"/> agonies, till between four and five the following day, and then expired.</p>

               <p>Court. How came you, after the caution you had, when you knew that the bullock was wild, how came you to loosen it, without it's being properly secured? - Mr. Jackson knows that he told me, if I would take it off for him, he would be obliged to me.</p>
               <p>The question I ask you is, why you loosed him wholly, why you did not hamper him immediately? - That bullock, if he had been left to myself, I could have drove him twenty miles with any two or three beasts, had he not been pricked about the market; the bullock was not half so wild as they say he was, when he was against the rails; here is a man at the door who tied him up; Mr. Jackson gave me a penny three farthings, and promised to give me more.</p>
               <p>Did not Parker lend you a hand to drive him? - He lent me a hand to put it up in the yard, but it was more than we both could do.</p>

            's master, Mr. Ireland, he came to me and asked me for two beasts, says Plato, I have got a beast here that is wildish, I wish you would help me, for the butcher has given me a pint of beer to lock him up; he did not say what butcher; nor I did not go; I lent him two beasts, and in going along the carts and coaches made such a noise, that it drove one of mine along with it, and it took up St. John's-street, and mine with it, and I went and fetched mine back; presently the man was brought back killed; I verily believe Plato is innocent of it; he begged and prayed of the people not to make a noise, but to let it alone; I never saw any thing of Parker; nor to my knowledge I never saw him at all with the bullock.</p>
               <p>Did you see Mr. Blackwell? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Court to Blackwell. Did you see that man there? - No, Sir, I did not see him at all.</p>
               <p>Was there nobody to take care of these other two beasts? - I do not know that there were; I saw nobody but the two prisoners after the three beasts; I have seen Lee in Smithfield; I do not know his station; nor I do not remember seeing Smith in Smithfield at all.</p>
               <p>Court to Smith. Who was you employed for? - For Messrs. Boys and Ure, in Rose-street, Newgate-market.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Plato. It being Saturday, there is no other butcher here; Mr. Blackwell knows me very well; I have been in the market sixteen years; I have a wife and three children.</p>
               <p>Blackwell. As to his general behaviour I do not know any thing at all; they are all very bad fellows, and sometimes they act with a great deal of cruelty to the cattle, and if we say any thing to them, we only get ill will, and abosive language.</p>
               <p>Court. Is it a very common thing to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250085"/> tie beasts, or do they depend on their skill in general? - If they take them out they generally cut them down or disable them, or hamstring them, or tie them by the horn of the head; but the proper method when a bullock is mad as this was, is to have him confined; Plato told me it was wild, and says he, I am obliged to tie it up with two ties.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Plato. I declare to God, I never saw Mr. Blackwell, so help me God Almighty.</p>
               <p>Lee. The bullock was wild at Boston, in Lincolnshire; he ran at a country drover, so he told me over night; but the bullock was pretty well then; it came very well along with the rest of the beasts; we had a bullock yesterday, and after his fellow bullocks ran away from him, he was as mad as a March hare almost; he was killed directly; we always tell a butcher when he is wild.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, this is perfectly a new case in practice; though the principle of law is by no means new; the principle of law undoubtedly is, that if any man wilfully and maliciously drives a beast which he knows to be wild and mischievous into a crowd of people, meaning to do mischief, that such a man will be answerable for all the consequences that that act produced, and that if a passenger is go- red passing by, by a bullock under those circumstances, and dies of a wound, it will be murder in the person who is the cause of it, by that wilful and malicious act, which had a necessary tendency to do wilful and bodily harm to whoever should meet that beast: This is certainly a principle of the law of England; at the same time, that I do not know that there has been any instance that has fallen within that principle in my experience; it is therefore extremely necessary to be careful what to do; to understand very well the correct state of the matter of fact; and also to attend closely and minutely to the principle of law; now this indictment seems to me to have very properly stated the charge, by way of application to that general principle, and it therefore states, that these two men did wilfully and maliciously, knowing this to be a wild and mischievous beast, loosen him, and drive him, and goad him through the market, by which this mischief was consequently produced; that the beast by being so drove, ran against this unhappy man, and gored him in the belly, of which he died: the constituent parts of the charge are first, that they knew this beast was mischievous; in the next place, that they loosened him for a mischievous purpose, intending to do mischief; and in the next place, that having loosened him, they drove him in a malicious and mischievous manner through the market, which irritated him so as to induce him to commit the mischief as followed. As to the matter of fact, the representation of the fact is unfortunately very different, by different witnesses; therefore you are to ascertain the fact in the best manner you can, as you must, where it does happen that the representation differs, as I am afraid you will find it does in this case: You must therefore judge for yourselves, and determine what is the precise state of the fact before you can go a step farther. According to the account given by the prisoners two witnesses, the prisoner Parker, who is charged by the witnesses on the part of the prosecution, as most active and mischievous, appears not to be there at all, which flatly contradicts Mr. Blackwell, who represents Parker, as taking pains to get him to do mischief; you have therefore the disagreeable circumstance to collect the fact, and to apply it to the rules of law, upon which the quality of the offence must be tried and determined; there is no remedy but patient and cool consideration of the evidence, to see where the truth is most likely to lay; you must do that in this case; you must first of all determine whether you believe Blackwell, or these two drovers; if you believe these two drovers, I hardly think there is any room to impute any offence whatever to the prisoners; because though the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250086"/> beast was a wildish beast, yet the manner of taking two other beasts to go along with him, seems a reasonable care, if not quite sufficient: It is not very unreasonable, if their representation be true, to believe that the drovers did really think they should be able to manage the beast very well, and that no harm would ensue: on the other hand if you should be of opinion that the representation made by Blackwell is the truth, and that the drovers have sworn falsely; to be sure that alters the case; and if you should be persuaded that the prisoner Parker (for Blackwell does not charge Plato with any thing more than a knowledge that the bullock was wild) had so infernal a mischief in his head, as to wish to provoke this beast, in order to drive him mad, in order to make him do mischief to some person, for the abominable entertainment it would afford him and the mob; I do not see how the crime can fall short with respect to him of that of murder; but with respect to Plato, the most that can be urged against him is, that he knew the state of this beast, and to be sure where the neglect is very gross, it will sometimes amount to the crime of manslaughter, as where a man drives furiously along the street and drives over any person; but you must suppose him to drive at people to make it amount to murder; on the other hand, if the true complection of the case is, that Mr. Blackwell has seen it in a little too strong a light with regard to Parker, and that he is not warranted in his conclusion, to use that expression which he used,</p>

               <p>"of seeing what he meant to be at;" and that Parker, though not so careful as he ought to have been, only tried to get the beast to the place of his destination; then there would be a ground to take the middle course, and to say, that as to Parker, he would be guilty of the other crime of manslaughter, and as to Plato, if you should be of opinion, that he cannot be excused for trusting to his dexterity, he may be guilty of manslaughter also; it ought to be a very strong plain case of wilful and intentional mischief, that should lead you to carry this to the utmost strictness against these prisoners: To the nature of their business some indulgence should be given; men like them fall into habits of unnecessary severity, very often without much malignity of heart; men in such situations acquire dangerous and bad habits; they are not to be tolerated to be sure, but at the same time, when the question turns upon the malignity of the heart, there are some allowances to be made; you would not understand their language nor perhaps their actions exactly in the same manner as those of persons in a different situation; and if the case admits of any shadow of doubt and of difficulty, it will be a reason for you to moderate it into that, which is most likely to be the case nine times out of ten; that is the case in which they drive their cattle, incautiously trusting to their own superior skill in managing them, and behaving criminally negligent. It seems as if it would ultimately resolve itself into a question for your consideration; whether these prisoners can be said to be free from all blame, so as to lead you to acquit them all together; or whether they are guilty of manslaughter. Not guilty generally would be the opinion that my mind would go to principally: You however are the judges; if you find clear wilful deliberate malice against every body, in their conduct; and that they, with a view to do mischief, let this beast loose, on purpose to enjoy the fun of doing mischief, and this man lost his life in consequence of it; undoubtedly they may be reached to the full extent of the crime of murder: If you think it approaches more to the other crime in which there is neglect and incaution and rashness, but not deliberate malice; then they will be responsible for the crime of manslaughter: If you are of opinion that they have acted with a reasonable degree of caution, though not with all the caution that every prudent man would take, and that the beasts ran wild by others exciting them, and not by the prisoners themselves, then I think<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250087"/> the prisoners will be entitled to your acquittal.</p>

               <p>Would it not have been very easy to put a new name piece, with a new name, and in which there would have been no scratching, if any body had wished to have done it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Prosecutor. It was a great while after you was robbed, before you had any intelligence at all of this clock? - Oh, several months.</p>
               <p>How long have you known Athill? - I have known him by sight some time, but did not know what he was, any further than he told me he was a weaver.</p>
               <p>Had Athill occasion to come to your house? - He had.</p>
               <p>Had he been there frequently? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How frequently before your house was was broke open had he been there? - Several times for one thing or another, but whether he had been there two or three days before, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was he there frequently after the robbery? - Mrs. Athill has been there since, but I do not remember seeing him since: Mrs. Cockvine used to come there before.</p>
               <p>You never suspected Mr. Athill of stealing your clock? - No, Sir, never.</p>
               <p>You did not know so much of him then, as you do now? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you ever mention the loss of your clock to him? - Never till I went to New Prison; I said I valued the clock more than any thing else; I have said so to Athill no doubt.</p>
               <p>How near did he live to you? - Within a hundred yards, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>It was impossible for any body within one hundred yards not to know it? - They advised me to advertise it, but I would not.</p>
               <p>Did Athill so advise you? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I delivered this clock to Mr. Armstrong.</p>
               <p>How came you by it? - I bought it of the prisoners at the bar; they were all three present when they brought it to my house the latter end of March, or the beginning of April, I cannot be certain, it was in the night time; it was dark I think.</p>
               <p>What part of your house did they come to you? - I have a bell at the chamber window, and I heard it ring, and I went down and opened the street door, and the three prisoners were at the door, and they had this clock with them, and some other things; and they came up to the chamber to me; there was a silver tankard, and some spoons, and a pair of salts, and several other things that I cannot recollect now; they asked me to weigh the silver, and I did, and paid them for it; then they asked me if I would buy the clock; I told them I could not pay them any money for it, because I did not know the value of it; they said they would leave it with me till I did; when they were going away, they desired me to get the things out of the house as soon as I could, for they came from a near neighbour of mine; I asked them who it was, and they said Mr. Leachman; they said they broke into the window-shutter; and Udney said he was obliged to creep over a great deal of lumber in the cellar, and his coat was all over cobwebs; I met Udney three or four days after, and I paid him fifty shillings for the clock, at the White-hart, in Webb-square, Shoreditch.</p>
               <p>How long have you known these men? - A good many years.</p>
               <p>All of them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where was Mrs. Cockvine during this time? - She was in the room with me, but not when I paid for the clock.</p>
               <p>Did she sleep in the same room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was she up, or in bed? - She was sitting up in the bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250089"/>She did not get up then? - No, not at that time.</p>
               <p>You went down and let them in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Jury. Do you know this gentleman? have you seen him before? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then it was the other Jury; I must ask him a few questions for your information.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Athill. How many trials have you been a witness on this session? - This is the third trial I believe.</p>
               <p>On each of those trials, you told us you was a notorious receiver of stolen goods? - I own I have been very bad, and my Lord knows it.</p>
               <p>Who is Mrs. Cockvine, is that my old client, the wife of

            ? - I fancy it is.</p>
               <p>Fancy! why do not you know whether it is or no; I could tell him myself, but I am afraid, I am bound to secrecy: you told my friend the other day I believe you had been in trouble? - I did.</p>
               <p>You have been in custody very often? - I have.</p>
               <p>In your youth, you told him you had been very bad indeed; then you got a little better, then became very bad again for the last twelve months? - I own to the Court that I am not a person that has done right.</p>
               <p>Do not you own to the Court that you are a person to whom no sort of credit is due? - I cannot say any thing about that.</p>
               <p>In the course of the last twelve months, how many burglaries have you planned, and recommended.</p>
               <p>Court. That is not a fair question.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You gave fifty shillings for this clock? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The full value? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Is it worth less than ten pounds? - I really cannot tell; I do not know the value.</p>
               <p>This little bell at your window, it is to give an alarm in case of fire? - No, it was in case I was wanted.</p>
               <p>Why are you a public officer? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you mean it as the bell for thieves to ring at, when they have brought stolen goods? - They did ring at it.</p>
               <p>How long had the bell been up? - At that time, about three or four months.</p>
               <p>How far did the prosecutor live from your house? - How far!</p>
               <p>Ay; is it as far as from here to Newgate? that is a distance you know? - A couple of hundred yards.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the prosecutor? - Five or six and twenty years; I have been at his house scores of times; I never heard from him that his house was broke open; I heard it talked in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Did you give him his clock again? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>When for the first time did you tell it? - I told it when I was apprehended; I voluntarily delivered it.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you discover that cock to save the life of yourself and Mrs. Cockvine? did not you know if it was found in your possession, you were liable to be indicted for the burglary? - I made a discovery as soon as I was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you make the discovery for fear of being hanged? - I did not do it to save my own life, nor Mrs. Cockvine's; I did not think of being hanged.</p>
               <p>Had you ever told any body that Leachman's was a good house to do? - No, Sir, upon my oath I never did.</p>
               <p>How lately had you been there before it had been robbed? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Was not you there the evening of the day preceding the robbery? - No, Sir, that I was not in the evening.</p>
               <p>Was you not there in the course of the day? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Tuesday before? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Had you any talk about Mr. Leachman's house with Mrs. Cockvine in your life? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Did you ever say he does not keep his doors fast; it is very likely his house may be robbed? - No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250090"/>What made you go to Leachman's? - To buy bobbins.</p>
               <p>As you are very much interested in what his Lordship has said to you, did you attend to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you hear his Lordship observe to you, that no questions that we could put to you, could make you more infamous than your own account of yourself? - (No answer.)</p>
               <p>I hope this is the last trial you are to come upon? - I hope so, Sir.</p>
               <p>Court to Athill. I will say to you, in consequence of the last question that was put to you, that I hope it will be the last time, because you never can come as a witness any more, and therefore you must come as a criminal, and if you do, the world cannot save you; therefore remember, let nothing tempt you to do wrong again? - No, my Lord, never.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I lived with Mr. Athill; I know this clock.</p>
               <p>How came it to Athill's house? - The three prisoners brought it six or seven months ago, as near as I can say.</p>
               <p>By day or by night? - By night.</p>
               <p>How got they in? - They rung a bell at the door, that leads up to the chamber window.</p>
               <p>Whose chamber window? - In the chamber where we lay.</p>
               <p>Who do you mean by we? - Mr. Athill and myself; when they rung the bell, we got up; Mr. Athill went down stairs, and let them in.</p>
               <p>What part of the house did they come in? - They came in at the street door, and came up one pair of stairs where we lay.</p>
               <p>Did you get up? - I did not, I lay still in bed; the prisoners, I cannot say which of them it was, pulled out of his pocket, a silver tankard, and two table spoons, a tea-spoon or two, a pair of salt-cellars, and this clock besides; the plate was bought and paid for, and the clock was not.</p>
               <p>Why was not the clock paid for? - He said he was not a judge of such things, till he shewed it to somebody that was a better judge than himself.</p>
               <p>As it was not paid for, did they leave or take it away with them, till it should be paid for? - No, they left it.</p>
               <p>Was it paid for? - I cannot say, I did not see the clock paid for afterwards.</p>
               <p>Had you any knowledge of these men before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which of them? - A ll three of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I have only one or two questions to ask you; how long have you lived with Athill? - Fourteen or fifteen years.</p>
               <p>You have known all his dealings exactly? - Yes, I was not present when the money was paid; I heard mention where the clock came from.</p>
               <p>How many clocks had you when he was apprehended? - Only this and a little one in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>What reason did he give you for his keeping this? - No reason.</p>
               <p>Did he not tell you it would be convenient to have a piece of evidence against these men to save his life? - No.</p>
               <p>Who christened it? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was it done at home or abroad? - I believe it was taken out.</p>
               <p>Who performed that operation? - I really do not know.</p>
               <p>Was this clock at home when he was taken into custody? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Where was it? - At an acquaintance's.</p>
               <p>Who is that acquaintance? - Why, Sir, he is a good way off from here.</p>
               <p>I do not care where he is, I want to know who he is? - It was at my sister's husband's.</p>
               <p>Where does she live? - Down at Shadwell; his name is

            , he never was in trouble an hour.</p>
               <p>It was at her house when you was taken in custody? - It was, I sent for it; I took it home myself from their house, nobody desired me to take it, I took a coach and took it home from my sister's.</p>
               <p>Was it christened before you took it to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250091"/> your sisters? - Yes, it was; it had been there three or four months; I had not made a present of it, I gave it her to see if she could find a customer; my sister is dead and buried, she kept a chandler's shop; he is a waterman and lighterman.</p>
               <p>So you thought that a good situation to get a customer for this clock? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>How long was it at home? - Not a week in all.</p>
               <p>Who told you it would be better it should be found at your house than at any other place? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did not Athill tell you so? - He did not ever upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Did not he mention it till he was in custody? - I do not think he did; I was bailed out because I had two children dying.</p>
               <p>Did you find any of the plate? - No, Sir, it was sold; I have been at the prosecutor's house many times for some bobbins when I wanted them.</p>
               <p>How long is it since this house was done, that you and Athill had the conversation about the fastenings? - I never had any conversation about the fastenings, I did not know any thing at all about it's being done, not before the prisoners told me, when they brought the things, that they had done it just before they came; I heard the conversation pass, I recollect it perfectly.</p>

               <p>How did they get into the back kitchen? - They came out of the parlour into the back kitchen.</p>

               <p>Court. Can you shew that you bear a good one, that will be the best contradiction; and if he is so bad a man, how came you to be found at Ephraim's house in company with him? - I called there and he asked me to drink a glass of brandy, and then he sent for people to take me; Mr. Burgess came to me seven months ago, and he asked me if I would go and rob Cordwainers hall; I told him no, I was going to work; and I met him about six weeks after in the Temple, and he asked me then if I was at work, and I told him, yes; and he said he had got a good job for me to do; and he asked me, if I would go and rob (God bless my heart, I have forgot the name) it is an office in Bell-yard, the Bankrupts office; I told him, no, I would not, I was going to work; he said, he had several jobs for me to do in the city, if I would do it; I told him I would not.</p>
               <p>What is your way of living? because all this is of no use to you; if you had been a man of any character, he would not have proposed to you to go robbing? - My Lord, I am a carpenter by trade.</p>

               <p>Mr. Akerman. My Lord, here is a letter and a receipt on a stamp, for the horse; the prisoner begged I would give it into Court.</p>
               <p>(Handed up to the Court.)</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Is this your letter? - I have not seen it since I came here.</p>
               <p>Did not you write this letter to this man, telling him, if he could raise the money to save your recognizance, you would not appear against him? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>You wrote something very much like it.</p>
               <p>(Reads the letter.)</p>
               <p>"I received a line from your hands,</p>
               <p>"signifying your wish that I should not</p>
               <p>"appear against you, but as I am bound</p>
               <p>"in a bond of forty pounds, I must, without</p>
               <p>"you have friends that will discharge</p>
               <p>"my recognizance, and make up my loss;</p>


               <p>"I have not the least objection to hold</p>
               <p>"the hand of mercy out to save the life</p>
               <p>"of any man; though I cannot think</p>
               <p>"you innocent; and it is very hard that</p>
               <p>"men should be rifled of their property."</p>
               <p>Court. It was not a very wise thing in you to write such a letter, nor an honest thing, it was selling mercy for forty or fifty pounds, not recommending it; does it become a man do you think that means to protect his property, and that of other people's by prosecuting, to behave in such a manner? you have acted very ill, and very foolish indeed; let this letter be put into the Recorder's hands.</p>

               <p>How came you there at that time of night? - I had been at Brentford the day before, and I came to North-hall and then to Pinner, and then to Harrow; the people at the Swan told me their bed was taken up, and they could not accommodate me with a bed, but thought I could get a bed at the Black Horse, a house about half a mile distance; the two prisoners sat drinking in the room, I called for something to drink; I believe I might be in the house half an hour or three quarters; Rudd told me he was going that way, and he would shew me where the Black Horse was, as I was a stranger; accordingly he went out with me for that purpose, and I had not walked with him but a little way, but a few minutes, before I received a blow which deprived me of my senses, nobody was with me then but Rudd to the best of my knowledge; when I came to my senses I found my hands tied behind me, and my legs tied together, then I perceived Giggs on my left hand and Rudd on my right; they beat me very much, beyond what I am capable of saying, they beat me several times, I believe it might be ten minutes before I was robbed, or some such distance of time, I cannot be exact; Giggs unbuttoned the waistband of my breeches, and took my purse out of my right hand pocket, my penknife out of my left hand waistcoat pocket; there was six pounds odd shillings in my purse, as near as I can recollect it was six pounds five shillings.</p>
               <p>In what money? - In gold and silver.</p>
               <p>How many guineas? - I cannot be exact, there were some guineas, some half guineas, some shillings, and some half-crowns.</p>
               <p>What sort of a purse was it? - A silk purse with some orange in it, and the inside of it at one end is lined with some linen; they took some papers out of my left hand pocket, giving an account of the price of pins, my pocket-book was also<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250103"/> taken out, my shoes were taken off, and my hat, stock, and stock-buckle.</p>
               <p>What happened then, Sir? - Nothing but beating, that I can recollect particularly.</p>
               <p>What did they continue beating you after they had robbed you? - Yes, it appeared to me to be a club; one of the sticks that they beat me with I have great reason to believe was the stick I walked with.</p>
               <p>Was you struck with more sticks than one? - I received their blows with a stick with a club at the end, which seemed like the stick I walked with; Giggs was on my left hand when he beat me with the stick; I do not know what Rudd struck me with, but he struck me several times; I remained in this situation till one of them went away, that was Rudd, the other continued beating me till the landlord and landlady from the Swan came to my relief, then Giggs was standing by me; the landlord unbound me and conducted me to their house, where I staid all night; when they came up Giggs was close to me.</p>
               <p>Did he stay there? - A very little time; the landlord and he had some conversation, then he went away.</p>
               <p>Did Giggs go away before yo u was unbound or after? - I believe he did, I will not be particular.</p>
               <p>Did the landlord speak to you before he unbound you? - I cannot say; I spoke to him, I asked him whether they were people of that place; he said, yes; I begged of him for God's sake to unbind me, they unbound me and conducted me to their house.</p>
               <p>Did you receive any personal hurts by their beating? - Very bad, my Lord, so that nobody could suppose that I could survive it, in my head, my shoulders, my arms, my eyes, I am under the surgeon's hands now.</p>
               <p>Was you sober or in liquor? - I was sober at the time; I do business at North-hall, and at Harrow, and at Pinner; I could not get a lodging at Harrow, I called at one house there, Mr. Foster's: after he had taken my knife and unbuttoned my breeches, he cut off a part of the waistband, and cut off my pocket; and just as he had cut of part off my breeches, he took hold of my private parts with the knife in his hand.</p>
               <p>What, as if threatening to wound you? - I expected it, but I received no wound there.</p>
               <p>Which of them did that? - Giggs; I have my breeches and my shirt in Court.</p>
               <p>Did they say any thing at the time they did that? - They had a great deal of conversation, but I was so beat about the head I cannot recollect the discourse.</p>
               <p>Did they give any reason for that? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you and Rudd go out of the public road? - No, this was on the turnpike road, or on the grass adjoining to the turnpike road.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Mr. Turner, where did you say you lived? - In Bishopsgate-within.</p>
               <p>Are you married or a single man? - Married.</p>
               <p>Your wife lives there? - Yes, in Clark's Court, Bishopsgate-within; I keep goods there sometimes; I have part of a house.</p>
               <p>Are you the housekeeper? - We are lodgers.</p>
               <p>With whom do you lodge? - With

               <p>How long had you been from home when this accident happened? - I went out of town on Wednesday about four.</p>
               <p>Where might you lay on Wednesday night? - At the Red Lion at Brentford; I was at North-hall, three miles from Pinner, I walked from Brentford to North-hall, from thence to Pinner, and thence to Harrow, and from thence to the place where this happened; I was very sober, I had not been drinking at all.</p>
               <p>How many miles do you take it to be? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Where did you dine? - At a village between Brentford and North-hall; I do not know the name of it, it is near a common near the main road.</p>
               <p>How many miles from Brentford? - I do not know, I never was that way but once before; I believe it is three or four miles; I had no business there, I dined there.</p>
               <p>What time did you get there? - I do not recollect, it might be between eleven and twelve, or some such time that I dined, I bought half a pound of sausages at Brentford.</p>
               <p>What time did you arrive at the Swan at Subury Green? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Had you ever been at Sudbury Green in your life before? - Once before.</p>
               <p>At the Swan ever? - I called there once; I do not know the sign at Harrow where I applied for a lodging, it is kept by one Foster; I suppose it was a little six, it was a very clear evening.</p>
               <p>Closing in by that time I should think? - It was clear enough for me to see any body.</p>
               <p>That was not the object of my question; you asked no where else but chose to walk on to Sudbury Green? - I went out with the prisoner Rudd.</p>
               <p>You had a stick? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How did you carry it, under your coat? - No.</p>

               <p>Did not you instantly say to the landlord, for God's sake secure that villain, he has been murdering me almost? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Who fetched the landlord and landlady? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not Rudd fetch them, and do not you know it? - I did not see Rudd there the next morning; he was gone long enough to fetch the landlord and landlady.</p>

               <p>Will you swear you did not? - Swear, I did not if I had not a moment to live; I swear that positively, not at all.</p>
               <p>Now you describe the cutting of your clothes, and another act which you described; what conversation passed previous to that? - There was a conversation between them, but I cannot recollect what it was.</p>
               <p>Do not you recollect what Rudd said to Giggs about you before that? - No, I did not; I heard them converse together; I must hear them speak, but I cannot recollect what they said, I was very much intimidated.</p>
               <p>How long had you been drinking with them? - I did not drink with them; I asked the landlord if he knew these two men, for I did not like the looks of them; he told me they were neighbours which he had known many years; I thought myself very safe as they were very well known in the neighbourhood; he did not recommend them.</p>
               <p>It was perfectly well known in the house that Rudd was gone out with you? - Rudd desired Giggs to leave me; Giggs replied with an oath he would not.</p>

               <p>What was said besides? - It was let us leave him.</p>
               <p>Upon that he went away, and Giggs staid there doing nothing till the landlord came? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you cry out at all? - I did not cry out much; I said, for God's-sake do not murder me.</p>
               <p>How far had you got from the house? - Some little distance, it might be two or three hundred yards.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250105"/>Did not it occur to you that it was right to call out for assistance? - It did not, he had left off beating me when the landlord came.</p>

               <p>This Black-horse is in the road from your house to Harrow? - It is the next public house; it was above half a mile.</p>

               <p>Did he desire you to take Giggs when you came up? - No, Sir, if he had, I could not.</p>
               <p>You knew these two men very well? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long have you known them? - Ten or eleven years; Giggs has lived in our place all the time; I believe they were farmers men.</p>
               <p>What became of the pocket book? - My wife gave it to Rudd, and the shoes, to take back to the gentleman; when we came back, I found the shoes; they were laying by the side of the road by him.</p>
               <p>Where was this pocket book that was found? - Near to him, just by him, there was his buckle likewise.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any thing particular about any part of Mr. Turner's dress? - His shoes were off.</p>
               <p>Did any body point out any thing to you, before you untied him? - No, Sir; his hands were behind him, and I untied him.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any thing about his dress? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Were his knees unbuttoned? - No, Sir, his shoes were off.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250107"/>Were his stockings down? - His breeches were down; his breeches were undone in the waistband.</p>

               <p>Mr. Turner came to our house, and called for a pint of beer, and asked for a lodging, we had none; a person in the house said, he might get a lodging at the Black-horse; and Rudd said if he would give him a glass of any thing, he would see him safe there; he treated him with a pint of gin-hot; they both went out together, and Giggs followed him, in about five minutes after; they were gone some considerable time; then Rudd came back again, and said they had taken a footpad; my husband asked him where, and he said the man that went from our house, and he said as how he knew he was a footpad; I asked him whether he had fire arms; he said he had fire arms; I told him he should not come to our house; I asked him where he was; he said Giggs was with him; I thought they had him in the yard; I asked him who was with, then I opened the door; he had Mr. Turner's hat on his head, and shoe in his hand, and his pocket book; I told him I was afraid they had used him ill; he said he had not; then my husband told him, if he had not used him ill, to take his shoes back, and ask his pardon, and let him go, and he said he would; and we went out to hear if there were any words, and we heard Rudd go to him, and call Giggs away, and Giggs did not leave him; Rudd went up, and laid the things down, and went away; then we found the things laying by him, after Rudd went up to him; and my husband said he was very sorry he had been used in that manner.</p>
               <p>When you came up to them, what did you find? - I found Giggs standing by Turner, with a stick in his hand.</p>
               <p>What was Turner doing? - He laid on the ground; he was tied hands and legs; Giggs d - d my husband, and said how did he know he had used him ill; my husband said it did not appear to him, that he had used him very well, by seeing him in that situation; then Mr. Turner spoke to my husband, and asked him if he belonged to the place, and I told him yes; he said thank God there were some neighbours in the place that had saved his life, or else he should have been murdered; we lifted him up, and when he could stand. I saw something lay on the ground white; I thought it was his handkerchief, but it was his stock, which was tore off his neck, and the stock-buckle was in the ditch, and his hat, and his pocket-book were there; Giggs was there, and he went away, and said he would come in the morning, and bring the club stick with him that Turner had, and then he would come and clear that point up, and he went towards home; Giggs said he found it under Turner's coat; then we brought Turner home, and sent for a woman to wash him, and sit up with him all night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Turner never spoke till after the conversation with Giggs? - No.</p>
               <p>Giggs produced the club? - It was a knotty stick; it did not appear to be like a club; it was two foot long, and a knot at the end of it; I do not know whose it was.</p>
               <p>Did Rudd desire you to look to see if there were any bank notes in this pocketbook, or any thing of that kind? - No, Sir, only to see where the gentleman lived.</p>
               <p>How long have you known these young men? - Above a twelvemonth; I thought Turner as safe with them, as if he was in my house.</p>

               <p>What time did you come to him? - Between five and six, as near as I can guess; I got a constable, and found the prisoners in a field, about a mile from the farm.</p>
               <p>Were they at work? - No, they had run from their work; I followed them for near a mile; they asked me if the gentleman had got his purse and money; I told them no; and they said they gave it to Stephens the hay-binder, to carry it him; when we came to Lovell's house, the prosecutor desired me to ask them if they had not a knife; and I asked Giggs, and he pulled a knife out of his pocket, and gave it to the constable, that is all I know.</p>

               <p>I formerly lived at Harrow, and have a house there now; it is in dispute; I have more knowledge of Giggs than the other, he kept a public house at Harrow, and I have frequently seen him; they were both quiet good sort of men: if they had been tried yesterday, there were twelve or fourteen capital inhabitants to give them characters which was well known.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. This man has been extremely ill used and abused; and has met with very violent and outrageous treatment, under circumstances as extraordinary as ever came before a Court of Justice; and I wonder the prisoners have not given any account of this behaviour of theirs; nothing can be more clear, than that they have taken from this man his purse, and these different articles; and his story unexplained, would certainly constitute the crime of robbery; and were it not that there are two or three extraordinary features in the case, I should state it to you, as being clearly against the prisoners; but there are two or three extraordinary features in the case that puzzle me, and leave my mind in some degree of uncertainty, as to what was the object of these two people; for supposing it to be a concerted plan to rob this man; this conduct was so extraordinary, that it seems almost impossible that men should have acted as they did: for you find that after having tied this man hand and foot, beating him, and abusing him, and taking from him all these things, instead of going off with the money, and endeavouring to conceal what they had done; the first step they took, was such a one as must lead to a discovery; they came back to the house, and gave notice, that within two hundred yards of the place they had taken a footpad; when the landlord remonstrated with him about the improbability of this man's being a footpad; he went and carried the things back, and it seems by the evidence of Turner, as if Rudd had done more, and advised Giggs to go away; it is equally extraordinary that when the landlord and his wife came up, Giggs should stay there to be present, to give them an opportunity of seeing him there, and consequently of convicting him. I do not find that there was any reasonable ground for taking the prosecutor for a footpad.</p>

               <p>Did he undress himself? - He had his coat and waistcoat on.</p>
               <p>Any part of his clothes off? - His breeches were off, and his shoes and stockings.</p>
               <p>Where did he pull them off? - He pulled off his shoes and stockings in my mistress's room.</p>
               <p>How do you know? - Because he put them on in the morning when he came down; he had his breeches on when he came up in the room to me.</p>
               <p>Where did he pull them off? - In the room where I was; he got up in the bed and upon me, and put his private parts into mine, and I could not stir nor move, he would not let me, he told me if I made any noise, he would knock my brains out, I went to call out, and he put his hands before my mouth that I might not call out; he laid from eleven till seven in the morning.</p>
               <p>Did not he pull his coat and waistcoat off in all that time? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor did not he get into the bed? - No, Sir, the bed was so small he could not do otherwise; the bed is but a side-bed.</p>
               <p>He lay with you from eleven till seven? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he sleep any part of that time? - No, Sir, if he dropped in sleep, when he felt me stir or move he was awake directly, and at seven o'clock he got away; and I came down stairs and told my mistress; I got up directly afterwards; my mistress said she thought he went out of doors, but she could not get up to see, for she was ill in bed, and I could not make any noise at all.</p>
               <p>You certainly could have made a noise when he fell asleep? - If I made a noise he put his hand before my mouth and stopped my breath.</p>
               <p>You do not seem to have tried to make a noise? - Yes, Sir, I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mrs. Smith, he continued in this same position from eleven to seven? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Exactly in the same position? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You mean laying upon you with his private parts in yours? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He would not let you stir? - No, I offered to stir, he threatened to kill me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250117"/>He was going to sleep till you disturbed him, then he got awake again? - He did not sleep but very little indeed, only little bits.</p>
               <p>But now putting all the little bits together, how many hours do you think he might have slept? - I cannot tell you.</p>
               <p>Did this business hurt you at all? - Yes, it hurt me very much.</p>
               <p>And continued to hurt you all the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This bed is very narrow? - It is not above half the width of my coloured apron; he could not lay any otherwise.</p>
               <p>They tell me it is a very ricketty bed too? - Ricketty!</p>
               <p>Aye! makes a noise when you get in and out? - No, it does not.</p>
               <p>You was hardly got into bed? - Yes, I had just dropped to sleep; my door was double-locked with a spring lock, and it was broke open with these two chissels.</p>
               <p>(Produced.)</p>
               <p>The lock was pushed back.</p>
               <p>But you never heard him till he was at your bed-side? - No, Sir, I am very heavy to sleep.</p>
               <p>Did you get any sleep during this night? - No, Sir, I did not go to sleep all night long.</p>
               <p>How high is your bed from the ground? - I never measured it; he had me lengthways upon the bed.</p>
               <p>Why did you not put down your hands and tap for the lodgers? - He had hold of both my hands all the time, and one hand on my mouth.</p>
               <p>Had such a thing never happened to you before? - No, Sir, never in my life.</p>
               <p>That you are sure of; do you remember any thing about a table in a warehouse? - No, Sir, there never was such a thing done before.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath has there never been such a thing done against a table once? - No, Sir, never.</p>
               <p>Did he pull off his breeches before he put out the candle? - No, after he put out the candle.</p>
               <p>Did you help him to pull off his breeches? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you did not help him? - I did not.</p>
               <p>How did he do it? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Did you not go down before he did? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you go for his shoes and stockings? - No, I did not, I went down to do my business, and to tell my mistress; I left him in the work-shop without shoes or stockings.</p>
               <p>Did not your mistress say to you, what have you been laying with your master all night? - No, Sir, she did not.</p>
               <p>Then you never told her that you had not lain with him all night? - No, Sir, I told her immediately of it, when I came down in the morning.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did you never tell your mistress that you had never lain with him? - I stand by that.</p>
               <p>What did you say the first thing to your mistress? - I asked her if she did not know whether my master was with me; she said she did not, she said she thought he was out of doors.</p>
               <p>What you said, pray, Madam, do not you know my master has been with me all night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your mistress turned you away, I believe? - No, she did not, my aunt took me away, Mr. Hodge went and made his brags at the public house the next morning, that was the way my aunt knew of it, a man let my aunt know of it.</p>
               <p>How often have you and Mrs. Marshall and her husband talked this over in the course of last week? - I never did talk any thing at all about it.</p>
               <p>That you swear positively, that you did not talk it over yesterday what you should say in Court? - Sir, he never did teach me, nor his wife.</p>
               <p>How long was it day-light before this man got up from you? - It was not daylight long.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing to you when he got up? - No, Sir, only if I would get his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250118"/> shoes and stockings for him, he would go out; I did not go for them.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Merry is the lady that lived in the floor under you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you tap at her door as you went down? - No, I did not tell her till a good bit after.</p>
               <p>When did you tell her? - I told her it before my aunt came.</p>
               <p>So this man as soon as he got his ends of you, lay quiet till the morning? - He would not let me move.</p>
               <p>Did he move himself? - No, he did not from that time till the morning.</p>

               <p>I am aunt to this girl.</p>
               <p>When did you hear this girl's having received any injury by this Hodge? - The next morning a man came and told me to come up to my niece, that Hodge had ruined her; I went directly up stairs, and made the best of my way to the prisoner, where I saw the girl sweeping the shop; I cannot say whether it was ten or eleven in the morning; I went into the parlour to Mrs. Hodge, and Mr. Hodge's father, as I was told, was there; I said it was a very sad affair, and they said a very sad affair indeed; I bid the girl look up her clothes, and come with me; my husband and I took her up before a Magistrate directly, the same day.</p>
               <p>How came you to take her before a Magistrate? - Because she said her master had been the ruin of her, and had been in bed with her; when I came from the office, I came to take her things.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the girl? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Nor look at her linen? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Was she never examined by any surgeon? - Not to my knowledge, nor I dare say she was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You thought it was a sad thing that this girl should have these liberties taken with her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And therefore you took her away? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she tell you how often this sort of thing had happened to her? - I heard nothing but what she said at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any thing of a table in the workshop? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you speak to the girl before you spoke to the mistress? - I cannot tell what I said to her.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell her she was an impudent hussey, to suffer men to do these things? - I might say, it was a sad thing; I cannot say her answer.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen this bed, where this is supposed to have happened? - I did go up stairs, but I was alarmed; I cannot give you any particular description.</p>
               <p>You are a married woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you think it possible to have lain all night in that situation by the side of her, or in any other way without her consent? - I cannot say; it is a small bed, like a child's bedstead; I did not go close to it.</p>
               <p>How old is this girl? - I cannot be punctual whether she is fifteen or sixteen.</p>
               <p>Is not she nineteen? - I cannot be punctual, I do not think she is so much.</p>

               <p>Jury. No my Lord, we are satisfied.</p>
               <p>Court. It is a very brutal thing, for which this fellow deserves to be punished in a way more severe than he has been, or will be; to be sure, taking any method to persuade a girl, his servant, of this age, in his house, under his protection, he having a wife and three children, one cannot presume any thing more brutal and beastly than his conduct; but as to a rape, there is no pretence.</p>

            ; when I first came to the house, I hang the watch up in the bar; it hung for a considerable time; on the 15th of August my husband was taken ill; the prisoner was sitting in the kitchen reading the newspaper, about four yards from where the watch hung; I went out and returned, and the watch was missing; I suspected the maid, and threatened to take her up; the prisoner said, if you take us all up, my pretty face must go before the Justice; I did not suspect the prisoner; I took him to be a gentleman of five hundred a year; I lost a punch ladle before on Thursday night the 18th of August; we found the watch at one Mr. Purse's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. How long have you kept the Talbot? - Just come there; we kept the Opera coffee-house before.</p>
               <p>The road to the rooms that are most frequented, ( you understand me without more explanation) is through the bar, is it not? - If you was to come there you would go through the bar.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I never shall be that way I assure you; how long had this gentleman of five hundred a year been at your house? - He came on the 10th; he staid a week.</p>
               <p>Was it you that presented the bill of seven pounds for his week's board? - No, Sir, my husband; but then he had three or four gentlemen eat and slept with him; he always had one or two, sometimes three gentlemen slept with him.</p>
               <p>Did not he refuse to pay it? - I do not know</p>
               <p>Was you present when your husband said, if you do not chuse to pay that bill, I shall charge you with stealing a silver watch? - He was taken up on the 18th and carried before a magistrate; he was at large from Friday till Monday; there were advertisements with a reward to find the watch; he was taken up again on the 30th of September.</p>
               <p>Did he continue at your house after this? - No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow I understand that you at some time had a conversation with this woman in the presence of Mr. Letwyche? - I believe I had.</p>
               <p>I only wish to say this to you, at the same time, I believe, you said, you would not take advantage of any thing that did pass in a particular conversation? - I believe I might.</p>
               <p>Then, I believe, my Lord will tell you, that any thing that did pass at that conversation must not be mentioned now? - I meant to carry my engagement no further.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then I object to your stating any thing that you came to in consequence of that; do you know any thing that you came to in consequence of that conversation? - I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. I am not going to ask him any thing that passed in consequence of that at that time, I believe the conversation that I am enquiring after, passed previous to that time, and if it should happen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250129"/> to have passed after that time, the engagement being, that what passed at that time should not be disclosed, does not come within agreement; it is the duty of Mr. Knight, in the office he is in, to enquire into seamen's wills, before the commissioners make any payment upon them; the application made to him was made by the prisoner as the representative of Druce previous to that time.</p>
               <p>Court. If it is brought into the shape of an objection of which I can take notice, it must be that of the common objection, that something has been said to this woman which has induced her to say something; I shall object to that as not fit to be heard; but as to the point of honour I have nothing to do with that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was what you are going to state previous to what passed, or subsequent? - I think it was previous.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. Did you at any time apply to Doctors Commons to search for the wills of seamen? - I did.</p>
               <p>When was it? - In the month of April last.</p>
               <p>Did you find the will of Druce? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you any time, and when, after see the prisoner? - In the month of April or May I saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did you take any measures upon it to the payment of wages? - I saw the will, I thought it suspicious, and I gave notice to the Pay office not to pay the wages till the suspicions were cleared up; in consequence of the wages being stopped the prisoner came to my office, and brought a man of the name of

               <p>Court. Now before you examined her, did you inform her that you had any evidence that the will was forged, or make her any promise? - No, none in the world, I took minutes from her into this book which I have in my hand.</p>

               <p>Then you entered in the book the debt this woman owed you? - I certainly did; my landlord seized it, I recovered the debt before he got the books, what was paid was waste paper.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Court. In the first place, when did you come into Court? - I am here about an hour.</p>
               <p>Why did not you answer when your name was called? - I was not here then. I was drinking a pint of beer over the way in the Old Bailey with two or three acquaintances.</p>
               <p>Who were they? - I cannot recollect their names.</p>
               <p>Do not you know who they were you was drinking with? - No, Sir, they were round there, I was not well acquainted with them; I do not know their names.</p>
               <p>Can you write? - Yes, Sir, a little.</p>
               <p>Court. Give him a pen and ink and let him write; how long have you been disabled, how long have you lost your arm? - I believe in November 1777, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Now write your name on that paper.</p>
               <p>(Writes his name with his left hand, given up to the Court and compared with the will, and shewn to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>What are you? - I was bred up to the currying business, but I failed for a thousand pounds, and I could not pay it at that time, and I went to sea.</p>
               <p>What ship did you serve in the year<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250138"/> 1780? - I was not on board in the year 1780; I came home in the year 1780 from taking one of the galleons, in the Sharke privateer, belonging to Messrs. Newby; after that I came to Gosport and resided there.</p>
               <p>In what way? - I lodged in O'Hara's house, at the Wheat-sheaf in Cross-street.</p>
               <p>When was that that you lodged there? - In the year 1780, 1781, and part of 1782, I lived upon my prize-money, at that time I received upwards of two hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Did you know Druce? - I have seen him but not to know him.</p>
               <p>What did Druce belong to? - By all account he belonged to the Magnificent and Monsieur, and an Indiaman; the time I saw him he was dressed in a light coloured coat and leather apron, and a trowel under his apron; I saw him at Gosport in company with the prisoner, it was at O'Hara's house; they went to Mr. Hinde's at the upper end of Middle-street; that is a navy agent, to have a will and power made, or something of that kind, and Mr. Hind nor his clerk was not in the way, and they came back to the same house, and the house was full of men and women, women of the town, and men, the boats crews; they had been telling their business, some of the sailors said to them, d - n your foolish blood, it will cost you a crown to have it filled; why we will fill it says one, and we will fill it says another, and it was filled by a sea-faring man that was in liquor, I cannot tell his name; there was hundreds and thousands in the house in the course of the week.</p>
               <p>What became of it then? - The woman desired me to sign it, and I signed it for one, and there was one

             signed it for another; I would not know him if I was to see him; he was a lowish man; that is all that I remember; this was some time in the summer 1781, I cannot recollect the time.</p>
               <p>Where was O'Hara at the time? - I cannot tell; he was out of the way at the time; he was not present I know.</p>
               <p>Did you know Druce, was you acquainted with his person? - No, I was not; I drank with him two three times in that disguise that he was in to prevent him from being pressed as I thought, which was the case with many sea-faring men at that time; I had heard he had run from the Monsieur.</p>
               <p>Is that sort of secret well kept amongst a number of you? - Yes, it is, for I have run from a King's ship myself before now; I was on board the Hector man of war in the year 1777, and in a privateer in the year 1779, and took a galleon and brought her in.</p>
               <p>How many times might you have seen Druce before you was called upon to sign this? - Three or four times, or perhaps half a dozen; I have often seen him with this woman in the streets of Gosport, and I believe three times at O'Hara's.</p>
               <p>What was his business at your house? - I believe he came there to drink, I cannot say his business; it was a great house for sea-faring people.</p>
               <p>You yourself lived there, did not you? - I did.</p>
               <p>How many rooms were there in the house? - I believe there were six rooms.</p>
               <p>How many bed-rooms? - Four.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to recollect who there was that lived there beside yourself at the time? - It was impossible, for boats crews were constantly coming and going; this was in the back parlour.</p>
               <p>You said you saw the low man

               <p>Did you understand at the time he signed it, that he then run away from the Monsieur? - I did not; I heard afterwards that he had before that time he had run away; I heard it the next day.</p>
               <p>Do you know where he used to harbour after he run away in that manner? - I believe he kept with this woman at her house.</p>
               <p>Was you ever at her house? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see him there? - Yes, I saw him there one night.</p>
               <p>Never but once? - Never but once.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether he had any lodging there? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>If he did not lodge at her house, you do not know where he lodged? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>(Looks at the will.)</p>
               <p>Is that your hand-writing? - It is.</p>
               <p>And that is Payne's hand-writing? - It is the man's that I saw sign it.</p>
               <p>How came you to be desired to sign it? - I have signed many for many people in the same house; there have been many things done in the same house, and in many houses in Portsmouth besides.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. I see you have had a misfortune in your arm? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you ever the misfortune to break your leg? - I broke my shin but not my leg.</p>
               <p>When might that happen? - Sometime in June 1781 to the best of my knowledge, I think, I will not be sure.</p>
               <p>Can you be sure when this will was executed? - It was executed about that month.</p>
               <p>Have you ever given any other account of this? - Yes, I gave an account to Mr. Knight as well as I could once; I did not go to Mr. Knight; this woman applied to me; I came from Portsmouth as a witness to another will.</p>
               <p>Did not you go with the prisoner to Mr. Knight's to get a certificate? - I know nothing of any certificate.</p>
               <p>Did you give you any account to Mr. Knight of this transaction? - I do not know but he might put down what I said.</p>
               <p>Did you give him any account of this transaction? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you tell Mr. Knight this was a transaction in the month of June? - I believe I did; I am not sensible.</p>

               <p>Was it read over to the man who signed it? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was it executed when it bears date? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner before it was wrote? - Yes, it was filled up by a seafaring man, who gave it to Druce to sign.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When Mr. Knight first asked me about this matter, I told him I would endeavour to give him every satisfaction; and he examined us all apart.</p>

            ; I know the three prisoners; they came to my shop on the 5th of October, about four in the afternoon; nobody was at home but myself; they asked to look at some jackets, and as they came in, I observed one of them pull at a waistcoat that hung at the door; I went and took it down, and while I had it in my hand one of them asked me the price of it; I hung it up in the window, and they asked to look at another; I took it out of the window, and they asked me the price of that, and I told them; then they asked to look at some blue cloth jackets; one of them put on one and pulled it off; and asked to look at a shagg waistcoat, he put it on, and said, it was too little, he could not button it, and he wished I would see if I could; I told him, no; the tallest of them wanted to shut the door; he pushed the door half way to; and I told them the door must not be shut; and he said, what did I mean, did I think they were thieves; and I told them, I did not know; and they said, they were honest men, and men that could pay for what they had; and that they were just come from on board a ship from Blackwall; that it was better to lay out their money for things for themselves,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250142"/> than to let the bed women have it; he bid me reach him down another under waistcoat; they were all three in the shop at the same time; I turned round to reach another for the prisoner Lutwitche, and the prisoner Wallace was gone, he had taken a waistcoat out of the window where I had hung it up before; I missed it directly; when I missed the man I was afraid; I had nobody in the house but a servant maid, which I called down directly to take a child I had in my arms; when I said the man had taken the waistcoat; a person stepped into the shop, and said they had taken him; he was stopped directly in the passage by the neighbours that saw him go out with it; the others were in the shop at the time; then the prisoner Milne said, he wished he had pushed to the door and left my nose black; then the runners were sent for, and they were taken away directly; they bought nothing.</p>
               <p>Then Lutwiche tried on the things, and Wallace ran away with the waistcoat, and Milne tried to shut the door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did they come in together? - Yes; they appeared to be acquainted and talked one to another while they were looking at the jacket.</p>

               <p>If these people will be so brutal to fight in this manner with one another, does it never occur to you to go somewhere to fight, that you might not have the stones to fall upon? - I do not know; it was over; he gave out, and said he would not fight any more then, but he would have it out another time; he spoke no more that I heard of.</p>
               <p>Jury. Were they both drunk? - I really believe that neither of them was cleverly sober; as for Barrett, he was very drunk; we took him into the house, and put on his clothes as well as I could; and I got somebody to help him into a coach, and I drove him home to Moorgate; when I came there, somebody said he was dead, and somebody said he was not; I saw no breath, and I went for a surgeon to bleed him; the surgeon would not come; he said where they fought, there he might go and be blooded.</p>
               <p>When you came back from the surgeon's, was he dead then? - Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>How soon did he die? - I cannot tell how soon after; I helped him out of the coach into his master's house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. He was your acquaintance? - I lived a fortnight with him; I did not know any thing of this man; Barrett was certainly very much in the wrong, and provoked this man; I thought he had had a good beating, but I did think he would die.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On September the 24th, I opened the body of the deceased; and on the left side, below the false rib, in the cavity of the abdomen, I found a quantity of blood, perhaps exceeding a pint; on the external surface of the body, on the left side, on the fifth and sixth ribb; there was some contusion, but by no means mortal in itself; that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Was there any appearance of a rupture in any vessel? - No, there was not.</p>
               <p>From whence did that blood proceed do you apprehend? - Perhaps from too great an action of the heart; from too much drinking; it must come from some vessel undoubtedly, but not visible.</p>
               <p>You could not discover that some artery had burst, or any large blood vessel? - By no means, my Lord, they were in a perfect healthy state.</p>
               <p>What do you take to be cause of his death? - Perhaps an apoplexy.</p>
               <p>Did you open the head? - I did; the brain seemed to be in a healthy condition.</p>
               <p>Does it happen that people die of apoplexies, without the disorder shewing itself upon the brain? - It does, my Lord, but not often; the heart and arteries appeared in a healthy state; I cannot say to a certainty what might be the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Would the blood that you found in the abdomen have produced it? - Not instantly, but in the course of twenty-four, or thirty-six hours; it must have been taken up again into the absorbent vessels, and taken again into the system; it could not have been discharged any other way than by the absorbent vessels.</p>
               <p>Did you find the heart and receptacles surcharged with veinous blood? - They were; I meant by healthy state, that the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250147"/> heart and arteries were not by any means ruptured.</p>

               <p>Will you swear that? - I will; she was not taken till the twenty-third; I think it was about the Friday following, about two I saw her.</p>

            , and Humphry, and all of them; a man who has walked London streets cannot fail.</p>
               <p>You name never was William? - Never to my knowledge, unless it was before I was born.</p>
               <p>Now that is a pretty discreet answer! now you are a jeweller? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Will you have the goodness to tell these gentlemen, what your friend Humphry's trade was; you know he is an old client of mine; do you know where he used to buy his rings? - He never bought any of me, none of the gang.</p>
               <p>You know their trade used to be, to drop a very fine cluster ring, worth one hundred and forty guineas; you know he was boned for it; are you sure that your diamonds in your pocket-book were not of the same sort? - I know a diamond as well as any man; mine were diamonds.</p>
               <p>Was it before or afterwards that you stripped to fight the boy that picked your pocket of your handkerchief? - I never stripped to fight any body; on the 14th of September, at the Granby, I lost my handkerchief in the house; a good many women were in the house, and several at the door.</p>
               <p>Was you as sober then as you are now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250150"/>Much the same perhaps? - I am sober now.</p>
               <p>That you swear to; have not you been drinking? - I believe I have drank more to day than I did then; I was sober enough to know the people that robbed me; I could have gone to any shop and done my business, I was not drunk.</p>
               <p>Did nobody refuse to give you liquor, because you was so beastly drunk, they would not let you have another glass? - That was the landlord.</p>
               <p>He would not trust you with any more liquor? - Why, if he says it, he may say what he likes.</p>
               <p>However, he was wicked enough to say it? - You will hear it from the landlord.</p>
               <p>But I must hear it from you; did not he tell you, that you was so beastly drunk, he would not give you any more liquor? at the Rotation-office, the landlord being called up, he said you was so drunk, he would not give you any more liquor; is that true or false? - It was false; he did refuse me liquor at his house.</p>
               <p>What reason did he give you? - He said there I was drunk.</p>
               <p>I do not wonder at the man's saying so? - Nor I neither, the man was frightened to death; he did not know what to say; I will prove whether I was drunk or no; I was no more drunk than I am now; I sometimes get drunk, but never till my business is done.</p>
               <p>I am told your character is quite reverse to that in general; you are generally drunk, but sometimes you get sober? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Where had you been spending your evening? - I had been with the man that works for me in Moorfields, and I was coming home, and I was no more drunk than I am now; he has worked for me these seven years; his name is

             the next day, that he had lost his pocket book; I do not know how sensibly drunk he was, I thought him very drunk; I did not quit the tap room nor the bar for a considerable time after; he staid ten minutes in the tap room, and never made any complaint in the tap room.</p>
               <p>If any body for instance had seized him violently by the collar, and another person taken his pocket book, should not you have known it? - I never heard a syllable about it; I do not know much about this woman; her husband is an honest man I believe.</p>
               <p>Did any body strip to fight, or fight? - No, I heard no complaint that this man had lost his stick, nor his hat, or handkerchief, only that he had lost his watch.</p>

               <p>Harding. I never did.</p>

               <p>Seago. He was there the next day with a short man; I do not know his name; it was in the forenoon, I think before twelve; I think my wife was in the bar; she was unable to go out.</p>
               <p>And upon the oath you have taken, you will persist in this fact? - Yes, I will; the man that came with him, had his own hair tied behind; I have heard say he keeps a liquor shop near Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Court to Harding. Did you ever go to his house at any time? - Yes, I went there with Phill. Brisco about a week after.</p>
               <p>Court to Seago. Are you sure it was not a week after? - No, Sir, he came only once, I really think it was the next day; I think I can swear it was not a week after; I am sure it was the next day, because I had just heard of his being robbed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel; I am so ill I cannot speak.</p>

               <p>How was the fact? - I had dined in the City, and walked home; I had been drinking but left off drinking before eight o'clock; I sat down to my dinner at past five o'clock at the London coffee-house; then I walked home; I told her, if I was sober I never could think of going with her; if I was drunk, I was not proper<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250154"/> company for her; she asked me to give her some money to drink; I told her, I made it a rule never to carry money of a night; then she put her left hand on my right hand breeches pocket, and kept rubbing up my thigh, to feel if there was any money; I had a new pair of leather breeches on which were very tight, and I thought I felt my seal draw up my thigh, and I took my hand and caught hold of the skirt of her gown, and she was going to leave me; upon putting my hand on my pocket I found my watch was gone out; I praised her ingenuity and dexterity, and told her it was a very good joke, but would advise her to return it, least it should prove serious; says I, have it you certainly must; says she, what the devil should I do you with your watch? I was leading her to the watchman who was within three or four yards; I saw one in Coventry-court; I charged the watch with her; he took her to the watch-house; I was asked if I found my watch, if I should proceed; I said, I owed it to the public, and I certainly should do it, whether I got my watch or no; I carried her to Bow-street, Sir Sampson Wright committed her, and I then went to the clerk of the indictments, who directed me to the Grand Jury; then I heard that a person had found it; I saw it at the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Did you go in after him? - Yes; when he came out of the cellar the first time, he came up the steps into my garden.</p>
               <p>Do you know him? - I never saw him before.</p>

               <p>Do you know what he came into your house for? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>How had he got in? - He got the cellar window open; the padlock was off entirely, and hung to the staple when I saw it.</p>
               <p>Then no violence had been used? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you always lock that door? - Yes, always of a night.</p>
               <p>Do you never happen to forget it? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you locked it over night? - I am not positive of that, I think I locked it; I never forget it as I know of; when we got him to the watch-house, we searched him; we found nothing upon him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Justice asked him, how did he get into your cellar? he answered, I am not sure whether I locked the door, Sir, or not.</p>

               <p>Did you see any blows? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you hear the woman say, the villain has struck me? - No, she said, would you strike me? and he said, I did not strike you.</p>
               <p>Did Mrs. Godfrey come up before you shut your door? - Yes; I saw all that passed before Mrs. Godfrey came up.</p>
               <p>Do you remember somebody on the one pair of stairs saying, I would throw the villain down if I was dressed? - That was below me; I did not hear that.</p>
               <p>How soon after that he knocked at the door of the deceased; did you open your door? - I opened it directly, but I opened it again when Mrs. Godfrey came up.</p>

               <p>Have you any reason to believe at the time you opened your door, there had been any blows struck? - No, not the least in the world, I never heard any blow struck; I have no notion how she came by her death; she was very a few well minutes before; she was very much enraged, and in a great passion, and was very weak; she had lain in about six weeks before; she was very week and poorly.</p>
               <p>How soon after he went down did she begin to complain? - After he was gone down, I heard the child cry in the room, and I went in, and she was gone down stairs, into the one pair of stairs; there was only the children in the room; then about five or six minutes I heard the youngst baby cry very much indeed; and I looked out, and her room door was shut, and I opened her room door, and the deceased was leaning against the back of the chair, with one hand to her head, and the little child in her lap, like to fall off her knee; I took the child off her knee; and I said, oh, dear me, the woman is in a fit.</p>

               <p>I did not know the deceased in her lifetime; the coroner and his jury sent a request that I would come and examine the body, it was the evening after the day of her death, in that space of time there can be very little room for any great alteration by putrefaction; I could not observe the least marks of any injury externally; I ordered the head to be shaved, supposing I might have found something there, but there was not the least mark of injury or mischief thereabouts, or her breast or neck; but upon examination in the internal parts, (I will not trouble you with every part we examined, it is not necessary) but in the head there was considerable mischief, so that it is not at all to be wondered at that she died so soon; in the brain there was a very considerable extravasation of blood; there had been a rupture of some small vessels, they had discharged their contents, and a great deal of this blood was diffused through the brain; no where else did I observe any injury at all, except a general appearance of weakness, such as might have been expected from a woman who had lately laid-in.</p>
               <p>I suppose these ruptures proceed from numberless causes? - A variety of causes, it might arise from violent anger, sudden fear, and a plethora might produce it; there are frequent instances of people that die suddenly from such causes; I believe my deposition was pretty much to that effect; it was like an apoplexy, if it was not quite so.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, there wanted nothing but the authority of a gentleman of the profession, to satisfy us about that, which I think the whole course of the evidence sufficiently points out, which is, that this woman came by her death from a sudden eruption of the blood vessels, which her emotion with this pot-boy occasioned; the death happening in that way, it is impossible to carry the consequences of this boy's misconduct to such an extent, as to impute that rupture to him: we cannot measure the effect that impertinent behaviour will have on different constitutions, so as to make it a crime of one degree in a boy to affront a person of a strong constitution, who does not care a farthing for him, and of another degree to affront another person whose spirits are all in an uproar at his behaviour; that is a refinement which cannot be admitted into the definition of crimes; so that upon the whole, I think it is impossible for us to say, that this woman came by her death by the hands of this boy; therefore we cannot examine into the crime of this boy, as both the charges against him presuppose that he was the cause of her death, though his impertinent behaviour was the thing that did lead to this unhappy end.</p>

               <p>On the 22d of October, at two in the morning; it was Sunday; I was coming up Wych-street; I was accosted by the prisoner to go and drink a glass of wine; I went home with her about ten minutes after two; when I went to her apartments, I gave her two shillings in silver, and went to bed; I then had two guineas and a half in gold, and four shillings in silver, in a green silk purse; I pulled out my purse in the room before I went to bed to give her the two shillings; the money was in the purse; we went to bed; I put<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250170"/> my brown cloth coat and waistcoat on the table; I then pulled off my shoes and buckles, and put the buckles and neckcloth on the table, and then went to bed; I had not been in bed long but I found every thing was not so agreeable as I could wish.</p>
               <p>Where did you put your breeches? - I laid in my breeches and stockings; a little time after I had been in bed, I did not like my companion; the consequence of which was, she said, she was not well, she must get up, and have something to drink; she got up in a quarter of an hour, and left the candle in the chimney piece; I saw her looking at my buckles and shoes; I asked her, what she was doing with them? she said, I never come nigh a man so curious as you are; says I, put them down; she put them down, and at the same time blowed out the candle; she went out immediately and locked the door; I was doubtful of the place I was in; and I remained there till Cox the prisoner came; I missed my purse after she went, and before Cox came in, which was about half after five; I lost the purse about three; how Cox came in I do not know; he said, you bloody b - g - r, what do you do here? I asked him, what that was to him; I had paid for being there, and would stay till I saw the woman that brought me there; he said he had no woman at all belonging to him, and that I should get up immediately; I told him, I would not; in consequence of which he said, I shall return very shortly, and if you are not gone before that time, I will do for you; he did return in a very in a very short time, and says again, what you bloody b - g - r, you are not gone; he then says, get up; says I, do not go to treat me ill; I am a better man than yourself; upon which he took off the bed clothes, and then with a knife he cut me twice. (Shews his hands to the Jury.) One a deep cut; in consequence of which, I jumped up immediately, and said repeatedly to him, do not use me ill, I am a better man than yourself; then I missed a blue cloth coat, which I had on, and my neckcloth, and my pocket handkerchief; when he came the second time it was day light.</p>
               <p>Court. What may be the value of this coat? - It cost me three guineas.</p>
               <p>What do you think it is worth? - I do not know; it has been worn by me only three weeks; I leave the value entirely out of the case.</p>
               <p>Do you think it is worth forty shillings? - I should be very happy to get such a coat for forty shillings; I then quitted the apartment, and stood on the landing place, and said, I am now out of your apartment, but I will not quit the place till such time I have my property; I value my cambrick handkerchief at one shilling, and my pocket handkerchief at one shilling; and he flung my head against the door, and the door flew open, and there lay two as notorious villains as himself; they cried out immediately, ham him, and murder him; upon which he came to lay hold of me to throw me over the bannisters of the stairs; I avoided that; I came to go down stairs, and he and the other two came and smashed me down stairs; I fell stupid; they then kicked me, trod upon me, and threw me out of the door; I went into a public house; the man's name is

               <p>Before Bray took you into the room, did he tell you for what purpose he took you there? - He told me he had stopped Cox the prisoner with my coat; and he told me what money he had let him have upon it; my friend let me have the money; Mr. Jordon and Mr. Kirshaw were subpoened; they neither of them were before the Grand Jury; and another publican whom Cox took the coat to, before he took it to Bray; he kept the Cheshire Cheese in the same lane, he was subpoened.</p>

               <p>Court to Fearne. Did you see any person running before? - No; my house is seven doors from the corner of the Minories; he was running towards the corner of the Minories.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. How long had this young man lived with you? - He was not a servant of mine; he was under my head porter.</p>
               <p>This money was supposed to be taken out of your desk in your warehouse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is it a place which is in general resorted to by people? - Yes, just to deliver parcels, and go away again.</p>
               <p>Upon opening the desk, how many marked guineas did you find? - I did not open the desk at all.</p>
               <p>Did not you see it opened? - No.</p>
               <p>Do not you know what quantity of marked guineas there were in it? - Twenty-seven.</p>
               <p>How long has it been the fashion to mark the money? - About two months.</p>
               <p>Did you mark all that was put into that desk? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not that money get into circulation? - No, never; this money was kept by itself on purpose.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>There is a desk in the warehouse; it is usually kept locked; I have the key.</p>
               <p>Do you sit there to receive parcels, or when parcels are brought there, do you take them in, and lock them up? - I do.</p>
               <p>Do you usually keep the desk locked? - Always.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250177"/>Did you mark any money on leaving that desk? - Yes, thirty-seven guineas, and twenty shillings in silver, and four half crowns; all these I marked some days before, about four days, except seven guineas, seven guineas I marked over night; I had thirty guineas marked four or five days.</p>
               <p>How much money had you in that desk marked? - That I cannot tell; I kept the unmarked in a purse by itself, and the marked in a leather purse, and the silver in a wooden dish.</p>
               <p>I suppose the occasion of your marking the money was, that you had lost money, and wanted to detect the thieves? - On the 16th of September, between eight and nine, I was sitting on the steps, and the prisoner brought an old lanthorn, which his master bid him put into the warehouse; I gave the prisoner the large key to open the door; there is a key to the desk, another to the door.</p>
               <p>What did you do with the key of the desk? - I had it in my pocket; he stopped about twenty minutes in the warehouse; and few a minutes after his taylor came down the street, and they went down to drink a glass, I sent for the key to go to wash myself; I took the large key from him, I immediately opened the desk and I saw the leather purse which had the thirty-seven guineas was reversed, turned upside down, after that I took and counted them, and there was only thirty-six, I told the silver, and I missed one of the half crowns; I locked the desk and went to my master, and told him; my master told me to go into the warehouse; and he came in and called up the prisoner and accused him; the prisoner said he never robbed him of a farthing; I told him he had taken a guinea and half-a-crown, and some halfpence that morning; my master desired him to take the money out of his pocket; accordingly my master found the guinea and half-a-crown upon him, knowing it to be mine, as he knew my mark.</p>
               <p>Did you see the guinea and the half-crown that he produced out of his pocket? - Yes, the constable has it, it had my mark; I am sure it was in the desk when the young man went into the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you had not paid away any of this marked money? - No, I kept it; it was not circulating money, I kept it on purpose to catch the prisoner.</p>
               <p>How could your desk be got open? - I suppose by the virtue of a false key.</p>
               <p>Was that key searched for? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you pay that money to nobody? - No, I never passed it.</p>
               <p>What is the mark? - There is a horse upon the guinea, and I cut his leg with a dash; and on the half crown, opposite the king on the near side there is a dash.</p>
               <p>(Shewn to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You told my Lord, I think, that thirty-seven guineas had been marked for four days? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the same mark on all the guineas? - All the same mark.</p>
               <p>You could not tell one from the other? - No.</p>
               <p>How long is it since you began marking guineas? - When I had about seven or eight; I kept adding to the heap, but never took any from it.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear now, that in no one instance any one of these guineas was taken out and got into circulation; could it not happen by accident or any other way? - I never meant to take any out, it was a thing impossible, for nobody had a key to this desk but myself.</p>
               <p>Was not this young man searched directly, to see if he had a key? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Have you lost any of your marked guineas before? - Yes, several times.</p>
               <p>How many had you got before you missed any? - I cannot say, then I kept putting more, every five or six days there was a guinea taken.</p>
               <p>Somebody, however, at different times took out a marked one? - Yes, he had.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250178"/>Had you lost any of your silver? - No; I used three different marks, these thirty-seven were marked alike.</p>
               <p>What was the mark on the half-crown? - A dash on the tail side.</p>

               <p>Do you remember Mr. Thompson's evidence, and what be supposed had been done by this young man? - Perfectly well; Mr. Thompson called me up in the Coach-office, on the 16th of September, and told me that the prisoner had been taking money out of the desk; he ordered me to call him into the office; I called him up, and Mr. Thompson told him to take what money he had out of his pocket; and he laid down the money he had, which was part of it mine, and among that money was a guinea and half-a-crown, which he said belonged to Wadsworth our book-keeper; Wadsworth claimed it, and said it was his, and came out of the desk; the lock was not broke as I observed; he was not searched for a false key; his general character was a good one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did not the prisoner desire to be searched? - I believe he said, you may search me if you will.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am innocent; I said gentlemen search me; I leave the rest to my counsel; I am in the warehouse sometimes two or three hours.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bishop. I gave him the lanthorn into the gateway, and I told him to go into the office and clean it; that accounts for some part of the time.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called eleven witnesses who all gave him a very good character.</p>

               <p>I was bred to the sea; I get my bread by rigging; I was with the prosecutor and his wife; at this time it was between six and seven; I cannot recollect what day of the week or fair; I was behind Blake with his wife, I saw Blake striking at a man, I had not seen the man near him before, and there were a parcel of people together, and they got a fighting; I could not get to the man, and I looked for the woman, and the constables had got the prisoner; and I saw Blake's face cut; Blake said in the fair the prisoner wanted his watch; I saw no more of it till we came to the public house, and Blake took out his chain, and said see how it is broke; and the constable Tillcock asked him for it, and he gave it to him.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; as we were coming down Bartholomew-fair there were a number of people together, and a person called out, constable, I have lost my watch; I saw the prosecutor's face all bloody; he said the man is there, and pointed to the prisoner; the prisoner had his coat off, my partner, Sargeson, he took hold of him and delivered him to me; I searched him, I found nothing upon him; he gave charge of him, for that he had lost his watch.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes; this charge was first given in Smithfield, and afterwards when he came to the Compter; I asked him for his address, and he gave it in Nightingale-lane; then he pulled out the chain, and said the prisoner forced the chain from his watch; he did not say then that he had taken his watch; I think he was sober, but being an Italian I could hardly understand him; but I am sure he said in the fair that he had lost his watch: I have had the chain ever since (Deposed to) I swear to the chain and the pieces of coin; I have kept the watch also.</p>

               <p>This Blake was going on in Bartholomew-fair; I was before him and he knocked me down, and said I took this watch; I got up and asked him what that was for; he said I had got his watch, then we fought two or three rounds, I hit him on the nose and gave him a black eye, I suppose that exasperated him, and he run into the Crown, and called for two constables; they came and took hold of me; nothing was said about the chain; he had the chain and his watch then; then he laid hold of his chain, and said, you God d - d b - r, if it was not for this hole I should have lost my watch; then we came to Wood-street Compter, I thought it was for striking him; I knew nothing of this till next morning; then when we went before the Alderman he had his chain in his hand, and said I broke it off; if you will hear this witness.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a chandler; I live in Grub-street; I am a housekeeper.</p>
               <p>Are you a constable? - Not this year; I have been several years running; I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250182"/> employed by the Marshal, along with Mr. Tillcock in Bartholomew fair; there were a number of constables employed at that time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you see the chain hanging to the man's breeches after this affair that he charged me with; when the cry was, constables, I have lost my watch? - I and Tillcock made our way into the crowd; I was the first of the two; I laid hold of the prisoner; Tillcock was at the same time as close as he could be; I gave him into Tillcock's hands; Tillcock gave him leave to put on his coat; I was keeping off the mob as much as I could; the prosecutor was close to my elbow; before we got to the end of Duck-lane, Tillcock was before the prisoner; Mr. Blake was along with me; he laid hold of his watch chain; I was about three steps behind, with the prosecutor close by my elbow; Mr. Blake swore a great oath, with a bloody b-g-r that if it had not been for a round turn in his breeches, he would have had his watch; then he pulled at the chain, and pulled up the chain; I did not see the watch, but I saw the chain; I replied, put your chain in, or otherwise you will be done of it yet; this was after I let the prisoner put on his coat; I swear his chain appeared fast, the same as mine is now; and I said, put your chain in, or else you will be done of it; the crowd was so, I could hardly keep them off of Tillcock and the prisoner; he pulled so hard at it with a terrible oath that he drew up his breeches waistband.</p>
               <p>What was the oath he made use of? - The latter part of the oath was bloody b - g - r.</p>
               <p>What did he say when he made use of that oath? - That he had done him of his watch if it had not been for that round turn.</p>
               <p>What? - That he would have got his watch, had it not been for that round turn.</p>
               <p>Just now you said something else, and I want you to repeat it? - I cannot recollect the other part; he said, he had done him of his watch, if it had not been for that round turn; we went on to the compter; when we got to the public house to take his address; he then produced the chain loose.</p>
               <p>Where did he produce it from? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that he did not produce it from his waistcoat pocket? - Was I to swear so, I should swear more than I know; I do not know from what pocket he produced it; he did produce it.</p>
               <p>Who was it that advised Mr. Blake to make it up with the prisoner? - As we came along Love-lane, the prisoner called me first, and desired I would speak to the prosecutor that he would make him satisfaction for striking of him; I believe Tillcock heard the words; I could not tell who had been the first aggressor, not then; upon which I told Blake, that the prisoner was willing to make him satisfaction for striking of him.</p>
               <p>Did Tillcock hear that? - I do not know; Blake was five or six steps forward all the way; I spoke to Blake; he refused it; and I told the prisoner he would have nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>How happened that you was not constable this year? - I do not know; I have been a substitute several years.</p>
               <p>Was you ever turned out of office? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Never? - No.</p>
               <p>When you was at the Compter the charge was made? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now on hearing this gross and abominable charge made of stealing this chain; when you saw it found in the man's breeches before; what did you say to Mr. Blake on that occasion? - I did not say any thing to Mr. Blake then; it did not strike my mind at that time; I mentioned it the next morning to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Why did not you tell Mr. Blake,</p>
               <p>"you must be a very bad man; it is but a very few minutes ago that you shewed me this chain whole; you must have broke it from your fob?" - My Lord, the truth is, it did not strike my mind till the next morning; I had quite forgot what passed in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250183"/> street at that moment; the next morning I told the Magistrate of the proceeding.</p>
               <p>Who subpoened you here? - The prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did you come by a subpoena, or without one? - By a subpoena.</p>
               <p>Have you got that subpoena? - I believe I have.</p>
               <p>(Produces it.)</p>
               <p>When did you receive this subpoena? - On Thursday afternoon, I think it was.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was in the room when this charge was made against him? - He was put into the compter before the chain was produced.</p>
               <p>You did not go to the Magistrate that night? - No, not before the next day.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say to the charge? - The prisoner denied it; and I acquainted the Magistrate what I have acquainted your Lordship.</p>
               <p>What did Blake say to that? - Blake gave me ill language, but it was immaterial; the Magistrate thought I had been fee'd by the prisoner; Blake persisted in the charge, and first of all he said, that he took it out of the prisoner's hand; then he varied from it, and said, that the prisoner threw it down, and he picked it up, and first he sung out that he had lost his watch.</p>
               <p>How came you to say that the prosecutor gave the same account that he has given in Court? - I was there when he was examined.</p>
               <p>How do you know what account he has given now? - I hear that he gives account that he took it up.</p>
               <p>From whence have you heard that? - That might not be the identical word.</p>
               <p>How do you know what he said in this Court, have you received any message out of this Court from the prisoner here? - No, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Nor had any intelligence from him? - No farther than the subpoena.</p>
               <p>Have not you been in Court during the whole time the prosecutor was examined? - Yes, my Lord, I was; I did not hear the witnesses for the prisoner ordered out; I heard the witnesses for the prosecutor ordered out; or else it would have been the same to me; I came here with no tale; I never saw the man before nor had any conversation with him; Tillcock and the prisoner were before, and Blake and me were behind some steps.</p>
               <p>How did the prisoner get at you to subpoena you? - He was examined three times at Guildhall before he was committed, and there he got my name; I met his wife one day promiscuously in St. Giles's; I knew nothing of the man; I met her once since that again.</p>
               <p>How came you to know it was his wife? - They said so when he was examined; she attended the examination every day; but Tillcock can tell as well as me.</p>
               <p>What sort of a woman was she? - A young woman, appearing about two or three and twenty.</p>
               <p>Did you give the man's wife or him your direction? - Why I do not know whether I did mention it at the Castle.</p>
               <p>It is impossible you can have forgot? - I believe I did at the Castle, before Tillcock and the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Did you give that direction in writing? I believe he wrote it in writing.</p>
               <p>Did you give it in writing? - I really cannot say who wrote it; going up Guildhall yard, Blake's wife says to him, never mind, swear that you took it out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Was you employed this fair time by the Marshal? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which of the Marshals? - Mr. Miller.</p>
               <p>Did he pay you for your attendance? - Yes; he gave us an order for the money.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you ever say at any time that you took the chain out of the prisoner's hand? - It is false, every thing; because I never spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Did you say that before the Magistrate? - I do not recollect that I did; I told the Magistrate that I saw the chain in his hand and he dropped it directly.</p>
               <p>Did you ever say that you took it out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250184"/> of the prisoner's hand? - I picked it up directly.</p>
               <p>Court. Let Mrs. Blake go out of Court.</p>
               <p>Now in Guildhall yard, when you came away, did your wife say to you, never mind, swear that you took it out of his hand? - No, she said no such thing to me; why should I swear any thing that is not true.</p>
               <p>Did your wife ever tell you to swear that? - No, she never told me nothing.</p>
               <p>Was not it the last winess that desired you to make it up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When he wanted to make it up, what did he say? - He spoke to my other witness Dunchin twice; a man came to me twice from Sargesson; Sargesson never spoke to me; it was Dunchin that came to me.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect coming home whether you put your hand into your pocket or into your fob? - I took out my chain and shewed it to 
               <persName id="t17861025-103-person1278">

            , and put it directly into my green-shag waistcoat pocket; that was in the fair.</p>
               <p>When you came in the house you shewed the chain to Tillcock, did you, when you was walking home, put your hand to your fob and say any thing to him? - I never spoke to him all the way home; the constable offered me two guineas the next day to make it up; says he, come here, I want to speak to you; says he, you are French, I know that very well, says he, you do not know the law of England; yes, says I; says he, he will be tried at the Old Bailey, and the costs to you will be sixty pounds; my wife was in the public house, at the sign of the Castle; he called me out to him; I wn out to him twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Court. Call in Mrs. Blake</p>
               <p>Did you go with Mr. Blake backwards and forwards to the Magistrate? - Yes, Sir, every day.</p>
               <p>How do you and your husband get your living in Nightingale-lane? - Only by his going to sea.</p>
               <p>Did you tell your husband any time, never mind, swear that he had the chain in his hand? - No; I always was quite against it; I wished to have no trouble with it; I am very sure I never told him, never mind it, swear that he had the chain in his hand; I could take my affidavy I never said such a word as that.</p>
               <p>Court. Let Mr. and Mrs. Blake come forward, and let Sargesson stand up together.</p>
               <p>Now Sargesson, Mr. and Mrs. Blake, on the solemn oath they have taken, have both positively sworn that what you have said is false; Mr. and Mrs. Blake swear positively, that there was no such word said, as never mind it, swear that he had the chain in his hand; now I ask you, upon your oath, whether you will still persist in what you have said? - Yes, I will, point blank, swear that she said to him in Guildhall-yard, going up on his shoulder, never mind, swear that you took the chain out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Blake. When did you see Sargesson first, did you see him in your way home talking with your husband? - No, Sir, Sargesson came with us to the public house from the fair; he was first with my husband, then with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any conversation between the fair and the public house, between Sargesson and your husband? - No farther than he wanted to persuade my husband to make it up; he said you had better take four or five shillings, and make it up, than let it go any farther; it will only cost you a deal of trouble.</p>
               <p>To make what up? - I did not hear him say what.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him say the b - g - r wanted totake away my watch? - No, Sir, I did not hear him say so, because he very seldom makes ude of that word; he might say it, but I did not hear him; we went to the public house in Guildhall-yard every day.</p>
               <p>Do you remember Sargesson's beckoning your husband out for any thing? - Yes, Sir, I was sitting by at the same time.</p>
               <p>How long was your husband out? - About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250185"/>You did not follow him to know what Sargesson said to him? - No, Sir, I did not; I asked him several times, but he did not tell me.</p>
               <p>Court to Dunchin. Do you know whether you saw the watch and the chain separate in Smithfield or any time before he got to the compter? - Yes, Sir, as they were going through the fair, after the prisoner was in custody, the prosecutor took the chain in his hand, and put it into his waistcoat pocket; at the pu blic house he took out the chain of his watch out of his waistcoat pocket, and gave it to the constable; I saw him, as he was going along the fair, put it in his waistcoat pocket; I came with them to the public house; he had no conversation with Sargesson; he was going on in a passion, with his face bloody; and Sargesson came to me twice, to endeavour to make it up with the prosecutor, for it would only cost trouble, and I went to him the first time, says I, you have got your watch and your chain, what signifies; he said, he would have satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Was there any conversation between the last witness, Sargesson, as he was walking through the fair to the public house and the prosecutor? - I did not take notice of any.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing to you about making up the blows or any thing of the kind? - No, he did not say any thing of the kind; Sargesson came to me another time, then he asked me to advise the man to make it up; he did not say a word that I know about blows or any thing, only to make it up, that it might not go any farther.</p>
               <p>Did Sargesson say any thing at the public house that you recollect? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>He did not tell the prosecutor, why you are a bad man, you broke it yourself, or any thing of that kind? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did the prosecutor, at the public house, charge the prisoner with having taken his chain? - He did, and Sargesson said nothing to it; I was at the Castle the last day; but I cannot recollect whether the prosecutor was called out by any body or not.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I came home the 21st of August; I bought the watch chain and key since I came home, because the watch I had when I was in the kingdom before; then I took it out of the kingdom.</p>

               <p>Was it at Charing-cross that the coachman got in? - No.</p>
               <p>At what time did the coachman get into the coach, and shut up the blinds? - The blinds were shut up.</p>
               <p>What time was it that the coachman got in? - It was the latter end of the night, which I suppose to be three o'clock.</p>
               <p>You know you were together about seven hours? - More than ever I was out in my life; it was ten o'clock when I first set off, we were half an hour drinking a glass of ale; I lived at that time in Denmark-court, No. 14.</p>
               <p>Now you live on Saffron-hill? - Yes.</p>

               <p>How many pints of ale did you drink together? - I drank a glass of ale, but if I had got quite drunk, it is no reason I should be robbed of my property.</p>
               <p>By the time you parted in the morning, I believe you was pretty drunk? - I defy them to say so that I was drunk, or yet to say that they can disprove me, whether I am man or woman.</p>
               <p>How many fares were taken up, and how often did you ride on the outside of the coach? - They took up two fares, and the prisoner was behind.</p>
               <p>First you went out of town? - Yes, but they broke my command; I am not drunk now, I am rather confused at you; I wish to be as partial to the prisoner as any one, and to them all; I do not wish to be severe to any, and I pity the unfortunate, but I have been cruelly treated; I leave it to the Judge of the Court.</p>
               <p>Where did you first find this man? - He was first taken by one Lucas; he was taken the Sunday after.</p>
               <p>How often have you taken him up, and how often has he been discharged? - Once he was taken up by the constable before he was brought to justice; a second time he was taken up and brought before Mr. Justice Croft, then he was set at liberty; and after that he was taken up and discharged, at last he was committed.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did not you swear that this young man's brother was the person? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you never had him in custody for this offence? - No, I never had him in custody; I gave him a challenge of it, and he went and charged the watch with me; I accused one brother in order to bring the other brother before me.</p>
               <p>Did not you positively swear to that brother before the magistrate? - No; he was not carried before any Justice, I went at the hour they ordered me, and he never came.</p>
               <p>Court. After you was used in this manner, who did you go to the next morning? - To the same place where I lived before, in Denmark Court, No. 14; I lodged with a woman that lives on the second floor; Mrs. Holmes keeps the whole; I was with her taking care of her child.</p>
               <p>How came you by the bundle? - I had been out that evening a visiting in Mincing-lane, No. 25. I took the bundle out with me to work; the gown was half made and half unmade.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I was applied to by this young woman about her bundle; I think it was some time in August, or the latter end of July; she came to me and told me she had been robbed; she then mentioned the prisoner, she said the prisoner could tell me all about it, one of the coachmen had cheated her of her bundle; I went down with her into the Strand, this young man was in the public house; she found him out; I understood she had been there before; she took me directly to him, when we came there I called him out, and asked him about the matter, and he said he was the person that was upon the coach-box; that the coachman and she were together in the coach, and he believed they had connections, or something of that fort, and he should be very glad to go with me any where to apprehend the coachman if I thought it was a robbery; he went with me to different parts of the town; we did not find the coachman; she then said, as you cannot find the coachman, I insist on your taking this man up; the man came several times to the office, she applied for a warrant, the magistrate refused it, it was Justices Clark and Walker; I do not believe the prisoner had ever been in custody above twice; there was a warrant granted once or twice, and the magistrates discharged him.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the brother of this young man being in custody? - Yes, one morning; as far as I can recollect, she stopped him somewhere in the street, the watch was charged to take him into custody; I believe he was in custody all night, and the next morning the young man was brought up, and she never appeared; he was discharged.</p>
               <p>Have you ever enquired how this young woman gets her living? - Some say she's out of her mind; the magistrates thought so however.</p>

               <p>Court. You went to the office in expectation of seeing some man there that had robbed you? - Yes, my servant said, he knew the man, and I went in expectation of seeing somebody that my servant should know.</p>
               <p>When you went in were there many people in the room? - Not more than six or eight, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner the first man that was fetched when you went in? - Yes, as soon as I came in, Mr. Bond sent for him immediately.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner was fetched, was he shewn to you as a person that was under a suspicion of robbing you, or did you make any observation of him? - When the prisoner was brought, Mr. Bond asked me if I knew that man; I said, I did not, for I did not know the men that robbed me; and I immediately said, I am upon oath Mr. Bond, to speak the whole truth, the man's voice exceedingly corresponds with the voice of the man that ordered me to get into my carriage again.</p>
               <p>Did you make any observations besides the voice? - Not the least; only the man that was on that side, was a very tall man.</p>
               <p>How was it as to the light at that time? - It was not sufficiently light for me to distinguish exactly the colours; I could see white from black, but I suppose, I could not distinguish blue from black; all the recollection I have, I think the man on that side, when he turned round he appeared to have lightish clothes, but I cannot say with certainty; I took particular notice he was very tall; as to the faces of either of them I cannot tell; I do not think either of them were muffled; but I cannot be positive; nothing has been found; it was only money, and there was nothing singular about it; we drank tea in London, and left town about six, and we jugged on about five miles, or five miles and an half; we came from Moorfields in order to avoid the stones of the city; we went through Paddington.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, Prisoner's Counsel. If I understand you right, it was so dark that you could not distinguish colours? - Not sufficiently.</p>
               <p>You made no observation at all on the person? - No, only that he was a very tall man.</p>

               <p>I am a servant to Mr. Holbrook; my master was robbed of a Tuesday night about a month ago; about half after seven as nigh as I can guess; I was driving the chaise; he came up and said, stop, post-boy, stop, or I will blow your brains out.</p>
               <p>Who came up? - A tall thin young fellow, in light coloured clothes, with a long face.</p>
               <p>Should you know him again? - I believe I should.</p>
               <p>Is the prisoner the person? - I believe that is the person.</p>
               <p>Do you believe the prisoner to be the man? - I believe him to be the man; I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Why did not you say so at first? - I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Is it by looking at him that makes you sure? - I am sure he is the man; I took particular notice of him at the time of the robbery; the prisoner at the bar came up and said, stop post-boy, stop immediately, or I will blow your brains out; I stopped immediately; he was close to me; he came from behind; he was of the near side of me; he turned back and demanded the money; your money, says he; he did not demand my money; I am a servant; he demanded my master's money; he went on the near side of the carriage where my mistress was; the prisoner was not the person that went to my master.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether your mistress gave him any money? - I cannot say; I heard none pass between them.</p>
               <p>What passed after this? did he do any thing after this? - No, he swore at them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250193"/> that were in the carriage before the glasses were let down; he said, let the glasses down, or I will blow your brains out; my master got out of it, and said, if they were gentlemen, to behave as gentlemen, as they had got his money; he told him to get into the chariot again, or else he would blow his brains out.</p>
               <p>Which of them said so? - I cannot say, they both said they would blow his brains out, if he did not get into the carriage.</p>
               <p>Are you sure they both said so, or only one of them? - They both said so; I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Was the tall man on the side of the carriage with your master, or on the other side? - He was on my side.</p>
               <p>Did they both speak together? - Very near together, but I cannot say which spoke first.</p>
               <p>Did they both speak to you at the time you stopped? - Only one, that was him that was on my side, that was the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Then at any one time, did you hear his voice alone? - I heard his voice then, that was the only time, the other was not speaking then.</p>
               <p>When you went to the magistrates with your master, did you go in expectation of seeing the man that robbed your master? - When I first saw the prisoner, he was brought into the room.</p>
               <p>Was you asked if that was the man? - Yes; I said, I believed he was the person by his voice, and by his complxeion.</p>
               <p>Was there light enough to see his complexion at the time of the robbery? - Yes, he was close to me; he partly touched me; he had no disguise in the least; he rode up to me; I knew him by his voice, and by his long thin face, and his dress.</p>
               <p>What had the man you saw in Bow-street the same dress on? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What dress had he on? - A light coloured coat, a cocked up hat, and his hair tied behind; when I saw him at Bow-street, he appeared in the same way.</p>
               <p>Had he a cocked up hat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Considering the situation in which he which he stands, his life depending on your evidence, can you safely swear, what you have sworn already, that you have no doubt but he is the man? - I have no doubt but he is the man.</p>
               <p>You will swear that positively? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. How long have you been coachman to my friend Mr. Holbrook? - About four months.</p>
               <p>You knew the prisoner perfectly well before the robbery? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by complexion? - I know him in every respect.</p>
               <p>But explain what you mean by complexion? - His complexion, and his height, and his thinness, and his dress, and his voice.</p>
               <p>The man that robbed you, you never saw before; and you never saw him till a month afterwards? - It was very nigh a month.</p>
               <p>You knew before you got there, that you was to see a man that was charged with robbing you master? - I did not mind any thing about that.</p>
               <p>But you was told to drive your master to see the man that robbed him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you had talked of this robbery to your companions, and says you, or says they, if we can convict him, there is forty pounds? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You never heard of forty pounds? you will swear that upon your oath? - I have heard of it, but never heard any thing about my having the forty pounds; I heard there was forty pounds for somebody.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you first hear that? - A long while ago.</p>
               <p>Before you went to Bow-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you expect some share of it? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Who was to have the forty pounds? - I cannot say, I never inquired about it.</p>
               <p>Do not you expect some of it? - No, nor desire any.</p>
               <p>Who did you understand was to have the forty pounds, upon your oath? - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250194"/> did not understand who in particular was to have the forty pounds one way or the other; I did not know the witnesses was to have any thing; I cannot say who was to have any of it; I never enquired about it; I never heard in discourse who was to have it.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived near London? - Not a quarter of a year.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, have not your fellow servants told you, it would be a good thing to put a part of this money in your pocket? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did nobody say any thing about it at Bow-street? - Nobody said any thing about it at all.</p>
               <p>You never heard you was to have a part of it? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you to say it was light enough to distinguish? - It was light enough.</p>
               <p>Is not your master a man of character? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He says it was not light enough? - He could not see so well as me.</p>
               <p>Your master was out of the chariot? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And he says it was dark? - I could distinguish clear.</p>
               <p>Now as to voice what was there particular in the man's voice? - Like the person's that is at the bar.</p>
               <p>How is his voice different from mine? - He does not speak like you; he came up to me in a good humour.</p>
               <p>How came you at first to say, I believe he is the man, two or three times, and then afterwards mend your evidence; was not you told to plump it now? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you understand the counsel just now? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know what is meant by plumping it? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Did any body tell you to say any thing about it? - No, Sir, neither in Court, nor out of Court.</p>
               <p>Have you ever had any conversation with any person desiring you to give any account of this business? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Could you swear to my voice to morrow, if you was to hear it? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You would forget it to-morrow, should you? - No, I do not think I should.</p>
               <p>You would swear to my voice to-morrow? - Yes, if you spoke as you do now.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. In the confusion of this fire, you lost a great many things? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your friends got them out of the house as soon as they could? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had the box ever been opened after it came to your house from Birmingham? - No, Sir, I never opened it.</p>

               <p>Was it nailed down when it came to you? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Had you any letter of advice? - No.</p>

               <p>I am in partnership with Mr. Stiff, in New-street, Covent-garden; on Monday, the 6th of October, between the hours of ten and twelve, the prosecutor came to our shop for some buttons; he came behind to my partner and me, as we were sitting at the desk, and told us, he understood a person was to come to sell some buttons; about one the same day, the prisoner came to my partner and me, as we were sitting at the desk, and produced two buttons, one of each, and mentioned that he had a quantity to dispose of; we asked him if he was the manufacturer of them; he said no, he had them of a taylor who lodged in his house, who was gone to Liverpool, and that it was all he had for fifteen pounds; we asked him what price he asked for them; he said, he could not think of taking less than four shillings and sixpence; he did not say, nor we did not mention, whether he meant the single gross, or the double gross, as we did not want an explanation, only to get possession of the buttons; we appointed him to come at three; about ten minutes before that, he brought the buttons tied up in two handkerchiefs; he put them on the counter in the front shop; I desired him to step into the back shop, which had not the command of the shop door, as I expected the prosecutor with his friends, to come at three; the prosecutor came in with two gentlemen belonging to the Sun-fire-office; and the foreman of the fire men, when he came in, he gave me a small slip of paper, upon which was wrote the number of the buttons, and the description of the buttons, and the quantity; the number that was affixed to them, if they were his buttons was ninety, upon which they just pulled open one corner of the handkerchief; I had not unpacked the buttons; I looked and saw it agreed with the paper, which the prosecutor had given me; and agreed with the numbers on the front of the buttons, upon which the prosecutor and the gentlemen from the office called the prisoner forwards, and untied the handkerchief; he was asked if they were his property; he said they were; one of the gentlemen belonging to the Sun-fire-office said, Sir, you must produce the person you had these buttons from, they were stolen, at which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250196"/> the prisoner seemed surprized; he was taken to Bow-street.</p>

               <p>So did the correspondent in London send down the number? - Certainly; if the manufacturer should send these buttons to a hundred different sorts of people, they would have been the same.</p>
               <p>Have you any of them? - I do not keep any of the sort; I had them a very little time; it may be common with other button-makers.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester to Prosecutor. Look at these buttons? - They are my property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you ever see them before you saw them at Wightman's? - No.</p>
               <p>Who do you deal with at Birmingham? - I do not know him; a friend of mine wrote for the buttons.</p>
               <p>Did not he write for that sort of button, that was numbered 92 on the card? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If I wrote to him he would send them to me? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>If any body had looked at this card for that button, would not they have found it 92? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now you have never seen these, how can you say they were your property? - He sent me white once.</p>
               <p>How can you say he did not do so now? There is the proof of it.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you by that paper that you delivered in to Mr. Wightman? - My friend who wrote for the buttons gave it me; his name is

               <p>How came your friend to write it? - By my desire, because Mr. Wightman said, he wanted to ascertain the number and the quantity; and I went to my friend who wrote for the buttons, and he looked in the bill and there he found the number; I produced that number to Mr. Wightman, and the number and the quantity answered with these offered to sale at Mr. Wightman's; from all which, and the box being found in the prisoner's lodgings, I conclude they are my property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Umpage. Where did you find the box? - Down in the kitchen; when I went to his house, I asked him where the box was that held the buttons; he said it was in the kitchen, but desired me not to make a noise; it was publicly there.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Cooke, in Well's-street, Piccadilly; the prisoner lodged at Mr. Cooke's; I remember his bringing a box there; it was the box that was found by Umpage, on the 2d of this month; about seven in the evening, I heard a knock at the door.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250197"/>Court. Was that the night of the fire? - I do not know; when I went up it was Mr. Fox, and he said, Molly, I have picked up a box, but what is in it, God knows; I asked him, where he found it; he said, in the street, on the pavement; he went up stairs; Mr. Fox said, take it in the kitchen, perhaps we may find an owner for it; the next day in the afternoon, Mr. Fox came down into the kitchen and looked at the box, and said, Molly, there is no direction on the outside, I wonder if there is any within; he opened the box, and there was no direction, only a parcel of buttons; he said, he did not think they were of much value; he would look in the paper to see if they were advertised; on the day that he went to sell them, he said, they were not advertised, and he might sell them as well as another.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What is Mr. Cooke? - He keeps an academy.</p>
               <p>How near is Well's-street where you live, to Vine-street where the fire was? - No great way.</p>
               <p>You heard of the fire? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This was the evening of the fire I understand? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>About seven in the evening, whereabouts upon the pavement did he find it? - He did not tell me; he said, to the best of my knowledge in Vine-street; my master never comes into the kitchen; nobody goes into the kitchen but myself.</p>
               <p>Did you look at the outside of this box to see if there was any direction? - Yes; there was no direction.</p>
               <p>No mark upon it? - Not to the best of my remembrance; I saw none upon paper.</p>
               <p>What became of the other part of the box? - I do not know; there was no direction on the box.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. You would have found no difficulty in burning it if you had been desired? did not you advise him to go to Vine-street where the poor people had been burnt out? - No, I had no business with it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses who gave him an exceeding good character.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding, Prisoner's Counsel. You seem to be a very odd old gentleman; we have seen you in all the Courts I am sure: So a part of this house is where your coal-shed is, where you keep your few coals, and your sticks? - Yes, my few coals; I suppose Mr. Cassell might be indebted to me ten or twelve pounds; at the time he was in prison, I was such a blockhead as to let him have money.</p>

               <p>Then upon that you received that woman into your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now you receive the things belonging to Cassell also? - Yes, but in the same room.</p>
               <p>Did not you receive them things of Cassell for safe custody? - Of himself.</p>
               <p>Was ever Cassell to have these things back again? - Whenever he paid me the money.</p>
               <p>How many goods might you have received? - I did not take any inventory; I received them from different people.</p>
               <p>Then you knew at the time you received these goods, that they belonged to the creditors? - I paid the money for them.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. Did you ever see it out of the case? - Yes, when Mr. Hill took it into his hand; I cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>How came you by it? - The prisoner delivered it into my hands, in her own apartment, No. 4, in the Broad-way, Westminster, in the two pair of stairs backwards; she said it belonged to Mr. Cassell, and she said, she would be much obliged to me, if I would be so kind to go with it; I carried it to Mr. Hill, the same day she delivered it to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Did not Cassell send you with it? - Mr. Cassell desired me, when he was in prison, to pledge something for him, and I carried this; I went by Cassell's orders and desire, and I got this and pledged it for him, and returned the money to Susanah Redman; she made no secret of it at all.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know this was done by Cassell's order? - Cassell gave me orders for going himself.</p>
               <p>Did Cassell desire you to pawn the quadrant for him? - He desired me to pledge any thing I could, for he was distressed.</p>

               <p>At the time you was in prison, did you give any orders about a quadrant that was in the hands of Mr. Thomlinson? - I gave him an order, whether it was a written order, I will not be clear; I sent him to the prisoner, and desired her to let him take my quadrant.</p>

               <p>On Monday the 11th of September, the prisoner Patrick, who confessed he was the father to the little boy, brought this gold into my shop to sell it, between the hour of nine and ten; I asked the prisoner how he came by it, he told me, he gave four-penny-worth of oysters for it.</p>

               <p>Court.

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Can you swear this to be yours? - No, I cannot; a confession was taken in writing, signed by the boy, and I witnessed it; the boy was taken an hour or two afterwards.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you present when the confession was taken in writing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It is a confession by the boy? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you seen the boy before that confession was made? - I went with him from my house with the constable; he had lived in my house seven weeks an errand boy; he lived with me when he was taken up to the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>Did he tell him he would be prosecuted if he did not confess? - No, Sir, the boy began to make an excuse; telling me it was gold he found in the shop; I am sure I had not threatened him, or told him it would be better for him.</p>

               <p>Was you present when he was brought? - Yes; he first said, that his cousin gave him the money; then he said, he worked for it; it appeared he had lain out in that week, in one way or the other, upwards of twenty pounds, with what he got out of pawn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. How long have you known him? - A great while; he has worked for me ever since the beginning of April; I have heard say his wife and him have lived very creditable; but very much reduced.</p>
               <p>You have told us that this man had the things in pawn which he redeemed? - So he told us; I am sure I saw the money on Wednesday the 11th of October; I had put it into the top drawer or the bureau; it was my husband's money; he did not know there was so much as there was; he might know perhaps there was twenty pounds; for I have worked very hard these three years, because I have a small<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250205"/> family; I did not tell him every thing; my husband never went to that drawer at all.</p>
               <p>How much rent had you to pay? - Twenty-five shillings and nine-pence; and to our cow master about eight pounds; we had between nine and ten to pay.</p>
               <p>How long ago was it that your husband borrowed five guineas towards paying his rent? - He never brought five guineas since I was married; I never said so to any body.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Earle, a shoemaker? - I do; my husband buys his shoes of him.</p>
               <p>How lately had he occasion to buy shoes of him? - I do not know; about six weeks ago he had a pair, and paid him.</p>
               <p>You do not know now that he applied to Mr. Earle on credit, and said, he was ceedingly distressed? - No, he did not, I am sure; I have been in the milk way about three years; my husband was a coachman; and when we came into business, I had seventeen guineas; we had saved almost fifteen pounds; my husband carries a pair of pails, and I carry two kettles, that carries a good deal of milk.</p>
               <p>Have you lately sold any of your furniture or clothes or things? - No, nothing in the world.</p>
               <p>Nor you have not said so to any body? - No, I have not.</p>

               <p>What account did he give of himself how he got that twenty pounds? - First, he said, he had it of his cousin; then he denied it, and said, it was money that he earned at three-halfpence an hour of Mrs. May; the prisoner was very mean and ragged, and was quite destitute.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was this money kept in a locked drawer? - Yes; I seldom went to it; I did not know the sum; I never applied to any body for five guineas; I never wanted it.</p>
               <p>Have you never said that you have? - No, Sir; I know Mr. Earle; he is my shoemaker; I never applied to him for credit for any thing; I had no suspicion of the prisoner; I have known him since he came to work for Mrs. May; I knew him in the life time of his wife.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. His work was laborious? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I worked for Mrs. May seven months; and I laid the money by; she almost always gave me victuals then; and when I had done work for her I went on messages; I slept in a gentleman's house in Portman-square; that saved my money; that was something every week; I had a few things of my wife's that I sold; and I laid the money by, thinking to get me two or three things.</p>
               <p>Court. Then how came you to lay it out all on a sudden; to lay it all out and get drunk, that does not agree well with the character of an industrious sober man? - I was afraid of losing the things; I never was down in Mrs. Kensington's kitchen in my life; if ever I was down, it was for a little milk for Mrs. May; I never saw a farthing of the money in my life.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Paddington-street, Mary-le-bone; I keep a house there; I am married; I have known him between seven and eight years; he has been employed by me the whole time his wife washed for my family, at her own habitation; he is remarkably sober, honest, and industrious, so much so, that whenever my mother had any business to execute, that she could not repose trust in a common porter, or even her own servants, she used to say, she would send for honest Cloud.</p>
               <p>I believe that was his general name? - Yes; and if the clergyman of the parish had been in town, he would have appeared for him; when I heard he was taken up, I asked the prosecutrix how she came to have so much money by her; and she said, her husband had borrowed five guineas towards making up his rent; that was the way she accounted for having so much money.</p>
               <p>Where was this conversation? - At the woman's where he mangled.</p>
               <p>Was any body else present? - Captain Seymore.</p>
               <p>Captain Seymore. I went with Mrs. Hudson, to enquire into the merits of the case; and that woman, I think I heard her say, she had thirty guineas in her possession; and I made reply to her, I rather think it is too large a sum for you to have together at one time, living in a cellar, in great poverty, as you appear to me; I do not recollect that she made any reply.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect hearing any thing about borrowing five guineas? - No, not from her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Where is it your live, madam? - No. 9, Paddington-street.</p>
               <p>Are you married or single? - My husband is gone to India.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with Captain Seymore? - Fourteen years.</p>
               <p>Then he and you being acquainted, went to this house? - Yes, Sir, we went first to the clergyman's; all the neighbourhood were interested for him; Mrs. May was present; and she recommended them as objects of charity to me, having lost their money; I never knew any thing of the people before; they seemed to be in a great state of poverty; four small children, in such indigence, as not to be able to realize thirty-one guineas; I did not go into their cellar; the children were all brought up to me to excite charity; the woman was very shabby, and very poor, and the children I did not look to see whether they were ragged.</p>
               <p>What was it that impressed you with the idea of poverty? - Living in a milk cellar, and being brought to me with four small children; I told them, if the man was found guilty, they certainly would be paid by his being condemned; if he was not, his friends would make it up; the man's wife has been dead a year and a half; I have known him very near eight years; my mother died a year before Mrs. Cloud died, of the same complaint; he has mangled for me; this man, by his honest, good character, has recommended the woman to half the business she has; he brought the linen backwards and forwards to my house; and I took his recommendation of her as a washer-woman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mrs. May. Has this man recommended you to any family? - Yes, to two or three; I mangled for Mrs. Hudson; he fetched and carried all my linen; I frequently gave him his victuals, and frequently asked him when he would not accept; he certainly appeared to be a saving, frugal fellow; I was present part<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250208"/> of the time when Mrs. Hudson came; I cannot recollect about the five guineas; the prosecutrix had four children; I am very positive she had the money; she shewed it to me a month or two before.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know this Mrs. Hudson? - I never had the pleasure of seeing the lady above once or twice before.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Kensington. Mrs. Hudson came into the shop, and a gentleman with her; I cried and said, it was a great loss; I said it was a great loss to us, as we had seven or eight guineas to pay to our cow-keeper; she said, it would be a great charity to make a collection for us.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two more witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>What do they cut them away for, a malicious kind of amusement or what? - They are cut away with intent to go a thieving and plundering on the river; my boat was locked on shore, to go away at high water; the headfast was cut, and she was taken away between twelve and one o'clock; I caught the four prisoners in her, on the 22d of September.</p>
               <p>Where did you catch them? - Between New-crane, and King Edward's Tier; they were rowing; I suppose it was between three and four hundred yards; we had a boat on the lower side of the stairs, and a boat on the upper side of the stairs, with a proviso, that any body should come and take the boats away.</p>
               <p>Did you see this boat taken away? - We saw them come rowing out from the stairs with her; we perceived them, and rowed along side of them, and asked them whose boat it was; and they immediately said it was their's; I looked at the boat, and knew it to be mine by my number; then we immediately took hold of their headfast, and towed them on shore, and sent for the watch, and they were taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Do you know them? - I never saw them before.</p>
               <p>Did they belong to any vessel that lay in any of the tiers that were round? - One of them told the Justice that he came to go into the Borough, that he lived there, and he said he came down to New-crane, to get over the water to see somebody at Deptford; they all pretended to be going over the water.</p>
               <p>Were there any sculls in your boat when you left it? - No, I could see that they brought sculls with them, for they had a pair in the boat.</p>
               <p>Jury. I believe it is a very common thing to take one another's boats; was there any mark or name on the sculls that you found on the boat, when you came up to it? - There were a pair of scu lls in her, but when we took hold of her, the sculls were thrown overboard, so that we could not see them.</p>

               <p>Were was that ship bound to? - To the South-seas; we all three belong to the same ship.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the watchman when you was taken, that you belonged to that ship? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Court to the watchman. Did you take these men into custody? - Yes, they gave no account of themselves, only they said, they cried scullers; I never heard any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Did any of the watermen hear them cry scullers? - No, and we lay close too.</p>

               <p>Were there any promises made to him? - Not to exempt him from prosecution.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner say any thing to whom the house belonged? - No.</p>
               <p>Was that confession taken before the Magistrate in writing? - I am not clear whether this last confession was taken down before the Magistrate or no; we could not promise him the favour of the Court; but we told him, we imagined it would be the only way to obtain favour; then he told us; and until we told him so, he never declared himself.</p>

               <p>How soon did the ship sail after this? - In two or three days; I do not know she staid more; I cannot be sure which.</p>
               <p>Did you lay any information before any Justice of the peace of this before you went? - No, Sir, because I could not find the man; I did not.</p>
               <p>Were these sold you as smuggled goods? - I do not know whether they are or not; they were sold me as such.</p>
               <p>Was this silk or gingham that you bought? - The chief was silk; I do not remember there was any cotton among it.</p>
               <p>Is this prisoner a Custom-house-officer? - I never heard he was; I never saw him before that night; I did not know his name positively at that time, till the next morning; then I found out his name.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. How far did he live from Mr. Swinney's? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Yes, you do? - It is in Fore-street; I am sure it is not half a mile.</p>
               <p>Did you go to his lodgings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Before you went to Scotland? - No.</p>
               <p>Why did not you do that? - Because I did not find it.</p>
               <p>How long have you been come from Ireland? - That was the last place I came from; I have been home since the 14th or 15th of August.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts did you take him up? - I did, a month ago; I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Is it a week ago? - It is more than two weeks.</p>
               <p>Is it three weeks? - I do not know; I could not find out his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - Many people know I was a farmer in Georgia; I live sometimes at Saltpetre-bank; there are more Americans there besides me; I lodge up stairs at a public house, and two of us have a room to ourselves.</p>
               <p>Did you go with the constable to this man's lodgings? - No, Sir, I did not; but I shewed him to the house.</p>
               <p>Now, another thing, upon your oath, did not he let him go, and the prisoner came back to him the next morning? - I did not let him go; I do not know what the constable did; he told me that he took bail of him.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, do not you know that he let him go on his promise of coming back the next morning? - He told me he took bail of him.</p>

             was at the door when I bought the goods; the first time I saw Callagan was at the end of Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>What might pass between you about it? - I asked him if he had ever found out where Mr. Slimmon lived; he said, he had not.</p>
               <p>Were you and Callagan acquainted? - No, only I knew he was in the house the night I bought the things; he is a duffer; I was sober enough to remember every thing; I had drank some beer.</p>
               <p>How much might you have drank? - That is out of the question.</p>
               <p>No, it is not, it is in the question, it is the question? - I did not measure the mouthfulls I had taken.</p>
               <p>How much money had you got from any body for this gingham that you said you had lost? - Three pounds ten shillings; that was after he was taken and committed to gaol, I got it, and was bound over to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Who did you receive it from? - The tall man, that was his brother, and his wife; I was in distress for money; I was obliged to take some.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that you have any thing from Government? - It does not belong to this question.</p>
               <p>Yes, it does? - Upon my oath, I had twenty shillings last year, and thirty shillings this year fro m Government.</p>
               <p>Have you got any of those ginghams that you bought? - I sold what was remaining of what I had left in my chest; but all I had about me he took; I had bought more on another day.</p>
               <p>And you took from this man three pounds ten shillings, what is become of that money? - I have laid it out; I never returned it back again.</p>
               <p>Court. I hardly think it right, Gentlemen, after a man has taken the price of his goods, to believe a story that he has been robbed.</p>

               <p>Do you mean by fainting, that you lost your senses? - Certainly, Sir, and my money too; he brought a knife in his hand to me, and told me, if I spoke a word, he would cut my throat; I fainted away when I saw him take the petticoat, and the knife in his hand; there was nine guineas and an half in gold; when I recovered, a woman was standing by me, and my petticoat on the stairs towards the street.</p>
               <p>How many other men were in the cellar? - Indeed I cannot rightly tell, there was not many; there were not above five or six at the most.</p>
               <p>How came the prisoner to know you had money in your petticoat? - He saw me sewing it in my petticoat on Saturday night; he lived with me two or three months; I never received my money.</p>
               <p>When did you see the prisoner after? - I did not see him till he was at the watch-house; he left his shoes, stockings, waistcoat, handkerchief, and hat behind him; he went away only in his breeches, and an old check shirt.</p>

               <p>Did he appear to have been up the chimney? - Yes, he was in the shirt with a handkerchief round his head, and all over soot; I carried him to the watch-house; he said, he bought some of the clothes the same day, and some of them the day before; the next day he was taken before the Justice, and was committed; I saw the constable take a pair of silver knee-buckles out of his breeches, before he gave them to him; and the constable took a pair of silver buttons out of his shirt sleeves; they were the breeches he acknowledged to be his, and a pair of stockings.</p>

               <p>I live in Little Russel-street Bloomsbury; I am constable; I suppose the boy calls upon me because I am in Court; this woman came to me, and said, she had been robbed of nine guineas and a half; it was in the beginning of September; I did not make any memorandum of it; she said, she had stopped a woman that lived there with her; I went and took the woman in custody in Buckerridge-street, and brought her up to Mr. Walker's office in Hyde-street; and there the woman charged her with taking this money; to the best of my knowledge, she said, that woman she supposed had taken her money, and knew that she sewed it in her petticoat; there was a little place in her petticoat that looked as if something had been put in it; I searched the woman, but she had no money at all about her; Mr. Walker discharged her; the prosecutrix then said, it must be a little boy they call Welch; she never mentioned a word about the knife, or about the boy coming about the bedside; but I believe our clerk took it down in writing, every thing she said.</p>
               <p>I wish you to recollect this if you can, whether the prosecutrix did not tell you that this woman must be connected with Welch? - Yes, she did.</p>
               <p>Did not she tell you that she and Welch had kept company together? - I did understand it, that this boy and this woman knew one another.</p>
               <p>Did you understand it from the prosecutrix that they knew one another? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>When the prosecutrix made this charge, did you understand it to be a direct charge against the woman of taking the money from the petticoat? - I understood at the first giving the charge, that it was the woman.</p>
               <p>You are sure nothing was said about the knife, or of the boy's coming to the bedside? - I am sure of that; after the Magistrate discharged this woman, she said it must be this boy, and not till then.</p>

               <p>Court. That is not the present question.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. How soon after did you see Flint? - Flint served me with bread and water, and nobody else; and one day, when he brought it, he called me into the hemp-shop, where the bad people pick hemp; they had done work; it was their dinner time; I cannot tell the day; I believe it was the middle of the week; and he pushed me down between the bulks, and put his hand before my mouth because I should not halloo; and when he had done what he wanted, he threatened to flog me if I told the Governor or any body.</p>
               <p>Court. But what did he do child? - He put his private parts into my body; I was afraid, and did not tell any body; I continued there a fortnight after; but he never let me out after, only to wash the cell; I saw nobody else; my master came about two days after; I told him, I was well, because I was afraid of being licked; Flint staid with him all the time; when I came out of Bridewell, my master put me to his journey woman, Mrs. Stunnell, in King-street, Golden-square; I did not tell her the first day, but she saw my shift, and took me to task.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing particular on your shift? - Yes; I had clean linen only once while I was in Bridewell.</p>
               <p>Had you any clean linen from the time that Flint used you so? - No, Sir; she took me to task about it, because I was restless, and I only told her of the Captain, because I was ashamed to tell of two men; but I told my mistress of Flint one day; I really think it was my mistress; it was a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250222"/> month after I came to Mrs. Stunnell, and I went home to my mistress's; I told her in about a fortnight after I went home; she asked me, whether any body had lain with me besides the Captain; then I told her about Flint.</p>
               <p>Had nobody else lain with you? - No, Sir, indeed.</p>
               <p>How near was this hemp room to the place where the people were? - It is a good way off; there was nobody else in the room but me and Flint.</p>
               <p>Was there any body within hearing? - I do not know; Flint never staid with me at any other time; I saw the apprentice boys out; I never saw the Governor where I was; no woman came to me; the Matron never came to me but once, then she gave me a bit of bread and meat.</p>
               <p>Did Flint take any pains to persuade you? - No, Sir, never a word; I struggled, but I could not have the power to move or draw my breath; he was down with me about five minutes; I told him of what the Captain had done to me; it was three days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Prisoner's Counsel. Was not you committed as a loose, idle, disorderly person? - I do not know I was more idle than the rest; I had ran away three times.</p>
               <p>Where did you go on Whitsun Tuesday? - I went into the Park by myself; I walked about the streets all night without victuals or lodging; I have been twice in Bridewell for running away.</p>
               <p>Did you tell this story to any body till you was again carried to the Justice? - I told it to my mistress a fortnight before; my master came to Bridewell to bring me clean linen; I changed it and carried out my soul shift to my mistress; she looked at it, and put it in a great tub of water; it was all stained.</p>
               <p>Was it bloody? - I do not know whether it was blood; it was white stuff.</p>
               <p>Was that the shift you had on when the Captain lay with you? - It was, and when Flint lay with me; I swear positively, that no man ever lay with me before the Captain.</p>
               <p>Did not you change your things before you went to Stunnell? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you any disorder on you? - I was not quite well; I always had such a pain.</p>
               <p>Had you no complaint, no running of any sort? - Yes, Sir, I had indeed; I told Mrs. Stunnel that the Captain had lain with me.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did you never lay with any body in the necessary in the Bridewell? - No.</p>

               <p>Did you never tell these boys that you would behave well for one day to get your clothes, and then you would go upon the town? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you never tell Richards, that Houghton had laid with you? - No.</p>
               <p>If you had called out and made a noise, might not the boys have heard you? - Yes, Sir, they might, but he put his hands before my mouth, that I could not call out.</p>
               <p>When he had done what he pleased, what become of you? - He locked me up in my call; it was not my locking up time; I sometimes spoke to the boys through the grates.</p>
               <p>Did you never see Mr. Fenwick, the governor, after that time? - I could almost swear it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>This girl stept with me a month after she came out; and she told me the Captain had lain with her by force; she did not say what Captain; she was restless of nights, and could not sleep; and afterwards viewed herself much in the glass; I thought she had been with a man, she seemed rather bold; I then told her mistress; I did not examine her linen; she came to me with quite clean linen.</p>
               <p>Court. Did that restlessness continue for any time? - No, only when she first came to me for the first three nights; she did not seem restless afterwards; she boarded with me.</p>
               <p>Had she plenty of meat and drink? - Yes, they were very good to her.</p>
               <p>Perhaps the sudden change of her diet might make her restless? - I did not think so, she used to clasp me in, her arms, and squeeze me very close a night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you take this to be restlessness proceeding from illness, or from lewdness? - I thought it proceeded from lewdness.</p>
               <p>Is it true that you observed the first or second night any appearance on her linen? - I saw nothing, it was my mistress; she was a whole month with me, and never mentioned the name of Flint.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did she appear to be a loose vicious girl? - No otherwise than lazy and playing about, and gave her mind to low company.</p>
               <p>Mrs. MATTHESIAS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the mistress of this girl; she was with me two years; her character has always been a loose, idle girl; I never saw any thing vicious in her; when she came home from Bridewell, I shifted her, and by her linen, I found she had had connections with a man; I did not tax her with it; I sent her to Mrs. Stunnell; she had been taken up four times; twice forgiven, and twice committed for running away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I am sorry to ask you the question, you must forgive me; you spoke of appearances upon her linen, were they such appearances as if it had been the first time, or such as would attend an ordinary connection? - There were no marks of that kind at all; it was marks of being concerned with a man.</p>
               <p>Not at all as if it had been the first time? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>I conclude from your opinion of this girl, that she is a very bad girl? - Sir, she is all that; she never opened her lips to me, or I should have seen into it; she run away again the last time, and we took her to Litchfield-street to get rid of her, and then she told this story; I never heard a word of it before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. How came you not to tax her when you discovered it? - Because she was quite a bad girl, and I thought myself quite above her.</p>
               <p>Do you a mean vicious one? - No, Sir, I cannot say she was vicious as to men, while she was in our house; but we have no men but what are honest; I thought, let other people find her out as I had done.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, I believe your are satisfied.</p>

            , the prosecutor; Mrs. Breedon lived by Bedford-square; she is a lady of fortune; to the best of my remembrance, about last September twelvemonth, on a Tuesday evening, a chariot was brought and left at Mr. Cropper's shop, and Mrs. Breedon said, she would call the next day, or the day after; I believe it was two days after, Mrs. Breedon was talking with Mr. Cropper, to know what he would give her for it, he said, he could not fix a price upon other people's goods; and she said, she was told seven years ago it was worth thirty pounds; Mr. Cropper told her, it was not worth one third of that, and Mrs. Breedon said, she should like to change it for a phaeton, and Mr. Cropper shewed her a phaeton, and they agreed for a phaeton, and to have the chariot in exchange.</p>
               <p>Tell us particularly what the agreement was? - Mrs. Breedon was to give Mr. Cropper twelve guineas and her old chariot, and he was to have one guinea for painting her arms; it was a second hand phaeton, and was to be fitted up for Mrs. Breedon.</p>
               <p>Did she see the phaeton at the time? - Yes, and the phaeton was fitted up according to Mrs. Breedon's agreement; she gave order for a fresh lining; and made in a thorough repair, fit for use; when the phaeton was ready, Mrs. Breedon sent about six weeks after, to the best of my remembrance, and said, she would not have the phaeton, and when Mr. Cropper read the note, he said, it was children's play, and he would not do any such thing, he would have his bargain, and he went on and had it done against the time; he sent to Mrs. Breedon; and she said, she would not have any thing to do with it at all; then there was a trial came on about it; Mrs. Breedon arrested Mr. Cropper for thirty pounds.</p>
               <p>What did they together value it at? - Mr. Cropper said, it was not worth one third of thirty pounds; she was to give twelve guineas and the chariot for the phaeton, and one guinea down for putting in the arms.</p>
               <p>Court. Which brought the action first, do you know? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did not Cropper arrest her for thirteen guineas? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What is this phaeton worth? - To the best of my judgement it is worth twenty or three or four and twenty pounds; that I take to be the value of it; I have not seen it since.</p>
               <p>Have you a mind to buy a bargain this morning, I will sell you one cheap, will you give me three pounds for it? - I do not want to buy any such thing.</p>
               <p>What is become of the chariot? - I do not know; I have not lived with Mr. Cropper for some time.</p>
               <p>You was a witness upon the trial? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You know that there was some one question that the Counsel did not ask you, that if they had asked you, it would have turned the verdict, and she would have the verdict instead of Mr. Cropper? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, have you never said, if the Counsel had asked you one question that he did not ask, Mrs. Breedon would have had a verdict instead of Mr. Cropper? - To the best of my knowledge, I never said so.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, after the trial, did not you say, that if Mrs. Breedon's Counsel had asked you one question, it would have turned the verdict? - I do not remember that ever I did.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you remember what you write, better than what you say; did you ever write a letter to Mrs. Breedon after the trial? - Yes, Sir, I did.</p>
               <p>Recollect what you did write, and I will refresh your memory presently? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Did not you write her thus, that if she would give you ten guineas, you would inform her how she might set aside all the proceedings against her, and put one hundred<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250226"/> guineas in her pocket? - Yes, I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Was you in Cropper's service then? - Yes, I believe I was.</p>
               <p>What did you mean by that, how was you to put a hundred guineas into her pocket? - (No answer.)</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not Cropper see that letter before it was sent? - No, Sir, I do not believe he did.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear he did not? - Yes, Sir; he did not know of it.</p>
               <p>Did not he desire you to write such a letter, upon your oath? - No.</p>
               <p>How soon was this after Cropper came from the hulks? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What was you to do for her, suppose she had given you the ten guineas, what was you to have done. (No answer.)</p>
               <p>Why it was to tell the whole truth, was not it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Let us know what this whole truth and this half truth is? - I told every thing I was asked.</p>
               <p>What did you mean to do or say for her? - That she always insisted that she never would have the phaeton; and it was six weeks after that she sent countermand</p>
               <p>You did not swear that on the former trial? - I was not asked it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What conversation had you with Cropper, before the trial in the King's-bench? - No more than he told me to tell the truth; he never at no time, to the best of my knowledge, told me to conceal the truth.</p>
               <p>Court. Were you sworn on the trial in the Court of King's-bench? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What kind of oath did you take? - To speak the truth to what was asked me to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Can you repeat the oath? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Should you know it if repeated again? did you take oath,</p>
               <p>"The evidence you</p>
               <p>"shall give before the Court and Jury</p>
               <p>"sworn, shall be the truth, the whole</p>
               <p>"truth, and nothing but the truth, so help</p>
               <p>"you God?" - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then why did not you tell the whole truth without being asked? - I told all that I was asked.</p>
               <p>But that was not the oath you took.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Where do you live now? - In Charlton-street, Mary-le-bone; I lodge at Mr. Eaton's.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was servant to Mrs. Breedon; I took a note to Cropper for her.</p>
               <p>Court. Produce the note? - I was present in the drawing-room with Mrs. Breedon, when the tradesman and she were together; it was after I took the note, I brought the candlestick to take the impression of the arms; and it was a clear exchange; and the tradesman was to have twelve guineas, and a guinea to put in the arms; I heard the lady say, let her friends say what they would, the phaeton she would have; nobody was present but us three; I fetched a silver waiter out that had the arms on at the time; he was to go the Herald's-office, to see that the arms were right; I recollect nothing else; I fetched down the servant's livery, that the inside of the phaeton might match with the livery.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. When was this, my girl? - It was about a twelvemonth ago.</p>
               <p>Was that before any action was brought? - It was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Parke, another of the Defendant's Counsel. Will you tell my Lord and the Jury, where you got that pretty word, clear exchange? - I heard it a great many times more than once between the tradesman and the lady.</p>
               <p>Did they use the word clear exchange? - Certainly they did.</p>
               <p>What does it mean? - Why clear exchange is not goods sold and delivered.</p>
               <p>I do not well understand what clear exchange is? - Why clear exchange is clear exchange.</p>
               <p>Have you been in the service of an attorney? - No; she was to give twelve guineas more besides the chariot.</p>
               <p>Did you hear that lady with whom you lived, say that it was a clear exchange?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250227"/> - Upon my oath I did, and I will swear it before a Bench of Justices.</p>
               <p>Did you likewise hear her say, that a clear exchange was not goods sold and delived? - No, I did not; I heard her express that it would not be so much expence to have an exchange as to buy it.</p>
               <p>You did not hear the lady say it was for goods sold and delivered? - Clear exchange is not goods sold and delivered.</p>
               <p>How do you know that, who first gave you that information; you was not born with it? - My imagination tells me so.</p>
               <p>Do you know a Mr. Brown? - Yes, I know him by going to the King's-bench with him upon the first trial.</p>
               <p>Had you ever any conversation with Mr. Brown on this subject? - No more than if he asked me any questions, I answered him; I never saw him before I went to the Court of King's-bench.</p>
               <p>Was not your name called by the cryer of the Court? - I was subpoened; Mr. Brown's clerk served me; I did not talk to him or his clerk; neither Mr. Brown nor his clerk knew what I could say.</p>
               <p>Since the trial in the King's-bench, have you ever had any conversation with any person about this business? - I never repeated what I said there; I had nobody to speak to.</p>
               <p>Where do you live now? - I live with one Mr. Elms, a stationer, near the Jew's-harp-tavern, Mary-bone; I never spoke to any person about this cause; I did not live with the lady; she was a lodger, and boarded with my mistress; I left the house where I lived, I was in view of a better place.</p>
               <p>Have you never declared since the trial, that you was to do for the defendant at all events? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Did you never say any thing at all about this trial? - I never heard any thing about it, till I was subpoened; it is a very disagreeable circumstance to me.</p>

               <p>Have you been a coach-maker for the last twenty years without interruption? - No, Sir, I have not.</p>
               <p>There was a little interruption of your trade.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I do not call him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. He is sworn; he is the Court's witness now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Then I will go on with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. We have heard that it was a year's interruption to your trade? - A year! you make a mistake; it was only three months or thereabouts; I received the King's pardon.</p>
               <p>Have you got it? - I have not got it, Mr. Garrow; I did not know it was necessary, Mr. Garrow.</p>
               <p>Very well, Mr. Cropper.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Garrow waved his objection to the competency of this witness.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Then Mr. Cropper give us the account of this transaction between Mrs. Breedon and you? - In September, 1785, the lady came to me, and asked me if I dealt in carriages; she said, she had a carriage in the country, and had no place to put it up in town; I told her if the lady chose to send for it from the country, she might put it in my place for a few weeks, till such time she had a coach-house, or some other place to put it in; a few days after the carriage came to my shop; I was not at home; word was left for me to wait upon the lady the next day at eleven o'clock; she was busy; she came in a coach to my shop; she asked me what I would give her for the carriage; I told her it was not the business of a tradesman to put a price on another person's property; the lady then said, that about seven years ago the chariot was worth about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250228"/> thirty pounds, as she was told by her coach-maker who made it; but twenty years before, it cost her sixty pounds; it was her wedding carriage; I told her that a carriage that was worth a hundred pounds seven years ago, would not be worth that now, as fashions alter; it was not worth one third of the money now; the lady observed she should like to make an exchange of her chariot for a phaeton, and asked me what she should give me with her chariot, for a phaeton and plated harness; I told her fifteen guineas; she told me, she thought it too much, she would give me twelve; I told her she should have it at twelve guineas and her chariot; she would have her arms; and I told her I would only charge her what the painter charged me, which was a guinea; she told me then, there was a matter she did not mention to me, which was, she could not pay me till Christmas; I told her that was not material, and she did not want it till that time; a few weeks after a gentleman came with her, of the name of Martin; the lady sent me a letter by

            , and I waited on the lady; and she said, I have considered of it, and let my friends say what they will, I insist on having the phaeton; this was about a fortnight after Mr. Martin had been with her to my house; then Mrs. Breedon ordered a servant to fetch a silver-waiter, for there was some difference she thought in her arms or crest, and a candlestick was brought to examine it; I told her I could not find out any, without I was to examine at the Herald's-office; she then desired a candle, and she would give me the impression of her arms and crest in wax, and the name of her husband she gave me in writing, to examine the family arms; and sent the servant to fetch the livery, to see if some lace she had seen in my shop was near the livery; she then told me to go on with it as I thought proper, till just before Christmas, which I did; and a few weeks before Christmas, I received of her a note to wait on her, and she told me, she had put by all thoughts of having a phaeton, and I must give her thirty pounds for her chariot; I told the lady I was not indebted to her thirty pounds, nor no such sum, but when the phaeton was finished and delivered, she was indebted to me fifteen guineas; she said, that if I did not pay her the thirty pounds, she should put it into the hands of her attorney; then I received a letter from one Mr. Allen, that if I did not pay her thirty pounds, I should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250229"/> he sued; I then went to Mrs. Breedon, I could not see her; I left my name; the servant came again at five o'clock; I went there, and I saw a gentleman, which was Mr. Allen, sitting by the fire, apparently asleep; the lady then asked me some questions about her carriage, and when I thought to pay her; I told her the agreement was an exchange, and I never thought of paying her any money; she said, she would sue me if I did not pay her; Mr. Allen at last starts up, pray Sir, says he, what have you done with the phaeton; says I, I have done nothing to it; then says he, oh, you have done nothing to it, that is what I want, now I will ruin you; I told Mrs. Breedon, I did not any way stand indebted to her in any money, neither should I pay her any money whatever; Mr. Allen said, he would ruin me, he would arrest me, and if there was a possibility of ruining me, he would; I then left the place, and went to my attorney Mr. Brown, of Rathbone-place, and told him my business; I arrested the lady for thirteen guineas; I went with the officer, and she kept me in the room till Mr. Allen was sent for, then I came away; I was arrested a few days afterwards for thirty pounds; and I was at Mr. Parsons the officer's, from between seven and eight in the morning till twelve.</p>
               <p>Had you at any time agreed for the purchase of this chariot or not? - Never, I never thought of agreeing, as I always thought it to be an exchange; she told me, that seven years ago it was worth thirty pounds; she said it had been built twenty years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have stated all that you know? - All that is material to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>The last thing that you said was, that you never did agree to purchase the chariot, and that you never had such an idea in your life? - I will not say I never had such an idea, I thought of purchasing it when she first mentioned it, but afterwards, no otherwise than by exchange.</p>

               <p>They came to look at the chariot? - Yes, and they denied having the phaeton.</p>

               <p>And you told her if she chose to have that back again, she must pay you twenty or twenty-four pounds for the additions that were made; now, what is become of the chariot? - I sold it to a gentleman in Princes-street; I believe I sold it about two months before.</p>
               <p>Did you sell it before you was arrested? - Yes, about a month before.</p>
               <p>How much might this old wedding chariot fetch you? - I think thirty-six pounds or guineas.</p>
               <p>Did you ever the phaeton? - I sent the phaeton home to the door; they could not take it in, they had no coach house.</p>

               <p>And that you are sure was before you was arrested? - Before she was arrested.</p>
               <p>And before you made your affidavit to hold her to bail perhaps? - Yes, it was; because I was advised by my attorney not to appear against her till I sent the carriage and harness home.</p>
               <p>It was not taken in you know, what did you do with it? - I took it back again.</p>
               <p>How long did you keep it? - Not many days.</p>
               <p>What became of it then? - The lady sent for it in a few days after she was arrested.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not it continue with you till after the trial of the civil action? - No, I do not think it; I am of opinion that she sent for it again in a few days after she was arrested, and then I believe it was not in my possession at the trial of the civil action, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Will you swear it was sent for before the action? - No, I will not.</p>
               <p>How much is this phaeton worth? - About three or four and twenty pounds, harness and all.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that? - I gave fifteen pounds for the phaeton before ever I lined it or painted it, or any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Was it worth fifteen guineas when you sent it home? - Yes, that I swear; and the harness was worth very near half the money.</p>
               <p>You have told us that after the lady had countermanded this phaeton when she came herself with Mr. Martin, she sent for you again, and then she told you in spight of all her friends, she was determined to have it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You told us all that passed between you and the lady in the presence of Mr. Allen? - As near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>And you have told it truly? - To the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that he said that which you have stated him to have said, or any thing like it? - To the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>I will repeat it. (Repeats it.) - It was that, or to that effect; that I am sure of.</p>
               <p>Did you say, in the presence of Allen, that you did not care whether she took the phaeton or not, for you could get more money for it after Christmas? - Upon my oath I never did.</p>
               <p>That you swear positive? - I do positively.</p>
               <p>Nor any thing to that effect? - No, nor any thing to that effect.</p>
               <p>Master Cropper, let us have one word more, now you scratch your ears it is symptomatic of the pillory, it locks like a presentiment; did you, or did you not say to Mrs. Breedon, that you could have more money in the spring for the phaeton? - At that time I did say I could have made more money of it in the spring of the year; says I, I could have sold it to a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250231"/> number of customers; that was in September.</p>
               <p>You know at the time Mr. Martin came, you could not say that, because it was before you had lost any time; upon your oath, when Mr. Allen was present, did not you say it was immaterial to you whether she took it again or not, for that you could get more money for it after Christmas? - Never; that I do swear positively.</p>
               <p>Did you never acknowledge in the presence of Allen that you was to pay or allow her thirty pounds for the chariot? - Never upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Are you the prosecutor of this indictment? - Yes, I should imagine so; I understood myself that I prosecute Mrs. Breedon for perjury.</p>
               <p>You pay the expences of the prosecution? - I have paid too much of it already; I did employ my attorney till I saw such villainous proceedings going on, I was obliged to put it into the hands of another; I pay the expences and nobody pays them else.</p>
               <p>Court. Mind, and attend to my question, and be careful of the answer, what did you do with the chariot after Mrs. Breedon left it with you before you sold it? - I bordered, run braids round the roof and door; the perch was cracked, and the wheels entirely ran down; I took off the moulding round the roof, and down the hind pillar; I put plated bits and gores; and one hundred and forty, or one hundred and fifty foot of plated work round the chariot; I then put plated joints to it, which are about three guineas a pair; I put six head-plates, at twenty-four shillings a-piece, that amounts to the aditional sum that I sold it for afterwards more, than I valued it at, when I took it in exchange; I laid out upon it about three or four and twenty pounds, that I am sure I did not clear myself when I sold it, by allowing ten pounds for the carriage; I sold it for thity-six guineas or pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What time of the day was it when you saw Mr. Allen at Mrs. Breedon's, you said, between five and six? - It was in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Was not it between twelve and one? - I do not think it was; I think it was in the evening between five and six; I will not be too positive.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Garrow. Have you any evidence to the value of the chariot? - No, I have not; it has been so altered.</p>
               <p>Cropper. I would not give more than nine or ten pounds for it, if it was brought to my shop tomorrow; that is the extent of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I have many witnesses on the part of the lady, but I rest it here.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. This is the advertisement that brought us acquainted with your client, Mr. Morgan; you offered a hundred pounds reward? - Yes, on the apprehending and conviction of the man as described, and I conceived the description to answer to the prisoner at the bar.</p>

               <p>I live at the Bell in Friday-street; my husband keeps the house; I know the prisoner; I have seen him at our house in company with Rogers; it was the Monday morning after Rogers left his place; he came dressed in his best clothes; I says, what you have a holiday to day; the prisoner was present; Rogers said, he had a holiday, so he had got crumpets for breakfast; Mrs. Evans breakfasted there; Rogers said to me, it was very odd that he had met Evans that had been servant to his father; that was in Evans's presence; I never saw them together before; I saw him next day, or two or three days after.</p>
               <p>Did you see them frequently afterwards together? - I cannot say how often; it might be half a dozen times; I believe they might spend a couple of evenings together.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the headboroughs of Shoreditch parish; I apprehended the prisoner; I had information on the 27th of February, about four in the afternoon I apprehended him; I stood at the end of Gravel-lane; I asked him what property that was under his arm; and he said, it was nothing to me; I took him to Mr. Wilmott's office; he made some resistance; he told me the property he had from Mrs. Haslam; these are things; then I took him and Mrs. Haslam to the compter; Mrs. Haslam denied knowing any thing of him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The marks are taken off these things, but we were robbed of muslins of the same quality; and I have every reason to believe this to be one of the pieces; we lost six.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. Then that you cannot swear to? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. It is the very same sort of muslin you lost? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Does there appear marks to be taken off? - It does; and ours were marked in the same place; a little of the ink came through.</p>
               <p>Is not that the usual place for marking all muslins? - It is.</p>
               <p>From the view of that muslin, in the state in which you now see it, can you form any belief that it is yours? - We had lost muslins of this quality, and I believe this to be ours.</p>
               <p>From all the circumstances which you have heard when this muslin was found, I have not the least doubt but you believe it to be yours; but suppose you had found a piece of muslin in the state in which you have now seen this, in the shop of any reputable<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250233"/> tradesman, should you have known it to be yours? - It is impossible; there is a hundred pieces in the bale; at the same time I have not the least doubt but it is mine; had it been found without circumstances of suspicion, I should not have thought of such a thing, and I could not have formed such an opinion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. You have given a very fair answer to the last question, which does you honour, therefore it will save me a deal of trouble; I only ask, whether you have not, in the course of a short time last past, disposed of a great many pieces of muslin of the same sort? - Undoubtedly I have. (The muslin shewn to the Court.) This is the place where the mark usually is, and the ink being damp has made a little mark.</p>
               <p>Court. Is it usual to take off the marks of the goods unless they are cut? - Not at all; I dare say there is not a piece of muslin out of that bale that has the mark off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. But there is a possibility that the mark might be rubbed off by carriage? - I dare say it might be rubbed off; you see it has been rubbed off; it is gummed paper; it is not easy to rub off; there is something at the corner which appears to be India characters.</p>

               <p>Can you judge from the appearance of that piece whether any mark has been taken off? - There certainly has.</p>
               <p>If that mark had been on, would it have led you to identify the piece? - It would have told directly.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I lived with the prosecutor nine weeks; I knew the defendant many years ago.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. While you lived with Messrs. Acton and Eyre, did you take any muslin from them? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>What did you do with it? - Haslam had a good deal of it, and different people; on the Monday morning after I came from my master's, I went to Haslam's, and after I had been there a few minutes Evans came up stairs; I asked him if he was not the person who had lived with my father; and he said, he was; I told him to go to the Bell in Noble-street; I would come to him; the Bell was then kept by Mr. Freeman.</p>
               <p>What passed between you? - Talking of one thing or another; he said, he had some goods of Mrs. Haslam, and she had told him they were one Rogers's goods, but that he did not think it was me; he said, he had bought a good many things of her; and most of the things Mrs. Haslam had of me; and he asked me if I had any thing, and he would give me ready money for it; I said, there were some at Mrs. Haslam's, and I would fetch them over directly; I went over and fetched one whole piece of lawn, and another of which about two yards had been cut off.</p>
               <p>Was that part of Mr. Eyre's muslin? - It was; when I brought them to the Bell, Evans and me went into the parlour to look at them; and agreed for them; I think he was to give me two guineas and a half for each of them; I received from him I think, four pounds fifteen shillings in the whole; we stopped there, and a man came in and went out with him; the next day I saw him again at the Bell, and there was a whole piece of plain muslin, and half a piece of striped; he gave me four guineas and a half for the whole piece; but I cannot say what the other was.</p>
               <p>How came you to meet him again that day? - He promised to come that day to have some more; he said, he would come if I had any thing else, and he would give me ready money for them if it was ever so much.</p>
               <p>How often did you meet him afterwards? - I do not know whether it was the next day, or the Thursday, at the Cooper's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250234"/> Arms; we were first at the Bell by appointment, and then we went down to the Cooper's Arms; he had a patch or two of callico then to make a gown.</p>
               <p>These things that you sold to him were all the property of Messrs. Eyre and Acton? - They were.</p>
               <p>Do you know the real value of them, did you sell them at the highest possible price? - I do not know what they were worth.</p>
               <p>Were the marks on when you delivered them? - I am not sure of that; I never took the marks off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. Did you tell him how you came by the goods? - I told him I left my place, and I thought they knew nothing about them.</p>
               <p>What did you tell him? - He mentioned different porters; and said, he had some of them; he said, he could not deal with Kent, he was too dear.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Repeat what you said just now? - I said I left my place, and I thought there was no suspicion of me; then he asked me where I lived; and I told him I had left my place.</p>
               <p>Did he ask you where you got these goods you were selling to him? - I cannot say whether he asked me or not, but he asked whether the marks were in.</p>
               <p>What answer did you make him? - I told him I did know, I thought Mrs. Haslam took them out generally.</p>
               <p>Did he look to see whether the marks were in? - Yes, he did look when he was opening them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. Did not you tell him they were smuggled goods? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>You say that upon your oath, nor even hint it to him? - No, I did not; he knew very well where they came from; I never told the prisoner that Mr. Eyre did deal in smuggled goods.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell him that you had lived at a tavern? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him that you lived at a tavern at that time? - I cannot remember that he asked me any thing about it; I told him what place I lived at in town.</p>
               <p>You have been both in custody togegether? - He was in custody when I was.</p>
               <p>Was not you in the same prison? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you sleep together some nights? - We did one or two nights; I told him nothing any farther, than that I should speak the truth, and that I must speak the truth I never told him that; Mr. Eyre had been several times.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell the prisoner, during the time you slept with him, that Mr. Eyre threatened you, if you did not convict him, he would lock you up? do you remember any particular conversation that you had with Hyam Moses? - I do not know Hyam Moses as I know of.</p>
               <p>Do you remember having any conversation with any one of the prisoners, or any one in the prison respecting this prosecution? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did not you say that another witness was wanting to make your evidence be confirmed? - I never heard any thing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Did you ever tell Moses, or any body so? - No, Sir, nor never heard any thing of it till now.</p>
               <p>When were the last goods you sold this man? - It was on a Thursday, I do not know the day of the month, it was the same week.</p>

               <p>Court. I think you said that before that Monday when you met him at Haslam's, you had not seen him for a dozen years? - I never saw him while I lived with my master, nor at the meeting with the taylor. (The piece shewn to Rogers.) It was one just like that, a heavy piece, I cannot be sure; it was a whole piece.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They all run the same length; this piece is worth three pounds ten shillings, or four pounds.</p>
               <p>Court. Then this man made a very hard bargain if it was worth then four pounds.</p>
               <p>Court to Rogers. What did he give you for the piece of plain muslin? - To the best of my knowledge, four guineas and a half.</p>
