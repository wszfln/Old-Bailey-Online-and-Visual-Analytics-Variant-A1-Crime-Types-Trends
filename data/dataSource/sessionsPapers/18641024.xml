I reside at 23, Nelson-square, Peckham—the deceased, Mr. Briggs, was a relation of my wife's—I believe he was sixty-nine years of age, and about five feet nine or ten inches in height—he came to our house on 9th July, almost exactly at 5 o'clock; he came very punctually—he had a black bag with him, out of which he took something at our house—he dined with us that day, and left about half-past 8—I accompanied him from my house to the Lord Nelson, in the Old Kent-road, and saw him into an omnibus—he would get out at King William-street, for the purpose of going to Fenchurch-street railway-station—when I parted with him he was in his usual health and spirits—I know the general appearance of the watch be used to wear; I could not swear to it—I know he wore a watch and chain; be used to wear it in his waistcoat-pocket, attached to a button-hole, the chain attached to his button-hole at one end and the watch in his pocket—he had a small seal attached to the watch, and two keys—I am sure he had his watch that night, from his referring to it before he left my house to see whether he was in time for the train—in consequence of some informa<lb/>tion that I received I went next morning to the railway, and then to Mr. Briggs's house; it was between 10 and 11 in the forenoon—he was still alive, but quite insensible, and remained so until he died—I left before he died, but I understand he died before midnight—while I was there he did not recover consciousness.</p>

Robarts and Co.—on Saturday, 9th July, I went to the Hackney station of the North London railway, at about 10 o'clock in the evening—I was in company with Mr. Jones, who is a clerk in the same employment as myself—I took a first-class ticket for Highbury—on the arrival of the train from Fenchurch-street I went to a first-class carriage—I opened the door myself; it was empty, and I and Mr. Jones got in—I sat on the right-hand side going in—that would he with my face to the engine; about the centre of the carriage, I think—before the train started Mr. Jones called my attention to some blood on his hand—we immediately called the guard—he brought a light, and we all got out; there were two other people besides Mr. Jones and myself, who got into the carriage—when the guard came with the light, I saw a hat, a stick, and a black bag in the carriage—the guard then locked up the carriage, leaving those articles in it, and we got into another carriage.</p>

I am a guard on the North London railway—I was the guard of the train that left Fenchurch-street at 9.50 on Saturday night, 9th July—it was five minutes after its time—being late in arriving at Fenchurch-street I had no time to see the tickets or shut the doors, because I had to shut the doors on the arrival side—I knew Mr. Briggs just as a passenger—I did not observe him that night—on the train arriving at the Hackney-station my attention was called by Mr. Vernez to the state of a first-class carriage, No. 69; after I got notice from the gentleman that there was something the matter with that compartment of the carriage, I went back to my break<lb/>van and procured my hand-lamp, which we always carry—I then examined the carriage—on the near side cushion there were marks of blood; that is, the cushion nearest the engine—on the quarter-light, on the near side, there was blood trickling down—the quarter-light is a square of glass that shows light into the carriage even with the seat—after examining that part of the carriage I looked underneath and found a hat and stick—the hat was flattened up—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) looks very much like the hat; there were marks of blood upon it—it was flattened up—there was blood also on the stick and on the bag—I pulled the windows up and locked the carriage door—there were no passengers in the carriage when I went to inspect it—I locked up the car<lb/>riage with the hat, and stick, and bag in it, and told them to telegraph on Chalk Farm for my inspector to meet me there—Mr. Greenwood is the superintendent there—when we arrived at Chalk Farm Mr. Greenwood examined the carriage; it was then locked up again and brought to Bew station—it has never been used since; it stands in the shed there now—the blood has not been washed away that I know of—Mr. Greenwood took charge of the hat, stick, and bag, as lost property, at the lost-property office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical practitioner and Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, carrying on my business at Lower Clapton—I was the usual medical attendant of the late Mr. Briggs, and had been so for some years—I believe him to have been in his 70th year—he enjoyed very good health until this spring, when he had an illness, erysipelas, from which he had perfectly recovered, but he was in danger for some time—on the morning of 10th July, between 2 and 3 o'clock, I was sent for—I arrived between 2 and 3—I cannot speak to half an hour—it was before 3—I found Mr. Briggs still living—he was groaning, but perfectly unconscious—I was with him from time to time, until he died at a quarter to 12 on the Sunday night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose it was a hopeless case from the commencement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing whatever could have been done in a surgical point of view—I made a careful post-mortem examination on the Tuesday following, in the presence of Mr. Brereton, Mr. Cooper, and other gentlemen—I made notes of it immediately afterwards, as soon as I returned home.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186410240008"/>
               <p>in this centre, a portion of the outer commencement of the parietal bone was separated entirely, about three-fourths of an inch in length, and half an inch in width—that was perfectly separated, and fell out—it was a triangular portion, quite detached—there was effusion of blood between the scalp and the calvarium, or skull-cap—there was a large quantity between the scalp and the skull, or bones of the skull—there was further blood between the skull-cap and the dura mater, or investing membrane of the brain—I have not described all the wounds, though probably enough—besides these, the temporal bone was driven in upon the brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were the wounds all, or any of them, in your opinion, inflicted by a blunt or a sharp instrument? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The wounds on the top of the head I cannot account for, except upon the presumption that they were inflicted by a blunt instrument, used with considerable force—the wound on the left ear I believe to have been also inflicted by a blunt instrument, but of that I will not speak so certainly; that was my impression.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you able to say whether many blows had been struck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were four or five distinct wounds on the scalp, which would account, I pre<lb/>sume, for so many distinct blows—my observation as to their being made with a blunt instrument applies to all of those, and I am especially guided to that, by what I referred to just now, namely, that the pericranium was not divided, which I assume it would have been if a sharp instrument had been used—there was no wound about the head that could be attributed to a sharp instrument.</p>

I am professor of chemistry at the London Hospital—I made a particular inspection of this railway carriage, with a view to ascertain whether there was blood, the nature of the blood, and so on—I examined the carriage on Tuesday, 26th of July last—the carriage was at Bow—it was No. 69 carriage—I examined the first compartment of the carriage, next to the buffers—there were three compartments, I think—three</p>

               <p>or four, I am not sure which, but it was the first of the three, the end compartment—I observed blood on two of the cushions—I have ascertained that it was blood—it had all the characteristics of human blood—I have measured the globules of the blood, and believe it to be human blood—it was on the first cushion on the left hand side of the carriage, as we were facing the front of the carriage; I mean, the cushion nearest the engine—it was very nearly in the centre of the cushion—the cushion had been turned—the proper side was covered with cloth, but it had been turned, so that the leather or under part had been turned uppermost, and therefore the blood had been retained in the cushion, and it was in a large quantity—I found the most blood about the middle of the cushion.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I will draw your attention to what I may call the left hand corner, next the window; was there any blood in that corner, or near to it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was blood on the glass immediately over the cushion—it was blood having all the characteristics of human blood—it was blood that had been living when it came on the glass, from the coagulum in it, and it contained also particles of brain matter—it was in the shape of two large spots—they ap<lb/>peared to be splashes of blood, not at all having the character of blood ejected from a vessel, but rather blood that had been splashed from a blow on the surface—each spot was very nearly about the size of a sixpence—if a person had been sitting on that part of the carriage, and had been struck on the left side of his head as he was leaning his head against the glass, that effect might have been produced—on the opposite cushion, the one farthest from the engine, there were about thirty spots of blood—they were small spots—there were two spots on the cushion next the principal cushion on the same side, and there was a spot likewise, I think, on the other side, in fact, there was blood on all four of the cushions—I examined the door, and the handle—there were spots of blood outside the door, but I did not observe any spots of blood on the door itself—there were spots of blood on the carriage, and the spots trailed in the direction of the hinder part of the carriage—I looked at the stick; there was blood upon that; I see it there now—there is very little, but it is there, in very thin layers on the surface of the stick—it covers a large surface, but in quantity it is not much; it extends from the lower part to where my finger is—there was no appearance of blood on the top part—I examined it very carefully, and could not find any blood on the top of the stick—I discovered marks of blood about six or seven inches from the top of the stick—the top is a good deal smoother than the rest.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186410240012"/>
               <p>a chain, saying that the customer wished to part with it in exchange, asking me to value it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the chain and appendages—(<hi rend="italic">This was numbered</hi> 1, <hi rend="italic">produced by Kerressey</hi>)—I examined the chain closely with a magnifying glass in the presence of the prisoner—I then went behind him to weigh it in some scales that were fixed there—as I did so, he turned round to see me do it—I weighed the chain, and then told him that I would give him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—he silently accepted that; tacitly accepted it—I understood him to accept that price—he was to take a chain in exchange—there were chains before him at the time—he then said, "I want one of the same cost"—I under<lb/>stood of the same value; but that was the term he used—I then selected a chain at 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was the nearest in price there—he made some objection to that—he said he objected to it on account of its having the drop appendages like this—it was a chain that hung in this form—it was objected to, but I persevered to sell that chain, and he then said he would take it if I would give it to him for the same sum, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—that I said I would not do—I then looked in my stock, and found a chain at 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I showed him that, and he very shortly accepted that chain—I then asked my brother for a box, which he handed to me—I put the chain that he had bought into the box, and made a parcel of it, and gave it to him—after a moment's pause, I said, "What will you take for the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.?"—he immediately answered, "A finger; ring"—I showed him about half a dozen on a card, one of which was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I took that from the card, and gave it to him to try—he put it on his finger; it fitted him, and after some little observation of it, he accepted it for the balance—this (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) is the box; the same shape, size, and colour as the one in which I packed the chain—I believe it to be the same box.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Repsch, a tailor, carrying on business in Jewry-street, Aldgate—I am an Englishwoman, born of German parents—my husband is a German—I have known Muller for some time—I first saw him nearly two years ago—he worked as a tailor—he worked with a person of the name of Hodgkinson for some time, I believe until 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> July—after 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> July he was not in any employment—he came to our house from time to time after 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> July—we were on friendly terms—he had a watch and chain of his own—I have seen it—he has worn it—I connot say for certainty when I last saw that watch and chain on him—I believe he had it while he was working for Mr. Hodgkinson—he told me that he had pledged it—I don't remember whether he told me what he had pledged it for—I believe the watch and chain were pledged separately—on the Saturday, 9th July, he had not got that watch and chain out of pledge—he was at our house on that Saturday—he came, I should think, between 12 and 1 o'clock, or from 11 to 1; I cannot say exactly—he stayed till about half-past 7 in the evening—he was at work there—I don't know whether he was working for himself or for a friend—I know he was not working for my husband—he had met with an accident on the Thursday previous, and he wore a slipper on that day—I can't recollect whether or</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186410240016"/>
               <p>not he came in the slipper on the Saturday—he wore a slipper during the day, on the right foot, in fact, he wore two slippers, because he was in the habit of taking off his boots when he came to my house, and putting on his slippers—I remember seeing him with slippers on during the day—I did not see him leave that night—I was out when he left—I have here the slipper of the left foot, which I found after he was gone—the right slipper was gone—he had his boots with him during the day, two boots—whether he came in them or not on the Saturday morning I can't say—he might have had one in his pocket—the two boots were by the side when he changed them, to put on his slippers—when he left neither of those boots remained, they were both gone—he took away both boots, and one slipper—I recollect his changing his clothes that day; he had on a pair of green and black trousers when he came to my house in the morning, and he changed them for a pair of striped ones, an older pair, to sit at work in—when he went away he put on the newer pair, for the working pair was left—I saw him on the Monday morning between 10 and 11 o'clock—he then had on a pair of light trousers—he came in both boots on the Monday morning—he showed me a chain on that Monday morning—I believe this chain (No. 2) to be the same that he showed me—he said he had paid 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it in the Docks that morning—he had a ring on his finger—it was a plain gold ring with a white stone—he said he had paid 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for that—he said he had got it at the same place that he bought the chain—my husband saw him on the Monday morning as well as myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you on that Monday morning observe anything with respect to his hat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I observed that he had a new hat on, one that I had never seen him in before—I told him he was very extravagant in having another new hat, and he said his old one was smashed, and he had thrown it in the dust-hole—my husband asked him what he gave for it, and his reply was that he had paid 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—my husband said it looked more like a guinea hat—nothing more passed about it that I am aware of—I had not seen that hat before—I had observed before that what hat Muller wore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before I show it you, just describe to me what kind of hat it was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was a plain black beaver hat with a merino rim inside, and the lining was a striped lining, a broad brown stripe, and a broad blue stripe edged with black and white—my attention was drawn to the lining from its being a peculiar lining—I never saw a hat lined with such a lining before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to notice the lining? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As I said before, from its being a pecnliar lining—I have frequently seen him take off his hat, and I have frequently had it in my hands—he was in the habit of putting letters behind the lining—I have seen him do so—before I saw the hat in question I gave a description of it to the police—to the best of my belief this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the hat—the lining is the same, and the merino also—as far as I can judge it corresponds—I heard the prisoner say that Mr. Matthews made him a present of that hat—Matthews is a cabman—I think it must have been either in November or December of last year that the prisoner told me that—I had not noticed Muller wear any other hat except that—I saw it in the hat-box—he brought it to my house in the hat box when I first saw it—that was either in November or December; Í can't say—it was the same description of hat box as this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the hat and the hat-box were in my house at one time—he took them away with him again—he brought them to show us, and then took them away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On Saturday, 9th July, according to your recollection, what hat had Muller on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of my belief that is the one, the old one, the</p>

               <p>one that I have spoken to—he had a single breasted overcoat—I don't think he had that coat on on Saturday, 9th July, he had a morning-coat on—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the light pair of trousers, and this is the old pair I spoke of that he wore on the Saturday at work—the light pair is the pair he came in on the Monday-morning—neither of these is the pair he left my house in on the Saturday-night—I have never seen that pair since.</p>

SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do I understand you to say that you actually saw him leave your house that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not see him leave—the last time I saw him on the Saturday was half-past 7—a person named Haifa was with him—I left him there with him—he had a slipper on the whole of the day on Saturday when I was there—I am not able to say whether he left in the slipper or not—the slipper I have produced is the one that was left at my house on the Saturday—he must have taken the right slipper with him—whether he had it on or not I cannot say for certain, only by what I heard Haifa say—I understood he had been lame of the right foot.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was Muller rather a vain and boastful man, do you think? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was rather fond of finery, and fond of showing the things that he had—I cannot say whether he used to what is called <hi rend="italic">romance</hi> a little—he told me that he had told Mrs. Blyth that Messrs. Hodgkinson were sending him out to New York—we of course knew different—he said that he had told Mrs. Blyth that Mr. Hodgkinson was sending him over to America—he did not tell me that he had said he was to have 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—my husband wears a hat—I could not tell you what was the lining of it—I have constantly had Muller's hat in my hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What business had you with the hat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He might have put it in my way, and I might have moved it—if it was in my way I had a right in my own place to move it—I was asked just now to describe the hat before it was produced—I saw it at the police-court and before the Coroner—I had it in my hand there—I know Haffa—I have known him about twelve months or more—he has been in the habit of coming to my house, but not of working for me—he works for Mr. Hodgkinson—he does so at the present time—I have known Muller nearly two years—Huffa was constantly in the habit of coming to my place—he wore a hat—I can't tell you the lining of it—I have several male friends who come to my house—I cannot tell the lining of any of their hats.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then this is the only hat that you looked into so often? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was the lining that took my attention—I cannot say how many times I looked into the hat—I cannot undertake to say whether I looked into it thirty, forty, or fifty times—I cannot say whether I looked inside it each time I had it iu my hands—I will not say that I have looked into it thirty or forty times—I may have done so—I know a person named Jonathan Matthews, a cabman—my husband knows him—I have not known him so long as eight years—I should think about six—it was six years ago when I first met him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How soon after you heard of this murder did you see Matthews? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not until after he came from New York—I had not seen him for years, not for all three years—I did not see him before he went to New York.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you in the habit of visiting Matthews at all, or he you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think I went there about twice, not more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner, about a month or two months before the 9th of July, buy some new clothes, to your knowledge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Merely a pair of trowsers—I did not ask him about a month or two months before to lend me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186410240018"/>
               <p>oh! yes, I did—I cannot remember his saying that he could not do it because he was going to buy a new hat—I do not swear it—I don't believe I said, "Oh! pooh, pooh, you may as well lend me the money"—I don't think I did—I cannot swear it, because I do not remember it—I cannot swear it did not pass—I don't remember his saying it—I remember asking for 5 <hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and he lent it to me—I did not say that just now, because I was not asked—he did not say he could not lend it me, he gave it to me—I did not say that just now in answer to your question, because you put another question to me and I had not time; that was my reason, and no other—I don't remember his making any excuse about his going to buy a new hat, because he gave me the money—I have repaid him that;—we settled it—I believe that was the only time I borrowed money from him—I cannot swear it—I cannot swear whether I have borrowed money of him before—my husband was not by when he gave me the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he knew nothing at all about it—I do not remember Muller saying anything to me about anew hat, nor do I remember saying to him, "You can buy a new hat next week," or anything to that effect.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You told me that you had not seen Mr. Matthews at all until he returned from New York; had you seen Mrs. Matthews? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only at the Court—she had not called on me—I saw her at the Court, and only at the Court—I am quite sure of that—I do not expect any of this reward—I cannot say whether the prisoner had the same dress on, except the trousers, on the Monday that he had on the Saturday—I could not say whether he had the velvet-collared coat or the morning coat on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a journeyman tailor, and work at Messrs. Hodgkinson's—I have known the prisoner about six months—on 9th July, I was at Mr. Repsch's—I saw the prisoner there that day, between 6 and 7 in the evening—I went there and found him there—I don't remember if he was at work or not—I don't think he was at that time—he left before me, between 7 and 8; nearly 8, I may say—he said he was going to see his sweetheart—I had seen him working there before—I did not notice what clothes he had on when he left; it was rather dark when he went away—I saw him again on the Monday following, at Mr. Repsch's, my own lodging, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon—I observed a chain about him on Monday—I had not seen that chain on him before—he said he had bought it—I don't know if he said where—he said he had given 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I left him at Mr. Repsch's, and went to my work—when I came back in the evening, the prisoner was still there—we left Repsch's together—we went together to his lodging and I remained there that night—I took his lodging—I afterwards lent him 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to do that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Repsch came to the place when I work, and told me Mr. Franz Muller had not sufficient money for his passage ticket, he wanted 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had not the money, and I gave Mr. Repsch a suit of my clothes to pawn to raise the money—that was on Wednesday the prisoner gave me a duplicate of a gold chain as security for my money—I have got the duplicate—it is for a chain pledged at a pawnbroker's of the name of Annis—he did not give me the ticket of a coat—he told me the last evening; as I had the lodging to pay, Mr. Repsch had a ticket for a coat, which I could have for the money that I had to pay for the rent—I afterwards got that ticket for the coat from Mr. Repsch—it is the coat that has been produced to-day—I got it out of pawn the day before Muller came back to London from America—I don't remember the day of the month—I sent it to Scotland-yard the same day I took it out, for him to put on when he came to London.</p>

Hodgkinson's, and he made up his mind a fortnight before he left—I knew that he was lame—I have seen him in possession of money before 9th July; gold and silver—I can't say how much, but I believe it was sufficient for the passage—I had known him for six months—he bore the character and disposition of a humane and kind</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you give him a chain of yours in June to have it exchanged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know if it was in June, but he was to exchange or sell a chain for me—I gave him a chain to exchange for another chain, or to sell—he could not do it, and he returned it to me—he did not tell me whether he had been anywhere to change it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember at all the dress of the prisoner on the Monday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The coat was dark—I cannot remember the particular dress—my first im<lb/>pression was that his trousers were light, but I was not positive about it; it was a mere impression—we employ several jewellers; we employ one jobbing jeweller, his name is Evans, of Bartholomew-square; I think No. 14, but we often send chains, if they are repaired, to the chain-maker's.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As I understand, be par<lb/>ticular in answering me, you identify this hat by the side portion of the rim being turned up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not only by that; that is one thing—I am quite sure of that—I had that done in the shop; I had the rim so turned—my hat was exactly like this, as near as they could possibly get it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you say before the Magistrate that one of your means of iden<lb/>tifying that hat was this: that three weeks prior to 9<hi rend="italic">th</hi> July you saw the prisoner, and that the brim of his hat was turned up in one part of it more than another, and you told him so? <hi rend="italic">A. I</hi> did so—I never mentioned before to-day that I had the two edges turned round myself, at my own request, at the shop where the hat was bought—I said, before the Coroner, "I saw him frequently wearing that hat, and I had noticed and remarked upon its wear<lb/>ing so well; I fancied one side was turned up more than usual, and pointed it out to him; I said it was not altered in shape, and I suggested that it might have been done from his lifting it from his head on that side"—I cannot tell you how many hats I have bought—I could not tell you the number that I bought within six or twelvemonths of 9<hi rend="italic">th</hi> July—I could not say what has become of the hat that I bought, which was just like this, but I think I left it at one of the hatter's shops that I have bought hats at since the one I bought at Mr. Walker's—the hat I now wear I bought in Oxford-street, at Mr. Mummery's—I did not leave my other hat there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not stated that you left it at Mr. Down's the hatters in Long<lb/>acre, three weeks before 9<hi rend="italic">th</hi> July? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I stated that I left one there, but I could not say to the time—I did not say so—I believe it was some time, bat I could not state the time positively—I said, "I purchased a hat also at Mr. Down's in Long-acre, and left my old one there; that was about three weeks before I bought the one in Oxford-street; I wore my old hat home when I purchased the new one in Oxford-street"—I bought the one in Oxford-street, I should think it was, I could not say for a few days, before I went to America.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you buy the one at Down's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I have had two hats; when I came to look at home, and I could not say which of the Down's I bought it at, whether it was the one in the Strand, who used to make for me, or the one in Long-acre, but I find I am in error about my hats altogether; I have had so many that I could not say how many.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not say this, "The next hat I purchased was about June, of Down's in Long-acre; it was a cheap one, I gave 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it I left the other one at Down's?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did say so; that was not true, because it was longer ago—I could not say the time exactly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you bought a hat a few days before you went to America; when did you go to America? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot tell at this moment—I left home on 19<hi rend="italic">th</hi> July, and sailed on 20<hi rend="italic">th</hi> from Liverpool—I went with Mr. Tanner—I mean when I went to America on this matter.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I want particularly to call your attention to what you said before the Coroner, "The next hat I purchased was about June, of Down in Long-acre; it was a cheap one, I gave 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi> for it. I left the other one at Down's;" did you say that before the Coroner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said so, but it was a mistake of mine; I did not know bow many hats I had had till I got home—I found I had several there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you since found out that three weeks before you were examined before the Coroner there was no such shop as Down's a hatter in Long-acre? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did make that inquiry, and then I looked at home to see what number of hats I had had—I found that Down's shop in Long-acre had been shut up for some time—when I came to look at my hats I was surprised to see that I had so many at home as I had; that made me make inquiry—I had two of Down's hats before—I said before the Magistrate, that I had bought that at Down's a fortnight or three weeks before this job—I found out that was a mistake of mine—Mr. Clark went with me to Long-acre—he is one of the detectives; the sergeant who went to America with me—I told him at the time that I was under a mistake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where do you believe the hat is now that was just like this; have you any idea whatever? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I have not—I occasionally throw my hats into the dusthole or some place—I said that before the Coroner—I could not swear to the lining of any of my hats—I could not swear to some of my own hate—I first heard of the murder about the Thursday or Friday of the week following—I think it was the Thursday; that would be about six or seven days after—I mean to say that I had not heard of it before—I had been out with my cab—I have occasionally put on the rank when I wanted something to eat, but I never heard of it—I am not a public-house visitor—I may have been to a public-house perhaps once a. day, to have a glass of ale, not more—I do go into public-houses for refreshment every day—I sometimes take in a newspaper, not regularly—I don't take in any particular paper; occasionally I take Lloyd's—I take a Sunday paper; sometimes I buy a daily paper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear that you saw no paper from 9<hi rend="italic">th</hi> to 14<hi rend="italic">th</hi> July? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not bringing the murder to my mind—I never looked at the paper—I did not see it in the paper at all—I did not see it in large conspicuous letters, over and over again, before the Thursday—I live at 68, Earl-street East, Paddington—I know the police-station—I pass it—I could not swear whether I passed it every day from 10<hi rend="italic">th</hi> to 14<hi rend="italic">th</hi>—I never saw the placard or noticed it—I did see a placard at the latter end of the week, but not to read it—I knew that Muller was going to America—I gave information to the police on Monday, 18<hi rend="italic">th</hi>—at that time I knew that Muller had gone by the <hi rend="italic">Victoria</hi> sailing ship to New York—I knew that he was going to sail, according to what he had left word at my house—he called to wish me and my family good-bye. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you tell me what you were doing on Saturday, 9<hi rend="italic">th</hi> July? <hi rend="italic">A. I</hi> was out with my cab, I find—I did not know at the time I was called upon to answer before—I said before the Coroner, "It is impossible for me to say where I was on the night of 9<hi rend="italic">th</hi> July, I was about with my cab, but I could not say where"—I have since made inquiries to find out where I was—I made inquiries to know whether I was out with my cab or not, on account of losing a pocket-book which I carried, which I have found since, and it is here—I took a piece of paper out of my pocket just now—here it is; you are at liberty to look at it—it is to prove that I was out—Mr. Beard wrote down after my character—this piece of paper is dated September 29<hi rend="italic">th</hi>—that is the date I wrote to know what day I was out, and that is the return</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186410240026"/>
               <p>letter from my employer, Mr. Perfitt, that I was at work for on the 9th—that inquiry has been made by me since I was examined before the Coroner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe that your master, Mr. Perfitt, failed, or was "sold up," to use your own expression? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was sold off; that is a mistake, "sold up"—it was a mistake in print—I never said, "sold up," I said, "sold off."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Here it is, "Mr. Perfitt lived in Lisson-grove, and was sold up the week after 9th July," you say you said "sold off?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I did—the deposition was read over to me—I could not tell what day it was that Mr. Perfitt was sold off—I first saw Repsch after I had given information, at Bow-street, when I returned from America—I did not see him before I gave information to the police—I am quite sure of that; not for years previous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been a cabman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have been licensed be<lb/>tween times I suppose about seven or eight years, or eight or nine years; I could not say to a year or two—sometimes I do not hold a license for three or four years between—I have been something else besides a cabman; I have been a coachman, and I have been in training stables—that was, I suppose, twenty-two or twenty-three years ago—since then I have been a cabman—not ever since—sometimes I have been in business—I was in a small fly business, and I was foreman to Mr. Hubble of Camberwell, and to Mr. Langley of Westminster—I have driven for the London General Omnibus Company—I have always been a driver during those twenty-two or twenty-three years—I have never followed any other occupation—I have been an ostler—I have never been coachman to a private gentleman—I know a gen<lb/>tleman named Linklater—I was not his coachman or anything—I never lived with him—I never drove for him—I was not in his service—I knew him by living in the neighbourhood—I have never been insolvent or a bank<lb/>rupt—I am sure of that; there is no mistake—I was in business at Brixton—I did not fail there; that I swear—I was in business at the Prince of Wales-yard, and at the White Horse-yard, Brixton-hill—that was two years ago last January—I did not fail, or compound with my creditors, nothing of the kind—I gave up the business because I was not getting a living—I owed some money, and I was not able to pay it—I am still in that position.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you been to some of your creditors, and stated that as soon as you got your portion of the reward you would be able to settle with them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I have not been to one of them—I will swear that—I will swear that I have never said that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Of course you expect a portion of the reward? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't understand you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you are the only person in Court who does not. Do you or do you not expect a portion of this reward of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I leave that entirely if I have done my duty to the country.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you do expect a portion of it, do you not, after you have done your duty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If they are only satisfied that I have done my duty; if they think proper to reward me, very well—I have no expectation of any<lb/>thing—if it had been a plain bill without any reward, I should have done my duty—I did see the reward, but if it had been a plain bill I should have done the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I will have an answer; do you expect a portion of the reward? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If I am entitled to it, I shall expect it—I have never made use of the words that if I had kept my mouth closed a little longer, they would have made the reward 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. instead of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nor anything like it—I said I was given to</p>

               <p>understand on that morning that they were printing bills for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, but had it been a shilling I should have done the same if I had thought of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were once convicted, I think, of a little petty theft, were you not? No theft; it was for absconding, leaving a situation without giving due notice; I swear that—I was conductor of a coach, like most young men at that time, I made a little free, and got out on what we term a <hi rend="italic">spree</hi>—I merely went away and left the coach without any one to start it—I was convicted of that; the result was that I had twenty-one days, because I could not pay anything—I have been at Norwich—I was not at Norwich in the year 1851—I was there in 1850, not in 1851—I was in prison there for the twenty-one days; nothing else—I cannot tell you the gentleman's name that convicted me for the twenty-one days—I was tried before a jury—it was for a spree—my box was sent home, and they wanted to make a theft of it because I had got a book and a pair of spurs—they did not actually make a theft of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you not convicted of having feloniously stolen, taken, and carried away one posting book, of the value of 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., one pair of spurs, of the value of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and one padlock, of the value of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was not that the matter you were convicted of? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was the matter they brought in, because it was in a box, <hi rend="italic">unbeknown</hi> to me—it was found on me after the box was taken away—I did not know they were there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The lining of your hat, you say, was the same as the lining of this hat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Similar; I could not say exactly; the same, or similar; I could not say—I said that the lining of both hats was alike as near as possible—I could not say to a stroke or so in the colour of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SOLICITOR-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you were sentenced to be impri<lb/>soned for twenty-one days? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that was in 1850, fourteen years ago—I suppose I was then about nineteen or twenty years of age, I am now thirty-seven, or between thirty-seven and thirty-eight—I was horn in 1829—I have never been in any trouble of the kind since—I gave information to the police on Monday, the 18th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just explain how you came to give that information. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As I was coming by the Great Western Hotel, I called to give my horse some water—while my horse was drinking, I ran the bill over, and I spoke to the water<lb/>man, and made some inquiries as to the height I was myself—from the de<lb/>scription on the bills, I asked the waterman what height he thought I was—the hand-bill was on the wall, and I then read it—on reading the hand-bill, I spoke to the waterman, and directly went home and fetched a small box—this is the box (<hi rend="italic">the one produced</hi>)—I remembered my wife telling me that Muller came to my house and gave the girl a little box—I did not know that Death was the name of the jeweller until I asked the waterman—it was in consequence of some conversation with the waterman that I found out that Death was the name of the jeweller—I took the box to the water<lb/>man and showed it to him, and he got in the cab, and I drove him to Her<lb/>mitage police-station, Paddington—we both went to the station together—we there saw Sergeant Steers—I gave the box to him, and took him to get a small strip of paper that was left at my house by Miller, with an address on it, written by Miller—I also gave a description of the hat on that occa<lb/>sion—this is the piece of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is Muller's address at Mrs. Blythe's—I subsequently went with the police to America, on the subject of Muller's extradition—I was examined before the Coroner when I came back—I arrived on the Saturday, and I think I was examined before the Coroner on the Tuesday following—I was examined before the Magistrate on the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186410240028"/>
               <p>Monday, and on Tuesday before the Coroner—I was cross-examined at that time as to where I had been on the Saturday of the murder—I had not at that time prepared myself at all to answer those questions—on being asked before the Coroner, I did not recollect precisely where I was that night, not until I got home and I made inquiries of the waterman—I had some little idea of it, but not until I got home—I then wrote a letter to my employer, the answer to which I have produced here to-day—from the subsequent in. quires I made, and the communications I have received from my employer and others, I am enabled to state where I was that night; I was on the rank at the Great Western station from 7 to about 11, and, not having a fare for that time, I went away home, and bought a joint of meat, and took it home, as I usually did—I went to the stable-yard in Lisson-grove and left the cab, and then went direct home with my joint of meat—it was not a leg of mutton, it was an aitch-bone of beef, if you wish to know—I took it home with me for my Sunday dinner—I was cross-examined a good deal about my hats—I had not at all prepared myself to answer questions about my hats, I never gave it a thought—I should think I have upwards of nine or ten hats during the year—I am exposed to a great deal of rough weather—I never wear a weather hat—I was asked questions about my hat which was not prepared to answer—I subsequently made inquiries on the subject, and what I have stated to-day is correct, as near as I can possibly give it—I stated before the Coroner that one brim of Muller's hat was more turned up than the other—that was the fact, there was a slight curl more than usual—both brims were turned up by the hatter—in addition to that, one brim was more turned up than the other—it was the right hand brim as he stood from me that was a trifle more turned up than the other—that brim was stiffish, but rather limper than the other—I called Muller's attention to it and said I thought he had had it done up by its looking so well, I thought he had had it turned a little more. (<hi rend="italic">The witness depositions before the Magistrate and the Coroner were put in and read</hi>) <hi rend="smallCaps">ELIZA MATTHEWS</hi>. I am the wife of Jonathan Matthews—I was ac<lb/>quainted with the prisoner rather better than two years—he has been in the habit of occasionally coming to our house—I was present when my husband bought a hat—that might be in November or December last year, I can't recollect exactly which month—my husband bought it at Walker's, in Cray<lb/>ford-street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you any recollection of the description of hat it was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not particularly; only it was turned up rather more at the side than my husband's was—I have seen the bat—this (<hi rend="italic">looking a it</hi>) looks the very same hat—I had not noticed any part of the hat except the brim—my husband gave that hat to Muller about a fortnight after—on Monday, the 11th July, the prisoner called to see me in the afternoon—I have four children—he came between 2 and 3 o'clock—he said he had come to wish us good-bye, previous to his going to New York—he remained with me about three or four hours—he told me he was going out for Messrs. Hodgkinson's firm, and he was to get 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he said that he had met with an accident on the Thursday, I think a letter cart or a mail cart had run over his foot on London-bridge—during the time he was there, he shewed me a chain—he took it off the button-hole of his waistcoat and put it into my hand—told him I thought it was not a very good one—it looked so pale, much lighter gold than his own watch and chain—I did not make that observation to him, I thought so myself—this (<hi rend="italic">looking at chain No.</hi> 2) is the character of chain—I believe that to be the chain—I saw a box on that occasion—this is it</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he took that out of his pocket, and presented it to my little girl—she is ten years old, she will be eleven in December—I remember my husband afterwards coming home and getting that box—it was that day week after—the child had been playing with it that same evening, it was then put away in a drawer from the Tuesday evening—it was taken out of the drawer a week afterwards—I also noticed a ring that Muller had on—I looked at it, and he told me his father had sent it from Germany—it was a plain gold ring, with a cornelian head and a white face—when he left be wished me good-bye—he said he should call on Tuesday or Wednesday morning to see my husband, to wish him good-bye.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, Bridge-road, Ebury-bridge, Pimlico, and am a hatter—I was brought up to it from a boy—I am acquainted with all the branches of the hat trade, and the second-hand hat trade most particularly—cutting down hats and sewing them is usual in the second-hand hat trade with me and others—it is usual to stitch them when they have been cot down—this hat is not as I should do it, because it is not stuck—I should stick it with dissolved shell-lac, as well as stitch it—that would involve more time and trouble in the work.</p>

I am a hatter, and live in Queen's-road, Chelsea—I have been six or seven years in the trade—after cutting second-hand hats down, I always stitch them—the object in cutting hats down is because they are worn lower now—besides stitching them, hatters use varnish—I have done a great many hats in the same way as this—if any one asked me to cut this hat down, who did not require a new lining, I could put the old lining in—it is cheaper to stitch them in the second-hand trade, because we save the expense of buying shell-lac—I know nothing of the prisoner, and have never seen the hat before—I did not volunteer to come, I was subpaenaed.</p>

In July last I lived at Lant-street, in the Borough; I now live at Peckham—before I went to Lant-street I lived in Islington; I once lived at Camberwell, with the same landlady I am with now—it was at Stanley-cottage, James street, Vassall-road—I was living there in July last—I know Müller; I have known him twelve months—I was often in the habit of seeing him—I remember receiving this telegram—I had met Müller on the Saturday previous to receiving that telegram in the Old Jewry, Cheapside; that was the Saturday before 9th July—on the day I received the telegram I went out at 9 in the evening—I remained out till after 12—I came home that night—I did not see my landlady till the morning—she then told me that a friend of mine had called—I cannot recollect how long it was after she told me that, before I heard of the murder; I can't tell at all—I am quite sure I went out at 9 o'clock—I generally went out at 9, and the prisoner called at half-past 9—he did not call before I went out—I knew that he was going abroad, several weeks before he went; he told me, and asked me to go with him; he said he was going to America to see his sister, and if I did not go with him he should remain there only six months.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you first make any communication to anybody about his having been there that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't remember telling any one—I remember a German gentleman calling; I did not see them the first day</p>

               <p>they came—I can't remember a gentleman afterwards calling and speaking to me about it—I did not make any statement, or say anything that was taken down in writing by a gentleman—I have seen Mr. Beard—I have had the telegram a long time—I gave it up to Mr. Beard or some one sent by him two or three days ago, I think.</p>

SOLICITOR-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you see Mr. Beard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A few days ago; it was not so long as a month ago—I can't remember how long it was after I last saw Müller that I spoke to anybody about this; I don't remember that I ever did—I did not see a German gen<lb/>tleman; I saw two gentlemen together at Mrs. Jones's, some weeks ago; three or four weeks ago—I did not say anything about the telegram then; I did not know I had got it till I was looking over my letters—I first said anything about the telegram a few days ago—until the two gentlemen called about a month ago my attention had not been called to the date or time of Müller coming to see me—when the gentlemen called I remembered at once the exact time that I went out that night; I remembered going out at 9—having the telegram from this gentleman made me recollect going out at 9 that night—I cannot say the time I received the telegram, but it was toward? the afternoon; I cannot tell within an hour when I received it, it might have been 1 o'clock, or it might have been 2—I dined that day after 4—I can't exactly tell the time; I should say it was about that time; I can't tell within half an-hour—I can't remember what time I breakfasted that day; it might have been 10, or it might have been 11—it was after 11 when I got up—it was much after 12 when I went to bed; it was past 12, I dare say half-past; I only guess—I am positive I went out exactly at 9; that was about the time I generally used to go out—I went out every night at that time—I can remember it so well, and the telegram—I don't know that the telegram had anything to do with the time I went, out that night—I recollect the time because I can remember so well my landlady telling me that Müller had called in the evening; it was the next morning she told me that—the receiving the telegram had nothing to do with the time of my going out—I don't know why that should assist me in recollecting the time I went out.</p>

                  </hi>. I have conducted the prisoner's defence, instructed by the German Legal Protection Society—I have heard Haffa examined here in the course of this trial—I heard him say that Müller told him when he left the Old Jewry, Aldgate, at a quarter to 8, that he was going to Camberwell to see his sweetheart—Haffa had communicated that fact to me before the arrival of Müller in this country—I am not quite sure whether he had said it at the police-court, but he had communicated it to me out of court—I received that communication somewhere about four or five days before Müller's arrival from America—he arrived on 17th Sept—in consequence of that I instructed my clerk to accompany one of the gentlemen of the Pro<lb/>tection Society to make inquiries about this matter, and he did so—he brought the result back to me—this telegram must have been first handed to me about twelve or fourteen days ago; I am not quite sure as to the day, but about that time—I had proofs produced to me by my clerk and a Ger<lb/>man gentleman before Müller's arrival, and also the proofs of Eldred and Jones—the telegram was shown to you on consulation—I don't know the day exactly—I dare say it was Thursday week—I had not then had it in my possession above a couple of days.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an omnibus-conductor, living at 7, Norfolk-street, Montpelier-street, Peckham—I conduct an omnibus of Mr. Barwick's, a fly-master, of Camber well-gate, running from Peckham-rye to Gracechurch-street—we go from Peckham right through Camberwell, and Walworth, and Newington, to the Borough—the Peckham-rye omnibuses run through Camberwell-gate, up the Walworth-road, Newington-causeway, and so into the City—mine is a Peckham omnibus; we go to Peckham and then to Peckham-rye—there are other Peckham omnibuses that go up the Old Kent-road—they start from New Peckham; that is quite a different route from ours—they go to the Elephant and Castle, and branch off by St. George's church—leave Camberwell just about five minutes to 10—I gene<lb/>rally arrive in King William-street about twenty minutes past 10, and leave again at the half hour, or a minute or two over the half-hour—the journey before that I leave Camberwell-gate about 7 o'clock—it is a little more than a quarter of a mile from Camberwell-gate to Camberwell-green—it may be about a quarter of a mile from Camber well-green to Vassall-road; I cannot say exactly—one end of it comes into the Camberwell New-road and one end into the Brixton-road.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you notice at all the colour of the man's hair? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of my belief he seemed rather fair, and to the best of my belief rather stout—to the best of my belief the slipper looked like a Brussels carpet slipper—I could not swear that this was the slipper (<hi rend="italic">looking at the one produced</hi>)—I cannot say whether it resembles it; it was a carpet slipper, to the best of my belief.</p>

Herzoff and Herman; that was in June last—he asked me to take a cheque from my master—he said if I took a cheque from my master and learnt to copy his handwriting, and wrote it out for a sum of money; if I gave it to a commissionaire to take to the bank, he would wait outside till the commis<lb/>sionaire went for the money; and if anybody came out with him he would come and tell me at once, and I could leave the office and get away, so that they could not take me in charge—it was about 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> June, I think, that he first spoke to me about doing that—I took one of my master's cheques—it was one, I think—we used to frequent an ice-shop, and we used to try and copy Mr. Alexander Watt's writing—we did that a good many times, every evening after we left our office, for about a fortnight before the cheque was sent to the bank—we used to lay the. name of Mr. Watt underneath the piece of paper—we got Mr. Watt's name from a circular of Mr. Watt's—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the circular—at last be took the paper from me, and said I could not copy it well enough; he would take the paper and keep it, and give it to me the next morning—I gave him the cheque, and he went home; and, I believe, copied it at home, and he brought it to me next morning written out—it was "Pay to order," I believe, 417<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was not this cheque—he gave me that cheque and told me to give it to a commissionaire, and he would wait outside, and if anybody came out with the commissionaire he would come and tell me, so that I could go away—I don't know what has become of that cheque—I beg your pardon, I gave it him that evening—when the commissionaire came from the bank he came to Mr. Watt's office, Mr. Watt was not in the office, I took the cheque from him and told him I knew there was something wrong in it, and I took it away from him—I left the office that afternoon, and I met Brown in the evening—he took it from me, and said, "Oh, that is no go," and he tore it up—he then told me had got a plan in his head—I told him I could not go home any more, I had disgraced myself; I would keep away from Mr. Watt's office and from home—he said, "Don't be a fool, go home and see if anybody has called from Mr. Watt's office; if not, they will not take any notice of it; if they have not taken any notice, I will tell you what the plan is"—I asked him what it was—he told me if I went and got three or four cheques he would copy one as well as he could, of Mr. Alexander Watt's—I had found out that Mr. Watt did not sign his name "Watt and Oust"—by seeing him write another cheque I found it was "Alexander Watt"—the 417<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque was signed ' Watt and Oust"—I copied the name of Alexander Watt myself on a piece of paper from the copying letter-book, and gave it to him to copy on the cheque—he took it, and told me that if I gave him another cheque he would</p>

               <p>from the book out of the safe; the safe was open as I passed by—it was in the evening—Mr. Watt was doing what he wanted with the books, and as I was posing by copying letters, I took the cheque-book out of the safe and tore the cheque out, and put the cheque-book back, as I passed the safe again—I have said before to-day that I took the cheques at two different times, one first, and then the others—I told Mr. Mullens so before I was convicted—I do not know Louis Hoenig—I don't know any person of that name (<hi rend="italic">he was called in</hi>)—I know that lad—I don't know him personally, I have only known him through seeing him with Brown; I never knew his name or anything about him—I never knew his name—I have only known him since this case—I have seen him occasionally with Brown when he left the office—he has come home with Brown; he lived somewhere by Brown—I had seen Brown with him about a week—I did not go to school with that lad—I went to School with Brown at Mr. Cox-ford's in Great Prescott-street—this lad was not with me during any part of this transaction—he did not know anything about this case—I had nothing to do with him, I have merely known him by seeing him with Brown—I have spoken to him when Brown was speaking to him, when we were walking together—he never went to the ice shop with us, because Brown said we were not to let anybody know where we went—he went to the Effingham; I have been there with him—we used to stay there and see the acting—it is a theatre; we went there together—I think he had only been about three or four times before I was taken; I mean he went with me and Brown, and he has walked with us down the Whitechapel-road before the play began—we went nearly every night to the play—I never had occasion to call him by any name—I never heard Brown call him anything—I knew that he worked somewhere in Mincing-lane—I have never been charged with anything before this—this was the first time I was ever in a police-station or court—I was never charged with stealing a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, nor ever accused of it—I know Mr. Thornton, the minister of a chapel—I was not accused of taking money out of the poor-box of the chapel—I was told that I had—the housemaid told Mr. Thornton that I went to the cupboard to a box—I did go to the box for something else—it was a cupboard in Mr. Thornton's dining-room; there was no poor-box there that I know of—there was something of mine there, some large buttons with a coat of arms on them—I had them from some boys—Mr. Thornton had gone out of town, and they were having the place cleaned; the carpet was up, and some men were then nailing it down, and I put some things in the cupboard—I did not know it was used for anything else—I worked for Mr. Thornton—I was discharged—that is twelve or eighteen months ago—I was about three or four months at Mr. Watt's—before that I was with Mr. Jackson, a wholesale cloth manufacturer, for eight or ten months—I left because they wanted me to draw a barrow, my father would not let me do it—no charge was made against me there—they did not accuse me of taking anything out of the poor-box—they said I had been to the cupboard—nobody ever made a charge against me of stealing a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—no one said I had stolen a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; I never took a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—a great many boys go to the Effinghans, Saloon—I don't know whether they went to the ice cream shop—we went to a room up stairs; we found pen and ink there, not paper; we used to find the paper, and we had blue ink.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a metal-broker, of 15, Great St. Helen's—the boy Harden was an office-boy of ours for two or three months previous to June last—I missed some cheques from my cheque-book in June—I saw the prisoner at Harden's father's shop on 10th or 11th June—it was the day the commissionaire came back with the cheque—we had a two hours' conversa<lb/>tion—I went to Harden's father to tell him the circumstances, and to en<lb/>deavour to get from him the remainder of the cheques—the prisoner was not present first of all—I saw Harden's brother first—I went there a second time and then saw the prisoner there—I said to the prisoner, "You mast find this boy Harden"—he said he had left him only a quarter of an hour before, but he did not know where he was—I told him that we must find him, that he knew perfectly well where he was, as he was a friend of his; he must use his best exertions to recover these cheques—before that be asked what I wanted him for—I told him he knew perfectly well—I then told him it was a very important matter, and asked if he knew anything of what had been done—he said a great many things had been done—I then told him it was a case of forgery, and he said he knew all about it—after waiting with him some time, I told him that he must get these cheques for the sake of the boy's mother—it appears that he was very intimate with the Hardens—he said, "If Harden brings these cheques to you, will you collar him?"—I said I would not—he stood a minute or two, and then said, "Then you shall have them back, if you wait here for a quarter of an hour"—he went away, and returned in about a quarter of an hour with two or three cheques—this cheque for 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is not my writing nor was it written by my authority.</p>

Herzoff and Herman, of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—he also asked me to forge a cheque upon my masters, for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said he was a silly fellow to have such a notion in his head, and I also said that he would go where Harden now was—I also said, "I shall have nothing to do with you any more, as you are a dangerous character"—he then said, "If it should come as far as I should be captured, I shall implicate you in it"—I said, "You can't implicate me, for I have nothing to do with it"—he said that his yes and no was as good as mine—we then parted, and I said I should not speak to him any more—in consequence of that, I reported it to the minister of the German Church, who had recommended him to the place—that was on the next Sunday.</p>

I went to the Champion beer-shop, Essex-street, Hoxton, in consequence of information, with a search-warrant—I saw the prisoner standing in front of the bar, and directed Inspector Brannan to seize him—I ran up stairs with the other officers, expecting to find his companions there—the prisoner was brought up, and while he was coming up Sergeant Leather said, "He is putting his hand in his pocket"—I said, "Do not let him," and the officers seized him on each side—he became exceedingly violent, kicked Sergeant Leather, and made a kick at me—I shifted out of his way, and said, "You scoundrel, you might have ruined me for life"—he said, "I did not intend it for you; I intended it for that b-who was going to put the bad money into my pocket," alluding to Leather—I saw him struggling on the floor, and saw Leather take from him two packets, which he handed to me, each containing ten counterfeit shillings—he also gave me a packet which he said he picked up on the floor—I said, "I have received instructions from the solicitor to the Mint to look after you, as an extensive dealer in counterfeit coin"—he said, "<hi rend="italic">Lor</hi>, Mr. Brannan, I never had one in my life"—he was on the floor when the parcel was taken from his pocket—he became so exceedingly violent that they had to get him down—he kicked Leather on the knee—I opened the packets in his presence—they each contained ten counterfeit shillings, and the packet found on the floor contained ten counterfeit shillings separately wrapped up—Fife called my attention to a very large quantity of counterfeit coin which he found con<lb/>cealed under a form which gave way—he turned the form upside down by stepping on it, and there was this piece of wood temporarily nailed, from which one or two packets fell—the landlord of the house was taken in custody, but discharged—the packet contained counterfeit shillings of similar date to those found on the prisoner—he gave a false address.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, of 15, Addle-street—on the afternoon of 18th October, I was passing through Friday-street, within three or four yards of Mr. Lax ton's doorway, and saw the prisoner come out with this linsey (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—knowing the porter there for many years I went in, and in consequence of what was told roe I followed the prisoner—I overtook him at the corner of Gutter-lane, Cheapside, and told him him he most come back with me to the warehouse where he bad brought the goods from—he seemed quite astonished that I should stop him, and made some statement which I cannot now recollect—when I got him back to the warehouse he said a gentleman had given to him to carry—he did not say where—I saw him actually come out with it on his back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter and glazier, at Hounslow—on Saturday night, 8th October, between 11 and 12, I went into the White Hart public-house, at Whitton—I there saw the three prisoners—I had something to drink, and in order to pay for it I took out my pocket-handkerchief, in which my money was wrapped—I untied it, and took a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece out in their presence—I should think I had between 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my handkerchief</p>

               <p>when I went in; near 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I dare say—it was safe when I came out of the public-house—I might have been there three-quarters of an hour—I left, and Payne accompanied me to a place called the Rifle-butts—I was there met by West and Kemp—West knocked me down, and Kemp took my money that was in the handkerchief, and the handkerchief as well—I had a basket with me with my tools in it, and the handkerchief was in the basket—there was also a diamond there, wrapped up in paper; that went too—West and Kemp jumped over the hedge into a field, and Payne went down by the brookside—Payne did not assist the others, and he did not assist me—I was only struck once—the blow gave me a black eye; it was a severe blow—I cried out "Murder!" and "Police!" and a policeman came up—I made a complaint to him.</p>

I put a note in the hamper, saying if they were not fit for human food to sell them for dogs' meat, or anything.

What I done to him before is nothing to what I will do to him again"—they then all went down stairs together—I did not see what took place there—I went into a little room to speak to a young woman.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">VISCOUNT CURZON.</hi> On 8th February, I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Curzon: Twenty months have elapsed since I stated in a letter that your father was a liar and a robber, a shabby fellow, and would turn like a weathercock. When I wrote the letter to you, then living at Pen, in the Amersham Division, God only knew my motive, which I now refresh your memory, for so doing. Bone of his bone treated it with disdain, I expect, counselled by that monster of a villain, Thynne; that be as it may, I shall be on the watch strictly for you or your father and Thynne, to put my menace into execution. You may sneer at this, but, by God I carry that with me about the streets of London, as will rid the earth of tyrants. I let you to know I belong to that stamp of man as states his principles, and determined to shoot any of you down. I think no more of it than you did of shooting a hare on that farm, in the year of grace, 1840. Remember, it as entered so deep in the soul, and the only cure for it his execution; I mean, tie me up by the neck in the heavens—you may rely on this, I have been forty times in Great George-street this last ten days, to meet with that scoundrel, Thynne. The stamp I belong to is, 'Be up and doing,' for it is wisdom to kill such fellows so help me God! Pencil or ink, parchment or paper, I <hi rend="italic">are</hi> the same man. I declare to God you have had every chance to remedy and redress father Lynch; now, it is my turn. By God, beware! what I mean, I say, what I say, I mean; tomorrow, if I have the chance, I actually will blow out your brains, and throw your body into Slur-hole!") The prisoner's father was a tenant of my father's at Shakleston in Leicestershire—a person named Thynne was Lord Howe's agent—I believe the prisoner's father left the farm by the directions of Mr. Thynne, but I do not know it myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not the tenancy commence with my father under the Baroness Howe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no reason to think so—I remember your father—I said on 12<hi rend="italic">th</hi> August, at Marlborough-street, that I had never seen you before, and I do not know that I had—I do not recollect seeing you in my troop for nine years, or on the farm, when I have come shooting hares in a field of turnips—I do not remember seeing you when there was a fox in a drain at the bottom of the farm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I have three brothers who have been writing to you, but I never wrote to you; Thomas Hill wrote to tell you that if I had not been down in Ire<lb/>land, there would have been murder committed; the bailiff told me to give it up, and I said I would never do so; he sent thirteen or fourteen men into the farm, and let it at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an acre more than we were giving for it; he had no business to come and take it in that way; twelve mouths' rent was overpaid at the time they took possession of it; that was in 1858; I was thrown apon the world, and the property was given away entirely, we were not tenants to Lord Curzon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> The farm bailiff was not my servant, but my father's—this was my father's property—I never could have given any order to my father's servants about this—I did not interfere in the slightest degree in the management of my father's property; never in my life—I did not receive any letter from your brother Thomas in 1861.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He wrote three: one to Lord Howe, one to you, and one to the bailiff. One of them had my signature to it, but I never put my signa<lb/>ture to it, though I knew it was written. I can bring my mother to prove the injustice. He got 2001. a year out of this from this model farm, just at the time of the Russian war. This farm-bailiff came in, and was going to do wonders. Lord Howe has got a second family, and he said he would get</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186410240085"/>
               <p>a fortune for them, and get 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year out of it, just at the time that agricultural produce waft doubled. This man came speaking the grossest insolence, and insulting me. There was land hardly worth 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi> an acre, full of clay pits, and my family made that land. I knew my signature was put to the letter of 1861, but I am innocent of the letter of 1864. I am not my brother's keeper, and I cannot answer for this letter. I am as innocent as any man I am in the presence of. I am here with a clear conscience. I did not know a word that was in the letter till I heard it read at Marlbo<lb/>rough-street. I have been locked up ten weeks.</p>

Mr. Benett and his clerk, Mr. Byrne, were suhpoened as witnesses for Mr. Marshall, the plaintiff Both attended accordingly, but Mr. Benett, notwithstanding the remonstrances of Mr. Marshall's attorney, sent Mr. Byrne away, and he returned to Loudon before the cause was called on. Mr. Benett, however, remained, and during the whole day was in constant communication with the defendant's attorney, whom he supplied with invoices, letters, and other documents for use in the cause. To the surprise of Mr. Marshall, Mr. Benett entered the box as a witness for Captain Blakely. The counsel for the defendant did not, however, ask him a single question, and the jury without hesitation found a verdict for the plaintiff for 475<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which, with the costs, has since been paid. The following correspondence subse<lb/>quently passed between Mr. Marshall and Mr. Benett"—(<hi rend="italic">the letters were then inserted</hi>). I never wrote to Marshall—I am not connected with the turf—I go to races—I never made a book in ray life—the last race I went to, was the first day at Goodwood—I shortly afterwards received this statement and letter—it is the fair copy of the proof of the same circular—I received it immediately after the other one—this was addressed to the firm.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Will you take upon yourself to say that address is the handwriting of the defendant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—it is my belief that it is his writing—I am a member of Tattersall's—an order was given to us for the Chinese Government, through Mr. Marshall in the first instance, and we supplied two 9-pouuders, described as Blakely's guns—I afterwards gave Cap<lb/>tain Blakely orders, through Mr. Marshall, for the sake of giving Marshall a chance of getting a commission—he told me he would be satisfied with 2 l/2 per cent, and he squeezed 15 per cent, out of Captain Blakely—I think Captain Blakely was able to make his own arrangements, but I do not think he understood the arrangement between Mr. Marshall and myself—I should have to pay the amounts by bills and otherwise to Captain Blakely—I had a subpoena on the part of Marshall, and I believe I had a subpoena on the other side, but I was at Guildford at the time—I did not hand a single paper or invoice to the defendant's attorney on the day of the trial, nor did my clerk—I ordered the attorney out of my room, because he said if my clerk attempted to leave he would put him in gaol—I sent my clerk up to Loudon immediately, although I knew he had been subpoened as a witness—I am a director with Captain Blakely of the Tavistock Iron Works Company—I cannot swear whether Cunliffe and Beaumont are the solicitors to that Company—the business of the Iron Company has been carried on at 19, Mark-lane for ten days past, the offices are being repaired—I was just leaving my private office when I told my clerk to write that letter which has been read—I had read Marshall's letter then—it came in with the other letters—I have no doubt I read it—yes, I read that letter—what I said to Byrne, as nearly as I can recollect, was, "Here is a ridiculous letter from Mr. Marshall; write and tell him that I think Captain Blakely has been very hardly used. I have no expenses to charge, in fact I think he will have quite enough expenses to meet without them; and with regard to the bet, I neither recol<lb/>lect making him any offer, or his accepting any"—I read the next two letters from Marshall—I don't know whether Byrne was present when I read the one of 9<hi rend="italic">th</hi> August—I did not, upon reading that, ask him what he had written to Mr. Marshall—I may have spoken to him about it before I re<lb/>ceived the printed document—I never recollect making an offer of a bet of</p>

I could tight a dozen like you"—he struck me in the mouth, and knocked me against the shutters—I then took him info custody, and lie struck and kicked me several times—a public carriage attendant came to my assistance, and he was knocked down—Police<lb/>men Hart and Kenny then came up—Kenny assisted in getting me up—I heard him say, "I am stabbed"—I looked round, and saw him on the ground; his face was covered with blood—Sergeant Dillon then came up, and asked the prisoner to go quietly to the station—he went five or six yards, and then threw himself down, and said he would be d—if he would go for any one; he would not be taken by a dozen men—it took four constables to get him to the station.</p>

Franks's warehouse-door, and sent for the sergeant—there were six bags of tea in the cart—I could see it was loaded with bags at the time I saw it leaving Franks's warehouse—there was not an interval of more than a minute before I saw them again—I saw the witness Pearson at the time I was going round towards Garlic-hill, coming down Maiden-lane—I could see him coming along towards me—he met me close to Mr. Franks's ware-house-door, when I brought the cart back, and I asked him to stop, as there were thieves, and he did so—I found five other bags, filled with tea, on the ground floor—I took the tea to the station, and sent the cart to the greenyard—there was no name on the cart—it was not a peculiar cart—the horse was a chestnut; it had its knees broken, and was lame of the fore-leg.</p>

I am a gas-fitter, at 4, Sugarloaf-court, Garlic-hill—that runs parallel with Maiden-lane—I am now working at the Miller of Mansfield—on Monday morning, 12th September, about twenty minutes or a quarter to 7, I came out of Sugar-loaf-court, into Garlic-hill; I was going down Maiden-lane, and I met the prisoner coming up with a horse and cart, with five bags of tea on it—he was coming from Mr. Franks front-door—I then saw three men come out at that door, and run down a little court at the back close by—I only just saw the policeman pass round the corner then—directly the prisoner turned the corner, I suppose he went away from the cart—I did not see him then—the court where I saw the men run down if about twenty yards from the back of the warehouse; more towards Garlic-hill—I know it was Cole leading the horse and cart, because I have recog<lb/>nised him since—I was sufficiently near to see him; so near that I am able to swear to him—I have no doubt whatever that he is the man I saw—I afterwards saw the cart; there was no name on it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined, Q.</hi> Are you a gasfitter on your own account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and have been so about ten years—I was before the Magistrate on the first examination—I was never in Manchester—I was not in the country after the examination—I saw the prisoner again about a fortnight afterwards—I believe the man who was leading the cart had a little whiskers on—I go to work at 7 in the morning—the Miller of Mansfield is at the back of Guy's Hospital—I walk there; it is about 400 or 500 yards down King-street, on the left-hand side—it was a very narrow turning where I met the man with the cart—I was just the width of the cart from him—only one cart can get up there at once—I was a few yards off when I first saw the cart—I fancy the prisoner had another coat on.</p>

On Sunday night, 11th September, about a quarter-past 10, I was on duty in Tudor-street, which leads from the Temple to Blackfriars-bridge—I noticed a horse and cart there—after<lb/>wards on Tuesday morning 13th, I saw that same horse and cart in the green yard—a man named Hayes, who was apprehended with the prisoner, was in charge of the cart on the Sunday—I examined the horse and curt then—I did not see any name on the cart—the horse was a chestnut.</p>

I have had Mr. Hunt, my family physician, to see me, but feel no better. I beg to say it is bad management of the company's servants to allow a train at full speed to run into us.—Signed, Charles Nash.")—I replied on 10th June by this letter (<hi rend="italic">Read.</hi>—"10th June, 1864.

I have to leave the workmen there while I am out: they knew that I should not be home at night, and it may be a trap which they have laid for me, to have an opportunity to take what few tools I have—a young man, a polisher, was the last workman I had, and the policeman found him polishing at my place—he passed a bad half-crown, and afterward came into my room, closed the door, and said, "Will you oblige me by lending me a half-crown?" I said, "What for?" He said, "I had occasion to borrow one of a man I met, and he insists on my paying it. "I lent him one, and said that he might come and work it out. There is a trap laid to get me into the snare. As to the plaster of Paris, I had only that week contracted for some painting and whitewashing, and repairing some ceilings. I have to stop the holes with plaster of Paris. The workmen can do what they like when I am out, and I was at work at Peck ham.

I said, 'No one, except myself and two children;' as Mr. and Mrs. Mangon were out He asked me if he could put a box in there. I refused at first He said he would only be away an hour, and would call for it again and give me a shilling. He asked me to help him up with the box, and I did so. I did not know what was in the box. When we got upstairs, he said he would cut me a piece off if I liked. I said, 'No,' and told him not to stop. He told me to show it to no one if I cut a piece off. I tore a piece off, and hid it in the copper for fear they should see it when they came in.—I gave that piece to Rooney to sell. I did not tell her I had got a box up stairs.

               <p>on Saturday night, 1st October, I went with my brother into the King William the Fourth tavern, at about 10 minutes to 12 o'clock—there was a concert going on, and the prisoner struck my brother on the hat—I told him not to do that again—I knew him by sight—there was no singing going on at the time—I and my brother had not done anything to him—there had been no quarrel between them—I told the prisoner not to do that again—he told me he would put a knife into me, and came up, threatening—he closed with me, and I struck him—I did not see a knife in his hand, nor had I one—I did not take one out of my pocket—I went down the stairs, not knowing he was following me, and when I got to the bottom I felt my<lb/>self struck on the shoulder—I turned round and saw the prisoner behind me—I took him by the throat, took the knife from him, and threw him on the table—I afterwards found I was wounded—I then lost my senses, and when I came to myself I was in Guy's Hospital, with pains in my hip and ear—this wound on my hip was done then, and this hole through my cheek—I found part of the flesh in my mouth—I am still in the hospital.</p>
