On the 24th of May, about twelve o'clock at night, as I was going to put up my shutters, I observed that a pane of glass was broken at the corner of the window—I did not miss any thing at that minute—I put up one shut-ter and as I returned for a second, I met the policeman with the prisoner in custody—he asked me if I had lost any thing—I said not that I was aware of—he said, "You had better look, 1 think you have"—I looked and found I had lost five bundles of cigars, containing 100 each, they had been lying in the window directly opposite where the glass was broken—I had seen the glass whole about eight or nine o'clock—the policeman found some cigars under the broken window and I found three or four in the area directly under where the window was broken—they were of the same</p>

I was on duty in the Strand on the night of the 25th, I saw the prisoner standing close to Mr. Smith's shop window—there was another one with him—I went towards them and heard a slight snap as I thought, as if glass had been broken—I looked round for a moment, and then walked very smartly towards Mr. Smith's shop window—there was no other shop near there open at that time—when I got there I saw the prisoner turn his head, look towards me, and then they both ran away in the same direction, as fast as they could—I kept my eye on the prisoner on account of his having this black apron on—the other one escaped—I pursued the prisoner down Hungerford street, and at last caught him in Craven-street—he was stopped by another constable—I had my eye on him the whole of the way, and was calling "Stop thief"—when I got up to him he had taken his apron off, and had got it doubled up in his hand—he asked what I wanted him for—I said I did not exactly know yet, but I suspected he had broken a tobacconist's shop window—he came back with me—I took him back to the shop and asked Mr. Smith if he had lost any thing—he said he thought not—I said I thought he bad, and went out, took the shutter down, and saw the glass had been broken big enough to get both my bands in—I picked up nineteen cigars from the flagstones close under the window, and Mr. Smith brought up three from the area.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in King-street, Snow-hill. I saw the child on the Friday, the day after its death—I opened it on Saturday—I found the body very much emaciated—I cannot say whether it arose from sickness or insufficient nourishment—I did not find any bruises—the lungs were inflamed—the bronchial cells, the stomach, and intestines were healthy—the disease in the lungs was sufficient to account for death—it might arise from a variety of causes—want of care and attention would predispose it to an attack of that description—I heard of the bead being knocked against the wall, but found no traces of any violence—I cannot say that the neglect of the mother caused the death—I saw her there—she seemed to treat the whole matter with very heartless levity—all kinds of bad treatment would predispose the child to the disorder, but it would not be a necessary consequence—rough treatment, or leaving it to the care of another, would not—I allude to the complaint of the lungs—we find the same complaint in children who are well attended to—the stomach did not indicate an absence of food.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to John Foreman, of Commercial Wharf, Old Swan-lane, Upper Thames-street; he is agent to a flint and glass-bottle manufacturer; Seabrook was in his employ. On the 29th of May I came to work at half-past eight o'clock—as I was going up, Sea, brook said a cart had broken down, and he had had a hard job, he had hoisted a crate into the top floor—I cannot recollect where he said the cart had broken down—in the evening 1 and he were at a public-house, and he said the man was coming for the crate on Monday morning it seven o'clock—on Monday, at six, I went to work—I saw Seabrook—he said the man was coming for it at seven, and he was to have it—about seven I was up in the top floor—I saw Seabrook there—he went down stairs—Reeves came down the lane, opposite our warehouse, with a whip in his hand—he said, "Do you know a person named Brown or Bowen and said he called for the goods that were left there on Friday—I said I knew nothing at all about it, he had better go to the foreman—after that, in consequence of suspicion, I went to the warehouse where the crate was—I went to the crate, which was on the floor where I was working—it was a middling-sized crate—I did not open it—I pulled this bottle, now pro<lb/>duced, out—I pulled another bottle out, but that 1 put in again—it was similar to this, but not the same colour—I think they are my master's—the crate was fuller than they are usually packed—after I pulled the bottle out, Seabrook came up to me and said, "There is a quartern of gin for you at East's; you can go and take <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> and get it—<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> is the foreman—I called <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, and went to the public-house—I then told him what I sus<lb/>pected, and he returned back—the crate would hold four or five gross of bottles.</p>

I am a carman to the Gas Company—I was in Lin-coln's-inn-fields a few minutes after twelve o'clock on the 20th of May, went to the trench, and saw the prisoners in the act of putting something into a jacket or coat—knowing me, Bullen sat on the jacket, and Dooley took a shovel and began filling the trench—Bullen sat some minutes, and then got up, and began to unload the wagon—in a few minutes after the men came from dinner—he went to the pot in the place where the other men were collected, then went a few paces, and took the jacket—I told him I must see what was in it—he said, "Never mind," or something—he then took it back, and returned it from whence he took it, and out of the jacket he took a pig of lead, and walked towards the pot—I have no doubt it was the Company's lead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an attorney. I know the prisoner—I first be<lb/>came acquainted with him in 1827 or 1828—he told me he was a tailor and draper—I discounted bills for him—I received the bill in question, on Mr. Poulton, from him in February last—he had repeatedly given me bills drawn by Mr. Poulton before, which I discounted—in 1838, when he brought the first bill, he represented Poulton to be a gentleman out of business, of independent property, residing at Staines-row, Hounslow—he produced Mr. Poulton's card to me in 1838—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>, "<hi rend="italic">Mr. Ben-jamin Wheeler Poulton, Stames-row, Hounslow</hi>")—I desired him to make inquiry about Poulton, as to whether the bill he brought me was in Mr. Poulton's hand-writing—that was the first bill—he was to go to Staines<lb/>row to inquire—he promised to go—he returned, and brought me this card with the writing on the back of it—he was absent too short a time to go there, and I told him he had been too short a time to go to Staines-row—he said it was too short a time, but he met the gentleman at Morley's Hotel Charing-cross—I discounted that bill and others, and the one in question—I have had them repeatedly since that—I discounted this 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill on the faith of that—the other bills were paid, I do not know who by—I have some which are not paid, but a number of them were paid—in the course of our transactions, he said he received the bills from John Fletcher, who was a man of considerable property, and had a considerable connexion among tailors at the west end of the town—I requested to be introduced to Fletcher, and have his address—he objected to that, saying, "If you and him come together you will do your business without me, and I</p>

               <p>shall lose my commission"—I acquiesced in that objection—this bill was not paid—he once told me Fletcher lived at No. 22, Old Burlington-street—I have made inquiry there, and cannot find him—my clerk was present when he mentioned Fletcher's address to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Your clerk and somebody else were present? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—that was not by arrangement—the conversation about Fletcher was in 1838, on the first of these bills coming to me, I can-not say in what month—I think it was in May or April—(the other person who was present at the conversation is not here—he was obliged to go out of town)—I never forgot the conversation—it has always been the subject of conversation—the conversation about Fletcher had reference to all the bills—I was before the Magistrate respecting two other bills on which I have indicted the prisoner—this is the first time I ever swore any thing about Fletcher—my acquaintance with the prisoner originated in being employed by him professionally at the time of his bankruptcy—he has a wife and five children—I acted as his attorney, to get his certificate—I do not know what his estate paid—I do not think it paid any thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he in desperate circumstances at the time you bad transactions with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had no means of knowing—I believe he was—our deal<lb/>ing in bills commenced in 1838—I own some property at Norwood, and contemplated a speculation in building on it in 1838—I did not send to the prisoner in 1888, and desire to have a confidential conversation with him—I do not recollect any thing of the kind—I think I can swear I did not—I will swear it—I believe nothing of the sort passed—certainly not re<lb/>specting that property—I do not think I sent to him desiring to have a confidential conversation with him—I should hardly like to swear it at this distance of time, but I have no recollection of any thing of the sort, and do not know of any thing that would lead to it—I have been an attorney thir<lb/>teen or fourteen years—the prisoner called on me for the first time about bills in 1838—I have not bad bills from him in the course of two years to the amount of 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I should think it was about half that—I think I can swear I have not had 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I will swear it—I have not cast it up—I will swear I have not had 25,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When he came to you, in 1838, did you communicate to him that you had some houses and land at Norwood, and if he could raise any money by way of bills, to enable you to build on it, you thought you could make a good thing of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, certainly not—I told him I had some property there I wished to sell, if he could raise enough money to purchase it—I do not recollect Very distinctly when this was, but I think it was about 1838—I do not know the month, nor part of the year—it was a mere casual conversation—I told him it was not the sort of property that could answer my purpose—they were small houses, and if he could bor<lb/>row any money on them, they might possibly answer his purpose—he made several attempts—I did not tell him he might raise money on billa, I swear that positively—I said nothing about bills in reference to this matter—I never dreamed of such a thing as bills—I did not say I wished to build larger houses—there was not room—I saw him several times in 1838—I was not on the most intimate terms with him—I knew him as a person trying to get his living—he applied to me to endeavour to get him a situ-ation—he was not in desperate circumstances, to my knowledge—I did not know his circumstances were very bad—I did not believe they were good—I thought he was getting his living—he had applied about a year</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184106140046"/>
               <p>before to me, to get him a situation—I wrote to a friend in the North, to use his influence to get him appointed a coal-metre—the proposition I made the prisoner was under consideration some time, and he advertised, I believe—I do not recollect his saying he would consider of it till next morning—the first bill I took of his was about the 20th of February, 1838—(<hi rend="italic">referring to his bill-book</hi>)—I made this entry about that time—before I paid it away—I discounted this bill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Of all the bills you ever had in your life from him, and which you will not swear amounted to 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., tell me how you discounted any one of them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By cheques and by cash—the one I now prosecute on, was one of a lot, amounting to 280<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave cheques and other bills for it, which would be due at the same time, and the discount.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You gave him cheques, to what amount? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This was, I think, by bills alone—other bills.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said some bills, some cheques, and some cash? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that was the usual way, but from my memorandum I gave him other bills—one on James for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., one on Banks, for 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., one on Adams, for 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., one on Esther, for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were all due about that time—this entry in the bill-book was made about that time—I should probably do it immediately after, but I will not swear that I did—there was a bonus of 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to me on the transaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you account for giving him 328<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which appears in this entry for 280<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You will see the balance is carried forward against him to-wards the next transaction—I have no book of our transactions in 1840, except the bill-book—I kept it merely on the bills—James's bill was on just due, and probably not due—I will not swear it was not overdue, nor Banks's—I think they were just about coining due—(<hi rend="italic">referring to his book</hi>)—Jame's was due on the 27th of January—I cannot exactly say the day I gave then to him—I received the bills from him on the 6th of February—I think the bills would be given up about the day they were due—they were not all over due—they were given to him to be presented at the time they became due, as he said very often they were sent down to by the drawers to provide for the bills on a sudden emergency, and it was very convenient to his employer, Mr. Fletcher, to have the bills to present—I gave him a con<lb/>sideration for the bills he brought—generally speaking, it must have been cheques, not over-due bills—I gave him the bills for the 280<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., either the day or before they were due—they were not all due the same day—the transaction was in February, but I did not receive these bills in return at the time the others were given up—I gave him the bills I have mentioned for the 280<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills—I gave them to him in January—when that bill became due, in January, I gave it to him—when I gave him up a bill, I put it down—it sometimes went on for several weeks, before I got any others back for what I had given him up—he said it was the same to them as cash.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You stated you had discounted that bill; on your oath, is there a syllable of truth in that? Did you pay a single farthing for it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> gave him bills previously—I did not give him a farthing at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not long before that, agree to allow him a commission of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent, on any thing he could bring you, on which you could raise money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not that I could raise money on—I paid him a commis<lb/>sion for his trouble—he said he got another commission from his employer—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184106140047"/>
               <p>paid him about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent.—it varied—I did not at the commence-ment agree to give him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent.—he used to get as much as he could—I sometimes gave him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—nearly the whole of these cheques (<hi rend="italic">pro-ducing some</hi>) are for money he had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at them, and tell the Jury any time you will swear that in discounting hills, you gave him money, and what yon gave him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the 23rd of May, 1838, I gave him a cheque for 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for a bill in the name of Mr. Gill, for 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not think I had any bills of his then over-due (<hi rend="italic">referring to his book</hi>)—I see on the same day there was a bill for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due, drawn by John Williams, on Thomas Williams of Dover—that bill laid at my banker's—I do not know who took it up—I did not—I did not give him that cheque to take up that bill, on my oath—I never have done so—he has borrowed cheques of me, but I never dis<lb/>counted a bill to enable him to meet others—I never gave him cheques to take to the banker's, to take up bills over-due and unpaid with "no such person," or "not known," or "no such account" written on them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear that positively? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not believe I ever did such a thing—I swear I have not done it a hundred times, nor fifty—I think I can swear I have not done it twenty times—he may in several in<lb/>stances have borrowed cheques when he said they were pressed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But the question is, whether some of the cheques you gave him were not to take up bills lying at the banker's unpaid? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> may have done so in a few instances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear you have not done it in twenty instances? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think so—I should not like to swear so minutely, nor to twenty-five—I will swear there have not been thirty—not that I have been aware of his using them for any such purposes—I have not done it to my knowledge, for bills laying over-due at bankers—the bankers have not to my knowledge refused to deliver bills up—I know no such thing as bankers refusing to deliver up bills to me, or on my account, with "no account" written on them, when I sent to pay them—I did not tell him in 1838, that if he brought me the bills, I would take care of him—I said nothing of the sort—I did not tell him I was going to build a terrace—I may have shown him the plan of one, as an ornamental piece of work—it was drawn by Mr. Barry, for the person of whom I purchased the land, Mr. Flasket, with whom I have had bill transactions—I should think they were not to the amount of 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was not 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I will not swear it was under 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think my last transaction with Flasket was in 1838—I will not swear I have had none since—I think I had none in 1840, but cannot swear it without going through my book—there may have been one or two—I gave him 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the estate, in money, in 1833—he had three of the bills I took from the prisoner, I think in 1838—I may have paid him one or two more—he is a builder—I can scarcely tell the amount of my bill transactions in 1838—it was nothing like 50,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was very small in 1839—I had scarcely any bill transactions, except with the prisoner—I did not engage him for bill transactions at 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent—I think, in 1839, my bill transactions were not more than 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I swear they were not 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think they were under 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I swear they were not 6000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think I can swear it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at his book</hi>)—I never sent him in 1839 to the banker's to take up over-due bills—I might know of his going.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Bills over-due and noted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Noted, probably—I do not recollect</p>

               <p>any of Poulton's—there were not many of Poulton's in 1839, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear you do not know of many of Poulton's bills, in 1839, being over-due and unpaid, either drawn, accepted, or supposed to be accepted by Poulton? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Unless it was by arrangement to be renewed, I do not know of their being over-due and unpaid, except by arrange<lb/>ment they should be renewed—I have three or four over-due bills of Poul<lb/>ton's in my possession—I have none in the hands of a relation, except my brother—he does not hold any of Poulton's—he held, at the time the prisoner absconded, nearly 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether, which I had received of the prisoner, and now has nearly that amount—he does not hold more—I have a great quantity here—(<hi rend="italic">producing forty-seven</hi>)—these are all have, except the three indicted on—there may be perhaps twenty more, not in my possession—I swear there are not fifty—the prisoner did not call to request me to find money to take up any of these bills—he used to call on me to supply him with money, and if I said, "Do you want this to meet such and such bills?" he used to laugh at me, an I say, "No such thing you are always suspecting"—he has borrowed small amounts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he call on you for money to take up bills, and you tell him you had not a fraction in the world, and give him your watch, chain and seals to raise money on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to raise money on—I had told him I wished to sell my watch—I think that was this year—I do not think I had over<lb/>due bills in my hands at that time—I swear I had not fifty—I several times talked to him about selling my watch—he bid me a price for it—he then pressed for his commission, which had got in arrear—he said he could not live without his commission—I asked if he would like the watch at such a price—I might tell him I was short of money—I do not think I told him I had none—I will not swear it—I will not swear I had no over-due bills at that time—there might be one or two—the prisoner went abroad on the 19th of February—I did not give him money to go—the last cheque I gave him was in exchange for another he brought—that was on the 17th of February—I gave him two cheques, amounting to 76<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. together—I did not at that time give him a letter to Mr. Cooper, of Baldwin's-court—I may have given him one once, as he used to go for me to different persons—I think I sent him, shortly before he went abroad, to Cooper, to know if he could cash me some bills—I did not recollect it before—I had a letter from the prisoner on the day he went abroad—I did not tell him to write it—on the contrary, I was much surprised at receiving it—Mr. Cooper did not come to me, in answer to a letter to come, and give me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went down to him; he gave me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I handed to the prisoner—I did not tell him to pay as much of it as he could into Williams and Co., of Birch in-lane, my bankers, and keep the rest himself—this was on the 12th of February—if you will allow me to read a letter from the prisoner it will account for this—I gave him the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the same account as he had all the rest, for which I was to have bills—he did not tell me of his going abroad, I swear I did not know it—I received a note without any signature, but which I believe to be his writing—the post-mark is the 6th of April—that was the first I heard from him—I saw a letter before that from him to his wife—I think it was on the day I had a person watching at his house—it was in March, I think—the post-mark was "Paris, 25th March."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This letter is dated the 12th of February, were you not then in a most desperate state? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I thought I was in a very good state</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184106140049"/>
               <p>because I thought the bills I held were all good, which were all I hold now, except some which have come back to me—the bills I had in hand at the time he went, amounted to nearly 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe the body of Mr. Poulton's bill to be in the handwriting of the prisoner—I did not state before the Magistrate I believed the whole of it to be his writing—I did not desire him to get a letter from Fletcher, to produce to the person from whom I got money for the bills, to show there was a prospect of get-ting the money—the body of this bill (<hi rend="italic">looking as one</hi>) is very much like his handwriting—I believe it to be his—he seems to have the facility of varying his handwriting a good deal—I should not like to swear it—the body of several of the forty-seven bills here appear to be his handwriting—I never built the terrace, nor did any body else—I think I was ill with a cold, or something, in the Spring of last year—the prisoner came to me, I think.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many cheques did you give him on that occasion, did you give him at least ten? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a cheque-book</hi>)—this is not the book—this cheque-book ends on the 17th of February—I never drew a cheque after that—I stopped the account at my banker's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at the margin of the book, is there not, in your own handwriting, many of these cheques, denoting that they were given to the prisoner to take up over-due bills? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it is a mistake—these pencil-marks do not relate to any thing of the sort—here is, "Lent Smith, to pay Brown's bill, 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I know Brown of Sunderland, he is a friend of mine, but it is not his bill—he may have had 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of bills of Brown of Sunderland—I can<lb/>not say whether he has had more—I will not swear that he has not had twice or thrice as much—I should not like to swear, without casting it up—I expect this Brown is one of the parties to a bill—the entry relates to a bill I re<lb/>ceived of the prisoner—I think I have found it—I think it was the last bill Brown of Sunderland had from me—I find it was Brown of Sunderland—I do not think Brown of Sunderland had as much as 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of these bull.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Take the cheque-book, and turn to the 24th, the same day, and see if you do not find on a margin, "to Smith to take up bills due on the 17th? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, "40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., Smith to take up bill"—the * is scratched out, as it was a mistake—it was done at the time, I believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You swore you never gave him money to take up bills over-due, to your knowledge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Except by an arrangement, I said, which was that I was to have other bills from him—that is the mode by which I dealt with him all through—I did not give him money to take up bills in every in<lb/>stance, nor in multitudes of instances—not 100—it is difficult to swear, unless I kept an account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you recollect swearing, the only time you gave him money to take up over-due bills, was, when they were to be renewed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, by this sort of arrangement, if I gave him a cheque, it did not matter whether a bill was due, or would be due shortly, if I put the cheque down to the account—I was to have other bills for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This was seven days after the bill was due—on your oath, we there not written on that bill "The acceptor not known—no orders"—the bill noted lying in the hands of the banker? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very likely—he ac-counted for it by saying they were bills drawn by tailors on their custom-ers, many of them fashionable young men, at the West-end of the town, who did not care making bills payable at bankers, though they might not hare an account there—I never in any one instance made inquiry to ascer<lb/>tain</p>

               <p>whether there were such persons in existence as the acceptors, nor did I go to the persons themselves—he made inquiries, and always assured me they were perfectly safe—he was in the house of Bed ward and Co,—he said he had been with hills from that house—he knew the parties, and knew them to be safe—I did not go to Bedward and Co.—I depended on his statement—I cannot swear the whole of this page in my bill-book was not written at one time, nor whether the next was not written at the same time as the other—the bills were entered about the time I received them—the entries are in my handwriting—I cannot say it was written on the pre<lb/>cise day it bears date—it has been written at different times—I may have entered, perhaps, two pages at once, not more—it is all the same ink—I copied it from the bills—the dates are the dates of the bills—I have not filled up the column headed, "When received"—Mr. Lowry sometime had 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of bills at a time—he held about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth at the time the prisoner left—Hunt held between 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Cooper held two of 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, which are all over-due now—they were over-due in May last—there are none now which were over-due in 1840—those were either paid or returned to the prisoner before he left—Williams, a wine<lb/>merchant, held about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—I do not think he had thousands of pounds worth altogether—I do not think Wharton, of St. Katherine's Dock, had so muck as 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there are two now at Williams and Co., my bankers—I have not had any transactions with them since the 17th of February—they have had nothing in their hands but the two over-due bills—I be<lb/>lieve there was a cheque sent in on the 18th—the two bills they hold have overdrawn the account by 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had lent the prisoner several cheques at the time I stopped the account—there was one of 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which went in on the 18th.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the time you discontinued the account, was he in possession of cheques to the amount of 470<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., when you had nothing to pay them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had borrowed them before, which he repeatedly did, and has brought me back the cheques, or found the money to meet them—he said it made no difference to Mr. Fletcher—he does not hold 470<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of dishonoured cheques now, as one was paid—I paid 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in immediately—an action has been brought against me for the dishonoured cheques—the 470<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of cheques had nothing to do with this bill of Poulton's—they were lent to accommodate him and Mr. Fletcher—I never saw Fletcher—I asked tow him several times on the commencement of the transaction—I always said how should I find Mr. Fletcher, in case of any thing happening to him, in case of illness, death, or any thing—he said, his wife had Mr. Fletchers address, when I wanted it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And you mean to represent having had about 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of bills negotiated by him, when he said his wife had Fletcher's address, you never asked for it till after he absconded? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the bills were regularly met—I sometimes gave cheques to take them up—if he makes an arrangement with me, if he pays them, he regularly meets them—he said they were to be met for the accommodation of the acceptor, who had made a communication to the drawer, and the drawer to Fletcher, through whom they were discounted—the whole of this cheque-book almost is filled with cheques given him for bills discounted—he denied that they were to take up bills—he always said, "We want money."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was he getting his living? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I understood he was a good deal engaged by Fletcher—he said he got something from him, and he was buying and selling on his own account, I believe—he never dined with</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184106140051"/>
               <p>me—he has often come to the house I dined at in Moorgate-street to see me about bills and transactions, and sometimes he used to take something—I sometimes paid for it, not always—he only took a little pudding, or something—he came down to my father-in-law's, to me, and had something to eat, but not to dinner—it was in the morning—I was sitting down with him—I do not recollect eating with him—I have given him post-dated cheques, several—I think not a hundred—I should not like to swear minutely—he pressed me for post-dated cheques very much—he was very pressing for money, and if I had none, he would say, "It will make no difference to you, the cheques will lie in the hands of a friend of Fletcher's, who will lend him the money, and before they are due, you shall have the cheque hack," and I got them back—the 470<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. happened to be out at the time he absconded—I have not given him a dozen cheques at a time post-dated, nor six, I should think, but will not swear it—he has had three or four at a time, with different dates—that was a general thing—I know one Maltby by sight, as being in the employ of a person where the prisoner used to frequent—I never employed Maltby to take up over<lb/>due bills—I never gave him any, nor ever saw the prisoner give him any hills or cheques by my direction—I think on one occasion I understood he went to take up a bill, but not for me—it was for the prisoner—I think it was at my bankers', but do not very distinctly recollect it—it is some time ago—he did not come back and tell me the bankers would not part with the bill, because they suspected there was something wrong—i be-lieve he got the bill—I will not swear it; as it is some time ago—I do not recollect writing to the bankers and getting the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear he did not go there for you—on your oath did not you furnish him with your own hand-writing to get the bill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have given the prisoner a note—I will not swear I did not give Maltby one—I was practising as an attorney all this time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago is it that you sent Maltby? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a year ago—I do not recollect now whose bill it was—whether it was Poulton's—I will I not swear it was not—the bankers never sent to complain of my taking a liberty in making use of their names, by making bills payable there—I never heard of it till now—my own bankers, Williams and Deacon, did not do so—I gave the prisoner a note on one or two occasions—I have some indistinct recollection now of sending Maltby with a note—I will not swear I did not afterwards send him with the money to take up a bill—I do not recollect it-actions have been brought against me not he cheques, and on one bill—communicated that to the prisoner's wife—he was abroad, I think—he did not come to my office till May—the action had commenced after he left—he catne to my office about a month after I sent to him, but I have no dates when he came to the office I knew the bills were forged—I felt some difficulty about giving him into custody—I did not like the idea of a pro<lb/>secution against a man with five children, and I also thought his evidence might have been useful to me, I did not think it would be useful to the plaintiff—I was taken very much by surprise—I had no idea of his coming, and he promised to come again the following evening—my clerk was not in the room when he first came—he came in a few minutes—I saw him in my private office—I did not shut the door, and desire him to lock it—I knew where his wife lived at the time—he staid about half an hour—I will wear it was not more than an hour—I do not think he staid an hour—I did not send to his wife afterwards to see if he was there—he said he would</p>

               <p>come next day—he wrote to me afterwards, and I wrote to him—I know Hunt, to whom he owed 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Watson is Hunt's attorney—I would not be the attorney—when the prisoner came again, I had got Forresteru officer—there was not a Sheriff's officer in my office—he was in a picture shop opposite—I did not put him there—I knew of his being there—I ranged that he should be waiting there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath, did not you write him a letter to deceive him, to get him to come to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I applied to him to come in order that he might give evidence to clear me in the action—Hunt complained to toe about the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we thought the prisoner must have money, and if arrested first by the Sheriff, he would probably pay him the amount—Hunt was very much annoyed at his obtaining the money as he did previous to his absconding, and when I had made up my mind, under advice of my friend, to forego the evidence in the action, and to prosecute him, that was ar-ranged to get him there—he had called on me on a Monday, and wrote to say he would be there on the Monday afterwards, and was taken—I ap-plied to Forrester to take him without a warrant, but he did not like—he had not borrowed the cheques of me for himself, but for Fletcher—I be-lived he said all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you the smallest means in the world to take up any of the bins you have negotiated? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I have—I shall have the means of meet<lb/>ing them in a little time—I have some freehold land at Norwood, which I purchased in 1832, but must sell it before I can get the money—I have book debts to about 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there are about 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out now, including what I hold—I have given my own note for some of them, and in some cases, bills—I have contracted to sell the property at Norwood—there is a mortgage on it—on that, and some land at Holloway, I have had 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—did not give any money for the houses at Norwood—that transaction was also with Flasket—I do not know what is called the Swindlers' List—I do not think I ever saw one—my attention has never been called to it—I have heard of such a list, but not for several years—I do not know whether Flasket's name is on it.</p>

               <p>"April 17th, 1841. Mr. Moss.—Sir, It will he a great expense for any one to come to me—I am in the department of the Voges on the banks of the Moselle, and I do not understand what I am to do, from the paper my wife has sent me. If you will give my wife the amount it will cost me, I will meet any one you may please at Calais or Boulogne, and that will save you double the expense—it will cost me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; at the same time you instruct me how to act—will you give me time, and I will pay you 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound?—you will then be no loser. I should like to have your word upon this business. How soon do you want my affidavit? I could do business to a great advantage, if I could visit England, but not without, I regret much for the past. I trust I shall be able to repay; indeed if could get my business settled, I am sure I could. You will please to do till you can for me. My wife tells me you say that I am in England—what nonsense! because the paper is not French, I send you now some French paper that has not been made five minutes. I hope you will do something to settle my business; it rests entirely with you. What my poor wife and family will do, I know not.—Sir, yours respectfully, C. <hi rend="smallCaps">SMITH</hi>. "</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not know he was gone to France, nor did I furnish him with money to go—he called on the 3rd of May—here is a letter I received on the 6th of May—it is his handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">read.</hi>) "May 6th, 1841. Mr. Moss.—Sir, I must beg most respectfully to have a statement put before me, particularly if any of your friends are to be present at our next meeting to show this and also particu-larly how the sum of money or monies you hold in paper has accumulated, for I presumed neither Mr. Lowry nor the gentleman that was present, nor even Mr. Hickin knows. You must see that the enormous interest you charged makes the amount swell; for instance, take 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—and you have had more than this—We'll take it for 12 months—here is a profit of 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. This is the way I intend to explain, and some of my friends demand of me every particular. I must say, that when I left England, I had not one single sovereign of your money, or was it got in any way by or through your interest. Yours respectully, C, <hi rend="smallCaps">SMITH</hi>. "</p>

                  </hi>. I am a smith, and work along with Evans. I lodge at No. 18, Charles-street, Drury-lane, in the first floor. On the 18th of May we had been out together, and I invited him home to supper—about one o'clock in the morning I beard some one below calling for a light—I told them to come up and take one—the prisoner and another followed the person up who came for the light—they did not speak a word, but began to heat Evans—he fell down, and half a crown and some halfpence fell from his pocket—the prisoner came and offered to give me two penny pieces—I said 1 had seen him pick up a half-crown, which I had—the prisoner said "<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, that is all I picked up"—he knew me by working in the neighbourhood—I told him to give me the half-crown—he said he had not one about him, and had not picked up one—I asked him to let me search him—he would not—I sent my wife for a policeman—Evans was insensible at the time, and could not speak—he was sitting by my bed-side—they blew the candle out twice, and tried to get out, but could not, as I have a curious fastening to my door, co that they could not open it—the policeman came in about ten minutes, and took him into custody—the the prisoner staid in the room all that time—he did not speak—he only kept walking about, and trying to get out at the door—when the policeman came up he had the money in his hand, and offered it to him—it was a half-crown, two shillings, and a half-penny—I believe he offered it to him as won as he came in, but I cannot rightly say—I was looking after my room</p>

               <p>more than after him—he said that was all he had about him—Evans and I had been out together that evening—we left off work at half-past seven—we had been sitting in a public-house, and had three or four pints of stout—I only know the prisoner by seeing him about the streets—Evans and I went into another public-house, and there saw the prisoner—I did not drink with him, nor did I see Evans do so—the place was so full I could not see.</p>

On the 18th of May, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to the shop—I saw her move her hand up to her bosom from under her cloak when the young man who served her had turned to the window—when I had done with the customer I was serving, I went and missed this ribbon—the prisoner was then gone—I went one way and my young man another—he found the prisoner—she dropped this ribbon which is mine, and had been in the box which was put before her—I had seen it five minutes before.</p>

About five o'clock in the evening of the 27th of May, the prisoner came to my shop and took a goblet out of a basket that was standing on the rails—he would have run off, but I caught him with it, and gave him in charge—this is my goblet—he did not say any thing.</p>

On Friday evening, the 21st of May, I was at the White Hart public-house, Drury-lane—there were some persons there, and the prisoner was amongst them—I had never seen him before—we were playing at skittles—a person who went with me pulled off his jacket, and put it by the side of the bench—as he was going to put it on again, he missed his tobacco-box and his knife—there was a disturb<lb/>ance about it, and a young man who was with the prisoner said, "Do you oppose we should go to steal such a thing as a tobacco-box, when we have got so many thousand pounds about us?" and the prisoner then pro<lb/>duced</p>

On the 13th of May I was in attendance at the banking-house—the prisoner came there about a quarter to three o'clock in the afternoon, and presented this cheque—on looking at it I discovered the signature was forged—I asked him who Robert Perks, the person in whose favour it is drawn, was—he said he brought it from the under butler, at the same time handing me this card—he said the person had asked him to get cash for the draft, and to make haste, as the gentleman was going out of "town in the morning; that he received 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and drank a pint of beer with the man, and was to re<lb/>ceive 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on his return—I asked him if he knew the butler—he said he did not know much of him, he had seen him before—he said the under butler had sent him to receive the cheque—suspecting it to be forged, I consulted with the firm as to what steps to take, and a policeman was called in—Mr. Lawrence Palk had an account at our house at that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to James Richmond Smith and Joseph Catkins, of Tottenham-court-road. On the afternoon of the 13th of May the prisoners came into the shop together, and sat down close to the coun<lb/>ter opposite each other, face to face—Smith asked to look at some cambric, which I showed her—she said it was for gentlemen's shirt frills—I told her we usually sold French cambric for that purpose, and it would take three<lb/>eighths of a yard—I served her with half-a-yard, which I cut off—she then asked to see some thread lace edgings—I produced a box of them—they both looked at them—Smith bought four different lengths—while I was winding the piece up I saw Holt take some cards of edging off the coun<lb/>ter,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184106140094"/>
               <p>and place them on her lap—she swept them off the counter on her lap—she did not lift them at all—she covered them over with her shawl and handkerchief—that appeared done deliberately to conceal them—Smith then wished to look at some blonds—I showed her some, and she had three yards—she then wished to look at some ribbons—I sold her a small quantity of ribbon as well—I made a sign to another shopman when I ob<lb/>served what Holt did, for him to watch what she had done—he made a sign to me as if to say he had seen what she had taken—I made a motion for him to come round—he came and told Holt he wished to speak to her—(I had seen the corners of cards of lace as she moved them to her left side)—he said he wished to speak to her, and as she got up the cards fell on the ground—they laid quite close to the edge of the counter when she swept them with her left-hand into her lap—it was not accidentally done—I saw her take them with her hand—they did not fall from her lap—when the young man spoke to her she got up, and moved them up under her shawl by degrees, and they fell from her shawl after she got up—I am certain I saw them in a position requiring her hand to keep them in the place—when charged with taking them, she said her shawl might have touched them, and they have dropped into her lap accidentally—it was impossible to be an accident, I swear—I cannot say whether Smith saw her take them—she had not looked at nor touched the lace that I saw, nor done any thing about it—they both looked at the edging, hut not when she took the card off the counter—I do not think Holt could have taken the lace without Smith being conscious of what she was doing—they were speaking to each other all the time, and facing each other, so that she might have seen what she had done.</p>

                  </hi>. I am secretary to the London and West<lb/>minster Steam-boat Company. Charles William Christie is one of the trustees, and there are others—the prisoner was in the employ of the com<lb/>pany for three seasons—he was to attend at Westminster-pier every morn<lb/>ing, and receive from the chief-receiver small tickets which were put up in a book containing from 400 to 500, and to give each passenger one of them at his station, which was the Old Shades-pier, near London-bridge, on receiving 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and at night he was to account for each ticket which was not left in his book—these tickets enable the persons who receive them to land, and when they land they give them up—a Mr. Brown was employed to settle with all the collectors at night—he was the only person to whom they should account—on the 13th of May a communication was made to me by Tyrrell, who was a check-taker at Hungerford-market pier—it was his duty to receive a ticket from all persons landing there—in consequence of what Tyrrell said to me I communicated with the directors, and I then caused Tyrrell to mark some tickets and supply the prisoner with them from time to time—in consequence of what afterwards transpired I had the prisoner apprehended on the Tuesday week following—I was present when he was taken—he was searched in my presence, and this roll of tickets, screwed up together in a small piece of paper, found on him—he said they were thrown into his box on the Sunday night by the owners of the Old Shades-pier—the owners of the Old Shades-pier have no access to our tickets—neither the prisoner, nor any person employed in a similar capacity, are authorized to issue any ticket which is not in one of these books.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

I am in the employ of the London and West<lb/>minster Steam-boat Company, and have been so since the 21st or 22nd of April—I am stationed at Hungerford station—it is my duty to receive tickets from persons who travel by the boats, and to deliver them up at night to Mr. Brown—I know the prisoner—he was in the Company's ser<lb/>vice</p>

               <p>before me. On Tuesday morning, the 11th of May, the prisoner and I met at the station at Westminster in the ordinary way of business he called me on one side and said he wished to speak to me, which way did I leave Hungerford at night, I being the last person on duty—I told him which way I went home, and he said he should like to meet me at the Swan public-house, at the foot of Westminster-bridge—I agreed to meet him there, and did meet him from half-past nine to ten o'clock—he said to me, "Well, Tyrrell, our wages are very low"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Well, I can tell you how they can be made better"—we walked round Cannon-row, and he wished me to go another way to elude Mr. Brown—we did so, and he said, would I supply him with six dozen of tickets a day, of his issuing from the Shades—I told him, well, I would consider of it—it would require some little consideration—he said, "Well, see what you can do to-morrow—I know what Hungerford is—you can supply some from there"—he said the general thing was to allow the collector 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen, but for every six dozen I could supply him with, he would allow me 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there was nothing more passed between us that night—I endea<lb/>voured to see Mr. Leith on the following day, but could not—I saw him on the Thursday, and I communicated to him what had passed between me and the prisoner—by Mr. Leith's direction, I marked three dozen of tickets on Friday the 14th of May, and supplied the prisoner with them—he did not pay me for them that day—on Saturday the 15th, I supplied him with three dozen more, and he paid me 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the two three dozens; on Sunday the 16th, he had three dozen; on Monday the 17th, four dozen, and I received 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of him; on Tuesday the 18th, he had four dozen, and on Wednesday the 19th, four dozen, for which I did not re<lb/>ceive any thing—those which I gave him on Wednesday the 19th, were rolled up in a round piece of paper—they were all marked and loose—they were tickets which had been collected on Tuesday, the loth—I collected five of those marked tickets at the Hungerford station—these are them—(<hi rend="italic">lookingat them.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What is that book you have in your hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is a list of the tickets collected at Hungerford—I am not aware that there is any thing but dates and numbers in it—I did not keep a minute of the conversation I had with the prisoner—when I first met him that night at the Swan public-house, he took me by the arm, and said our wages were very low, and if I could keep my word, and he thought I was a person he could depend upon, he could tell me how the wages might be made better; and when we got to Parliament-street, he made the proposi-tion—when he said he thought I was to be depended on, I said I was, or something to that effect—I think I am a man to be depended upon—I am as honest in my calling as you are in yours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> So you listened to his proposition, and pretended to be friendly to him, and intended to betray him the moment you had opportunity, did you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the first opportunity I had to give the information I re<lb/>ceived—he said he wished me to supply him with six dozen tickets per day, and for every six dozen he would allow me 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he named no other number to me—he said about six dozen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you never say that his proposition was from four to six dozen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> His proposition was about six dozen—I might say from four to six—I could not swear to that now—he said about six dozen a day—he said 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen was the regular price, but he would give</p>

               <p>me 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for every six dozen—I said I would see, it required some little consideration—I did afterwards say, "Is that all, only 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.?"—he said, "Yes, you know we run all the risks and hazards"—I believe I have not stated that before, because I was not asked the question—I have not invented it—I have worked some time on the Eastern Counties Railway—before that I was in the police for about seven years altogether—I resigned once or twice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> They coaxed you back again, I suppose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—my friends got me back—I left the first time to go to Sir Thomas Forbes Reynolds, as a watchman—I left of my own accord to go there, and after I was not re<lb/>quired at Sir Thomas's any longer, I returned, and Mr. Day gave me a recommendation to go back into the police—I did not resign a second time—I was discharged for getting a drop of drink—I cannot swear how many charges were made against me before the one on which I was dis<lb/>charged—they were chiefly for drinking, I believe—I have been reported for talking to a person on duty—I cannot say how many times I was re<lb/>ported, it was not thirty times, it might have been twenty—I am not positive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I am told you got 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward once, is that true? <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Did lever swear such a thing as that? Why did not you ask if I got 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? I never said so; I do not know what 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward has to do with this business—I never got 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have got a reward for apprehending a person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever say you got it for shooting a man? now swear you did not, if you dare? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, Sir, nor nothing of the kind—the prisoner tried to take me in—I did not intend to trap him—I do not expect to get any promotion or reward for this—if any was offered me I would take it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long were you employed in the police? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Almost seven years, and it is nearly seven years since I left it—I cannot now remember how many charges might have been made against me—they were for drunkenness, or talking on duty, or paltry reports.</p>

I was called in to this man—I found him lying on the stairs, as described: when I raised him up there was about a pint of coagulated blood upon the stairs; I observed a number of bruises and cuts about the head, which were the consequence of one fall; there was an abrasion on the upper part of the head, a contused wound on the left eyebrow, about half an inch in extent, a contusion on the left side of the lower lip; the bones of the nose were fractured, and the nose was driven on one side; those were the principal injuries which I observed, all of which might have happened by a man falling on his face on one stair—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination in the morning; I ex-amined</p>

               <p>the throat, and found the cartilages of the windpipe, which were ossified, driven back towards the neck; the seventh bone of the neck was fractured, driven somewhat forward, and a portion of the body of the spine splintered or chipped off, and held on merely by the surrounding soft parts—in my judgment, those injuries were quite sufficient to cause death—the immediate cause of death was the pressure on the windpipe, producing immediate suffocation, the cartilages being driven together, and no passage left for the air—I have not the least doubt his death was occasioned by this fall.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in a long defence, stated, that the witnesses were abusing her, and her husband was going to speak to them about it; that she laid hold of his frock, to prevent him, when he obstinately pulled himself forward, and fell.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine-merchant, and live in Ryder-court, Leicester-square. On the 5th of June I met the prisoners by Coveot-garden market—they asked me to go with them, I refused, they then asked me to treat them with a glass, which I did—I went out—they followed and asked me to give them another glass at another house, which I did, and went with them to a house, which they took me. to, to a bed-room—there was a bed and a sofa—they asked me to go to bed with them—I said, they might go to bed, I would go on the sofa—I undressed myself on the sofa, I felt my purse in my fob where I had placed it, and went to bed—I had eleven sovereigns and a half in gold in it—I had been three or four minutes in bed speaking to Wellington, when I found Walker searching my purse in my fob—I immediately jumped off the bed, and said, "You have robbed me"—she said, "Oh no, sir"—I took my trowsers and said, "Where is my puree?" and I found it in the other pocket, not where I had put it, with 11 sovereigns and a half-sovereign gone—I was exasperated—when I was in bed I saw Walker searching my pockets—I saw my purse in her hand—she was hastening as much as she could, when I ran to her and told her she was robbing me—I said, if they would not give me back my money immediately I would call the police—they were whispering together at the head of the bed by this time—I again said I would call the police, when Walker handed me two sovereigns, and said, "There is your money, you fool"—I said, "You have nine or ten still, hand them back"—I several times called to the people of the house, and at last an old woman came—I said I had been robbed, and she began to abuse me in every way possible—I dressed myself, went out, and watched at the street-door for some time—at last I met a policeman and told him I had been robbed, and pointed out the house to him—he knocked with his stick at the door and went up stairs with me.</p>

On the 15th of June, about half-past one o'clock at night, I was in the Mall in St. James's Park—I Had my hands in my trowsers pockets—I was going home and met both the prisoners together—they asked where I was going—I took my hands out of my pockets, and pushed them aside, and directly my hands were out, theirs were in, and I missed my money—they undid my trowsers at the same time—I had two half-crowns, one shilling, and a sixpence—I called for a policeman—Grounds stooped down, and said she had the rheumatism in her legs—she came back to Wright, and said, "If you have the man's money why don't you give it to him?"—Grounds was the one that put her hand into my pocket, but both tried to unbutton my trowsers—I had the money in my pocket not a minute before they came up to me.</p>

I was on duty on the 14th of June,—I went to an enclosed ground adjoining the Foreign Office, and saw White there, about half-past eleven or a quarter to twelve o'clock—the leather was hanging from a hole in the window—I went into the Foreign Office, and ascertained that the window had been broken, and the leather removed from where it was deposited—I then went to apprehend White, and on looking for him, saw him, and Diamond with him—this was before the leather had been quite carried off—on taking White into custody, Dia<lb/>mond ran away, which excited my suspicion that he knew something of it—the ground is enclosed by a hoarding six feet high, where some houses have been pulled down—there were two other boys there—Diamond was not inside the hoarding—he saw me take White, and ran away—at the station they were talking together, and Diamond said to White, "You know I was not there when the window was broken," upon which White said he was there with other boys, when they agreed to break the window some time before.</p>

On the 7th of May, I was in Smithfield—I had a horse for sale—the prisoner came to me and asked if I would make an exchange with him—there was a horse brought up just afterwards—he asked me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to boot—I offered him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he afterwards agreed to 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said it was a very good horse, and if I liked to make the exchange, he would—I paid him 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but never got the horse, nor did he have mine, for the horse he showed me was owned by a person named Purser.</p>

I am a manufacturer of paper for hanging rooms, and carry on business in Lowther-arcade, and at Kensington—the prisoner was in my service, in different capacities, for thirteen or fourteen years—he had been originally a journeyman paperhanger—in 1838 he made a proposal to sell paper for me, which I agreed to—I told him I wished to see what he could do before I fixed his wages—he agreed to that—in the mean time I allowed him at the rate of 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he was to find customers, to tell paper<lb/>hanging to, to deliver the goods to the customers, which he was to get from my warehouse, to deliver the accounts, receive the money and deliver it to me—he was to get the accounts from my ware-house—it was the duty of Angero, my book-keeper, to make out the bills of parcels to be delivered to the prisoner, to be delivered to the customers—the prisoner had no business to make out bills in his own name—in 1839 I came to an arrangement to pay him ten per cent.—upon my oath I never arranged with him for a partnership—I was not aware that he claimed any thing like a partnership with me till after I gave him into custody—I had a customer of the name of Loat—I have got my books here—here is an entry from May 1838 to May 1839—part of it is in Angero's handwriting, the other by a clerk I had previous to Angero—if the prisoner had an order from Loat in May, 1838, it was his duty to give the particulars to whoever might be the shopman at the time, to get the goods, and on re<lb/>ceiving them, to write down in a book the date he received them, the name of the party they were for, and to sign his name—he copied this from the order book, which I keep myself—the book kept by the prisoner is the check order book—it agrees with my book—on the 21st of May the pri<lb/>soner appears from his own book to have received thirteen pieces of paper, No, 8887; seven pieces, No. 8771; five pieces, No. 8605; one and a half, No. 8914; twenty-seven, No. 8796; seven, No. 8898; and eight. No. 8893—these are all the entries in my book, and stated by him to be left at Loat's on the 21st—there appear in his own order-book in June, July, August, on to December, and in April and May, 1839, different items received by him down to May 31, 1839—Mr. Loat's account was 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it ap<lb/>pears on the 25th of September, 1838, he paid 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on the 11th of May, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., leaving a balance of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which has not been paid—if the prisoner had received more than that 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it was his duty to have at I once accounted to me for it—I never allowed him to sell goods on his own account—after the 24th of June, 1839, he accounted to me for moneys received from other persons.</p>

               <p>you going to Woolwich?"—I said, "No"—he said, "I thought you were,—they have taken my man Burt into custody for pawning a silver watch, and you know they are good ones, worth six or seven guineas each, for you lent 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on one yourself"—I said, "No," for at that time I did not recollect it, but on looking at my stock at home I found that I had—this is the watch—I have known Hands for years—nothing was said in my. conversation with him about money.</p>

Tobias, 31, Minoriea, London," on them—or "M. Tobias, London"—these have "M. Tobias, Minories" on them—besides, they are jewelled with garnets, ours are rubies, and the works are very much inferior—it will wind up—they are worth 60<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each as they are now—one of ours of a similar quality to what they imitate, would be worth about eleven guineas—on Monday, the 31st of May, the prisoner Hands called at our shop and asked if Mr. Tobias was within—I said he was not—he asked when he would be in—I said it was uncertain, as he was unwell—he asked if I knew any thing about an affair at Woolwich—I said, "What affair?"—he said, "About the watches"—I said, "What watches?"—he said, "Have you a sum<lb/>mons in the house?"—I said I believed there was one—he said it was a hard case for him, for he had purchased six watches at Abraham's coffee-house for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he was not to know whether they were our make or</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coal and potato merchant, and live in Bi-shopsgate-street Without. On the 20th of May I had fourteen sacks of potatoes in ray cart, which I left in Tooley-street for about three minutes, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon—it was a very steady old horse which would stand for eight hours and not move, if a person did not move him—when I returned, my horse, cart, and potatoes were gone—I immediately proceeded over the hill towards London<lb/>bridge, expecting somebody might have moved it—I made inquiries, and found the cart in Maze-pond, and the prisoners unloading the potatoes from my cart into another cart—Connolly was in ray cart, and Driscoll in the other—they had backed their cart to the tail of mine, so that they could get the potatoes from one cart to the other without getting down—I asked what they were doing with my load of potatoes—they both said they were hired to move the potatoes in consequence of my cart being broken down—my cart was not broken—I desired them to move them back into my cart again—they began to do so immediately, and when they had done it they both endea<lb/>oured to escape with their horse and cart—I would not let them go, but sent for the police—there was none near at hand—I was holding the Corse's head, and having no means of detaining both, Driscoll ran away</p>

               <p>for driving it, and gave him some money for some beer—I saw no more of him till last Saturday week, when the policeman took him into custody— in consequence of what I was told, I went to Atchelor's, a horse-slaughterer, which is the next yard past Lansdowne's, on the Sunday following, the 21st, and saw my cow there alive.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable L</hi> 105.) I hare been an officer for some years. On the 17th of May I was on duty in Hooper-street, Lambeth—between eleven and twelve o'clock I was walking towards the Farm House beer-shop there—I had heard there had been a man robbed of his watch there, and was going towards the house to make inquiries—about ten yards before I got to the house I was met by the prisoner Popham, who I saw come from a house of ill-fame opposite—I knew his person—he came up to me and said, "You b—, you shall never reach the house," and instantly struck me a violent blow on the side of the face with his fist—I had offered no violence whatever to him, either in language or act—after be struck me I endeavoured to seize him—he was making his way towards the door of the Farm House—I laid hold of him and struggled with him, in the course of which he knocked my hat off with a life-preserver, which begot out of his left-hand breast pocket—he then made another blow at me, which cut me just above the temple, on the left-side—it was a very heavy blow—it cut my head, and blood followed—I still kept my hold of him—he made another blow at me—I caught the life-preserver with my right-hand, and saved the blow—I continued to struggle with him, and whilst doing so I saw the prisoner M'Phane come from the beer-shop—I knew his person—he drew something from his pocket, and struck me a violent blow on my cheek, just below the temple, which felled me to the ground—it appeared to be another life-preserver—that was whilst I was straggling with Popham—the blow was on the same temple—it tore my cheek and fetched blood—I still had hold of Pophara, and we both fell together—while I was on the ground I received another blow from M'Phane, which took effect on the arm, and made me leave go of Popham—I should say it was with a similar instrument to the one I had taken from Popham—it was not his fist, it was something more heavy—as I was raising myself to get up, I received a blow on the hand from M'Phane—I was then at<lb/>tempting to seize him—Popham had got away from me—the blow cut my finger in two places—he struck me two or three blows on the hand—while endeavouring to secure M'Phane, Donoghue came up—Popham had then got away—M'Phane only was with me—I saw Donoghue come from the beer-shop, while I was on the ground, and he kicked me very violently about</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184106140180"/>
               <p>the body—I was not struggling with M'Phane at that time—I could not lay hold of him, because of the blows on my hand—he was going away at the time Donoghue came up—I did not get hold of M'Phane at all—Donoghue did not make use of any expressions at the time he kicked me—he kicked me several times—I also knew Donoghue's person well—I was exhausted with all this beating, and they all three got away—I was not able to seize Donoghue from the state in which I was—I was on the ground about five minutes after they left me before I was able to help my<lb/>self—I then got assistance from Jones, 141 L, and went with him to the Farm House, where I took Donoghue into custody—he was stand<lb/>ing at the bar when we went in—as soon as he saw me come in he ran into the tap-room, and hid himself behind the door—after securing him I went with Murphy to the lodging of M'Phane, in Short-street—I observed there was a light at the lodging, which was extinguished as we went in—I went into the second-floor front-room, and found M'Phane there in bed—I took him into custody, and told him what I took him for—he said, "I knew I should be <hi rend="italic">nailed</hi> for this—I shall only be fined—if it is 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I can pay it, or if it is 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I can pay it"—I did not myself take Popham—a warrant was lodged for him at another place next day—we found where he was in about a fort<lb/>night, in the City—he has been brought here by Habeas to be tried—here is the life-preserver which I took from Popham—I went to Mr. Wagstaff, the surgeon, and he kept me off duty for five days—I felt very weak—I lost a deal of blood—for seven days after that I was only on reserve duty at the station—I have entirely recovered now.</p>

On the 17th of May, Watmough came to me about half-past one o'clock in the middle of the night—I observed a good deal of blood about his head, a cut on the left-side, and the head and face altogether a good deal bruised—he appeared to have lost a great deal of blood—his cheek was slightly cut—from the appearance he pre<lb/>sented, he had decidedly been much beaten—the cut on the head was very near the temple—I consider it a dangerous spot for a man to receive a blow—I think it a blow very likely to have been inflicted with the life-preserver produced—it was not a sharp cut—I anticipated concussion of the brain—I kept him off duty for five days, and he was seven days only on reserve duty—the reserve duty does not come under my direction—if the blow had been on the temple, it would have been very likely to have deprived him of life.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many persons lodge in your house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are four families—there are no women—I heard Watmough say when he went out just now to speak to the solicitor, that I kept a house of ill<lb/>fame—I have six rooms—I live in the parlour—that is my sleeping room as well—my husband came home about half-past eleven o'clock that night—I cannot say to twenty minutes—he came home before M'Phane was taken, and before he went to bed—not before first let M'Phane in, when I gave him the lucifer and candle—I swear that—a shoemaker and his two children live in the first floor—M'Phane and his wife live in the second floor—he came to me as a married man—I cannot be answerable for it—I cannot tell how he has got his living—his grandfather is a hatter, in Gloucester-street, and he has worked for him—I went there as a reference—he keeps a hatter's shop there—I do nothing for my living—my husband keeps me—he is in the employ of Noble and Rolls, varnish manufacturers, and has worked for them nine years—M'Phane first came home about eleven o'clock or a little after—I have a clock hanging up in my room, so I of course could notice the time—know by the time he came in, and the time I had my supper it could not be more than eleven, or a little after—it was a quarter to eleven when I sat down to have my supper—my clock is always going—I wind it up night and morning—I am confident it was right, because my husband comes home regularly to his meals, and I am obliged to have it hit—he comes home to breakfast at half-past eight, to dinner at one, and to tea about seven, and then he does not go any more to work—I do not know where he had been that night—I did not ask him—I did not look at the clock when M'Phane came in—I did about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards—it was then half-past eleven—I did not go before the Magistrate—I intended to have gone—several of the persons went to speak on my brother's behalf, and I was going to speak for him and M'Thane, but was too late, the case was heard—my brother lives at No. 24, Cheston-street, Cheston-square, very near me—he is not here, nor is my husband—I know the Farm House beer-shop—I have been there for years—I was not there that night—I was there in the morning—I left about six in the evening—I went there I dare say about five, or a little after five, after my brother and sister who were there—it was a little after eleven when M'Phane first came in, and a quarter to twelve when I called him up—the police came about a quarter to one, as near as can be—I stood at the door when he went to the corner of the ditch—the ditch is not five steps from my door—I stood at the door with the door in my hand till he came in—when my brother went by in custody I made a great alarm—I did not particularly call M'Phane—he came running down, hearing my noise, and asked what was the matter—any other of the lodgers might just as well have come down as him—they might well be alarmed, for the police beat my brother so cruelly—the shoemaker on the first floor looked out of the window—no</p>

               <p>one else came down but M'Phane—ray brother did not bleed at all—he complained of his chest, where they beat him, and they rushed him against the posts at my door, and Watmough stated that he was positive my brother was the man that struck him—I heard him say so down at the hall—he said to me, "What have you come down here for?"—I said, "I have come down to see about my brother"—he said "Your brother won't be hurt—I shall not hurt your brother"—I was summoned here by that gentle<lb/>man (the prisoner's attorney) I have seen Popham before, not at my house—I have seen him at my door—he has not been in my room, nor in my house, only at the door—I am quite sure of that—I cannot tell whether he was an acquaintance of M'Phane—he must have been—it was not after me or any one belonging to me that he came—when Popham has been to my door it was after M'Phane he has come—I cannot tell how often he has been there—not three or four times a week—I have not seen him twenty times, nor half twenty—I will not say how many times, but I know he has not been twenty times—I know Donoghue perfectly well in the neighbourhood—he knows M'Phane by sight, but as to being any companion of his or not, that I cannot swear—I nave known Donoghue from his birth pretty well, and I know M'Phane never associates with him—I am confident of that—I do not know M'Phane's associates, but I know Donoghue is not an associate of his—my brother went to school with Donoghue, and when they come home from work they are generally to<lb/>gether—I believe Donoghue has been in custody for felony—I have no doubt about it—I know it perfectly Well—he was brought up a very good steady boy—he ought to have been so—my brother works hard for his living—he has never been in trouble, nor any of our family—I never knew M'Phane before he took my lodging—his wife came after the room—I cannot say how soon it was after M'Phane came that I saw Popham—he was a long time there before I saw Popham—I have not known Popham—he is an entire stranger to me except seeing him at my door—I never saw him at my door before M'Phane came there, nor any where else—I should not have known him from Adam, and I am sure I do not know him.</p>

On the night of the 17th of May, about half-past eleven o'clock, I was up at my window, and saw Watmough coming down Hooper-street, towards my house, talking to three young girls—I told him he would soon be wanted, there being a disturbance at the Farm-house—Watmough replied</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184106140187"/>
               <p>that he was going down to the Farm-house—I saw him go, and followed him—he did not go into the Farm-house, he stood at the door, till the party ran out in the attitude of fighting—the party then waited in the road, and wished to go in again—Watmough pushed them from the door—I was standing with Watmough, watching the parties—the party that ran out rushed right by Watmough, and went into the house again—Watmough went in after him, seized him, and pulled him out—they scuffled across the road, till they got to one of the small houses—Watmough then struck him with his rattle—T did not exactly know that person, I never saw him be<lb/>fore that night—it was neither of the prisoners—the man was dressed in corduroy, or fustian, I do not know which—it was not M'Phane—he was not there—a scuffle ensued, and the man that was struck with the rattle, I believe, knocked off the policeman's hat, as near as I can recollect—they scuffled a few minutes—I was behind Watmough at the time—he called on me—they fell, and I saw the man hitting the policeman with something in his hand—I do not know M'Phane, more than passing up and down the street, I have no intimacy with him—he was not at the spot at all, neither did he strike the policeman; for the party that did so was a great deal taller—there was only one person scuffling—was applied to by Wat-mough to give evidence on the part of the prosecution—I told him the evidence I could give—he said, "I have got the right two, have I not?" I said, "No, you have not"—I said I should speak the truth when I went up to Horsemonger-lane, where he told me I was to go—he told me to prepare myself for Monday—he has not subpœnaed me—he threatened me at Horsemonger-lane, if I appeared here—he took me into a little room, put his finger up, and said, "You had better mind what you are about, or you will get severely punished"—I told him I could not be punished for speaking the truth—that was all he said.</p>

In consequence of the robberies on board the steamers I was induced to watch—on Mon<lb/>day night last I was in ambush, and saw the prisoner pass in a boat be<lb/>longing to the Westminster Pier Company—I followed in about two minutes, and saw the boat lying alongside the <hi rend="italic">Nymph</hi>—I went on board, and hallooed out to the crew—I turned on my light, and saw the prisoner crouching, with his shoes off, close to where the crew were lying—I said, "What are you doing here?"—he said, "I am the fireman"—the crew awoke, the captain said they knew nothing of him—I searched the pri<lb/>soner, and found two silk handkerchiefs, a cotton handkerchief, a knife, a brush, and a purse—I said, "How did you come by these?"—he said, "They all belong to me, I have had them twelve months"—this handker<lb/>chief belongs to the prosecutor.</p>
