               <p>CHARLES HILL sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. On the 11th of September, did any thing happen to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Budd previous to that? - A. I knew his name was Robert, I don't know much of him; we made an agreement, and supped at Mr. William's, the Bayswater coffee-house, and I paid for the supper; when I came out, thirty-five minutes after eight, I looked at my watch, it was a moonlight night; I wished to go along the road home, but he said there were only two fields to go over before we got to <placeName id="t17961026-1-crimeloc3">Paddington</placeName>

               <p>Q. What did he turn it round with? - A.With his hand; after that I jumped over the stile, but with the agony I cried out greatly, and said to him, I am very much obliged to you for what you have done; give me my hat; and he said, damn your eyes I will cut your throat; and he attempted to cut my throat, I don't know what it was with; and having a stiffener in my handkerchief, it did not got through; which you will see by and by, Gentlemen, and the blood flew from my head and face, over his frill, and he went away; and then I went to the Bayswater coffee-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you able to see the countenance of the person that did this? - A. Yes; that tall man Harris, with the flaxen hair.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you quite sure? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there light sufficient to enable you to speak with certainty to his features? - A. Yes; I then went to Dr. Davis's, in Oxford-road; they were taken that night.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see them afterwards? - A. On Thursday, at Bow street, I saw him among a great many other bakers there; and I said that is the man over yonder, I could just see his head.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not in a condition to see him before that? - A. No; I was not; the robbery was on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. This was only moonlight, the light had closed at this time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw a person coming out of the ditch, and Budd, the moment he called out to deliver the money, ran away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I therefore take it you were a great deal frightened by loosing your companion, and the man coming to rob you? - A. I seemed rather alarmed.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did this continue do you think? - A. I cannot justly say to a minute, it might be about four or five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your fright was not lessened by this treatment of the person? - A. My arm was very painful undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say now at Bow-street, that it was a person who had very much the appearance of a gentleman, that robbed you, but that you could not swear that Harris was the man? - A. No, I did not; I said, at Bow-street, that that was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you were positive to him then? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time you were under very considerable alarm that the man attacked you, who did attack you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jackson, for Budd. Q. All that you know of Budd was, that his name was Robert? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And all that you have said is as true as that: How long have you been acquainted with Budd? - A. A few weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. How many? - A. It might be four.</p>
               <p>Q. Not longer? - A. I cannot justly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it six weeks, do you think? - A. I don't think it was so long as that; I dare say it was about four or six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q.And during that four or six weeks, how often might you have been in his company? - A.When my business called me that way, I saw him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179610260004"/>Q.Were you not very frequently together, and very intimate; you know the lad's master is here, and twenty other people? - A. Yes; we used to drink together, but not very frequently; when I used to go up to Paddington, I used to see him, and drink together.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you with him three times a week upon an average, during that six weeks? - A. I believe I might.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go so constantly, that his master chid you, and wanted to know what you wanted? - A. No; I never called upon him but once in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him so often then? - A. I have met with him going out with his bread.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet all that you know about him is, that his name is Robert; I think it has been stated, that you made some appointment upon the Friday before, how you should meet on the Sunday evening? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe it was proposed jocosely between you, that you were to meet under the forfeiture of half-a-crown, or a guinea? - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You proposed to him, that if he did not meet you according to the then appointment, he should forfeit half-a-crown, or a guinea? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the house first proposed to meet at? - A. At the Red-lion, in Oxford-road; I went, but did not find him, and I went again, and he was there.</p>
               <p>Q. You drank there? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you proposed to go to the Yorkshire-stingo? - A. No, Chalk-Farm; but, says he, no; I don't know any thing about going so far as that, says I, then we will go down to Bayswater.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, did not you propose to spend the remainder of the evening at the Yorkshire-stingo? - A. No, it was one evening before.</p>
               <p>Q. But, upon the present occasion, he proposed going to Chalk Farm, and you did not like to go there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, if you had accepted of this man's invitation to go to Chalk-Farm, this scheme could not have taken place? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You proposed going to Bayswater as a nearer place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. YOu called for some supper, and treated the young man? - A. Yes; I paid for it.</p>
               <p>Q. So that all these little invitations, the Yorkshire-stingo, a few days before, and the Red-lion, and all this, and yet all that you knew of him was, that his name was Robert? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How much did you drink? - A. One pot of beer, and I believe, a shillingsworth of punch, and half a pint of wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not it a pint? - A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. You were pretty liberal in pushing the bottle about? - A. I asked him to drink, and he took it.</p>
               <p>Q. The girl did not happen to say, that if you pushed about the liquor so, you would make the boy drunk? - A. She might say I was drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not Jane Smart say, if you pushed about the liquor so, you would make the lad drunk? - A. She might say so, very likely, but I don't remember it.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not venture to swear she did not say so to you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.When you were disposed to depart, you asked this young woman, if it was not a shorter cut over the fields? - A. She came out to the door with Robert; she said to me, you fool, I dare say you know how far it is to Paddington, so often as you go that way.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you ask Jane Smart, if you could go over the fields to Paddington? - A. I would not wish to say any thing but what I know; if I did, it has slipped my memory.</p>
               <p>Q. The lad was tipsey then, was not he, he had been drinking with you all day? - A. No; we did not meet till thirty five minutes past seven.</p>
               <p>Q. And then this other man said, damn your eyes stop? - A. He said, damn your eyes, deliver your money.</p>
               <p>Q. You were extremely frightened? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.By the same rule, your companion might be extremely frightened too? - A. As he left me, I suppose, so I cannot tell any thing about that.</p>
               <p>Q.He was on one side of the stile, and you on the other when you were stopped? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then he took to his heels and ran away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went from the Red-lion in a coach, to Bayswater? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was you that pulled the string, and told the man to go to Bayswater? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Arnold? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you happened to say to him that you did not want to hurt Budd, for Budd had not hurt you? - A. I don't know Mr. Arnold.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, whether you ever said that to anybody? - A.If I was to see the man, I could tell you.</p>
               <p>Q. But have not you said so to any person, that you did not want to hurt Budd, for Budd never hurt you? - A. If I was to see the man, I could tell you.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you ever say so to any body? - A. I might have said so.</p>

               <p>Q. That evening did you see Harris at your house? - A. About a quarter before nine, Harris came to my house and ordered sixpennyworth of rum and water.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he sit down in the tap-room? - A. He was offered a candle to go into a room, but he would not, he sat down at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any conversation take place while you were there? - A. Yes; he had two sixpennyworths of rum and water, and while drinking, he produced a stick, which I claimed to be my stick; he said, there was his fellow-servant, and he must go, and he went off directly; he had called for a third sixpennyworth, but did not stop to drink it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever lent that stick? - A. Yes; to a baker that he was journeyman to, Mr. Bourne, baker, in King's-street, but from the circumstance of his bringing a leg of mutton to be dressed at my house, I recollected it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether they had ever lived together as fellow-servants? - A. Harris told me, he lived at Mr. Hester's; Budd I know nothing at all of.</p>
               <p>Q.What sort of a stick was this? - A. It is here, a painted stick.</p>
               <p>Q. A large or small one? - A. A middling size stick.</p>
               <p>Q. Soon after Harris went out, did the prosecutor, Hill, come back to you? - A. Yes; very much in blood, with his arm broke; upon that I ordered the man to cut his hair off, and wash him with brandy; our people all knew Budd.</p>
               <p>Q.After that, did you go or send any body in pursuit of the person? - A. I sent my waiters, I did not go myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Harris sat down at the bar; he told you where he lived, at Mr. Hester's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the truth, was not it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He paid, of course, for the rum and water that he had? - A. He paid two sixpennyworths.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.That was all he had? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. How many fields are there between Paddington and Bayswater? - A. I believe there may be four or five fields; but there are two or three ways, the way they were going four or five fields.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to the house of Harris's master? - A. Yes; I waited there sometime, and he was not come home; he came home, I suppose, about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you at the time you were there? - A. Three more that went to join me, and one of the constables of Paddington; when he came home he passed through the shop, and came backward with this stick in his hand, and a hat in his hand tied up in a handkerchief; he went through the shop as quick as a dart; it was in the dark, and we went to look after him and found him in the necessary; we found this stick among the wood that was for lighting the oven in the morning; when I found the stick I took Harris by the collar and told him he was my prisoner, upon strong suspicion of robbing a man near Bayswater; and he said, he had not been at Bayswater at all; after we had lodged him at a watch-house, we went back to Mr. Hester's to see if we could find the hat and watch, and we found the hat thrown over a wall; the man is here that found it the next day; we found the watch thrown into a shed among the shavings that were there for the use of the oven; I was present when Baker, the patrol, found them.</p>
               <p>Q.Has Baker got them now? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you present at the apprehension of Budd? - A. Yes, the same night about two o'clock in the morning, at his master's house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any conversation pass between you and Budd? - A. No, no conversation at all; the patroles searched him, but I was not present.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. At the time you took Harris was he in liquor or not? - A. I imagined he had been cheerful.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he appear to be drunk? - A. I cannot say he was drunk; he had been drinking certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. YOu found nothing upon Harris, no watch, or any thing of that kind? - A. We found the watch in the shed.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon their leaving your master's house, did you observe any thing? - A. Yes; the moment Budd and the other went out of the room he snatched the stick from the bar and seemed in great confusion, and went away immediately after them; I am certain he is the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How many persons were in the tap-room at this time? - A. Nobody but themselves and the waiters.</p>
               <p>Q. So that Budd and Hill were eating their suppers together, Harris had his rum and water by himself at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from where Budd and Hill were? - A. As far as from here to the bench.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard Williams claim that as his stick? - A.Yes; and Harris instantly took it up and went away; Hill and Budd had been gone about one minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you near enough to the door to see which way they went? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am an officer; I apprehended the prisoner Budd at his master's house; I told him it was on suspicion of a robbery committed that night; he desired me to let him go up stairs and put on his clothes he had just pulled off; in his box, there was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179610260007"/>some money lying upon the clothes. I searched Harris at the watch-house, after Pole had taken him there, and found upon him a watch belonging to a publican in Oxford-street, a new guinea, and five shillings and threepence-halfpenny; in his coat pocket. I found a handkerchief stained with red wine, I went into the yard and desired Cooke to go up into the shed, and I handed him a candle, and desired him to look about to see if he could find any thing, and I saw him bring out a handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner, Harris, there? - A. No; only I saw some man there, but I don't know who; I and my fellow servant went out with Budd and Hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body follow them the way they were going? - A. No; for Hill went into the field, and I stopped back with Budd several minutes, and there was not a soul went by; we stood five or six minutes, I am sure, at the bridge going out against the green.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure nobody went past? - A. I am sure there was not a soul.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body go out of your bouse nearly about the time that Budd and Hill went out? - A. I saw some man go out at my left hand, when I went out, but I don't know who.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you at the house when this poor fellow Hill came back, so much hurt? - A. I and my fellow servant met him coming back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he describe the person that robbed him? - A. I asked him; he said to me, is the young baker come back, meaning Budd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you by whom he had been robbed? - A. No; he said he did not know; he told me over and over again, he did not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him whether he should know the person? - A. No; but I asked if he knew who had done it, and he said, no; he said the man that did it appeared like a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. You waited upon Hill and Budd? - A. No; a little girl waited upon them, I was sitting in their company and drank with them.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw what liquor they had? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they seem to be drinking pretty freely? - A. They were very good friends; and they had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179610260008"/>a pint of wine and a shilling's worth of punch; Budd drank three glasses one after the other; and I said, Robert, how can you drink so; and he said, then you drink it for me; I said, I don't drink red wine; I said, to oblige him, I would drink it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You and Budd are old acquaintances? - A. I have seen him with bread, I knew his name was Robert.</p>

He said, is the young baker come back; I said, no; he said, he had been robbed of his watch and five guineas; he said over and over again, that he did not know the man that robbed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was there? - A. Mr. Gatefield, at the Crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Mr. Williams there? - A. No; he was at home; this was in the road; me and my fellow servant, and Mr. Gatefield and his sister were there; they had a lighted candle in their hand.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Gurney. I was present when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179610260009"/>Arnold and several others made offers to the prosecutor for Budd; I saw their friends, I think, five different days; I saw them that Hill should not see them; I would not enter into any treaty with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Arnold make any offer? - A.They wished me to come to some terms, as I had a pretty considerable influence over Hill, they wished me to persuade Hill to receive money for him not to appear against the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure Arnold was one of the persons that made an offer? - A. Yes; he was in company at the same time, at the public-house in Red-cross-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What sum was offered? - A. The morning the trial was to have come on last session, a man, in company with Arnold, came and said he would give one hundred guineas; and as Hill might not be able to do his work again, it was likewise in his power to put him into something that might be of service to him during his life.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Arnold appeared to be the friend of Budd? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. You say they and they, which of the theys do you mean? - A. Arnold was one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the precise words that Arnold used? - A. They wanted me to come to some terms.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were they? - A. Mr. Arnold was one; he wished me to come to some treaty.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the words that he used? - A. I cannot tell the words he used, because I told them justice must take place.</p>
               <p>Q. There were five or six people present? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that five or six times during the course of the same day? - A. Yes; some of them; not altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there five or six people present each time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How often did you see Arnold, during that day? - A.Twice, if not three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Now state the positive words that he used to you, and who was by when he used them? - A. There was another man, but his name I don't know: on the Wednesday the trial was to have come on, I met Arnold and another man by accident, near St. Bartholomew's hospital; he wished to see Mr. Hill, and to come to where he lodged, to enter into some treaty with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, upon your oath, he used these words-I want to come into some treaty with him? - A. Yes; that he might do something for him not to appear against the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Arnold again? - A.They were to come to Red-cross-street; they met at the public-house, Mr. Arnold was one, and another of the name of King, I believe; there were five or six in all.</p>
               <p>Q.They were not all friends of Budd? - A. No; some friends of Harris's.</p>
               <p>Q. And some strangers perhaps? - A. No; they were all friends of the two.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Arnold say to you, then? - A. Arnold did not say any thing particular more than the other.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you again, what Arnold said upon that occasion? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you? - A. Yes; but I cannot recollect his words.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it this person talked of giving 100 guineas? - A. He came to me to the Jerusalem coffee-house; I keep the Jerusalem coffee-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come to you alone? - A. Yes; I believe he was Harris's friend.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know, that Arnold is as poor as a church mouse? - A. He may be, there was no money mentioned by Arnold.</p>

One afternoon, I was along with him, and he pawned his jacket; the next day, I called upon him before six o'clock to go to work, we got no work, we went down to Blackwall to see if the Indiamen were working out; we came to Poplar, and had two or three pots of beer, we then came to the Apple-tree, in Wapping, and sat there till dark; a man came in, and asked him to drink, he called for a pint of beer, and put it into the pot we had; I looked at the clock, and told Barlow it was time for me to go, it was half after nine o'clock; we had another pot of beer.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you with the prisoner the night the robbery was committed? - A. I don't know whether it was the night or not, I remember it was the 1st of September; I went into Mr. Wilson's, the sign of the Apple-tree, at Wapping Old-stairs, I called for a pint of beer, and Barlow and another man were sitting together with a pot of beer before them; Barlow asked me to drink with them, I put my pint into their pot, and we sat and drank together.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay there? - A. I looked at the clock when I went in, and it was a quarter after nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Carfrae there? - A. I don't know the other man's name.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to fix on the 1st of September? - A.August was a hard month for work, and as it was the 1st of Sept. I said, I hope God will send some work this month, I was idle that day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay? - A. I cannot say how long, we drank two pots of beer to the best of my knowledge; we staid, I believe, three quarters of an hour, I cannot swear to that.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Dawson.) Do you know the Apple-tree, in Wapping? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from Chamber's-street? - A. About a mile; I went into a house in Rosemary-lane, that night, and saw the prisoner there, with two or three other persons.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Mrs. Clarke.) Q. Whether you fixed on the person after he was taken, or was he pointed out to you? - A. I saw him at Lambeth-street, there were five or six persons, nobody pointed him out to me, I knew him directly, and should if there had been fifty more.</p>

               <p>Q. There was nobody up besides you? - A. Not then; Mr. Eyston came down and went into the place, I followed, and he brought out a box; it was not locked; he looked into it, and there he saw some black silk, which he claimed to be his own; I was sent to call the prisoner down, which I did; when she came down Mr. Crooke and Mr. Eyston asked her to walk into the parlour, I did not go into the parlour; she said, she must go down stairs, and they desired I would go with her.</p>
               <p>Q.To the necessary? - A. She did not go there; she went down stairs; she untied her pockets and gave them to me in a passage below, and in giving me her pockets she put out of her pocket a thread-case, with a pawnbroker's duplicate: I picked it up, and gave it to Kennedy; she asked me to go into that room and take the things that were in a box that was there; I told her I could not touch any thing that was there, and she put her hands together and said, then I am ruined, I am ruined; she went up stairs afterwards, and I did not see her any more for some time; after that I went up into the parlour, and saw her begging Mr. Eyston for pardon; he said, he could not pardon her, the law must take place; and I did not hear any thing more till the officer was going to take her into the coach; I took her cloak, and she begged him not to be too hard with her; and he told her it was not him that could hurt her, it must be those gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This is the place where the bread and cheese is kept in the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. All the different servants in the house go into this place? - A. No; I have gone in.</p>
               <p>Q. You have known it perhaps before, when the key has been left in the door? - A. She never left the key in the door unless she went just by.</p>
               <p>Q. If she happened to be by. she has left the key in the door before? - A. Yes; but not to go out of the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q.When she was asking pardon of Mr. Eyston, you did not hear what he had said first? - A. No.</p>

               <p>The prisoner was my cook and house-keeper; she lived with me about nine months; I placed a considerable confidence in her for a considerable time; but I had reason to suspect her of having taken several articles out of the shop; and I discovered upon her a key which opened my bookcase; that was on Saturday the 16th; when I sent for her down stairs to examine her keys, she at first refused to let me see her keys, and she told me that I should not see them unless I had proper authority; I therefore sent for an officer; but in the mean time she said, I need not send for an officer, that she would let me have her keys; I went up stairs to her bed-room with Mr. Crooke, and she opened her trunk before us, and we did not find<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179610260012"/>any thing in particular in the trunk, but a new cloak trimmed with lace; she was told, I believe, by Mr. Crooke, that was stolen: she said, it was not; Mr. Crooke, I believe, asked her where she had got it; and she said, that her husband bought it for her; I had great reason to suppose her husband did not buy it for her; I cannot swear to that cloak; I after that took her down stairs into the parlour; I told her to produce all her keys, and I found a key that opened my book-case; in my book-case I usually deposited the key of the shop on Sundays, and other keys; and during the conversation in the parlour, she was asked what she had taken.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you then, or any time after, tell her it would be better for her to confess? - A. I am certain I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor did your partner in your presence and hearing? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor that it would be the worse for her if she did not confess? - A.No; early on Saturday morning I went down stairs to see if Mary Baker had got the keys of her, which I had the day before desired her to do, if she could by any means; I went down, and in this room, of which she kept the key, I found the several articles that are specified in the indictment, the officer has them here; several Monday morning we had found that several bundles had been opened, and that led me to suspect her, and she was frequently alone in the house on a Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found these things, you took her into a room? - A. Yes; Mr. Crooke and myself were there, and her; and Mr. Crooke asked her what was the reason of her taking those things; and she said, it was to pay her lodgings, that she had been in some time before; she went down upon her knees and asked my pardon, and hoped that I should be merciful to her; she afterwards said, she was very unwell, and desired to go down stairs; and I desired the servant to follow her, and take her pockets.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What is your partner's name? - A. John Crooke.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any other persons interested in your business? - A. There are not.</p>

               <p>Russell. I know this tallow to be mine; it is a particular kind of tallow that comes from Siberia; and the heads I know to be mine, by the sale mark of the country, and my own mark.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q.Will you say I took that bed without your knowledge? - A. He took the bed while I was out; I did not know any thing at all about it. (They were deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I carried the bed to the Jew, that woman desired me to do the bed, and I told her to do it herself, and I went home with her, and she asked me to take hold of one end, and I the other, and we brought it to Mr. Smith's; I did not know it was a ready furnished lodging, I thought the things were all her own.</p>
               <p>Reading. He could not think any such thing, because he asked me to go and take the room, I was at an acquaintance's house in Hackney-road.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This woman lay upon the bare sacking of the bedstead along with me, and if I had done any thing unlawful, and she had not been privy to it, she would have gone and told Mr. Harlow of it. <rs id="t17961026-9-verdict56" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>I am a bricklayer and builder; I was coming by the office in Marlborough-street, on the 14th of the present month, and I heard there was lead stole; I went into the office, having had lead stole from my premises; I saw Mr. Comber there, whom I knew perfectly well; I was then desired by Mr. Comber, to go and see if the lead matched the premises where it was stole from, in <placeName id="t17961026-11-crimeloc69">Paviour's-yard</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you find, at the office, all the lead that was taken away? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Are you ac<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179610260016"/>quainted with Mr. Watts? - A. Yes. I have been in his company.</p>

               <p>Q. Mr. Watts is not here? - A. I cannot say, I have not seen him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Hearne.) Q. Do you know that these were Mr. Watts's premises? - A. Yes, because I have got men to work upon his premises; Mr. Comber acts as his agent.</p>
               <p>Comber. Mr. Watts was in partnership with me five years, therefore I know his name very well.</p>

               <p>Q.And yet, though you were a stranger, she carried on this traffic as you have described? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were employed by a constable to go to her? - A. Yes; because they were afraid of being known; he went with me and showed me the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You seem to have a little knowledge of this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179610260017"/>business, you talk of five shilling papers? - A. They looked to be so.</p>
               <p>Q. In order to enable you to judge what they were, you must have been pretty well acquainted with that sort of traffic? - A. I saw them lying upon the shelf.</p>
               <p>Q. You must have been pretty well acquainted with that sort of traffic, to have known that they were five shilling papers? - A. I have been in many shops where they wrap up five shilling papers, and they looked like them; I only swear what I thought.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you were never acquainted with the form of five shilling papers before, you take upon you to say, you saw a great many papers in this woman's house? - A. Yes; that looked like them.</p>
               <p>Q. They were open to every body's sight? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, why did you say you had never been an informer? - A. I said, not about hair powder; I did in the lottery, and that was for the good of my King and Country, and so is this; bad money ought to be stopped.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you never give any information for any thing else? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there was such a thing as the glove-tax, don't you? - A. I will take my oath I never did.</p>
               <p>Q.Not upon any other tax but the lottery? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q.Whereabouts were you placed to watch? - A. I had an old bit of a sword, with two edges; I cut a hole in the bushes, and hid myself in the hole, about four or five yards from the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this a very easy place to get at? - A. A very bad place.</p>
               <p>Q.Tell us the whole that you observed? - A. As I was waiting there, I saw the prisoner go along the path the outside of the lane, the man was singing; there were two men with me; after the man was gone by, he went past the hedge where I was, and was going from me; I stooped down; after he passed me, I went up the lane to see if I could see any thing of them, and I saw the prisoner in the field; I told one of the men to go and get his supper, and come at twelve o'clock to relieve me; I went down into the bushes again, and saw the prisoner came back, and go down into the lane; the man looked sharp about him, to see if there was any body in the place.</p>
               <p>Q. By the man you mean the prisoner? - A. Yes; he made a bit of a stoop at the hole, but did not stop; he went up the lane, and went to where the bag was; he took the bag and threw it out, he then went and took it on his shoulder; I then told him he was a dead man, if he went any further; I had a pistol in my hand, and the sword; the prisoner dropped the bag from his shoulder, and turned round and faced me, and asked what he had done; I told him he must go with me to my master; he said for what; he kept looking up and down the lane; I told him he must follow me; I got him to follow me about ten yards, and then he stopped again, and parlied with me, and attempted to close in with me; I told him to keep off, or I would cut him down; he said he was not afraid of me; I said, not I of him; I called Allen, I thought he might be within hearing; he said, I had got no Allen; I said, I had got him, and would take care he should not go away; he then ran from, me; I told him to stop, or I would fire upon him; I attempted to fire, and the pistol slashed in the pan; he kept running on; I told him again I would fire upon him, if he did not stop; I pulled out the other pistol, and fired upon him; he kept on; I told him again I would fire upon him; he then turned round and parlied with me; I followed him till Falkner came up, and then we secured him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Were you present with Falkner when the linen was put down on the ground of your master? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know what was in the bag? - A. No; I saw the things in the bag on Monday, what was in the bag on Tuesday, I know not.</p>
               <p>Q. This cotton was laid down on the Friday, and Falkner did not see it till the Monday? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took it, neither you nor Falkner know?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179610260021"/>- A. I have nothing to do with the things on the ground</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner asked you what he had done? - A. Yes; I said he must go to my master.(The things were produced in Court.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was at a sale, the 13th of September, in Brentford, and laid out to the amount of 22l. 8s. and gave earnest for them; and after the sale was over, having been standing all day, I walked out to see a friend at Hounslow, when I came there he was gone from there; so I went to the next public-house, and asked them if they knew James Miles, that lived there, they said they did, that he was gone to Kingston-upon-Thames; a man said he saw him in a lane, and I went down the lane, and saw this bag, I went and laid hold of the bag, and the man jumped up, and said he would blow my brains out if I stirred; I had a little money in my pocket, thirty-four guineas and a half; I had not paid for the goods; I did not know what the man meant to do to me, I ran away; I thought if he got my money, he would murder me; I ran away, and he being stronger, overpowered me and took me.</p>

               <p>Q. How far from the premises of Mess. Gould? - A. About a quarter of a mile.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there more sugar in the lighter than this? - A. Yes, there was; when they were coming on shore, I insisted upon seeing what they had got, and they said it was scraings; I examined the bag, and found it neat sugars, except about half-a-pound of scrapings mixed with it in the bag; the small bag was nett sugar; Saunders had the large bag, and Phillips the small one; the watchman upon the lighter said, blast you, you have made a better day's work than I have.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Cullen. I am one of the officers belonging to Marlborough-street: On the 29th of September last, myself, and three officers, in consequence of an information, went to a house, No. <placeName id="t17961026-21-crimeloc125">25, the Crescent, Michael's-place, Knightsbridge</placeName>

                        targets="t17961026-21-off123 t17961026-21-crimeloc125"/>; upon getting the street door open, I made my way into the garret, where my information lay, and getting to the garret door, I found it upon the jar, and as I went in, I observed the prisoner, Quinquerry, rising from a seat placed before a table, on which table was an instrument assixed for the purpose of siling blanks of gold; the prisoner, Pratt, stood on the left hand side of him; and in the same room, cluse to Pratt, was the mistress of the house; on the table, where the instrument for siling the blanks was, were two basons containing a quantity of blanks of gold; on another table, in the same room, an instrument was affixed, called an edger, for edging coins; on another table, in the same room, was affixed an instrument called a cutting engine; in the fire-place, there was a furnace with fresh charcoal in it, and upon the top of it a crucible, containing cuttings and droppings of gold ready to be melted; in the cupboard of the same room, a cup, containing a quantity of lesser pieces of blanks of gold; upon the table that the prisoner Quinquerry rose from was a quantity of gold dust and gold silings, scales and weights for weighing gold, and any thing heavier than gold; in the drawer of these scales there was a quantity of alloy; in the other parts of the room there was a great number of files and crucibles, new and old; and, upon the same table as the cutting engine was affixed to, a vice was assixed. I took all three of them into custody, the two men and the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between you and the prisoners? - A. I don't remember any particular conversation.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know whose house this was? - A. The woman said it was her house. There was a circumstance took place between me and the prisoner, Pratt, at the time we were about to take them away; he had not got his hat in that room, and he went down stairs with one of the officers who is here to fetch his hat out of a room below, which he called his bed-room. I conveyed the things I found, and the prisoners, to Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find any dies or instruments that would impress the likeness of the current coin of this kingdom? - A. No; I did not. (Produces the cutting engine, and the instrument mentioned in the indictment).</p>
               <p>Q. That instrument is calculated for cutting out different sizes? - A. Yes; we found cutters of three or four different sizes.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand there are two techinical terms called a dabb and a bolster; explain to the Jury the meaning of those words? - A. There is somebody here that will explain that better than I can.</p>
               <p>Q.Mention the different dimensions you found it calculated for cutting out? - A. Here are two cutters of the size of the smaller pieces that I found.</p>
               <p>Q.Between the smaller and larger, is there any intermediate one? - A. None; here is one that runs larger than any of the blanks we found.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are there any calculated for a guinea or half-guinea? - A. No; there are of a leffer size, and a bigger size. (Produces all the articles that were found in the houses).</p>
               <p>Q. Are all these instruments a complete machinery for cutting out blanks? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Shepherd. Q. That<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179610260025"/>instrument, the cutting-engine, was set when you went into the room? - A. It was fixed.</p>
               <p>Q. What cutter was there to it? - A. The same that is now for the large blanks.</p>
               <p>Q. That is to the size of a joe? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know what a Portuguese coin called a joe is? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q.However, that is set to a large blank? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the edger? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that when you went into the room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that edger set to the large blanks? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That edger was not applicable to any coin of this realm as set? - A. Not to a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Not only in size, but mode of marking? - A. It certainly differs very much.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know what a joe is? - A. I don't know that I ever saw one.</p>

               <p>NICHOLAS CONANT, Esq. sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Fielding. I am in possession here of a quantity of gold found by Hamilton in that room, produced before me when the prisoners were taken into custody; they were sealed up in the presence of the prisoners by myself and Hamilton, and I produce them here as being exactly in the same state as they were so given in (produces of great quantity of blanks, which were hundred to the Jury); as far as they come under my inspection there are but two sizes; the small pieces appear to me, upon the best investigation I can make, to be something less than one-sixth part smaller than a guinea, and the large ones exactly the size of a louis; I suppose there are about four hundred of the large ones; they are considerably heavier than a guinea, and worth about 18s. 3d.</p>
               <p>Hamilton. I also found these two papers, (producing them).</p>
               <p>JOHN JOHNSON sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Fielding. I am affay-master; I have made an assay of some pieces I had from Mr. Parker.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PARKER sworn.</p>
               <p>I took two blanks, one large and one small to Mr. Johnson, I had them from Mr. Powell.</p>
               <p>- POWELL sworn.</p>
               <p>I received these blanks from Mr. Conant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Conant. I gave them to Mr. Powell.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Jackson). What was the value of those tow pieces? - A. I cannot determine the value of them; I determined the quality of the gold, only one is standard, about the value of the current coin of this kingdom, and of the current coin of Portugal guineas, and joes are the same kind of gold exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. It appears to be a mixed metal? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gibbs. Q. Does your assay reduce the weight? - A.Rather.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the value of it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Parker. The large one weighed seven penny weights two grains and the small one, five penny weights one grain; I kept the weight, and delivered Mr. Powell the two blanks.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gibbs. Q. There is a great difference in the weight when they came from the cutter, they had a rough edge which must be filed off, and then they receive the impression? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Conant. The large one was filed at seven penny weight two grains.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gibbt. (To Johnson). Q. Do you know of the traffic of sending out reduced half joes to the West-Indies? - A. I have heard of the practice, but I believe the practice was to reduce the real one.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Look at the cutting engine, how does that work? - A. By the sorce of a screw, with a fly.</p>
               <p>Q.Explain to us the parts of it for cutting blanks? - A. This instrument will cut the blanks of any size, they are what we call the dabb and the bolster.</p>
               <p>Q. How many sizes are there of the bolster? - A. Here are four of them, but they appear to be but two sizes; I have in my pocket a guinea blank, and a half-guinea blank from the Mint, but they don't appear to he intended either for guineas or half guineas, one is much larger than a guinea, and the other smaller, and larger than half-a-guinea.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Might they not be turned into guineas? - A. Yes; by hammering up, and making use of other cutters.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179610260026"/>Q. The engine for cutting the blanks is entire? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Any bolster, or any dabb may apply to that cutting engine? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gibbs. Q. There is no cutting engine here fitted to the blank of a guinea or a half-guinea? - A. No, there is not.</p>
               <p>Q. The cutting engine is not compleat without the cutters? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. And there is no cutter to compleat that cutting engine for the cutting of blanks for guineas or half guineas? - A.None produced.</p>

               <p>Q. It is very unfortunate that such things should happen, but they happen so often as to render you perfectly acquainted with the practice of sending out reduced half-joes to the West-Indies? - A. I have never heard of it.</p>
               <p>Q. The size of these cutters would suit double louis's, I believe? - A. I don't know, unless I tried it.</p>
               <p>Q. All that you know is, that it will not suit the current coin of this kingdom? - A.It will not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find any thing upon her? - A. Yes; she dropped the things directly at my feet; five children's frocks, five cotton frocks, two children's great coats, five linen pin-cloths, a pair of silk stockings, and one diaper table cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these things taken from? - A. Out of the room over the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that room open or shut do you know? - A. Shut and locked; I was the last person that came out of it on the Friday, and was never in it on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose room was it? - A. It was a spare room belonging to the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who keeps the key of that room? - A. The key was on a ledge by the side of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any part of the house-door broke? - A. No; it appeared to have been opened by a key.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first look at the door? - A. About five minutes after she was gone; between three and four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the key of the door where you left it? - A. No; the door was wide open, and the key in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the outer door of the house open so that any body could come up? - Yes; it was upon the latch.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you seen the street-door before? - A. About an hour before; it was then shut upon the latch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her open the latch to come in? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body else in the house been out or gone in after you had seen the door safe? - A. It is an open warehouse; so that I cannot swear to that.</p>
               <p>Q. When you stopped her upon the stairs, what did she say? - A. She said, she was no thief.</p>

               <p>I am a constable: On Tuesday the 11th of October, I was sent for to apprehend the prisoner, and I took this tobacco from him out of his breeches, (producing it); I have kept it ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Haines, Junior. This is the same kind of tobacco that the prisoner was at work upon.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. This tobacco is the service that was given me and my wife; I had saved it up to send down to my brother, a young man that was going that morning to Lincolnshire; I have no other convenience that they should not search me to take it from me; and this man that is swearing against me, is to have five guineas from my master if he can cast me.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Haines.) Did you promise that man any money? - A. Never; but there is a paper stuck up in my warehouse, and has been stuck up these seven years, that whoever should detect another in stealing tobacco out of the warehouse should receive five guineas reward; I have made no promise to any body excepting that.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he lived with you? - A. Five or six months.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any character with him? - A. Yes; we never take any man in without a character;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179610260028"/>but I really cannot say from whom we had him; we did not minute it down in a book.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was this muslin when she first came in? - A. At the other end of the shop; and I brought it to this end of the shop, and laid it on the counter close to her.</p>
               <p>Q. There were other quantities of muslin upon the counter? - A. There were two or three pieces; I cannot possibly say how many.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Flamstone.) Do you know that to be your master's muslin? - A. This is the muslin I missed from the wrapper; it has our private mark upon it in two places.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. You are the shopman of the prosecutor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it? - A.About twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she ever been at your shop before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.She lived in the neighbourhood? - A. Yes; very near.</p>
               <p>Q. You had known her before? - A. Yes; by coming to the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pursue her shortly after she left the shop? - A. Immediately after.</p>
               <p>Q. You had told her in the street that you had missed a piece of muslin? - A. No; I tapped her upon the shoulder, and she came back directly to the shop, and then I told her so.</p>
               <p>Q. She made no resistance? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You searched her, I believe, before the ladies came? - A. No; the ladies searched her; I did not search her at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How many servants do you keep in your shop? - A.Only me and another gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q.He is not here? - A. No; he was gone out to take orders for a suit of mourning.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not either of these ladies above stairs, come down? - A.No; not till the bell rung after I brought her back.</p>
               <p>Q. You sold her a small quantity of muslin? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observation upon her at the time she had this muslin? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any suspicion that she had taken any? - A. I had rather a suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is the proprietor of this house? - A. Mr. Deacon.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is this shop kept by Mr. Deacon? - A.No; Mr. Holmes has it in trust.</p>
               <p>ANN DEACON sworn.</p>
               <p>I came down stairs upon hearing the bell ring; I went into the back-parlour; I was searching her, and did not find it; but I saw some muslin lying behind her at her heels.</p>
               <p>Q.Should you know the muslin again? - A. I am not accustomed to serve in the shop, so that I do not know the muslin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether there was any muslin in the back-parlour before you and she went in? - A. I did not observe; I did not see any.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, there is no other witness upon the indictment, and this being a capital offence you ought to be strict in the evidence; there appears to me no evidence to leave to you in this case, for here is nobody to prove that this is the same muslin that was found by Mrs. Deacon; even supposing the prisoner to have dropped it,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179610260029"/>yet still Mrs. Deacon cannot swear to this muslin; therefore it seems to me you must acquit her.</p>

               <p>I live in Southampton-row, Bloomsbury: On the 29th of September, I lost some lead from the top of a house of mine; Mr. Burton called upon me, and told me he was sure there was somebody there; I went and listened with him, and was convinced there was somebody at the top of some of the houses in <placeName id="t17961026-25-crimeloc146">Southampton-terrace</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was it dark? - A. Quite; it was a very dark night; we went up on the inside with the only ladder there was; when we got to the top of the second or third house, we found the gutters rolled up and tied in a bag, and lying there; in consequence of which we endeavoured to find out the man; we searched from house to house, and after two hours had esapsed we found the prisoner standing in the two pair of stairs, in the house adjoining to that where the lead was cut up; we found him in a very perilous situation, over a well forty feet beneath him; he had his shoes off, and tucked inside of his jacket; it was impossible for any body to have got into the house in which he was found, he must have got in at the top through a trap-door; the bottom was perfectly inclosed; there was likewise found two knives upon him, which had every appearance of cutting the lead, for they were bent.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this lead upon your premises? - A. Yes; and it was laid down and matched exactly to the gutter, (the lead produced); it has been in my possession ever since.</p>

               <p>As I was passing by some houses at the end of Southampton-row, called Southampton-terrace, that are unfinished, I heard somebody at work upon the top of the houses, cutting lead; I applied to the prosecutor, and after preventing every possible escape, we traced the premises, and found part of the guiters cut up; the lead which was found in the gutter, upon being matched to the gutter, exactly corresponded; being perfectly satisfied that the person could not escape from the premises, we went on till we found the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any account at all how he came there? - A. Before the constable of the night, when he was taken to the watch-house, he said, he had got over a house, inclosed at the bottom, and that he had got over the top of a door-way to get into that house, which was next to where the lead was cut from; he said, he had got in there to take a night's lodging, that he had no other place; there was no other possible means of getting into this house, but by getting over that door-way, or a doorway at the top of the house, which communicates with where the lead had been cut up; this is the same lead, it has my mark upon it.</p>
               <p>CHARLES HARRINGTON sworn.</p>
               <p>I heard an alarm at the top of Mr. Scrimshaw's house, and assisted in the search; a boy that was present, said, he heard him in this house; I gave the alarm to Mr. Burton, and he was found there, we could hear him plainly walking across the joists; we found upon him these two knives, (produces them).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been trying to get into St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and St. Thomas's, and I could not; I had not a farthing to help myself; I could not pay for a bed, and I got in to sleep there; I had just come up from Portsmouth; I had a bad leg from a hurt I got on board a man of war; I know nothing at all of the lead.</p>

               <p>I am an officer, belonging to Lambeth-street, Whitechapel: On Saturday, the 15th of this month, in company with Dawson, I apprehended the prisoner, in King-street, Tower-hill; he had this firkin of butter upon his head, (producing it); it was about seven in the evening; I saw him going into a shop that was a notorious shop for receiving stolen goods; the man of the shop was standing at the door, and I believe had seen me; and he would not let him come in; I then apprehended him, having no doubt it was stolen property; I asked him where he brought it from, and he said, from Newgate-street, he was going to carry it to Mr. Wilson, in Ratcliffe-highway; I asked him if he had no bill of parcel or direction, and not producing any, I had no doubt it was stolen property; I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179610260031"/>among the butter merchants, and found, it out by the mark.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my sirkin, it has my own mark upon it; it had been missing some time at the wharf; the other sirkin I never found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been carrying a load for a gentleman in the market, and going towards home a gentleman stood by the corner of Magpye-alley, in Newgate-street, with this rub; and he said, porter, do you want a load, I told him, yes; says he, you have got to carry this to Ratcliff-highway; he told me he would give me eighteen pence; I asked him for a note, and he said I had no occasion for a note, for, says he, I shall walk along with you; and coming along Cheapside, I saw him close behind me, and I saw him behind me in the Minories; and when I came to cross the way on Tower-hill, this gentleman came up to me, and asked me where I was going; I told him I was going to Mr. Wilson's, in Ratcliff-highway; and I looked about for the gentleman, and he was gone: I have worked fourteen years about the market and the water-side, and nobody could ever give me a bad character.</p>

            , and Henry Meyrick Hoare; I have known the prisoner many years, I remember his coming the 23d of July, about four in the afternoon, and presenting a draft, for which I paid him a 500l. a 300l. and a 50l. note; he said, the 50l. note was too large for him, as he, or Mr. Bray, were going to travel that night, and it would be difficult to change it on the road, I changed it for five tens; upon which he went away.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that the whole of the conversation at that time? - A. It was; I never saw him again till he was in custody. At the time of his examination, I lamented that I was so unfortunate as to appear against him, as I knew him so well; he said it was unfortunate, but he was changed in his mind, or he should not have done it; he told me some particulars at the time, that passed, which I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Bray keeps money at your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose account was this charged to? - A.Messrs. Hoares; they have paid it. (Produces the draft). There is my writing upon it. (It is read).</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes; I have known him about seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that draft, is that your hand-writing? - A. This is not my hand-writing, nor was it given by my order or consent, it is an imitation; I have not seen him since the 23d of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go away with your knowledge? - A. No; the 23d of July was Saturday, I expected to find him at the office; I received a note that he was going to see a friend, and begged leave of absence; I afterwards heard he was in Dublin, I received a letter from him on the 9th of August.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. This man was in your service? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He behaved himself extremely well? - A. Yes; he had a very good character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Willoughby.) Q. Supposing this to be a forged draft, and you paid it, are you not liable to reimburse the money to Messrs. Hoare? - A. We do not consider ourselves in that situation? - A. We do not consider ourselves in that situation; I don't conceive myself liable to any thing except a fraud upon the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my defence to my Counsel; I have some witnesses attending; I wrote a letter to Mr. Bray in Dublin, desiring him to settle affairs, and waited ten days in Dublin for his answer. I did it in a paroxysm of madness, and was willing to make any atonement.</p>

               <p>Q. I concluded that you were not sober at this time? - A. I was far from drunk, I had had two sixpennyworths of rum and water, and a shillingsworth of punch, with Mr. Edmunds, in Compton-street.</p>

Yes; after that I laid hold of him by the collar, and he dragged me about for the space of a quarter of an hour, and beat me and called upon the soldiers to rescue him away; I suppose fifty soldiers came round him; I was determined to hold him fast.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did they rescue him? - A. Not at that time; I got the assistance of Mr. Green and Mr. Wells, and gave charge of him to them, for stealing the starch, and lent a hand to get him into a cart; and then I left the constables to take care of him, and went back to take care of the starch.</p>
               <p>Q. When you examined the starch, how much was there missing? - A. About 8 or 10lb.</p>
               <p>Q. Who does the starch belong to? - A. I do not know the persons it belongs to; about ten minutes after he was put in the cart, I heard that he had been rescued; he came down with the other soldiers to the quays, with a baker's scraper, and asked for me and the constable, and said, if he could get hold of that sat headed bugger, he would kill him; and I ran away; afterwards he was secured, and I appeared against him.</p>

On the 19th of September, in consequence of having lost a considerable quantity of gold, I suspected the prisoner; I gave him an ounce of gold to make nine rings; I watched him very close, and saw him make ten instead of nine; I saw him take the tenth and slide it under the skin that catches the silings, and, I suppose, he put it in his breeches; in the evening, after the usual hour of work, he wished me a good night; I called him back into the shop, and told him I suspected he had robbed me; he said nothing, but sprung towards his place where he worked, and I prevented him, and told him he should clear himself from the imputation before he went near his place again; he was silent several minutes; I told him it was in vain to deny it, I was confident he had robbed me; he put his hand to his breeches-pocket and brought this ring out;(producing it); he put it into my hand; I desired the rest of the men in the shop to taken notice of the ring he had given me out of his pocket, and then I sealed it up in the presence of an officer, and delivered it to him; he was taken to the Compter, and I got a search-warrant to search his house; I went next morning with the officer and two or three men, to search his apartment, and we found, in a dark corner of the garret, in a tin box put within a deal box, the gold property mentioned in the indictment, and some bars of iron that belonged to me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you know Messrs. Thomas and Evans? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do they live? - A. in Staining-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. You are their foreman? - A. I carry on business in their house, but on my own account.</p>
               <p>Q. They are goldsmiths and enamellers? - A. No; they are merchants.</p>
               <p>Q. Dealing in these articles? - A. Yes, and others they assign me an apartment in their house<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179610260037"/>to carry on the gold business; I employ men and discharge them when I please; they buy the goods of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you responsible to them for the gold and property these men work upon? - A. No; I find the materials, and they have no concern in any thing but what I sell to them.</p>
               <p>Q. This bit of wire was to make ten rings? - A. No; nine.</p>
               <p>Q. It often happens that you make an extra ring to make up for the loss in making rings? - A. I never knew any such circumstance.</p>
               <p>Q. The ring was not finished? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not he often finish work at home? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He takes in work for himself, does not he? - A. Not that I know of; if I knew he did, I would not keep him. I will explain myself: when I say so, he does not do work at home for me; he has a large lathe at home that turns iron and steel; he has turned iron and steel, but nothing in the gold line.</p>

On the 19th of September, the prisoner had done his work and gone outside of the shop-door, the prosecutor called him back, and told him he had a strong suspicion he had some gold in his pocket; the prisoner made no answer, but seemed very much confused; he wanted to go towards his place, the prosecutor desired him to stand back; in about four or five minutes afterwards, the prisoner put his right-hand in his breeches-pocket and pulled a split ring out, he then put it into the prosecutor's hand; the prosecutor held it up, and desired the people in the shop to take notice that that was what the prisoner put in his hand; it was then given to a Mr. Hench, in the shop, to put a mark upon it, that he might know it again; it was then given to me, and I did the same. The prosecutor told him he had lost things of that kind before, and he had a great mind to get a search-warrant to search his house; he went next morning to the Police-office in Hatton-Garden, and got one; I went to his house, and found some split rings in his house, the constable has them.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I have some gold which I received from the prosecutor, I don't know what it is, it was delivered to me sealed up. (produces it).</p>
               <p>Q.(To the Prosecutor.) Is that what they call a split ring? - A. Yes; it was taken from the prisoner; I did not mark it, but I saw the other witness mark it.</p>
               <p>Balley. This has my mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This gold ring I know to be my property, because I made it myself about a week before, and I am confident of my own work.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. This is the ring that you took from him, and gave to the constable unfinished? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't mean to say that is a ring, or can be sold for a ring? - A. No; it could not be sold for a ring, it is a round twisted wire, which is always called a ring.</p>
               <p>Q. A ring, I take it, is either for the purpose of wearing upon the finger, or keeping some link within it? - A.Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say it is a ring then? - A. It is what is always called a ring.</p>
               <p>Q.Till it is bent you call it wire? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe none of the edges of that come in contact with each other? - A. No; they don't at present.</p>
               <p>Jury. We look upon it as a piece of unfinished gold wire.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Balley.) Look at that piece of wire, what do you call it - Do you call it, before it is made up, a ring? - A. Yes; it is turned up for a split ring.</p>
               <p>Q. As it is, it is not a split ring? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Now look at the gold ring; did you find that at his house? - A. That is my own making; it is a wearing finger ring. I know it as well as my own hand-writing, or better.</p>
               <p>Q. There are other gold split rings, are they in the same state as the other? - A. No; they are in a more forward state; one of them is in a state sit for a customer, it only wants brightening; it was made in my die; (produces it); I am certain it is my making; it weighs one ounce, fourteen pennyweights, eight grains.</p>
               <p>Q.Now there is an in got of gold, can you swear to that? - A. I verily believe it to be mine, as much as I believe any thing to be, but I cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179610260038"/>Q.Then there is an iron triangular bar, how do you know that to be your's? - A. Because I gave the prisoner the wooden model to get one of the iron bars cast from, for an engine which I have in Court, one had been delivered to me which is complete, and made into an engine; in searching his house we found these things.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it ever in your possession? - A. No, never; he confessed that he had had two made instead of one, and made me pay for two.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a brass cylinder piece, were you robbed of that? - A.Only in this way: that when he went to get any cases at the brass-founders, he always got two, and made me pay for two.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.Then you mean to charge him with stealing things that never were in your possession, and never belonged to you? - A. No; I don't charge him with having taken it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that that die is not the prisoner's? - A. No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never borrow any tools of him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he never work in your shop with his tools? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there not thousands of dies of this size? - A. I believe it is not possible, any more than coin dies.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that coin dies are of the same size? - A. I thought it impossible to make two alike.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any mark upon the other ring? - A. It has a mark upon it, by accident, the folder rather bolstered, and occasioned a number of little marks in it; I endeavoured to file them out, and they would not come out, from that circumstance, I was obliged to make another ring, and I said this ring by upon the board, and when I came to look for it the day after, I could not find it.</p>
               <p>Q. These accidents in making rings frequently happen don't they? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no private mark upon it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.This man, himself, I believe, has worked a great deal at home, has not he, upon his own account? - A. If I had known he had worked a single little at home for himself, I would not have kept him.(The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel.)</p>

               <p>Q. These were produced by the prisoner's direction? - A.

               <p>Q. Did you find any thing upon her? - A. No; then we sent for a constable, and Kennedy came and searched her, but before that time Hutchins slung the print which was in her cloak, on to the counter, but I did not see her do that myself; the print was given to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the colour of it? - A. A dark ground with a little sprig upon it.</p>

               <p>Q. How came it to fall? - A. I cannot tell; I was on the other side of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she near enough to have pulled it out when you saw her pick it up? - A. She was close enough to it to pull it off; and then I went into the shop and told the gentleman of the shop of it; I don't know any thing about the other woman, she was standing looking at a shawl at the door; she was not high the other woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her brought back? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Were they both liable to pay the whole? - A. No, neither of them to pay the whole.</p>
               <p>Court. Then, Gentlemen, you must acquit this prisoner, because the indictment should charge a contract made by the party, but the witness states, that they were each liable to pay half, but they should both have been liable to the whole; it appears to me, that under these circumstances, they were separate tenants, they were not joint tenants, each liable for the whole, and that therefore, the prisoner ought to be acquitted.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know it was his apartment? - A. It was an apartment in my house that I gave him to live in, it is over the shop where the seal was taken from.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the apartment did you find this seal? - A. In his bureau or drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that bureau locked? - A. I believe it was, I was by the officer at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any property besides this seal? - A. No; it is impossible I can tell when I do lose property, I have several shops.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know this seal to be your's? - A. It is made by the same man that makes gold seals for me, it was the same pattern, and he produced it, and acknowledged it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago was this? - A.It might be three weeks or a month ago, I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he made this acknowledgement, had you said, it would be better for him or worse, if he did not make such acknowledgement? - A. Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did not you tell him, in case he satisfied you about this, that you would not prosecute him, but permit him to go to sea? - A. Most assuredly not, nor any body else to my knowledge, his wife begged that he might go to sea, he acknowledged to have taken it, and he was very sorry for it.</p>
               <p>Q. This man is a young man, and has a very young wife? - A. Yes; he has been married, I believe, two or three years.</p>

It<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179610260042"/>was; I went the next morning between six and seven, and found the King and the Four Brothers adrift; I immediately went on board the King barge to see if the headfast was safe, I found it was cut; I went home and got my breakfast, and enquired of a man what barge it was that lay along side the night before, and I found it was Richard Johnson's; I went after the barge, and met with her taking in coals on board a ship at Ratcliffe-cross; I went on board the barge, and looked down in his cabin; I asked him if he had seen any thing of the barges, and he said, he had left them safe, that he did not cut them adrift; he told me I should not search his barge till I had a warrant, and I went and informed Mr. Richardson, and left a boy on board; and when I came back, going into Johnson's barge, I saw the headfast lying under his hatches, which he pulled out himself, and said, that is not your rope, it is the rope I bought, and gave 18d. for it; he bought it of a purl-man.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the value of it? - A. Before it was cut, about 5s. it is not worth above 18d. now; then Mr. Richardson and Mr. Cooke came up, and he told Mr. Cooke he had bought it of a purl-man.</p>
               <p>Q. What is a purl-man? - A. A man that sells purl and beer about; and Mr. Cooke took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the headfast that belonged to the King? - A. Yes; and that is the property of Mr. Richardson.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you made any particular examination of this rope before hand? - A. Yes; part of the rope was left upon the barge.</p>
               <p>Q. But are not all the barge ropes much of the same sort? - A. Some are thicker, and some laid in a different form; some hawser laid, and some shrowd laid.</p>
               <p>Q. All that you can say, is, that it is the same sort of rope? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there not thousands of barges in the river, with the same sort of rope? - A. Yes; for I have got five.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you compare the two? - A. Yes; and they fitted.</p>

               <p>I am a police-officer: In consequence of a search-warrant, I went with Mr. Richardson, on board the prisoner's barge, the rope was then on deck; I told the prisoner I came on board to search for a headfast; he said, there was a headfast, and he had bought it of a purl-man; I asked him if he knew his name, he said, no; if he had, he should not have bought it; and then I took him before a Magistrate, and there he said the purlman had picked it up in the mud.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mud about it? - A. No; there was water, but no mud. (The rope produced.)</p>
               <p>Barlow. This is the rope, and this is what was left upon the barge; they correspond exactly.</p>
               <p>CHRISTOPHER RICHARDSON, junior, sworn.</p>
               <p>I went to Ratcliffe-cross, after I had got a warrant, with Cooke, to the prisoner's barge; this headfast was the property of my father and myself; Barlow is our labourer.(The prisoner put in a written defence, which was read, as follows:)</p>
               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I stand here, indicted for robbing the prosecutor's barge of a rope, value 1s. 6d. It is a customary thing for the bum-boats on the Thames, to supply the river with purl; I was in my boat, the purl-man asked me if I would purchase a rope, which is the rope specified in the indictment; I told him I had no objection, provided he shewed it me; he produced the rope, and asked me half a crown for it, I told him, 1s. 6d. and a pot of purl was the worth of it, and he took it; it is true my barge laid next to the prosecutor's barges, and the next day he came on board my barge, and saw the rope, which he said was his property; I knew myself innocent, I refused him taking away the article that I had bought and honestly paid for; had I been guilty of this offence, I had time enough to make away with the rope after the prosecutor had seen it. I am now certain that the prosecutor has no idea that I stole the rope; I know myself innocent of the charge.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the Prosecutor.) Do you know any thing of this man? - A. I never heard any thing to his advantage; I have heard a great deal to his disadvantage.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Here is a little boy that saw me buy the rope.</p>
               <p>A little Boy called. Q. What is your age? - A.Thirteen.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the nature of an oath? - A. No.(The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a waterman; I was on board the ship Burton on the 13th of October; the prisoner was a lumper, I saw him come out of the ship about six o'clock in the evening, which is the time the lumpers usually leave work; there was a lighter, named the Lucretia, between the ships, she was loaded with logwood; the lighter was discharging her cargo at the time; I saw the prisoner stand in the lighter and hand some of the logwood to the other lumpers, into a boat that was lying by, and then he came into the boat, and stood in the fore-part of the boat, along with the logwood. I then boarded the boat, I was in a boat of my own, I took hold of him, and found he had sugar concealed, and I desired Hill to take him into custody; Hill searched him, and took the bag of sugar from him in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of logwood was there in the boat? - A. Six pieces; these are the same; the prisoner was rather obstreperous, and got into their boat again, and one of the lumpers said, let us heave it over-board; I took the cutlass and struck him on the back with it, and made him go back in to our boat; he offered me a guinea to let him go.</p>

On Saturday, the 15th of this month, I was drinking with the two prisoners at a public-house close to Whitehall; I had an acquaintance with me that knew them, and treated them; and this man said, if I would stand the value of about a pot of beer he would pay me again, and I did, it might be about eleven o'clock in the morning, and we kept company together till near five or six in the evening, and then I wished to go home to my apartments, and I paid for two pots of beer in Great Queen-street, and had change for a guinea, and they told me they knew of a decent place where there were two beds, and I might sleep comfortably, just by; I refused it, and after they saw me get change for this guinea, they told me I should not go, but should stop with them, and they insisted I should go with them, and I should be taken good care of; and one took me by one arm, and the other by the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you drunk at this time? - A. I was not drunk at all, I might be rather the worse for liquor; they took me from thence to another house, and Stopford went to see for the lodgings; Stopford came in very soon after, and said he had got the lodgings, and then he desired me to pay for what we had had, and we would go to bed, and I paid for two pots of hot; I went with them, and a woman stood at the door with a light in her hand, and I was to sleep with one of them, and my acquaintance with the other, his name was Hancock, and then she lit Stopford and me into a little back room, and she went away; I undressed expecting Stopford to do the same, I fixed my breeches under the pillow, and Stopford says, damn you, you bugger, I have done you, have I, and ran down stairs as fast as he could, and then Lavery followed him down as fast as he could, I could see him between the two doors; then I threw up the sash to call the watch; a woman immediately, from the next room, called out, you bloody bugger, what do you do there, do you want to rob the house, how came you there; after this, the woman came in and threw my clothes into the passage, and said, if I did not get out directly she would throw my bloody melt down the stairs; finding myself in that state, I was glad to take my clothes in my hand, and go down stairs; when I got into the street, I called the watch. I lost out of my breeches-pocket, a guinea and a half in gold, eight shillings and sixpence in silver, my pocket-book, and my deputation belonging the Custom-house, and my new hat, which cost me half-a-guinea a few days before; when the watchman came, Lavery brought me the breeches, and said, here, take these, damn you, and don't say you were robbed here, or I will kick you up and down the street; the money was not in the breeches; the watchman asked me what was the matter; I told him I was robbed; Lavery came up, and I insisted upon the watchman taking charge of him, which he did, and took him to St. Giles's watch-house; and the other was taken up on the Thursday following.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Lavery. Q. Was it not your own proposal to go for a lodging? - A. No, it was not; I begged to go home, but when he saw me get change I could not get rid of him.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HENRY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman, I apprehended Lavery; I was calling the hour of mine, I found the prosecutor partly naked.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179610260045"/>Q. Did you see Lavery give him the breeches? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Lavery. Q.Did not I go quietly to the watch-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not I searched? - A. Yes; and nothing found upon him but two sixpences.</p>
               <p>Stopford's defence. As I was going off guard, I met with this man and his comrade, and my comrade drinking together, and they asked me to drink with them, and we drank five pots, and we went to several houses, and had three or four pots a piece; he wished to have a lodging, and I got one, and when they saw it was four men, they would not let us sleep there, but said, their beds were for men and women, and they turned us out, and used us very ill, I did not take his things.</p>
               <p>Lavery's defence. I was never in the room with the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. You heard the keys fall? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They did not make any great noise, but such as if a man was going along and these keys were lying on the ground, as if he had kicked against them? - A. They were not upon the ground; they fell into a utensil about four feet from the ground, and six inches deep.</p>

Mr. Pearce told him, after the constable came, he could not-do any thing in it, but it would be better for him to confess it before he came; and I saw him pull out of his breeches pocket a five shilling paper of halfpence, (produces it.)</p>
               <p>Sweet. This is one of the papers that I had marked; the piece sits in, and the number too; I swear this is one of the papers I marked.</p>
               <p>Q. You pay your workmen some halfpence and some silver? - A. Yes; according as their pay is; I used to pay them about seven shillings in halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. It is no great wonder therefore that any man should have five shilling or six shillings worth of halfpence? - A. No; but it was odd he should have those that had never been in circulation; it was marked by me for the purpose of detection.</p>
