            . The prisoner came to my house with her master and mistress, and out of my kitchen she took 2 table spoons; she confess'd it to the Alderman who committed her. The Monday after she stole them, she went to dispose of them in Bishopsgate-street at Mr. King's, there one of them was stopp'd. She confess'd she broke the handle off the other, and flung it down a cellar window in Whitechapel, where I went and found it. Mrs. King confirmed the stopping the spoon at her House.</p>

The prisoner at the bar was in Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174904110003"/> Knott's house, they charged me with her. I took her into the watch-house; she confess'd to me that she had pawned two shifts and an apron in Swallow street; I went there along with her, there the things were delivered to me, which the Major has sworn belonged to his daughter. After that I went to Mr. Brown's, where I had several other things, which he can inform the court of.</p>
               <p>Nathanael Brown. Upon hearing the Major had been robb'd, I had a suspicion of the servant's being the thief. I sent to know if they missed any spoons, which they did; then I examined my book, and sent over to know if the other things, brought by the prisoner, belonged to him. There were parcels brought at several times; there was an apron, a tea spoon , 2 clouts, 2 napkins , one apron, one neckcloth, which she confess'd belonged to the Major.</p>

               <p>Joha Delaport . On Tuesday the 4th of April, about eight o'clock in the evening, as I was returning from Cambridge alone, coming by the lower road , Islington, almost opposite Cambray House , I was going a trott, I overtook an ill-looking fellow on foot on my right hand, with a very large stick in his hand; I clapp'd spurs to my horse; I perceived him to make after me, and heard him say some word, which I took to be stop. I was a little surprized. I saw two other men about 40 yards before me, one on my right hand and the other on my left. As I came near them, they ran directly towards my horse; he on my right hand had a cutlass, the other a pistol, which he snapp'd and bid me stop. My horse went from under me and I fell into a ditch; they pulled me out, one of them demanded my money. I gave him my silver, which was about four or five shillings , and a little canvas bag with some French sixpences; they asked me for my watch, which I delivered them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a silver or gold case?</p>
               <p>Delaport . Gold, my Lord. In the interim, there came up a man on horseback; and in hopes it might be some honest countryman, I cried out, For God's sake don't murder me. Immediately he on horseback came up with a great club in his hand, and swore he would beat my brains out if I spoke another word, or did not immediately go over into the field. [ This by their own confession was Murphy on my horse] They all three took me about 40 yards into the field , that is, the two that pull'd me out of the ditch , and the other I first overtook, who was got up to them by that time they had took me to the middle of the road. Murphy was not in the field. They then examined me more closely, and in a little private pocket they took out two rings, one was gold set with diamonds , the other gold, with a picture of the Prince of Wales. They also took a pair of silver wrought buckles ; then they tore off my spurs, one of which I found the next morning; it is amazing how genteely they took it. [the leather was torn off at one end, and the silver spur much bent.] They took a pair of gold buttons out of my sleeves , a handkerchief, a cravat from my neck, then they made me take of my coat, and underneath they took away my green velvet waistcoat, my hanger, my wig, and a silver laced hat; they helped me on with my great coat afterwards. At this time there were two men riding by, I once had thoughts to call out, but Murphy in his confession says, it was a gentleman's servant and himself, he being on my horse, and fearing I should meet with assistance, he rode along with him. Then they made me set down on the grass, and tied both my hands, and forced one of my feet through. There they left me sitting, and told me, if I removed from thence till they returned, they would murder me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you continue there?</p>
               <p>Delaport. About a quarter of an hour, till I was afraid of endangering my health. When I got up, my breeches was unbuttoned, but I made shift to get to Islington, then I was safe.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to hear of your things again?</p>
               <p>Delaport . I have been very industrious in advertising, upon which there came a Jew to me with a hanger and belt, which he supposed to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the hanger yours?</p>
               <p>Delaport. It was, my lord; I went to the Poultry-Compter where the Prisoner Lee was, he was in a little place. I desired him to come out; he said he new nothing of me, and would not; I had intelligence he lived in a court in Petticoat-lane, I got a search-warrant and took two or three of my servants with me, and we found an Irishman and a girl; I, seeing the man strive to avoid us, ran and seized him by the collar, the girl I found to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174904110004"/> be niece to the prisoner Lee, I desired her to deliver the key of the door, which she did after some threats. The first thing I found was my own wig in a box; then I found some powder-horns , and several implements for making bullets; we went down into the cellar where we found two pistols loaded and a hanger, the girl proposed to give us all the intelligence she could; she said one that was not yet taken had play'd at rob thief with the rest; I then return'd to Lee who was in the Counter; I ask'd if he knew James Wood, and if he did not remember the lace waist-coat , which the girl had told me of; she said Wood sent her for sixpence worth of salmon to White-chapel . In the interim he broke open a place and ran away with the two rings and two watches, the one gold, the other silver, the former I suppose to be mine, and a pair of pistols cap'd with silver. She said she had had the two rings on her fingers, and that he told her one was the picture of the king's daughter, and the other was a diamond ring.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this?</p>
               <p>Delaport. This was on Sunday; on the Monday I went to Lee and he own'd the fact and begg'd to be admitted an evidence. He impeach'd thirteen besides himself and Murphy, which I have a list of; he own'd he had been guilty of several other robberies. He put on his hat in a particular position, in which he said it was when he robb'd me. On observing it I am confident he is the very man that was on my right hand; he confessed every thing before the alderman, it was taken in writing, and I believe contains three sides of a sheet of paper. I then went to New Prison where I saw Murphy. The Saturday before I told him I suspected he was one of the persons that robb'd me, which he absolutely denied; but when I went to him again and told him that Lee was committed to the Poultry-Compter for further examination, he own'd every thing; that he got on my horse, and threatened in the manner before related, and that he belonged to the gang, and assisted in the robbery, and that he turn'd my horse up again in the yard belonging to the Thatch'd-house, Islington : I had two witnesses that heard him say this, but was not willing to trouble the court; I read the list to him which I had from Lee, and he own'd he had been concerned in robberies with eleven of them .</p>

He opened a handkerchief, I saw there a green double-breasted velvet waistcoat, it had gold tasts, and laced before and about the pockets. I was quite astonished to see such a valuable thing ; there was above a pound of gold about it, as near as I could guess; he also shew'd me two rings, one had fourteen little diamonds round a yellow diamond in the middle.</p>
               <p>Q. to Delaport . Did that ring answer to any of yours?</p>
               <p>Delaport . Yes, exactly my Lord; the other was a picture ring with shell work at the bottom where the picture was set in.</p>
               <p>Ashur . There was a pair of gold buttons with crystal stones.</p>
               <p>Delaport. I suppose they took them out of my sleeves.</p>
               <p>Ashur . He ask'd me if I could sell them for them; said I, these things are valuable; I do not know what to say to it. When I was looking on the waistcoat Wood went out of the house, Lee gave me the rings to sell, but I return'd them him again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the waistcoat wet?</p>
               <p>Ashur. Yes, on one side, I can't tell which.</p>
               <p>Delaport. As I fell from my horse I fell on my right side, which received some wet.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any thing else?</p>
               <p>Ashur . On the Sunday he came with this hanger and said he must sell it; he desired me to take it, and sell it not under eighteen shillings. When I had got the hanger in my hand I went to a Constable, gave it to him, and desir'd he would come and take the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Eliz. Wakefield. I live with Mr. Howel, the prisoner brought my master some skins to sell about the 20th of Jan. as near as I can guess, there were six of them; he ask'd 20 s. first, but he was to have 15 s; for which reason Mr. Howel did not think the goods were honestly come by. We would have stopped him but he got away, and never came to ask after them, altho' he had told us before that he was a master-currier , and kept six men at work, adding, his name was Attwood and liv'd in Walnut tree Alley, Bishopsgate-street .</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence . I went to buy a little boy a pair of old shoes , going into Rosemary-branch alehouse to call for a pint of beer , it rain'd. There was a man had got a skin or two on the table, he seeing me to be a shoe-maker, ask'd me if I could sell them for him; I went round to many shoemakers to sell them; he said he lived in Houndsditch ; and that his name was Attwood ; I return'd and told him I could not sell them; then he said, take the skins and try them, which I did, but I never saw the man before or since.</p>

            . I am the mother of the child. She was born the 21st of January in the hard frost, it was nine years old last January. I live at the <placeName id="t17490411-22-crimeloc100">sign of the Crown, near the Vinegar Merchant's, in Worship street, near Hog-lane</placeName>

She said, she was sore, and then complained sadly. I applied fuller's earth to her, thinking that would cool her, looking upon the disorder to be the scalding of her water.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you inspect the parts ?</p>
               <p>S. Batty . She appeared very red. She told me there was something more, for something ran from her ; she showed me a cloth she had put to her that night , which I have here; her shift was the same . I was surprized, and sent for a midwife who lived near me that afternoon; who, upon seeing her, told me, she feared the child had been abused by a man, for she had the foul disease. I would not believe any such thing, saying the child never went out of my house , and I had but two men lodged in the house, who I thought would never be guilty of such a thing; I thought I could trust my life with either. When she came again on the Tuesday, I said, I hoped the child was better, for she was easier; but my neighbour told me she was a great deal worse; and desired me to apply to a proper Doctor. Then I applied to Dr. Wathen , he is a Man-midwife and Doctor; I told him I thought my child had over-strained herself; he looked at her and said the child is foul. I was very much surprized, because she was never from under my care; he said it must be through the abuse of a man. The child still denied that ever a man had meddled with her, because, as she told me afterwards, he had threaten'd her life if she did tell.</p>

             . I have had many children, and have laid many women. The mother sent for me on the 10th of March; she told me her child was very bad and had a running upon her. I looked at her shift , it was as stiff as buckram with corrupted matter. She said she had had a strain. A strain indeed , said I, the child is foul; said I, it is through the abuse of a man: said she, I have but two men in my house, and I never trust my child out of my house . She desired I would come of the Sunday; but I did not go till Tuesday the 14th. She said the child was better. I searched her by order of the Doctor the 18th.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find the child then?</p>
               <p>Maclemara . She was very red; I saw the running come down from out of her body.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you think was the cause of it?</p>
               <p>Maclemara. I do really believe it was done by the abuse of some man.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174904110008"/>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing a grown man had laid with a girl about nine years old; is it possible it should not be shewn by her walking before this time?</p>
               <p>Maclemara. I should think it must.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any swelling?</p>
               <p>Maclemara . No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she torn?</p>
               <p>Maclemara . No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you known as bad symptoms as that child's, which only proceeded from heat and strains?</p>
               <p>Maclemara. No, no; it could not be done by a strain; it was such a gross humour that it was impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear of children being so without the abuse of a man?</p>
               <p>Maclemara. I have heard talk of such things, but I never saw such a case.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never know girls at fourteen or fifteen years of age that have had gleetings and runnings upon them, that proceeded from strains?</p>
               <p>Maclemara. I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was this child's bedfellow?</p>
               <p>Maclemara . I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. to S. Batty. Have not you a son about 15 years of age?</p>
               <p>S. Batty. Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not frequently lie along with this girl?</p>
               <p>S. Batty. I, having a large family, have laid them in one bed sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time?</p>
               <p>S. Batty. He did not lie with her that week she was hurt; nor can I say he did the week before. They being brother and sister, I did not think any harm in so doing; he is now in court ready to be searched, if required.</p>
               <p>Q. to Maclemara . Did you look upon the linen?</p>
               <p>Maclemara . Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What colours did you observe there?</p>
               <p>Maclemara . There was red and white mixed.</p>

             . I am an apprentice to my brother. I attended the child more than he did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been an apprentice?</p>
               <p>Wathen . About four years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you attended any in the foul disease?</p>
               <p>Wathen . Yes, many, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Give us an account what you know of this child;</p>
               <p>Wathen . About the beginning of March last, the parent brought the child to our house; and talked of a rape committed on her, and that she had the soul distemper. Upon which my brother and I examined the clothes that had received the matter that came from her; and from its quantity, colour, and malignity , is it really the foul disease in both our opinions ; upon which we did prescribe things proper for her.</p>
               <p>Q. How is the child now?</p>
               <p>Wathen . All the bad symptoms are abated, and the child in a good way of recovery; I attended her ever since, and she has got a running on her now.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour is it?</p>
               <p>Wathen . White; which is what we apprehend a very good colour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever inspect the parts of the child ?</p>
               <p>Wathen. Yes , my brother and I inspected her last Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find her?</p>
               <p>Wathen . The external lips of the womb are extended beyond their natural dimensions; the internal parts were very much inflamed, which, I believe was from the acrimony of the matter. I saw the running proceeding from the womb.</p>
               <p>Q. What was this matter?</p>
               <p>Wathen . The soul disease , very bad indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. By what means were the parts extended?</p>
               <p>Wathen . I believe by carnal copulation with a man .</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think there could be the foul disease given to any child without penetration?</p>
               <p>Wathen . No; not to make its appearance in that manner .</p>
               <p>Q. Could there be any such thing acted on a child of that age, as a penetration without being lacerated by a man grown up?</p>
               <p>Wathen . Yes, Sir, I really think there may. I believe a man may copulate with a child of that age by introducing himself a little way without a laceration.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by a little way?</p>
               <p>Wathen . Far enough for emissio .</p>
               <p>Q. Are there not other means of communicating the soul disease than by penetration?</p>
               <p>Wathen . Yes; but then it would not make its appearance in this kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not possible that a small degree of disorder may be communicated without emissio , the man being foul?</p>
               <p>Wathen . That is not an impossible thing; there are many who catch diseases of this sort where there is no running.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174904110009"/>Q. If a man has a running, can that communicate itself to a child without emissio ?</p>
               <p>Wathen . Yes, it may .</p>
               <p>Q. to S. Batty. Do you know Mr. Herson , the Attorney?</p>
               <p>S. Batty . Yes, I do. He was concerned for me; he acted by my husband's and my advice, because the prisoner's friends wanted to make it up; but my husband would never yield to it. They offer'd us ten pounds upon the nail, and to pay all costs and charges.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was the person that hurt you?</p>
               <p>M. Batty. The man in a white coat at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Give us an account of what he did to you?</p>
               <p>M. Batty. I had been up stairs to shift me, and had broke the tag of my lace, so that I could not lace myself. The woman below said, come to me and I'll lace you. I went down into her chamber; and when I was going up again the prisoner called to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you?</p>
               <p>M. Batty. He said, come hither, I want to speak with you; I'll give you some money. He wanted a pint of ale, but I did not care to draw it for him, for he owed my mother some money. I went to him for the money he said he would give me; he was laid down on his bed in his own room; he took hold of me and laid me on the bed, and put one hand on my mouth, and with the other unbuttoned his breeches, and I thought he ran his double fist up my body.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you feel any thing wet then?</p>
               <p>M. Batty. Yes, I thought he made water in me. He told me, that if I told my father or mother, he would make them half murder me, and if they did not he would quite.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was this?</p>
               <p>M. Batty. It was on a Sunday between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your mother then?</p>
               <p>M. Batty. She was below stairs then; the house was full of people.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not cry out?</p>
               <p>M. Batty. He held his hand to my mouth and I was almost strangled; and as he had threatened me, I was afraid to tell afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened after this?</p>
               <p>M. Batty. On the Friday following, my mother thought I walked comically. My mother said, what is the matter with you. Said I, I am so sore I cannot walk. Says she, why don't you make a plaister of fuller's earth, and put it to you. She went up stairs into her own room , and I followed her; she looked at me, and was frightened to see what came from me; then she sent for the midwife.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pair of stairs was it up where he used you so?</p>
               <p>M. Batty . Two pair of stairs, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. How many rooms on a floor?</p>
               <p>M. Batty. There are two rooms on a floor; there is a lodger and his wife on the first floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they at home?</p>
               <p>M. Batty . They were dressing there dinner, I went to her to be laced. This was under the room where the prisoner used me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep your bed upon this?</p>
               <p>M. Batty. Yes, I did; I was once so bad I could not get out of my bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you once looking out at the window, and your mother called you away; telling you to keep private, or that you would swear your father's or mother's life away instead of the prisoner's?</p>
               <p>M. Batty. No, she never said any such thing. I know nothing of the matter.</p>

               <p>M. Batty. I lay a bed a good while on the Wednesday, but I did not say what it was for.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this was done was it, before you went down stairs?</p>
               <p>M. Batty. I believe it was about a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cry when you went down ?</p>
               <p>M. Batty. Yes, I did, but it was a very cold day; and when my mother asked me what I cried for, I said I was a cold.</p>
               <p>Q. to S. Batty. Did the prisoner owe you any money at this time?</p>
               <p>S. Batty. Yes, he did, about 25 shillings, and has not paid me since; it was for victuals, drink, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. to M. Batty. Did you put a clean shift on between the Sunday and the Friday following?</p>

On the 19th of March, Mrs. Batty said to the child, when you come upon the trial, be sure to say, that I sent you to see what it was o' clock, and it wanted three or four minutes of eleven; and she bid her say it was done when she went up to shift herself. Then another time, the Thursday following, I went up stairs and the child was a bed; I asked her how she did; she said, her mother bid her say she was a great deal worse; and if the child was heard to speak louder than ordinary, or was looking out at the window, her mother used to send me up to ask her, whether she did design to hang her father and mother instead of the fellow ?</p>

               <p>Q. Was there not a son to Mr. Batty fifteen years old, who us'd frequently to lie with this child ?</p>
               <p>Bletsoe. Yes, he did lie in the same bed with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever search the child ?</p>
               <p>Bletsoe. I did once before the prisoner was taken up; and she was not swell'd nor torn no more than the back of my hand , nor red neither.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she a running?</p>
               <p>Bletsoe. Yes, she had a running.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that occasioned by a strain?</p>
               <p>Bletsoe. I cannot say whether it was or no.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been gone from Mr. Batty's?</p>
               <p>Bletsoe. About six weeks. I had warning before this thing happened, and I stayed my time up.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the brother very orderly?</p>
               <p>Bletsoe . He is well enough while near his parents; I know not how he is when he is out of their sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner a well-behaved modest man?</p>
               <p>Bletsoe . I never saw any harm in him, more than I do now in any one here.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not addicted to women?</p>
               <p>Bletsoe . Not to my Knowledge.</p>

               <p>Guy. I have inspected, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Court. Pray give us your opinion of the case.</p>
               <p>Guy. There is the appearance to me, as though the child had been ravished by somebody, or other. As to the foul disease, I am ready to think the running she has is only the consequence of the lacerated parts; but I do not put it upon a certainty that it is so I have seen a great many children brought into the hospital; and it is usual for people to say it is venereal, when it only proceeds from an inflammation; but I cannot tell so well as the gentleman who had the first inspection on the child. It is certain, it appears to me that the child has been lacerated; and it is my opinion she has been carnally known by a man.</p>
               <p>Q. Give us your reasons for your belief ?</p>
               <p>Guy. The part is distended beyond what it should be for a child at her age: It is impossible it should be so without force.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it possible, if a full grown man was to lie with such a child, but it should be immediately discovered by its gate?</p>
               <p>Guy. I think it must: The child must have been so much inflamed I think it would be difficult for it to go about.</p>
               <p>There were five persons who spoke well as to his former character.</p>

I keep a farm and cows; they broke into my house between three and four in the morning; they went into the maid's room, and her screaming out awaken'd me; then I seream'd out at my window. There were three of them came into my room, and found me last of all . They pull'd me from the window and flung me down in another room and trod upon my neck, then their cancle went out. They had taken the opportunity to take my man's candle from him as he was going to seed the cattle. I had not sight of them to know any of them but by the prisoner's own confession. His confession was taken in writing, wherein he says he brought the others a night or two before, and they went round the house and could not get in; and at last he thought of this method, knowing the time that my servant man goes out to serve the cows, to be there ready, and by that means they could get into the house, and take my servant's lanthorn.</p>

They found my mistress at last , and they left two men to guard me: I screamed , out all the time, and they serv'd me the worse for it; then their candle went out, the people at next door were getting up, so a man below whistled to them, and at last hallowed; then they went down, and so went away: I saw them drag my mistress out of her room, they had a candle lighted till then, and likewise I saw them put her down and tread upon her. When they were with me in my room they prevented my seeing as much as they could. They put a petticoat about my head to hinder me from seeing.</p>

            . I am a constable. I had a warrant against the prisoner at the bar, for a silver tankard lost out of the Sun and Bull in Oxford-road: we search'd his lodgings in Winamill-street and found a loaded pistol and a green cap , as the prosecutor before mentioned. We went to several houses in Covent-garden and Broad St. Giles's; when we came near his lodgings we saw him. Mr. West said he was the man he wanted . The prisoner walked a great pace; we followed him pretty close, he went into Marybone fields , and I call'd to him, saying, I wanted to speak with him, and desir'd he would not hurry so fast: we still kept going on; instead of keeping the road, he got over a stile and turn'd on the left hand, and threw something from him: there was at that time some low pales between us , but I saw it rise above the pales, and it appeared as it was up much like a silver-mug. I then ran and got over the stile, he stood still by a pond, and I took hold of him, and saw the circles in the water made by the thing he toss'd in: said I, you are my prisoner; and Mr. West, here is your tankard: I believe I order'd a boy to go into the water for it and gave him sixpence: I flung a stone to direct the boy to the place, the motion was on the water, and within a yard of where the stone fell the boy took out this pint-mug. I will not swear this is what the prisoner flung in; but I have no reason to think the contrary: here is the weight on the bottom, and letters which the prosecutor described before he saw it.</p>
               <p>Mr. West. Depos'd to the same effect, being along with Mr. Lyon ; but being behind him, saw only bubles in the water: he also advertis'd it, and it was own'd by the prosecutor.</p>

The prisoner at the bar and a woman with him came into my shop the 17th of April, and asked for some check, I shewed them some: the woman took up a shirt that lay on the counter and ask'd the price of it. My sister shewed her the piece the shirt was cut off from; she bought a piece for a pair of shift-sleeves, and put down half a crown, and as I was looking for change the man went out of the door; my sister saw something under his coat. He staid about four minutes, and came in again, and asked the woman if she had not bargained, and they went out together: as soon as they were gone, my sister said, that man has took something out. I miss'd a piece of cloth in a moment. My sister ran after him, and I call'd the maid and sent her after them.</p>

I followed him into St. Giles's Vinegar-yard; by that time there was a person came after me crying, stop thief! she was our maid, my sister had sent after me; for I had not courage enough to call out; then he ran, and I call'd out, stop thief! he ran into a publick house, I went after him and took him, but he had nothing at all upon him.</p>

I concluded he designed to pay for the rum when he fetched the cloath; I thought that might be what he said, though it was spoke so low that I could not hear it perfectly .</p>

               <p>We the Grand Jury for the city of London, do most humbly and unanimously present, that Samuel Unwin of the parish of St. Botolp, Aldgate , London, vintner, now and for the space of two months last past, has kept an ill-govern'd and disorderly house, call'd or known by the name of the Magpye-tavern , situate in the said parish without Aldgate, that for the sake of wicked lucre and gain, he, during all the time aforesaid has harboured and entertained, and still harbours and entertains divers rogues, thieves, vagabonds, and other loose and disorderly persons in his said house, as well by day as by night, and that the said house ought to be suppressed, it appearing to us that the said Unwin's farther continuance to keep the same, must greatly tend to the corruption of the morals of youth, to the great endangerment of the publick safety, and to the great terror and nusance of all his Majesty's liege subjects inhabiting thereabouts .</p>

            . One day last summer Mr. Deverix and I were coming into the city, we met the prisoner and three men to the best of my knowledge with her, I did not know them. Mr. Deverix and she had some talk about some affairs; says she, I have not my son along with me, he is going aboard some king's ship, which I do not remember now; he is now willing to make a will and power before he goes; says Deverix, here is a man that will do it for him : we went into the Paul's-head tavern near Doctor's Commons; there the will was fill'd up by me. Deverix, the prisoner, and the other man was in the room at the time; likewise I filled up a letter of attorney for her son, as she call'd him, and they were witnessed by one or two besides myself ; and this said son sign'd both will and power.</p>

I said to her how long has she been absent ? between two and three months, said she; said I, apply to the honourable board, that will be the way to have relief: Said she, if you will do it for me, I'll pay you: said I, I cannot do it, but I'll recommend you.

               <p>Deverix . I cannot tell the day, I did not take such notice of the time; it was last summer, but I cannot swear to the month. We met her on the back of St. Paul's church. There were three men with her at that time .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any of them?</p>
               <p>Deverix. None but the man she called her husband. I know that one of the other men was called Mason.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done then?</p>
               <p>Deverix. After some talk, the man that called himself the prisoner's husband, said , the son was going to make a will and power ; and there was a man there that signed the will and power, and called himself Noble .</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner at the bar call him her son?</p>
               <p>Deverix. I do not remember she said he was or was not; but the man that call'd himself her husband , said that person they called Noble, was his son .</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner desire what effects that man call'd Noble had, should be given to her?</p>

             and I were going to Islington from out of Fenchurch street, on the 21st of November, between six and seven o'clock at night, but a very moon light night; this man, the prisoner at the bar, and two other men overtook us between two ditches coming into Frog field . One of the three, not the prisoner, had a pistol in his hand, and held it to Mrs. Howard's face , and commanded her to stop; threatening directly if she made any outcry, they would blow her brains out that moment; so we said nothing to them .</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner at the bar is one of the men?</p>
               <p>Oates . I am very certain he is. The next word after we stopp'd was, Damn your blood, what have you got there ? We told them foul linen. Then the next word was, Then damn your blood, I'll have it. I am the porter, I had the bundle of linen on my back ; it was taken off me behind, the man went away with the linen. One of them stood with a stick to me, and another with a pistol to the woman ; then he with the stick struck me a blow over my head and broke my head; then they run after the other with the linnen; we saw which way they went, then we went home to Islington as fast as we could.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did they go off?</p>
               <p>Oates. Towards Brick lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose linen was it?</p>
               <p>Oates. It was Mr. Carnan's , a Hamburgh merchant's ; we were carrying it to Islington to be wash'd .</p>
               <p>Mary Howard. I am a washer-woman; I live just by Islington church . I had been to Mr. Carnan's for this linnen; he lives in Philpot lane .</p>
               <p>Q. When was this ?</p>
               <p>Howard. November the 21st.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day?</p>
               <p>Howard. I believe it was about seven o'clock. This porter was always my man for such work; we were going to my house; he carried the linen; we met three men at a place between Chalk-hill and the Barn.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner was one of them?</p>
               <p>Howard. I am quite positive he was: I would not be positive at first, but upon mature consideration I am quite sure. One came up to me, the other went the lower way. When they had past us , I said, I wish we get safe home; I do not like the looks of them men; then they returned again upon me; one of them put a pistol to my breast, the other two kept behind: He said, Damn your body, Stop. I made answer, for God's sake don't use us ill, for if you take my bread you take my life. He asked what was in the bundle? I told him, foul linen. He said, Damn you, go along, and one of the other two pull'd the bundle off the porter's back; they said nothing to him as I remember; it was the prisoner that had the bundle on his head; he said it is damn'd heavy; one of the other help'd him up with it, for they had taken it off the porter's back and set it on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the prisoner since?</p>
               <p>Howard . Yes, I saw him in Bridewell two or three times since. I was informed of his being there by a neighbour.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When this witness first saw me, she said, she would not swear I was one of the men for all the world.</p>
               <p>Howard. When I first went, I did say I would not be positive, till I had considered it more; but I now remember him very perfectly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough to discern him?</p>
               <p>Howard . It was a very moon light frosty night.</p>

            . Thorp borrowed his coat; so they two changed coats; then we went up Saffron Hill, and then to Clerkenwell Green; there we bought a pennyworth of lead . When we came to Cold Bath fields, we put a bit of lead to load the pistol with; then we went into the field that goes over to Marybone; Thorp loaded the pistol. There we met a man and robb'd him of his watch; then we went round by Clerkenwell Green. By the backside of Sadler's Wells gate we saw this man and woman coming the Chalk Hill way; we staid in the field a considerable while till they came along, and made as if we were going to London. Thorp went up to them and stopp'd them, then Rogers and I went up; Rogers pull'd the bundle off the man's back, it lay about three or four minutes on the ground; then he desired me to lift it up on his back, and after he had got it, he said it was damn'd heavy. Then Thorp said to the woman, he would blow her brains out if she offered to follow. I pulled him from her and said, if we lick the man with a switch which I had in my hand, he will then go home, and the woman will follow him. I took the porter a blow over his head; then we went over the fields, and in a ditch there we untied the bundle and made it into two, I carried one, and Rogers the other; then we went to Merrit's.</p>

We missed the things as soon as we came home that night; she was gone and the cupboard was broke open. She was found two days after at Barnet . I advertised the things, and the pawnbroker brought me some that were pawn'd; there were two spoons and a milk pot pawned for 36 s. she sold my watch for 30 s. and told me where. she was taken by two men; they had gone with her to pawn the milk pot and spoons, so were afraid of being brought into a bad case.

On Saturday about six in the evening, when I was paying my men, the prisoner brings the gin in that I had ordered in the forenoon; I said, have you brought the receipt? He said, no, I have not; said I, then I shall not pay you. He came on Monday morning about eight o'clock; said I, what do you want? we do not want any liquor: Said he, my mistress has sent the receipt; he shewed it me, and I gave him half a guinea and four pennyworth of half pence ; that was for the five gallons he had brought without a receipt; he called for a quartern of gin, and I drank one glass along with him.</p>

She stood over me when I wrote it on the counter. I went with it to Mr. Hancock's according to my master's orders on Sunday; they did not want liquor; said he, have you got the bill? I said, yes; so he paid the 10 s. 10 d.</p>

               <p>Q. What have you got to tell us about the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Paterson. There were three women drinking, and said I, I will go up stairs and take a nap of sleep .</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a publick house you lodge in?</p>
               <p>Paterson. No it is not.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174904110020"/>Paterson. There were either three or four ; I just came in at the door and went up stairs to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Paterson . About half an hour after six, I wanted to take a nap before night. She came up and asked me for a handkerchief ; she call'd me husband , and said I was her property, and what I had belong'd to her: she wanted a handkerchief of me, and I told her I would pay for a handkerchief if she would go down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she go down stairs ?</p>
               <p>Paterson . No, she would not go down stairs: but the same time I was asleep she took my watch out of my fob .</p>
               <p>Q. How can you tell that, when you say you was asleep at the same time?</p>
               <p>Paterson . Because people can witness it down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear positively she took it when you was asleep?</p>
               <p>Paterson . Yes, I will; the people ask'd what a clock it was, and I went to look, and it was gone; she went away with the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you awake when she came into the room?</p>
               <p>Paterson . Yes I was?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He gave me the watch to be concerned with me.</p>
               <p>Paterson . I never kiss'd her lips.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her the watch?</p>
               <p>Paterson . I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she on the bed with you?</p>
               <p>Paterson . No, she was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know when you was asleep?</p>
               <p>Paterson . How do I know, how do I know, how do I know, because she had got hold of my shoulder as I have got hold of this gentleman; [taking hold of a person that stood by him.] she hawl'd me up from off the bed; I was half fuddled, please your worship.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got your watch again?</p>
               <p>Paterson. Yes I have.</p>
