On October 11th, about two p.m., I was on duty with Phillips, in plain clothes, in High Street, Shoreditch, and saw the prisoner and another lad going from one stall to another—the other went into Mr. White's house—the prisoner stood outside till the other one rejoined him—the prisoner took something like a small packet from his right trousers pocket, and handed it to the other—we lost sight of them for about a minute, and when I turned a corner the prisoner was standing outside a public—house by himself—I said, "What was that you took out of your pocket?"—he said, "I have got nothing; the other man has got them, he has gone across the road; you can search me"—I put him into the public—house door<lb/>way, and he threw a little packet from his right hand; it fell inside the door, and I saw Fox pick up two half—crowns and a small piece of paper</p>

I am a Fellow of the Chemical Society, and Bachelor of Science, and Assistant Assayer to Her Majesty's Mint—I have had considerable experience in examining the coin of the realm—various articles have been handed to me, and this is my report—I received four sovereigns from Sergeant Cox on October 20th, and found them deficient in weight—No. 1 was 17d. or 2s. 101/2d. less value; No. 2, 121/2 or 1s. 11d. deficient; No. 3, 141/4 or nearly 2s. 4d. value short; and No. 4, 11 grains, or 1s. 9d. less value—a sovereign after eighteen years ought to be reduced to the least current weight, but the deficiency has been caused in this case by the coins being placed in a corrosive fluid, a strong acid—they do not show ordinary wear, they have a peculiar pock—mark—after being reduced in weight by the acid the coins had been polished by rubbing—they prob<lb/>ably have not been in circulation much—I afterwards received these bottles, Nos. 2 and 3, containing two or three ounces of acid; that in bottle "A" is quite capable of dissolving a sovereign—bottle "B" contains an acid which" might be used in making the contents of "A"—this bottle marked "Jockey Club" contains some organic liquid, the effect of which is to precipitate the gold, and recover it in a fine powder—these glasses contain a small amount of solid, but they contain no gold; one contains a liquid from bottle "B," and the other a liquid from bottle "C"—I took a new sovereign and attacked it with liquid from bottle "A" for half an hour, and then took it from the acid and polished it, and found it very closely resembled these coins; I mean that there were pock—marks—I precipitated it with the Jockey Club liquid in soda and then melted the powder, and got this little button (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which is the gold that was in the solution—a fire is not necessary for this</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by McTeer.</hi> I was up in my sister's room when you first accused me—you said I gave the constable a shilling so that he should not take me in custody—I and two other men did not follow you and the prosecutor when he had his arm round your waist—you are wicked enough to say anything; you would accuse a child if it had been coming past—I did not come up the first time you were before the Magistrate because I forgave your wickedness—I did not come the second time because Thursday was stated on my subpoena, and it should have been Wednesday—I cannot say what you did with the money you took from the prosecutor's pocket; I saw you do it—a lot of people came out of doors at the time, hearing the noise—it is a very rough neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Clark, in his statement before the Magistrate, and in his defence, said that he found McTeer, with whom he was living, in a public—house with the prosecutor; that he left them there, and afterwards met them in the street, McTeer being then drunk, and having the prosecutor's arm round her waist, and that, mad with rage, he pulled them apart, when the prosecutor ran away, and returned with two policemen.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">McTeer, in her statement and in her defence, said that the prosecutor took her from one public—house to another and made her drunk; and then he was walking with his arm round her waist, when three or four men rushed up, and knocked her down, and rifled the prosecutor's pockets.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am an undertaker, of 422, Cable Street—on August 29th, about nine p.m., I was in Johnson Street, and the prisoner, whom I knew by sight, snatched my watch, and said, "Give me that"—he ran across the street—I ran after him, and got hold of him by his coat, and a man rushed up and said, "If you don't leave go of him I will stick a knife into you"—I let go, and he ran across the street—I ran after him, and when I got to the corner of the street I was knocked down on my knees by a tall man, the one who had threatened me with the knife—I jumped up, and called "Stop thief!" and ran after the prisoner, and when I got to the corner of Thomas Street three or four men said, "Knock the old b——down and kill him"—the prisoner was not with those men; he was running in front—I got up again, and found my arm bleeding—it was broken by a kick when I was down, and was trying to save my head—I went to the hospital—I knew the prisoner, because he came and asked me to <hi rend="italic">go bail</hi> for his brother the Sessions before last, who got five years' penal servitude—I came here on purpose to look for him, when his brother was here, and saw him in a public—house opposite this Court, and gave him in custody—when he was in custody he wanted to shake hands and said, "Mr. Tadman, I would not rob you of your watch."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He never said, "You have got the wrong man," nor did I say so before the Magistrate—I did not know his name or address when the robbery was committed—I did not know that the other man was his brother, or that his name was Gardner—I went with him to a beer—house with a man named Eccleston—I told the policeman he might be found at 'Eccleston's, not the same night—I did not see Smith till I came out of the hospital—I went to Eccleston's two nights, and had police all</p>

On October 18th, at one a.m., I was on duty in the Broad Sanctuary—Goode came out to me, and I went with him to the lodging—house, and saw Mann bleeding from three wounds; one on his thigh, one on his arm, and one on his hand—I went to a back room and found Williams there, hid behind some boards and ladders—I told him I should take him for stabbing the prosecutor—he said, "Very well, I will go quiet"—I took him to the station—he was sober, but he may have been drinking—I took Mann to the hospital—I found this table—knife among the boards, where Williams had been hiding—Goode said, "That is the man," pointing to Cartwright, who said, "I don't know nothing at all about it; I will go quiet"—he was charged at the station, and made no answer—the knife seems to have been rubbed on a step or a stone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 8, Church Row, Aldgate, next door to 9—in the early morning of 17th October I was awake, and heard Aldgate Church strike two, and about twenty five minutes or half—past two I heard cries of "Fire! Fire!"—I immediately got out of bed, and went to a window on the landing and looked out, and saw the prisoner Valensin leaning out of the window of the first floor of No. 9—I said, "What is the matter?"—he said, "The place is on fire"—I only</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189311130023"/>
               <p>saw smoke coming from the window; it seemed a goodish bit of smoke—I said, "Get out; the window is low; jump out"—I immediately turned round and went in for some of my clothes, and went out—as I opened the street door I saw Valensin in the court, in his drawers, socks, and shirt; he had been got down by two men—he was trembling very violently, and could hardly speak; I think it was fright—the night was cold, but nothing severe—he seemed very much frightened—he asked for A drink of water—I pulled him into the passage of No. 8—I gave him some water, and afterwards took him to my room—he had got all his clothes on then, except his hat, and he felt a little better, but he was not quite the thing—he kept complaining of his chest being so sore through the smoke and shouting out—when the fire was over he was allowed to go in and dress—when I got out into the street the fireman was there, and a constable and the two young men who had helped the prisoner out of the window—when he was in my room I got some coffee for him, and while he was drinking it I said to him, "How did the fire commence?"—he said, "I do not know"—he said he went to bed at one o'clock and went to sleep, and woke up through the smoke; that he got up and put his hand on the wainscote; it was so hot he could not keep his hand there—he Opened the door, but could not get down; he was half choked—he said that his employer stopped there till twelve to make his accounts up—he said, "I left home at half—past five to go to my employer at Walworth to acquaint him of the fire; I returned with him to No. 8; I just went to the bottom of the road with him"—after the fire was over Valensin stopped in my room till about half—past five.</p>

I gave evidence at the Coroner's inquiry—I said there that Valensin appeared very much frightened, and was half suffocated—that was so; he was very much frightened and trembling violently—it was not put on, he really was frightened; he looked very bad and very white—after he had got his clothes on he seemed half suffocated—he said his chest was very sore—he did not tell me that the shouting out had hurt his chest; he said the smoke had half choked him—when he was leaning out of the window and I was leaning out we could have touched each other's hands—he seemed like a man stupefied—he said he had been reading before he went to bed—I had never seen him before that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fireman, No.30, in the Fire Brigade stationed at the Bishopsgate Fire Station—that is about 300 yards from Church Row—on 17th October, about 2.34 a.m., I got an alarm of fire, and went to 9, Church Row with a hose—car, an escape, and three men—when I got to the door I found a constable keeping the door, which was shut—I entered the shop and passed through to the room at the back, which was on fire—I came out into the street and got a street hydrant at work, and put out the fire—it took me about seven or eight minutes—the door between the shop and the back room was open—I did not notice whether there was a lamp on the table—there was considerable strength of water from the hose; it would easily knock over a lamp—Superintendent Smith arrived, and he took charge—the biggest blaze seemed to be on the right, towards the fireplace.</p>

I was four or five minutes on the scene before the superintendent arrived—at that time the hydrant had been got to work and playing two or three minutes; I dare say 90 or 100 gallons of water had been discharged in five minutes—I should not think the hydrant had been playing more than eight minutes at the very outside, if not less—there were three men, and they relieved each other—I remained till the fire was over—I cannot say how many firemen went inside that night—only one would be there until the superintendent came.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Superintendent of the London County Council Fire Brigade; my station is in the Commercial Road—I received notice of this fire at 2.34 in the morning of 17th October—I at once went to the house with the engine and some men—I found the fire burning in the back room of No. 9, Church Row—it was extinguished in about a minute after I arrived—the moment after the fire was extinguished the room, would be full of steam and smoke—after that had cleared off I made an examination of the room by the aid of a lantern, with Superintendent Ford, of the London Salvage Corps—he arrived shortly after me—I found two fires; one by the cigar—boxes between two doors—it began nearly at the bottom, underneath the small table—I saw nothing at the bottom to account for the fire—when I made my examination the fire was extinguished—there was a little debris of wood and paper shavings in front of the cigar—boxes which had teen charred—the debris was about as much as could be held in two hands—I examined the clean shavings alongside the front of the cigar—boxes—they smelt very strongly of paraffin—I examined one handful—the small table in front was almost completely destroyed; it was weakened by the fire, and broken to pieces by our men going into the place—the under side and the legs were damaged by fire, charred—the outside of the fronts of the cigar—boxes were very much charred, but not burnt through, only one or two boxes—the door next the cigar—boxes had a glass panel; that was charred—the ceiling was papered—that was not all burnt—the paper immediately above the cigar—boxes was burnt, but the part between the two fires was not—the second fire originated in the coal basket—I produce the basket—there was some</p>

               <p>coal in the bottom of it and some rags; they smelt strongly of paraffin; there are pieces on it now—that basket and its contents had been nearly burnt, and it had damaged the front of the sloping desk, and considerably charred the paper casing of the beam directly over it—I found two packing—cases next the sloping desk—they contained several cardboard boxes of cigarettes, some full—the tops of two boxes were not on them—when I first examined the boxes they were standing side by side; afterwards someone placed one on the top of the other—they were charred on the side nearest the sloping desk—those were the only tires I discovered on that occasion—there was no connection between them; they were near about eight feet apart—there was a show—case on the side of the room—there was some glass on it broken, and broken pieces of glass on the floor in front of it—the door of it was shut—it contained principally empty cigarette card—boxes—in front of it were some wood and paper shavings, extending about six inches, and about three inches deep, the full length of the show—case; those shavings were not touched by fire—I examined them; they smelt very strongly of paraffin—I should think there must have been quite half a gallon of paraffin required to saturate the shavings and rags—I made a subsequent examination on 3rd November, jointly with Mr. Ford, by daylight—I went over the same ground I have spoken of, and I then found signs of another fire, under the writing table, in the centre of the room—I found the bottom part of a waste—paper basket, with some paper in it, affected more or less by fire—the bottom, part was consumed by fire; I produce it—at the time I found it it smelt of paraffin—the under side of the table was considerably burnt—the drawers are here—there was no connection between that fire and either of the others—there was an old carpet on the floor, and on the edges of the bottom of the basket the carpet was affected by fire, in a circle; the carpet was also affected by the other two fires in the vicinity of them, but not in the spaces between the tires—there were some shavings lying along, in front of the boxes under the window, similar to the others; I think about half a bushel—they also smelt of paraffin, but they had not been, affected by the fire—I examined one or two of the pile of cigar—boxes; three or four were full, and one or two were empty—I saw a broken lamp on the floor, about midway between the table and the fireplace; I should think that it had been knocked over by the stream of water coming in at the door—I carefully examined the remains of that lamp—I have had experience of exploded lamps—I should think this lamp had not been broken by explosion—I should think the receiver would hold about half a pint—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the remains of that lamp—I do not think there was any explosion; if there had been I should have expected the roller to have been damaged, and the receiver broken into more pieces, and it would also have shown signs of tire on the floor, and on the top of the table on which the lamp stood, which had a leather covering—that was curled up from the heat, but not burned—I should say this lamp was a very good one; I won't say it was a safety lamp—I saw this can containing, paraffin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which was found under the counter; it is an ordinary half—gallon can; it had a small funnel in the mouth; it was not corked—I shook it; it contained a little paraffin; I did not measure it, but I should think it was about half a pint; I poured out a little of it—there was no fire in the shop.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLES</hi>. I have been in the Fire Brigade twenty—two years—I know that a great many fires in the Metropolis are caused by paraffin lamps—this is the only piece of the lamp that was found—I believe there were other portions; I did not see them—this was found on the floor, between the writing—table and the centre of the room and the fireplace; the top was found near it—I do not know of any lamp that is absolutely a safety—I think most probably the lamp was on the table, and knocked off the table—I should not expect it to have left fragments—I should say the lamp must have been four or five feet from the cigar—boxes, and about the same distance from the coal basket—I think the height of the table was about six feet by four—the shavings were not the ordinary shavings of a carpenter's shop; they are fine wood shavings. This (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a specimen of the unborn shavings taken from the floor in the back room, and this is a sample taken from the basement—there was no fire in the basement—these are the two cases of which I have spoken which show marks of burning, and this is the paraffin can. These shavings are of wood, such as would probably be found in any place used for packing goods—I saw one lamp intact hanging to the ceiling in the shop, and this broken one in the back room—there was a cradle for the lamp in the shop; it looked as though it had been taken from the lamp in the shop and taken into the back room—there was another complete lamp in the shop window—I went into the basement—I did not notice anything there but a w. c.—I simply went in the basement to see if there was any fire there—I found none—I did not know what the basement contained—Hockley and two or three other men had gone into the back room before me—Hockley held a light—I don't think any other men came in—the floor was partly carpeted, and there were boxes lying about—I should say about 100 gallons of water were thrown from the hydrant, and about one—third of it went out of the window into the churchyard—the whole of the contents on the floor would, of course, be wet—the shavings were saturated with paraffin in three separate places; there was no fire on them—I did not see the waste—paper basket on the night of the fire; I saw it on the 3rd of this month—I had been there before that, but I did not notice it then—I should say it was from fifteen to eighteen inches under the table—I did not notice the state of the table till it was pointed out to me this morning by Mr. Ford—I was there yesterday; the table was in the same place then as it was before—I do not know whether this paper was in the waste—paper basket when I saw it; I believe it was—the basket was burnt down to the level—the top part of the paper was more or less burnt, and that protected the lower part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Valensin.</hi> I did not knock about the shavings with my feet—there were probably two inches of water on the floor—I did not ask you about the paraffin—I asked you if you could account for the cause of the fire, and you said you could not.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The Salvage Corps got rid of the water by ripping up the carpet and cutting a hole in the floor, and it went down into the basement—I have never seen a paraffin lamp explode; I have seen them afterwards—I have given reasons for thinking that the lamp was knocked off the table, and not exploded; I think the immediate vicinity of the explosion would have shown signs of it—there were some books and paper</p>

               <p>on the table—I asked Valensin where the remains of the lamp were—he said he had left it standing on the table, shored up with books, as it had not a flat bottom—the other lamp was precisely similar in size, and the cradles of both were the same—the cradles were hanging from the roof in the shop; one had no lamp in it—Valensin told me that his master left about half—past eleven that night, and that he had never gone into the room after he left; he was still reading in the shop—he could see into the room from the shop, through the glass door; he could tell whether the lamp was burning when he went to bed.</p>

I am Superintendent of the Salvage Corps in Commercial Road—I have had twenty—five years' experience of fires—about ten minutes to three on the morning of the 17th October I went to 9, Church Row—the fire was then extinguished—I went with Superintendent Smith, and made an examination of the premises by lamp—light—the pile of cigar—boxes between the two fires were affected by fire—on the floor at the bottom of the boxes I found a pile of shavings, partly consumed—they smelt very strongly of paraffin oil, exceptionally so—on the 24th, after the inquest on the 23rd, I was visiting the premises in the ordinary course of my duty, and I then took three samples of the shavings in front of the cigar—boxes—I counted the cigar—boxes between the doors; there were ninety—four empty ones and four full, placed on the tops—by the fireplace: there was the coal basket, on the top of which were some rags and shavings intermixed—I produce a sample—underneath the window there were some tin boxes stacked up, and on the floor a number of empty card—boxes, which apparently had been displaced by the firemen; and some shavings between the show—case and the writing—table—I smelt those; they were very strong of paraffin—at the bottom of the show—case there were shavings smelling of paraffin—later on, on the 2nd November, I made further examination—I then found that the under side of the table near the window was charred, and under the charred portion I found this waste—paper basket burnt at the edges—it contained some shavings which had accidentally been placed over it by the water, and beneath was some waste paper, a sample of which I produce—it smelt very strongly of paraffin, and smells very strongly now—it consists of empty card—boxes, and at the top were several full boxes of cigarettes—I saw the broken lamp—I have met with a great many cases of lamp explosions—I have examined the remains of this lamp—in my opinion it was not broken by explosion; the condition of the burnerpoints that out conclusively—it has indications of having been knocked over—if it had exploded it would have gone into a great many more pieces—it is an ordinary safety burner—I saw Valensin on the morning of the fire, about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after my arrival—I asked him if he could give any account of the occurrence; he said he could not—he said that he let his master out about half—past eleven, that he bolted the door and went down below to the lavatory with a candle, and then came upstairs, but did not go into the back room; in fact, he said he had not gone into the back room since his master left—I asked him if he knew that his master was insured—he said he did not—I went into the room over the shop; there was a bed in it, a sort of wicker—work, which they could use in the trade—it was not at all disarranged; it was of such a character that two persons would afford no indication of having</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189311130028"/>
               <p>been in it—there was a diagonal line of smoke on the bed, showing that a quantity of smoke had come into the room from the stairway—I saw no connection between the different fires; they were entirely distinct.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLES</hi>. I think, from their general appearance, that the fires had been burning about an equal time—Mr. Smith was there when I arrived—he did not give me any opinion as to the cause of the fire, he simply pointed to the fire by the cigar—boxes—when I entered I thought I was going into an oil—shop instead of a tobacco shop—I formed no impression till I saw the contents of the back room—there is very rarely a smell from the vapour caused by paraffin—this lamp is what is ordinarily called a safety burner—paraffin is a very funny thing—I have not had much experience of paraffin, but these burners are considered safe—a large number of fires are caused by the capsizing of paraffin lamps, not by explosion—an explosion would principally arise from a bad—fitting wick in a common burner—it allows of an aperture between the burner and the wick, so as to generate a vapour and cause the flame to descend, and cause a contact which makes an explosion; that is quite of a different character from the present case—if the lamp had merely fallen I should have expected more pieces of it remaining, but the debris has not yet been turned over; there are one or two small pieces lying about—one of them is stamped, "Suta Cigarette Company, 19, Leadenhall Street"—there was some loose tobacco in the basement, about four and a half pounds, and also about four and a quarter pounds in a packing—case in the back room first floor—I should call that a workroom, and there were several parcels of paper for making cigarettes—there were three work—benches in the upstairs room for the <hi rend="italic">employees</hi> to work at—I do not know that Abib used it as a factory for feeding other shops—I found the remains of the waste—paper basket on the carpet under the table, about the centre of the end of the table, about fifteen inches from the end nearest the window.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Langham, Coroner for the City of London—I was present on the 23rd October at an inquiry at the City Mortuary, Golden Lane, when the two prisoners were sworn and examined—I produce their statements, which the Coroner took down and read over to them, and they signed them. (<hi rend="italic">They were read as follows</hi>:—"Zachariah Abib, 205, Walworth Road, cigarette maker, being sworn, saith: I carried on business at No. 9, Church Row, High Street, Aldgate, as a cigarette manufacturer, three or four months, as a weekly tenant I had previously carried on business at No. 8, Church Row, for three or four years. I was then tenant to Mr. Weiss. I paid 10s. per week rent. I paid the rent up to within a week. I cannot say exactly what was the nature of the stock at the time of the fire. It would consist of tobacco and cigars, and cigarettes, and tin boxes. The cigarettes are made of pure tobacco. I am insured in the North British and Mercantile Insurance Company for £500 for stock and fixtures. I don't know what I laid out for fixtures. I had a shop in St. Mary Axe, and I transferred it to the same place; it was retail in St. Mary Axe, and wholesale in Church Row. The tobacco is in brown paper. I had two lamps, in which I burned paraffin. Half a gallon of paraffin takes two days, and sometimes three days, to burn. One lamp on the table where I write, and one in the shop window. There is one room upstairs, and one smaller,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189311130029"/>
               <p>and the shop downstairs. The fire took place on Tuesday, the 17th inst, at 2.34. I was not on the premises. I left at half—past nine on Monday evening to go to another shop at St. Martin's Court, Charing Cross. I have a retail shop there. I came back at twenty minutes past eleven; I waited about ten or twelve minutes, and then left to go home to Walworth Road. My man came about six o'clock in the morning; he told me there had been a fire, and I went at once, and when I got there the fire was out. I left Moses Valensin on the premises when I went out at half—past nine, and I found him there when I went back at twenty past eleven, and I left him there when I went home. He slept there, and was on the premises at the time of the tire. He had nothing to do, but merely to take care of the premises. I could see the fire had broken out in the office when I went on Tuesday morning; it had broken out in one place in the office. I did not notice any shavings on the floor. I did not know these shavings were saturated with paraffin. I had not had any quarrel with Valensin, nor was he under notice to leave. Sometimes splints are used in packing, and some boxes had arrived two days before which contained these splints. These splints were put in a basket; they lay about at night, and are cleared up in the morning. <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>: I always returned after coming from my West—end House. There was about 25 lbs. of tobacco, and about 30,000 cigarettes altogether. Altogether it would be worth £100. I owe about £200 for some tobacco and cigarettes. I do not give much credit. I can't tell exactly what is owing to me. I had a partner, but he left about four or five weeks ago. I owe the Suta Cigarette Company £40. I have been in St. Martin's Court for ten months, and I pay 8s. a week for the rent there. I cannot say what the value of the stock there amounts to. I have a retail shop in Walworth Road. I have no banking account; I pay everything in cash. Both myself and Valensin smoke on the premises; we smoke cigarettes. The policy produced is dated the 5th October, 1893; is for £500, from the 4th September, 1893, to 29th September, 1894, both inclusive, and is for stock, fixtures, and utensils.—Z. <hi rend="smallCaps">ABIB</hi>.</p>
               <p>"Moses Valensin, 12, Stratford Houses, Wentworth Street, Commercial Street East, cigarette maker, and assistant to Mr. Abib, being sworn, saith: I have been in the employ of Mr. Abib for about two years. Mr. Abib was formerly at No. 8 and 9, Church Row, and moved into No. 9 altogether. I have slept on the premises, No. 9, since I have been there—I occupied the top floor. Mr. Abib carried on the business of a cigarette maker. I was there on the night of the fire. I went to bed about one o'clock. I was reading. I took a candle and candlestick up to my room. I used the paraffin lamp to read with, and I turned it quite out when I left off reading. I had a cigarette when downstairs. I woke up about half—past two; there was a bad smell and the heat I opened the door of my room, and the smoke came in. I opened the window and called out for help. A gentleman from next door came out, and told me to jump down, and after two men came and caught hold of my legs, and I got down. It is about ten or twelve feet from the window—ledge to the ground. There were cases containing splints with cigarettes; one was in the office. I do not know anything as to the value of the stock on the premises at the time of the fire. I did not know that Mr. Abib was insured until the morning of the fire, when I asked him. We had a fair business. The</p>

               <p>fire broke out in the office; I saw where it was; there was no paraffin that I know of except in the can. I lighted the cigarette in the office, and I did not notice any of the ashes fall down. I do not know how the fire was occasioned. <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>: I had half a gallon of paraffin in the shop. In the absence of the governor I take the money. There were lots of empty boxes.

I am an inspector of agents for the London Amicable Accident Insurance Company, and live at 13, Theobald's Road—at the end of July this year I was agent for an insurance of a shop of Abib's at St. Mary Axe—I went to see Abib about a life policy, and he then spoke to me about a fire policy—he said he wished to transfer his policy from St. Mary Axe to Church Row, where he had removed his business—he also mentioned some other premises that he had, which he wished to insure—I did not take the addresses of those; one was in the neighbourhood of Charing Cross—the amount of the policy for St. Mary Axe was £300—I told him I had had so much difficulty in getting the money from him with regard to his life insurance, that I did not want to have anything to do with the matter, and he hail letter send in the notice of transfer himself to the North British Mercantile—I have held an agency for that company for a considerable time—on the morning of 17th October I met Abib in the Minories—he told me that a fire had taken place at the premises in Church Row—I said I presumed it would be a bad job for him—I did not know that he had affected an insurance—</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 205, Walworth Road, a cigar and cigarette shop—I have known Mr. Abib four and a half or five years, and during that time I worked for him—he had shops at St. Mary Axe, Frith Street, Soho, 23, St. Martin's Court, Charing Cross, 145, Walworth Road, and 8 and 9, Church Row, Aldgate—I was living at Walworth until he was arrested—I have often been to Church Row—I have known Valensin by speak<lb/>ing to him and working for Mr. Abib—sometimes Abib had four, sometimes five,</p>

               <p>and sometimes more persons working for him at Church Row, manufacturing cigarettes—there were Sophy, Julia, and Beckey; I don't know their sur<lb/>names—besides Valensin, there was Weisman; he was a cigarette maker—I looked after the shop at Walworth—I can make cigarettes—I used to get the tobacco from Abib—I never served at St. Martin's Court—a young girl named Susan Levy worked there; she can make cigarettes, but she attends to the shop—Mr. Abib would get the tobacco from Church Row; that was my first place—they had two lamps there, one in the window, one a little way in the shop, and one in the back room, hanging up against the wall—the oil would be got from Houndsditch—Church Row turns into Houndsditch; the back window looks into the church-yard—at first I used to clean those lamps; afterwards the servant did—I used to get half a gallon of paraffin at a tune—I sometimes cleaned them upstairs, and sometimes down—sometimes I used a duster, and sometimes I picked up a few shavings from the floor and wiped them round with—there was a carpet round the floor—unpacking was done in the back room—I remember Abib coming home in a hansom on the night of the 16th, about half—past six or seven—he brought with him some boxes of tobacco, and some cigarettes for me to make; he also brought two boxes of cigarettes for sale; altogether he brought eight boxes of tobacco—we had a good stock of cigarettes then; between 1,300 or 1,400, or more, and we had plenty of cigars to go on with—it would take me about an hour or three—quarters to make up a pound of tobacco into cigarettes—I could make up 50 lbs. of tobacco in three or four days—we sometimes sold cigarettes loose, sometimes by the pound—it was not an extraordinary quantity for Abib to bring—it is not true that he brought forty or fifty boxes on the cab—these are the boxes he brought; he did not bring any small boxes—I remember the inspector coming; these were the eight boxes that he saw—I heard that Abib was arrested the same evening—the inspector came to the shop about two or three days after—between the arrest and the inspector coming no goods were removed from the premises in Walworth Road; I was there the whole time—the in<lb/>spector saw the whole of the stock that was there on the night Abib came in the cab—the goods were ultimately taken away on Thursday or Friday, after the inspector was there; they were taken away by Mr. Abib's direc<lb/>tion; Mr. Yeates took them away.</p>

I am manager to Leopold Farmer, an auctioneer and surveyor, 47, Gresham Street—on 17th October Abib called with an introductory card from a Mr. Curtis, and I went with him to see the premises—I went into the back office and stood by the large table—I looked carefully round, and trod on something sharp; I picked it up; it was a small piece of the bowl of the lamp—the floor was strewed with boxes and books, and generally shavings, the ordinary tin shavings—by the side of the fireplace there were boxes and two books—I looked carefully on the table to see what was there; there were two books and a portion of the paraffin lamp, and on this side of the table, about six inches in, where the lamp had evidently stood, it had been burnt by the paraffin; I say from the explosion of the lamp—the rim of the table was not burnt—the salvage man objected to my moving any of the things—I afterwards valued the premises for Abib; on 3rd Novem<lb/>ber, I think; on the same day as the other parties were there—my valuation was only a few shillings different from Mr. Bottrill's—I valued it to an ingoing tenant at some £30, and the cigarettes and stock at £54 10s. 11d.—I have been in business since 1866—I have been with Mr. Farmer three years as manager—I have been convicted of sleeping with a girl under eighteen—Mr. Farmer knew all about it; I would not go with him without telling him—I have been acting as his servant.</p>

                  </hi>. I and John Edward Lea are members of the firm of Wertheimer, Lea and Co., printers, of Circus Place, London Wall—the prisoner has been in our service for ten years; he was the head man in the wetting department; only one other man, Holmes, was in that depart<lb/>ment—the prisoner had, as well, the general stock of paper to look after, and give out for the machine—wetting consists in preparing paper for the printing machines—the prisoner had a salary of £2 a week for his ordi<lb/>nary work, which ended at seven o'clock—his hours were fifty—four a week, an average of nine a day—when we were busy he would be allowed to stop and work overtime after seven o'clock at 10d. an hour—the fol<lb/>lowing day it was his duty to make out an overtime voucher, which would be signed at the end of the week by our manager, Mr. Plackett—he had no means of checking the overtime; he took the word of the servant—the prisoner having made out the ticket, and Plackett having signed it, it would be handed to Hilman, a foreman of the warehouse, who on the Friday would make up the wages sheet from the vouchers received during the week and the ordinary wages—other men would be under the fore-man, who would be able to check them, but the prisoner and Holmes worked in a place by themselves, and we had no means of checking them—the wages sheet would include the overtime, down to the previous Thursday night—Mr. Hermann Lea paid the wages on the wages sheet and vouchers—early in October I gave instructions to Limmer, the timekeeper in our estab<lb/>lishment, to watch the prisoner—in consequence of what he told me I sent for the prisoner on the 14th October, and, in Plackett's presence, I said to the prisoner that some little time ago, when he was ill and not able to come to work, we paid him his wages, and then later on, when he wanted an advance, we advanced him £10 and I asked him if he did not think it was rather an extraordinary way to repay us by systematically robbing us as. I heard he had been doing for the past year—he denied that, and said he had never robbed us—I then took that voucher dated 13th October, and asked him how it was he had written three hours overtime the previous evening when he had left our place at eight—he made no answer—I asked him (he was looking at the voucher of 11th October) how he had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189311130051"/>
               <p>written twelve hours overtime when he had left at 8.40—he then said he had been in the habit of going oat to supper—I said, referring to the special night, "If that was the case, how was it you took your bag with you, put your ticket on the hook, and said, 'Good night' to all around you?" and I asked him how it was possible for him to come back to our place when the front door was always locked, and the back door was always locked at night not later than half—past eleven—he said he had been in the habit of working twice as hard during the day in order to get away early at night—that was the only explanation he offered—I told him to go back to work—I was away the greater part of that morn<lb/>ing—I believe our manager told him to go—he saw me again in the afternoon, and asked me whether he should go or not—I told him to please himself—he left that day—these two bundles of vouchers are all filled up in his writing—in each case the date on the voucher is the day next subsequent to the day when overtime was worked—I find in the two bundles vouchers dated July 29th, August 2nd, 5th, 9th, 12th, September 2nd, 9th, 30th, and October 4th, 7th, and 11th—in each of those he claims twelve hours overtime, from seven to seven the preceding night—in this voucher for October 13th he claims for three hours overtime, from seven to ten during the preceding night—if he left at half-past ten on September 9th and September 30th there would be an overcharge of eight hours and a half in respect of each day, which would amount to 78. 1d.—if he overcharged eight hours in the voucher of October 4th it would be an overcharge of 6s. 8d.</p>

                  </hi>. I am undergoing sentence for stealing meat from Messrs. Lambert; I pleaded guilty last Sessions—Stepto was an assistant in the shop—it was my duty to weigh the meat—Wilkins is a butcher in Whitecross Street—he was in the habit of coming to the shop and deal<lb/>ing with Messrs. Lambert—in July last Gillons and Stepto and I arranged to send meat to Sunlight through Stepto, as Gillons was tried and con<lb/>victed here. (<hi rend="italic">See Vol. C XVIII., p.</hi> 1266)—on 14th July Sunlight came to the shop, and Gillons and I told him to take some meat—it was my duty to put meat which was sold at the back of the shop for the porter to take away in the afternoon—we finished about five or 5.30, and Stepto, Gillons and I went to a public—house at the corner of Whitecross Street—Stepto left us at the corner of Redcross Street, and said he was going to see Wilkins; he came back with Wilkins, and Wilkins and I went to a public—house, where he gave me £6 10s. for the meat he had had—we guessed it at fifty—two to fifty—four stone, at 2s. 6d. a stone—it had not been weighed, but I think Wilkins said he had weighed it—he offered me £6; I took £6 10s., and gave Gillons £2, Stepto £2, and <hi rend="italic">Sunlight</hi> 10s.; that left me £2 for myself—we arranged to have a hind-quarter of beef—I do not recollect the date—<hi rend="italic">Sunlight</hi> took it from the shop; Stepto told him to fetch it—I received something under a sovereign from Stepto as my share—he said he had been to see Wilkins, who paid him somewhere about £3—after that two top sides were taken, after which I met Wilkins—he said he had seen Stepto, and they could not exactly agree about the price of it, and told him to leave the money till he had something else, and said, "Bring me something worth having, and I will pay you altogether"—the market value of the beef which Wilkins paid me £6 10s. for was about £14—I was taken in custody on Septem<lb/>ber 1st—before I was brought up here I made a statement to the Inspector of the Meat Market.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant</hi>). On November 2nd, I went with Smart to 4, Brick Lane, at ten p.m.—Smart knocked at the door of the third floor back room and called "Dick"—he said, "Come in"—Smart opened the door and we went in—Richards was lying on the bed in his clothes, covered over, and Onley was standing at the side—as soon as we entered she said, "Oh! we are put away; it is the police"—we told Richards to get off the bed, we were police officers, and were going to search for counterfeit coin and implements for making the same—he would not get off the bed—with the assistance of other officers we pulled him off the bed and searched, but nothing was found on him—Onley said, "We are put away"—Richards said, "Who done it?"—on the mantelpiece was this tin, containing fourteen counterfeit sixpences, unfinished, all dated 1875—at this time the prisoners were struggling and fighting with us to get at it—I found on a table some files, some plaster of Paris in a handkerchief, and some in a bag, cloths; four metal spoons, one in the ashes under the fire, another in rubbish by the side of the fire, and two in a basket; this piece of metal, some silver—sand, a piece of glass and tissue paper—Smart found a plaster of Paris mould, which Onley knocked out of his hand—I submitted all those things to Mr. Webster—after the struggle with the prisoners, when they were quiet, Richards said, "What is the charge?"—I told him it was possessing counterfeit coin and implements for making them—he said, "We are fair done; you have got me straight, blind me, you have; who put me away? I am done"—the woman kept on shouting, "I told you so; I told you so"—I handed over Richards to the other policemen, and accompanied the woman to the station—when charged at the station with having implements for making counterfeit coin, and fourteen counterfeit coins, Richards said, "Quite true"—Onley said nothing—Richards gave the name of James Richards, and Onley gave Ann Onley—when the woman was asked her name and address Richards said, "I know nothing about the woman; she is only one that lived with me to help me in my business"—she said nothing—he did not say what his business was—when we stripped him in the cell passage, he said, "I wasn't a proper maker, I have only just started at the game;" and he again asked who put him away.</p>

I live at the Lindens, Bethune Road, Stamford Hill, and am a hardware agent—I am the vicar's churchwarden of St. Mark's, West Hackney—I was appointed in 1892—at that time the prisoner was already the peoples' churchwarden—an account was kept in our joint names at the London and County Bank, Hackney branch—either of us had the right of signing cheques, but, as a matter of fact, since the account was opened I have never drawn any cheques on it; the prisoner has had charge of this special account—Campbell was the gardener of the church, attending to the church grounds, and organ blower—his salary was £3 a month, paid monthly, for attending to the grounds, and £2 10s. per quarter for blowing the organ; so that for the last month</p>

Baldwin or order, is in theprisoner's writing—the endorsement is not his—the faces of cheques "I" and "J," both payable to J. Cordell or order, are in the prisoner's writing—the endorsement on "I" is not his, but I believe the endorsement on "J" to be his—they are both for £12 17s. 6d.—"K," "L," "O," and "R" are chequesdrawn to R. Smith or order by the prisoner, and, to the best of my belief, all endorsed by him—the churchwardens owed no money to R. Smith; we have no such name on our books—I gave the prisoner into custody, and charged him with forgery on October 24th, when he was brought up on another charge at the North London Police court—he said, "Don't make it too hard for me, Simkins; I am very sorry.</p>

               <p>prisoner operated on; I have a separate fund called the Mission Account which I operate on—it is distinct and separate from the account he was alone authorised to deal with—things have been altered since then—the prisoner had no authority to draw in favour of Campbell unless the amount was due to him—the only instructions churchwarden have is that they ate to liquidate accounts as they come in; they have no written in structions to that effect—the only control over the churchwardens is the Easter audit—the prisoner's books have not been audited since Easter 1892—it has always been the rule in connection with St. Mark's Church for the last twenty—seven years that all money shall be paid into the bank and all cheques drawn to order, and every account paid legitimately has been drawn to order—there was nothing to prevent the prisoner drawing a cheque to self and paying cash, because he had sole charge of the account prisoner has since paid the £3 9s. to Baldwin—nothing was owing to Campbell on 26th July, 1893, when this cheque was drawn—I have the cheque here with which he was paid for July—Campbell, and each of the persons except Smith, would be paid by the prisoner; not by me—I have gone through the accounts and speak of my own knowledge when I say the people have not been paid by these cheques—this £4 12s. has never been paid to Campbell; it was never owing to him, and has not been paid to him since—the last payment before that to Campbell was on 3rd, 1893, for £5 10s., which would include the organ blowing for the quarter and the gardening for the month and nothing more would be due to him before 3rd August when he would be entitled to £63 which he was paid on 4th August; as the bank—book shows—I have never drawn a bearer cheque to pay an account at St. Mark's, nor has the prisoner—I might have to make small payments out of my Mission account: I always draw "order—cheques for those—I have never altered "order" to bearer, and cashed the cheques myself—most of the cheques produced at the Police-court were crossed; but anyone can cross a cheque made out a cheque to Campbell, I should think it deecidedly wrong—to endorse it with Campbell's name if I intended to give Campbell the money—I think it wrong and unwise to endorse anyone's name—if I drew Cheque to Campbell's order and crossed it, and then gave him cash for it because he asked me, I should not myself endorse his name on the back—the prisoner had plenary control of the account.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Chilton Road, Bromley-by-Bow—on 13th September I was present at the Vestry Hall, Cable Street, at the Court held by Mr. Williamson for the revision of votes—I heard the claim of Thomas Newman put forward—I saw the claim, and heard objection taken to it, that the "X" was not the "X" of Thomas Newman—the barrister disallowed the claim—later in the day Hutchings was called and sworn, and I heard him give evidence—he said that Thomas Newman had signed his "X" on this paper, and he had witnessed it, and upon his evidence the barrister allowed the claim—Hutchings said that Newman was not able to write his name, and he had authorised him to put the "X" for him and he witnessed it, that a "X" was placed on the paper and he witnessed it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was acting on the instructions of Mr. Morris, as his agent—I did not hear Hutchings say anything about knowing Newman, I only inferred that he knew him as a canvasser, having called upon him—I have been canvassing for registration many years, in all districts in the East of London; on some occasions we have to call several times on an elector, there is a difficulty in catching them at home—I know Choppin's Court; it is a poor locality—many of the people are fairly well off, in well-built houses, and a very respectable class of inhabitants, in regular employment.</p>

I am assistant surgeon to the G Division—early on September 26th I was called to the station—I saw the prisoner there, and a female child dressed in a small woollen shawl and a thin nightgown, not sufficient to keep it warm; it was whining, and was dirty and very emaciated, I suppose from starvation, as there were no signs of disease, and no diarrhoea—it only weighed 5 lbs. 10 oz. with its clothes on—it was stated to be five months eighteen days old, but subsequently I found it was six months eighteen days, and the usual weight of a child of that age is 16 lbs. or 17 lbs.—if it was of ordinary size when born, it would weigh 15 lbs. at seven months—it would not remain at that light weight with proper care—it was not suffering from any disease.</p>

I am a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, Edinburgh—I live at 26, East Road—I attended the prisoner when she was confined with this child on March 7th—it was very small and weakly, and its face was covered with down, more like hair—it certainly did not weigh more than 4 lbs—I attended it again, a week or a fortnight afterwards, suffering from gastric disease—it was more like an old man than a baby; it was wizened—I attended the prisoner in 1892 for debility; I do not recollect a miscarriage—I did not think the child would live, and I told them so—if the food was not properly assimilated, that would retard its growth—a child suffering from occa sional attacks of diarrhoea would be weak—I was not in Court when Dr. Forbes was examined—if the child suffered from diarrhoea, that would be sufficient to account for what I saw—any child would be weak if it had occasional attacks of diarrhoea—I know what Dr. Forbes does not know.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 111, Commercial Road—I am a tailor—early in October, a suggestion was made to me that I should take part in passing bad money—in consequence I communicated with the police, and subsequently acted under their instructions, keeping up a communication with the person who first spoke to me and with other men—on October 12th, I went to where Clements lived, and while waiting there, about eight p.m., the three prisoners drove up in a trap—Clements asked me what I wanted there—I told him a falsehood, that I went round to <hi rend="italic">Old Steve</hi>, the maker, that he had no coins to sell me, and that I should work always with them—<hi rend="italic">Old Steve</hi>, I believe, is the man who makes the coins Clements said, "If you like you can work along with me on the Friday"—the other prisoners could hear the conversation—he said he was going to Whitechapel; that was my way home, and I got into the trap to go with them—before we started, Clements told me that Cohen went into a Post—office the same day and called for a 30s. postal order, and put down coins which the lady picked up; and she said two were bad, and then Cohen took up the postal order and ran out of the shop, and turned and used dirty language—Cohen did not hear him say that—we drove to a coffee—</p>

               <p>shop in Whitechapel, and I, Clements, and Cohen went in and they divided the money they had made between the three—I think it was about 8s.—they did not say where they had obtained it—I and Clements went out, leaving the other two prisoners to take the trap home—Clements left me in Whitechapel Road, and told me I was to call for him at nine o'clock on Friday morning—I told that to Thompson—on Friday morning I called at Clements's place, about 8.15 or 8.30—he had breakfast, and went with, me to the lodging—house, and he got the horse and trap and drove down to the coffee—house where Friedman lived about 9.30—I went inside and called Friedman—Clements said that he and I should drive in the trap, and Friedman should go and get the rug and the <hi rend="italic">swag—Friedman</hi> went away, and when he came back he brought the rug, and some coins in a hand kerchief, which he handed to Clements; he looked inside—they were handed to me; I told him he should keep them, and Clements took them—we got into the trap and drove to Norwood—Clements handed Fried man some coins—he asked me if I should like to go inside with him—I told him I did not know how to pass counterfeit coin for postal orders—he said, "I will tell you. First, Friedman goes in and asks for postal orders; in about two minutes you should go in and call for a postage stamp, and when the woman comes to serve you, if she finds the coins are bad, then you should stop her while he goes away with the postal order"—we drove about Norwood, buying postal orders and passing bad money—Friedman and Clements went in the shops, I did not; they went to five or six post—offices—Friedman generally went in for the postal orders, and was followed by Clements for the postage stamps—I don't know how many postal orders they got, I reckon five or six of different values—I was with them the whole time—I cashed four of the orders; two were for 10s. and 7s. 6d., I believe—he told me to go inside, and when I was. asked to write my name I should not write my own name, but Alexander on one and Smith on the other—these are the two orders I cashed at Peckham Rye—the other two I cashed I signed Smith; one was at Forest Hill, I believe—I received them from Clements—Friedman cashed a 20s. order a little way past the Crystal Palace—I was outside in the trap with Clements when it was done—we came back by way of Bermondsey, and coming through there Clements said, "We will go down to <hi rend="italic">Old Steve's</hi> place and see if he has got any coins ready for us"—we met <hi rend="italic">Old Bill</hi>, one of the makers—Clements got out of the trap and spoke to him, and then <hi rend="italic">Old Bill</hi> got in the trap—Clements asked him if he had got any coins to sell him; he said he had a dozen half—crowns—Clements took them and handed him 4s. for them, I think it was—we came back and shared the proceeds, and I had 4s. as my share, and I left them.</p>

Tell your solicitor and the Magistrate that, and they will arrest Myers"—you said I was to give information that Myers had been passing bad money—I did not tell you that I had been at a gambling club, and saw Myers, who had given me the bad coin which was found on me—you said to me, "How was it I am locked up?"—I said I was in a house playing cards, and Myers came in and told me a friend was outside, and when I got outside I was arrested, and on me was found bad money—I never said Myers had given me the bad money; he did not give it to me.</p>

I am the wife of Albert Sheffield, the postmaster at 80, Stevens Road, West Ham—on the evening of 12th October Friedman came in behind another youth, who, I believe, was Cohen—the one who first came in asked me for a 15s. postal order—I went to the desk and stamped and signed it, and laid it on the counter beside me, and he said, "How much is it?"—six half—crowns were already laid on the counter—he put his hand in his pocket as if to feel for more money, and then Friedman asked for a penny stamp, and gave me a good shilling in payment—I counted the money, and found the first half—crown was bad—I said, "This is a bad one"—I took up the second, and said, "This is bad"—he took it from my hand to look at it, and said, "Are they? I did not know they were; they are just as I had them given to me"—I placed them on the desk and went to call my husband, and while I was gone he bolted out of the shop—I returned, and found Friedman had remained in the shop—he said, "That fellow has bolted; I wanted to ask you if I sent a postal order to Australia could it be changed there?"—my husband came in, and said, "No, it could not"—Friedman said, "We have got a bet on"—he went away—I next saw him at the Police—station, and picked him out from among several others—Friedman's companion in the post—office was wearing a dark overcoat and hard felt hat, and he had curly hair, lighter than Cohen has now—I believe Cohen to be the man—</p>

Please send 111/2 yards of silk.—J. Deligny"—upon that I took the order to Mr. Ormsby, of the cashier's department; he knew who the credit customers were, and having looked at his book, he entrusted me to deliver the goods—I packed the silk in brown paper, enclosing the invoice, and gave it to her—I asked her to sign the invoice, and saw her sign "G. Goddard"—it was sent out on approbation, to be returned if it was not the right pattern—a few days afterwards, no answer having come from Madame Deligny, she was com<lb/>municated with, and we got an answer.</p>

I am a greengrocer, of 33, Verdure Road, Homerton—on June 26th I received a note from a strange man, in consequence of which I took a horse and cart and harness to 43, Harrogate Road, South Hackney, and saw a respectable—looking man, who hired them till eight o'clock the same night, to move some furniture—I left the horse and cart, and two rugs, and did not see the cart again till about three weeks ago, when it was in the possession of a pork butcher—I have never seen the horse and harness again—the property was worth £38; £16 is for the horse—I thought he was the owner of the house—I said first that he could not have them, and then he sent again.</p>

He said, 'Yes, you can have it at your own price.' We then went to a piece of waste land at the rear of 47, Cooper Road; he fetched the harness out of No. 47, and I said, 'I will give you 30s. for it—asked "Do you know the man?"—he said, "Yes"—I asked him whether he had any witnesses—he said, "Yes, I have two very good witnesses"—I said, "Who are they?"—he said, "The landlord and landlady of 47, Cooper Road"—I went there with him, and asked them in his presence if they saw anything of the transaction—they said they knew nothing about it—I said, "What has become of the harness?"—he said, "I sold it to a man in Smithfield for 5s.; I don't know who he is," and that the name was on the cart when he bought it.</p>

You lie, you b—, you did; you will never ask her again"—Pryke was on the ground at that time with his back against the wall—Robinson up with his fist and was <hi rend="italic">going</hi> to give him a blow—Wright said, "Hold on, Bill, one at a time; leave him alone to me, I will settle the b——"—I saw no blows after that—I left and went back to my shop; a crowd of people had assembled by that time—about ten minutes after I saw the two return together, Wright smoking a cigar; Pryke was still on the ground and the policeman was there.</p>

I am the wife of John Beckwith, of 31, Cullum Street, next door to Mrs. Welch—on the night of 18th August I was standing by my door with a baby on my arm—I saw three men coming along the dead wall opposite, holding each other's arm—Pryke was in the middle—I recognise the prisoners as the other two—Wright let go Pryke's arm, and hit him on the side of the face, near the ear, and knocked him on the ground, and said, "You shall never have the chance of taking my wife away as you did the other man's wife," and he kicked him in the leg—Robinson picked him up by his coat—sleeve, and hit him in the nose, and said, "You b——, can't you stand? If you can't I will finish you"—Wright pushed Robinson into the road, and said, "Go away, Bul," calling him a dreadful name, and said, "I will finish the cow's son"—they then left him on the ground, and walked to the corner of the street—I saw a policeman, and crossed over to him—I did not see Mrs. Welch there, she had turned away to her house—a chair was fetched, and Pryke was placed upon it—I saw both the prisoners come back smoking cigars; they came up to Pryke, and Wright said "Hallo, you b——, ain't you dead? If you ain't you ought to be. I should like to know the neighbour that lent you the chair to sit on"—the policeman was there, stooping down feeling the poor man's leg, which was bleeding—I said to Wright, "You two wicked brutes; ain't you satisfied with what you have done?"—they told me to hold my noise; if I did not they would have me <hi rend="italic">set</hi>—the police<lb/>man then asked their names and addresses—Wright said he lived at 10, Little Cullum Street; Robinson said he lived at a lodging—house in Angel Lane—the three men seemed as though they had had a little drink—when Pryke was on the ground his right leg was doubled underneath him and the other leg was stretched out—that was after he was knocked down a second time—his trousers looked as if his bone was sticking out, and the blood was pouring out on the pathway.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I am house surgeon at West Ham Hospital—I was on duty there on the 18th August when Pryke was brought in—I examined him; he had a compound fracture of the right leg; the bone was broken about four inches above the ankle; the fracture of the two bones was on the same level and at the same distance from the foot—from the fact of the two bones being broken on the same level, I should say it was caused by direct violence, as by a kick—in my opinion he was distinctly the worse for drink when he came in—I should say it could have been caused by a fall, but that is extremely unlikely—he could not have walked after receiving the injury—it would have required considerable violence to fracture both bones—I found no other injuries about the face or body—I continued to attend him for ten days—I saw no bruise on his face; he did not complain of any.</p>

Foster said he wished he had got a lot of them"—the prisoners made no answer; each kept repeating the same statement that they had been to the Crown, Distillery, Salutation, and Abercrombie.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the post—office at Chichester—I produce an original telegram which was handed in at Goodwood Grand Stand on July 28th, addressed to "Ball, High Road, Tottenham," and an original telegram addressed to Cress well—they are stamped "Goodwood"—I paid £5 to a person who called at the post—office—this is the receipt, signed "W. Ball"—I believe Butler is the man—I picked him out at Edmonton from a number of others—the person to whom I paid the money would have to state from whom it came—he signed it "E.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>). This matter was placed in my hands at the beginning of October, and on October 7th I saw both the post—office witnesses at Singleton and Chichester, and obtained from them a description of the person to whom the money was paid, and on my in<lb/>structions the prisoners were arrested—when they were brought to the station I said, "I am an inspector of police; I hold a warrant against you both"—I read it to them, and said, "You will also be charged with obtaining £3 from Mr. Cresswell, of the Mitre, Greenwich, by false pre<lb/>tences"—Marden said, "I know nothing about it"—Butler said, "I don't know Cresswell"—I then produced the original telegrams handed in at Goodwood Grand Stand, and the two receipts for £5 and £3—</p>

               <p>Butler said that the writing on the telegram was different from that on the order—Marden said, "I heard I was going to be arrested, and was going to the City to consult a solicitor"—on October 21st I produced the memorandum—book to Marden, and said, "This was found at your address"—he said, "Let me see it," looked at it, and said, "Yes, that is mine" I called his attention to page 1, on which the name of George Creswell is written—he said, "I used to send Creswell telegrams, and that is why his address is there; I believe he wrote that himself"—as to the page at the end of the book, he Mid, "That is not my writing; that was written by a man who used to send telegrams for me, named Wood"—I said, "Can Wood be seen?"—he said, "I don't know his address; he lives somewhere at Putney"—he also said that most of page A was his writing—I then showed him a letter to Harris in an envelope—he said, "I wrote that to Harris because some<lb/>body said I stole his pin, but I did not"—I showed this letter—card to Butler, and said, "Mr. Ball says he received this from you"—he said, "Yes, Mr. Ball owes me £1; I also called, but did not get the money."</p>

                  </hi>. I have made handwriting a study for some years—I have examined the documents in this case, and the two original telegrams and two receipts, also the documents which are in Butler's admitted writing, including the message from the station, and the letter card sent to Mr. Ball—the receipts for £5 and £3 signed "W. Ball" and "George Creswell" are in Butler's writing—the "Mr. Ball" on the letter—card, and "W. Ball" on the receipt are, in my opinion, in the same writing; Butler's letter to his wife, and the two messages from the Police-court, and the book, and Marden a letter to Harris, are all in the same writing as the two original telegrams; one of the telegrams is written with a blue pencil, and the writing in the memorandum—book is in blue pencil—believe the two telegrams are in the same writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have devoted myself to this branch of knowledge for ten years—all the documents I have alluded to are in the same writing, but no man's writing is absolutely the same all the way through—one exhibit in Marden's writing is absolutely vertical, but the others are the same as exhibit "C"—the two cards are more sloping than anything else—the letter to Mr. Harris is not so sloping as the others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> In the message sent to Butler's wife the "B" in the name "Ball" logins with a little curve at the top; and the signature,. "George Butler," in this paper given to the police, commences in the same way—the "W" in the word "Wife" agrees almost exactly with the "W" in "W. Ball," and the small "a" in "station" agrees with the small "a" in "Ball"—in the receipt signed "George Cress well," the capital "G" corresponds with the "G" in "Goodwood" in the letter—</p>

               <p>Marden's writing on the first page of the book is more upright than that written at the station—it is my impression that persons writing in a memorandum—book which they hold in their hands would write more vertically—one of the telegrams is written rather more vertically than the other, but there is no other difference between them.</p>

I am a machinist, of 40, Burwash Road, Plumstead, which is at right angles to Heavytree Road—on October 8th I was told something by a neighbour, and went into my garden; anyone could get there by jumping over a fence about 3 ft, 6 in. high—I met a constable, I looked at the top of the garden while he looked at the side, and my wife came out with a large table—lamp, and held it over where the prisoner was concealed under some steps in a crouching position, two feet from me—I asked him what he was doing there—he said he came in with the rest—no one else was there—the constable took him in custody—next day I found this watch at the spot where the prisoner was found.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The watch was concealed between the wall and a post, in a place only two inches wide—persons belonging to the houses were searching, but not in my garden—I found the prisoner at 7.45;</p>

               <p>there were seven fences to jump over to get to where he was—he could not get out into the road without coming through my house or getting over the fences—one man escaped, and Mr. Weeks' door and window next door were found open, and they had been fastened before.</p>
