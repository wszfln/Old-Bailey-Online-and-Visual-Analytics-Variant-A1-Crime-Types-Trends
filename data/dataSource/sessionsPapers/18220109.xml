            . I was porter to Mr. Seymour. On Friday last, I was in the shop about five o'clock or five minutes after, and heard the windows break. I am sure it was five minutes after five, for I looked at the clock, it was dusk. I should have known a man's face at that time, by the light of the day. I ran out and caught his hand in the window.</p>

            . I am a constable. I saw the prisoner very close to Potter's window about half-past five o'clock in the evening; it was quite dark, he was looking about on each side. I found him with a flute in his left hand, close to his breast; he was drawing the other out of the window. I seized him and forced him into a grocer's shop - he threw them away, and I picked them up. I informed the prosecutor. I had observed the prisoner lurking about the shop with two others, and heard the window crack, the other two were very near the shop and ran away when I seized the prisoner - they were waiting two doors off, looking at the prisoner; they had both been at the window themselves, which of them broke it, I cannot say.</p>

He had two cart mares; I saw them last on Thursday afternoon, the 13th of December, about four o'clock, in the field which was fenced round, and the gate fastened with a with. There were four horses, these two were chestnut cart mares, one was six years old, and the other nine. They had no shoes on then, but had worn shoes for years. I missed them the next morning, and traced them out of the gate, but no further; I have seen them since.</p>

I saw the prisoner Home at the house about six o'clock in the evening, in company with another (not Cutts), he left at eleven o'clock at night.

            . I am proprietor of the two mares. On the morning of the 14th, I was informed they were stolen; they are worth 25 l. each. I made the best of my way to London, and in consequence of information which I received, went with Rice, an officer of Union Hall, to several places in Paddington, and enquired if any horse-dealers lived there - we went to No. 8, Canal wharf, Paddington, to two stables, one was locked and the other padlocked; the door of the padlocked stable was partly open. I looked in, and immediately recognized one of my mares, I could see her distinctly, and the other behind it, I thought was mine, but could not see that distinctly. In consequence of information, the officer sent for Cutts, who came; he was known there by the name of Smith, only. I told him I and my man were going to town to buy a cart horse (my man was with me), I asked if he had any thing of that description to sell; he said he had, and opened the stable which we had not looked into - there were four nags, and one horse of rather the cart kind; I said they would not suit - we came out and asked if he had any thing of the cart kind, he said</p>
               <p>"No." I then asked if that stable belonged to him, pointing to the one which we had looked into, he said</p>
               <p>"Yes." I asked if there was not any cart horse there; he hesitated, and said no, only two colts that had never been shod, and a nag that belonged to a gentleman, and was rather lame. I said I sometimes bought colts, and asked if he could not shew them to me; he hesitated, and appeared conscious of what we were searching for. He unlocked the stable, I went in, and immediately said</p>
               <p>"Here is one that will suit me, and here is another, they are both stolen, and are my property." Rice said he belonged to Union Hall, and must take him in charge; he said,</p>

               <p>"But you will give me a chance to get my money back, I will go and shew you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182201090006"/>the man I received the horses from." I gave the horses in care of my man. It is impossible he could mistake them for colts which had never been shod. He took us to a public-house at Paddington, the other prisoner came to the door; he pointed him out as the man who brought them to him - the officer said he apprehended him for felony; he scarcely said a word. We asked how he brought the horses into town, he gave no answer. Cutts was then very anxious to go home to change his clothes, and asked if we had not done with him - we took him to Union Hall, the Magistrate was not there. Hone was locked up, and Cutts taken to a public-house; a person came in and called him Cutts, before that, we understood his name to be Smith. They were afterwards examined, what they said was not taken down - no promise or threat were held out to them. Cutts said the horses were brought to his stable the night before (this was Saturday) by two strange men, that Home was one of them, that it was late at night, they could not go to a public-house, and they brought them to his stable, engaged it for the night, and brought a truss of hay for them. He said nothing about having bought them. Home said he came from Shropshire. The Magistrate asked what he had been doing lately; he hesitated, and at last said,</p>
               <p>"I acknowledge that I stole the horses." The horses appeared to have been brought a considerable distance, they could scarcely walk, their feet were pared down, and could not walk on the road without pain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How far is Godstone from town - A. Twenty-three miles. Paddington is about twenty-six miles from Godstone. I was directed to Cutt's stable as a horse dealer. I saw my horses by pulling the door a little open. None of the horses in the other stable were exactly of the cart breed, but one was rather heavy. He did not say they were not his; Home did not deny it. Cutts said</p>
               <p>"The men who brought them were entire strangers, I received the horses as if for sale."</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with the prosecutors to several places, we came to No. 8, Wharf, Paddington, and found two stables locked - the one padlocked, was rather loose; I opened it a little, the prosecutors looked in, and knew one of the horses; I enquired whom the stables belonged to, and sent to the prisoner; I accosted him as Smith, and asked if the stable, No. 8, belonged to him, and said a friend of mine was waiting to buy a horse, if he had any for sale; he said he had, and came to the yard, and found the prosecutors there; we first went into a stable, where there were four nags, and one rather a heavy horse, the prosecutor said he wanted a horse that would work immediately; Cutts said that would suit him - the prosecutors declined, we asked if he had any more, he said,</p>
               <p>"No, no more mares in the cart way." I pointed to the other door, and said,</p>
               <p>"Does this stable belong to you," he said it did; we asked if had anything in the cart way there; he said, No; there was nothing but one nag belonging to a gentleman, and two colts, they had never been shod yet. I asked if he had the key of that stable; he said he had - he hesitated, and at last opened it, the prosecutor went in, and said,</p>
               <p>"Here is two that will suit me;" I said,</p>
               <p>"It is no use, Mr. Smith, going on any further, those two are stolen; I am an officer, and shall take you on suspicion of being concerned." He was very much embarrassed, and said,</p>
               <p>"God bless me, I can shew you the man I had them of; give me an opportunity of getting my money back;" I said I would give him every opportunity I could - they appeared like two cart mares; no one could mistake them for colts never shod. He talked very fast, and took us about three hundred yards, to a public-house, and Home came out, and stood still a moment, he said</p>
               <p>"That is the man that brought them to my stable;" I said,</p>
               <p>"Young man, I charge you with horse stealing;" he refused saying any thing about them, he only gave me his name, and Cutts gave me his name as

               <p>"I may as well tell you," his wife said,</p>
               <p>"If you do not, I will;" he then said a man came first of all, and engaged this stable for the mares; I asked who the other man was, he said,</p>
               <p>"Oh!

I took them to Union Hall, locked Home up, and took Smith to a public-house, a man came in, and addressed him as Cutts. They were examined in the evening, what Hone said was taken in writing, in the minute book, and the final examination was taken on paper.

             re-examined. I am speaking of the first examination. After the examination I enquired of the prisoner Home, about Hunter; he said the man who was with him, when he took the horses out of the field, he knew nothing of, nor his name, but that that man told him he knew a man in London, who wanted two horses, and persuaded him to take them from Getting's field. He always said he would give me every information he could.</p>

I went to Home in prison, and asked if he had seen any of the party who was with him when the horses were stolen, he said No, and if he could tell me where to find the man, he would, and if he came to see him, he would tell somebody. The mares feet appeared to be recently cut down. Cutts walked very slow towards the public-house. I have had information about another man, who has absconded.

               <p>"No". The prisoner helped me to search the house all over, and then he went out for a walk with Mr. Reyolds, and at dinner time, I insisted on finding it; the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"Do you think I have got it;" I said, I did not know, but as only we slept in the room, and I barred the door, I thought nobody but him could have it - he said if he was suspected he would apply to the Magistrate directly; I charged him with it, he denied it. I recollected he had a gold seal on his own watch, which he had not got at this time - I asked where it was, he said he had lost it. I sent for a constable, he acknowledged having the watch, and took us to a chandler's shop at Tottenham, where it was tied up in a parcel; his seal and key were hung on my watch.</p>

I went after him over into Bishopsgate-street, and asked where he was going, and what he had got; he made no answer. I brought him back, he said he hoped I would say nothing to Mr. Myers. It contained a cod fish, and four pair of soles; I said I must inform Mr. Myers, he said, then he would send him to gaol, and he must go off. I called Mr. Myers, and we overtook him by the Exchange.</p>

On the 10th of December, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, they both left the house without notice; and this property was missed. Between eight and nine o'clock the same night, I found them in St. George's-fields, walking in the road - I took a bundle from Tyrrell, and a bag from Simpkins, containing the property belonging to the Institution, they reproached each other. One was employed in washing, and the other as a servant. The bundle contained two shifts, a drawer cloth, three remnants of silk, eight aprons, and two slips of muslin; the bag contained half a yard, and some remnants of muslin, cut up in caps; some bits of lace, a frock, two combs, a gown, two napkins, a pocket, and two gown bodies.</p>

            , a Police officer. I was employed in December last, by Kinsey, the officer, to meet the prisoner; my husband also attended on different occasions. I was introduced to the prisoner on the evening of the 11th of December, at the door of the Horseshoe, public-house, Goswell-street, (I did not know him before) by a woman, as a person from Kent, who dealt in smuggled goods, and wished to be supplied with notes; they called them screens - she said I wanted 5 l. screens; she called the prisoner Job Jones, he said it was too late to get me any that night; the people were gone to bed, where they were at. He told me to meet him again at six o'clock the next evening, at the same place.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went there next evening, did you see Kinsey - A. I met Kinsey at the Jacob's Wells, public-house; my husband was there, and the woman; I was searched there, they gave me a sovereign - I had no other money, but some silver, which Kinsey gave me to spend; I had no note of any kind. I went to the Horseshoe, public-house, with the woman - when I went in, the prisoner was there, he desired me to wait a-bit, and he went out; I remained there, and in about five or ten minutes he brought me the 5 l. screen; he laid it on the table, wrapped up in a bit of brown paper - I took it up, and laid the sovereign down, and he took it up; he told me the tens were better than the fives; I said if I had any luck with the 5 l., I thought I should take a 10 l.; we parted. I went immediately to the Jacob's Wells, and gave Kinsey the note - I wrote my name and date on it, (looks at a note), this is it, it has</p>
               <p>"Bought of Job Jones, 12th December, 1821, at the Horseshoe, public-house, Goswell-street, for 1 l., by me, H. Goff." I saw him again next day, he rather refused to serve me, he said he could not serve me that day; I must come on Thursday, for the man was out of town who supplied him. I went on Thursday the 20th, but he was so busy, I stopped till night; and could not get served - I did not see him doing any thing, but he could not attend to me; there was a great many people there, he appointed to meet me at two o'clock the next day. I went to the Jacob's Wells, Kinsey and my husband were there - I was searched, and received a sovereign, and some silver from Kinsey. I went to the Horseshoe, public-house, where I saw the prisoner; I told him I wanted another 5 l. screen; he went with me down Old-street Road, to the White Horse, public-house, Brick-lane; I waited there while he went to fetch the note, he returned in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and brought me a 5 l. note, wrapped up in a bit of a newspaper, and put it into my hand - I looked at it, and gave him the sovereign; we had something to drink, which I paid for; we came back to the Horseshoe, public-house, where I parted with him. I went to the Jacob's Wells, public-house, gave the note to Kinsey, and marked it, (looks at one), this is it; it has</p>
               <p>"H. Goff bought this note of Job Jones, at the White Horse, public-house, Brick-lane, 21st December, 1821." Next day, (22d) I went to the Jacob's Wells, public-house, and was searched as before, and received a sovereign and some silver, and went to the Horseshoe, public-house; I went in and looked, and saw the prisoner, he came out - I told him I came for another 5 l. screen, we went together down Seward-street, to the Leopard, public-house, and had a pint of beer - he went out, and I went out, and walked up and down by the house; he went away, and brought a 5 l. note, and gave it to me; I looked at it, and gave him the sovereign - I said if I had any luck with it, I should come and see him again on Monday, or the day after Christmas day. I went and gave the note to Kinsey, after marking it, at the Edingboro' Castle, public-house, (looks at one), this is it; it is marked as the others. I went the day after Christmas day, he was not there - I saw him on Thursday the 27th. Before that, I went to the Jacob's Wells, public-house, and saw Kinsey, my husband, 
               <persName id="t18220109-22-person219">Lawrence</persName>
             an officer, and Welch; I was searched, and Kinsey gave me a sovereign, marked with a K, on the dragon side - I had no note about me; the sovereign was wrapped up in a bit of a lottery bill of Hazard's, and Kinsey kept the other part. I went to the Horseshoe, public-house, and saw the prisoner; I told him I wanted two, I was to ask for two, but only buy one. We went together from there, to the White Horse, public-house, Brick-lane - I walked backwards and forwards before the house while he fetched the notes; he came back to me, and we went into the passage of the house; I told him I had altered my mind, and could take but one - he only had one in a piece of blue paper, which he gave me; I gave him the sovereign which he put in his pocket without looking at it, and in the paper in which I received it; we came along together near to the Pitt's Head, public-house, Old-street<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182201090011"/>Road, and he was apprehended there, as I gave the officer a signal; it was about three o'clock in the afternoon when he was taken. I went home; (looks at a note), this is the one I received; I have written,</p>
               <p>"H. Goff bought this note of Job Jones, at the White Horse, public-house, Brick-lane, for 1 l., 27th December, 1821." I gave it to Kinsey, that evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Who introduced you to the prisoner - 
               <persName id="t18220109-22-person220">A. Mary Dowling</persName>
            . Whenever I applied to him, he went away, and returned with them; this is the first time I was ever employed on such business. My husband introduced Dowling to me; she called the prisoner Job Jones, and he answered to that name - she told him my husband dealt largely in bad notes, but we had a bad sort and wanted a better; he said he could supply me with any amount.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. Q. In what way did you ask him for them - A. I said I wanted to be supplied with them, he said he could supply me to any amount.</p>

            ; in consequence of information which she gave me, I introduced her to Mrs. Goff, and went in company with them to the Jacob's Wells, public-house, Barbican, on the 11th of December. Next day, I went there again, Goff was to buy a 5 l. forged note. I gave her a sovereign; I searched her in the presence of her husband, to see that she had no other money or notes, she had none - she then went towards the Horseshoe, public-house, Goswell-street, with Dowling, Goff and I followed them and saw them go in; they might be there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, they came out together. We went to the Jacob's Wells, public-house, they followed us, Mrs. Goff gave me a 5 l. note (looks at one) this is it; I signed it at the time,</p>
               <p>"12th December, 1821." I met her again on the 21st, at the Jacob's Wells, public-house, and searched her - she was to buy a 5 l. note of Job Jones; I gave her a sovereign, Goff, Lawrence, and I followed her to the Horseshoe, Dowling was not with her; she went into the Horseshoe, and came out alone in a few minutes; we returned to the Jacob's Wells, public-house, where she gave me a 5 l. note; (looks at one) this is it. On the 22d, I saw her again, at the Jacob's Wells, public-house, searched her as before, and gave her another sovereign. Goff and Lawrence, the constable, of Lambeth, were with me. We followed her, and saw her go into the Horseshoe, public-house, she came out in a few minutes in company with the prisoner; they went up Goswell-street, towards Seward-street, and there we lost sight of them - I do not know where they went. I returned to the Horseshoe, public-house. In about half an hour, I saw Mrs. Goff and the prisoner, they parted at the door of the Horseshoe, public-house, the prisoner went in, and Mrs. Goff came on to me; we went to the Edinburgh Castle, public-house, Sweeting's-alley, Cornhill, where she gave me a note, (looks at one), this is it; she wrote on it by my direction, and I put my name 22, 12, 21, on it; I saw her again on the 27th, about two o'clock, at the Jacob's Wells, public-house; Goff, Lawrence, and Welsh, were with me - I searched her, she had no money or note; I gave her a sovereign which I marked with a K, on the dragon side; her husband tore one of Hazard's lottery bills in two, and it was wrapped up in part of it - I kept the other piece; I only gave her one sovereign, which would buy one note; we all followed her, and saw her go into the Horseshoe; she came out in two or three minutes in company with the prisoner; they went up Goswell-street, we were at the Pitt's Head, at the corner of Old-street, Goff was with me; Lawrence, and Welsh, were to follow the prisoner; Mr. Goff, and Lawrence came and gave me information - I saw the prisoner and Mrs. Goff within three yards of the Pitt's Head,; I took him, and took him into the Pitt's Head, handcuffed him, and took him to the Crown, tavern, Clerkenwell, where Lawrence and Goff searched him; Goff said he had found the marked sovereign, and gave it me; I looked at it, and gave it him back; it was wrapped up in part of the lottery bill as before - Lawrence found a 5 l. note on him, I saw him take it from his right hand coat pocket, it appeared to be put in in a careless way; about 4 s. 6 d. in silver, and nine bad shillings wrapped up in paper, were also found on him, there was 3 s. or 4 s. in a row, wrapped in soft paper. Lawrence wrote on the note, and also myself, (looks at one) this is the note; I wrote 27, 12, 21 on it; he was asked how he came by the sovereign, he said he had had it above a fortnight, and took it for some poultry, and that he picked up the counterfeit shillings. I gave Goff the sovereign, and the paper in which it was wrapped; I produce the other part of the bill - I went and found Mrs. Goff at home, in New-street, Lambeth-walk, she gave me a 5 l. note, (looks at one) this is it; we all marked it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Goff, his wife, and Dowling, planned the arrangement - A. Yes. I acted on Dowling's information; I have not seen her since the 14th of December, she had two guineas from Mrs. Goff and has absconded. I searched Goff as diligent as if I expected to find something, though I did not - I believe if she had a note concealed about her, I should have found it. The note found on the prisoner was rumpled. Dowling said this man was in the habit of supplying bad notes.</p>

            . I am a constable of Lambeth. I first engaged in this matter, on the 17th of December, I was to go to the Horseshoe, public-house, and see who came in and out, I did so. I have heard the witness's account, I was with him every day after the 17th - I went to the Horseshoe, public-house, every day; on the 17th I saw the prisoner and Mrs. Goff there, she came into the tap-room, looked round, and went out again; the prisoner jumped up and followed her, he returned in five or six minutes; he stopped about twenty minutes, and then somebody came in and spoke to him, and he said to that person,</p>

               <p>"D - n me, I have lost earning 24 s." The house is one used by bad characters; there are hostlers and waggoners come there. The account of the officers is all true.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you present when the prisoner was apprehended - A. Yes; he was handcuffed, and taken to the Crown, tavern, Clerkenwell; I found a 5 l. note, in his right hand pocket, and marked it, (looks at it), this is the same - I saw Goff take something out of his pocket, which he said was a sovereign. I was present when a sovereign was given to Mrs. Goff, wrapped in a piece of Hazard's lottery bill; that produced is the same, Kinsey gave it her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where was the 5 l. note - A. In his jacket pocket, every thing but the good silver was there.</p>

He asked for some at a lower price, I shewed him some at 24 s. the ream; he said that would do. I then looked out for him half a hundred of pens, at 12 s. a hundred, and asked if he would have a bill, he said Yes, and his name was Scott, No. 44, Bedford-square.

I got the shopman to send for an officer, and I returned to my shop, I had left the prisoner in the care of my wife. Mr. White went with me and one of his partners; two young men came in, there were some persons round the door, but they did not appear to be concerned with the prisoner. I told the prisoner it was a forged note, he said it was not, that it were all right. I told him he should not leave the shop until I had ascertained the truth; Mr. White came in before I sent for the officer, he looked at the note, and said in the hearing of the prisoner, he was of opinion it was forged; he then left the shop. Plank and Wales came in, and the prisoner was searched; the note was examined by several persons, and the two young men looked at it, and White's partner looked at it, returned it me, and I gave it to Plank, after putting my initials upon it; (looking at it), this is the same note, there is R.

            . I am a stationer, and live in Oxford-street. The prisoner came to my shop on the 19th of November, about eight o'clock at night, and said he wanted some writing paper - I shewed him some, he agreed to buy a ream, which came to a guinea; he then said he wanted some quills, which I shewed him; he changed his mind, and asked for pens, and bought one hundred at 4 s. He said, making a sign with his hand,</p>
               <p>"You will send them round to me, at Mr. Outram's." Dr. Outram's house is in George-street, Hanover-square, just behind me, he lives at the corner house; he pointed towards Dr. Outram's. I made him a bill, it came to 25 s., he was going out; he then turned back and said, he might as well pay for them, as perhaps he should not be at home when they came - he then tendered me a 10 s. note; I found I had not sufficient change by 3 l. I went to different neighbours, who could not change it. I asked Mr. Roberts for change, and gave the same note to him, he went to Mr. Shaw's, next door to get it changed. I stood at Mr. Robert's door, he returned, and gave me ten sovereigns. I went back and found the prisoner in the shop, I could then give him but 8 l. 12 s.; I told him I was still 3 s. short of change; he said</p>
               <p>"Never mind, tell the boy to give it to the servant, when you send the goods, and he will give it to me." I said I was much obliged to him, and went to the door with him. He turned towards Dr. Outram's and went away; I sent the goods to Dr. Outram's, half an hour after, with 3 s. wrapped in paper, and in a quarter of an hour after, the Drs. servant returned the goods to me - the prisoner never called for them. About a fortnight after, I heard what had happened at Wedgwood's, I went there, saw the prisoner in the shop, and knew him.</p>

I told him to come into the shop for his change; I marked the note, (looks at one), this is it, it has Adams, Compton-street; I suspected the note, and told him that if two which I had returned to me before were bad, this was a bad one also; he said that was his master's, and where he lived it was written on the order, Adams, No. 32, Compton-street; he said he lived errand boy with him. I sent for an officer; he was searched and a few shillings found on him. I enquired at Compton-street, but no such person was to be found.</p>

               <p>"I was none, till he made me one." He turned round to his seat, and stooped, but what he got from there, I cannot say. When he first got up, he had been sitting at the dinner table.

He took something from his seat, but I cannot say what; he came towards me, I ran towards the stairs, and do not recollect any thing that passed afterwards, but I felt myself stabbed, and him over me; I do not know whether I fell, or whether he pushed me - my own children was close to me, and so was his daughter; I said I was stabbed, and the children screamed Murder!

            , the landlord's son, came, and rescued me from him, and took a knife from him; I suppose it was him that stabbed me - I was stabbed in my bowels, in two places; I was sent to the hospital. Here are the stays which I wore at the time; there is blood on them, and two holes. When I was on the stairs, I felt myself stabbed, and said I was stabbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Before this, there was a pretty loud quarrel between you - A. Yes. I did not strike him, or throw any thing at him; I said I would have him tried for bigamy, and would not go till I had brought him to justice; I stamped and raged a good deal, and refused to leave the room, when he told me - I believe I aggravated him; I was very passionate, and aggravated him as much as I could. I reproached him for having other wives, and told him he wished to bring my two boys up as thieves; he was very passionate as well as I.</p>

            . I am son-in-law of the prisoner's landlord. The prisoner had lodged about four months at the house; I saw the prosecutrix go up stairs, I never saw her before. I was sitting below; there was a disturbance up in the prisoner's room, like people quarrelling, only a general noise - I heard stamping with feet; I could not tell whether it came from one or more persons; then I heard something like a falling down stairs - I ran up, and saw them laying in the landing, at the bottom of the stairs; I thought they was fighting - I tried to part them, and in doing so, I saw the prisoner had a knife in his hand; I seized his arm, and took it from him, and immediately threw it into the one pair back room, and pushed him up stairs, and told him to govern his passion; I did not know that he had stabbed her - he went up and I followed him; he said,</p>
               <p>"What am I to do," I left him, and came down, and heard she was stabbed. I went for an officer, who took him. Nelson appeared in a fright.</p>

            , JUN. I am an officer. I was sent for, and took him; I found a knife on his seat, which was very bloody. The man in whose room the knife was thrown, told the Magistrate, in the prisoner's hearing, that he came into his room, and fetched the knife. I took his apron off, which had a great deal of blood on it, but the blood did not come from the prosecutrix, as the daughter said she got before him, and was cut herself.</p>

I passed on about ten yards, and received a blow on the side of my head from a person behind; I did not see who struck me. I looked round, instantly, and my bundle was immediately snatched away - it was quite light, it was just under a lamp, I saw his face very distinctly, and remembered seeing his face sometime before; he ran down a court, I cried Stop thief! and pursued, but lost sight of him; another man followed him, and was knocked down on the ground. I went through the court, and then went home - my father and mother came back with me, and met the officer, who said he had got the man and property. The bundle belonged to Mrs. Marshall, who employed Mrs. Wollams, a dressmaker, who gave me the bundle. I cannot say whether the man who struck me took it - the prisoner is the one who took the bundle, I am quite certain of him, I speak to his features.</p>

I went out and found who had lost the property - in about a quarter of an hour, I took two men near to the George-public-house, by Angel-alley; one of them was the prisoner.

               <p>"Take care, here he comes;" the ox was coming. I received a blow on my shoulder, and immediately felt my watch being drawn from my fob. I put my hand down to protect it, it had not got out of my fob; I caught hold of my watch, the prisoner drew it through my hand, by some means or other. I touched the outer case, which came off, and he made his way through the mob with the watch - it was about six o'clock in the evening; I pursued, and as I passed through the gang, I received a blow on my side, which took my breath away, till I got about six houses off. I then cried Stop thief! I was only a few yards from him, keeping my eye on him, and crying Stop thief! He was turning up Black Horse-yard, and was stopped - I never lost sight of him from the time he took the watch, till he was stopped. At the time he was seized, I received another blow on my head - the watch was picked up in the kennel, a few yards from him, I am certain of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How could you swear to me - A. He looked me full in the face before he took it.</p>

               <p>- SADLER. I live in Bishopsgate-street. On the morning of the 1st of December, I came into the shop and found the prisoner there, and some stockings laying on my counter - my young man said, in his presence, he would give 5 s. per pair on them; he said he wished to sell them for 5 s. 6 d. per pair; I questioned him how he came by them - he said his brother was a job man, that he had redeemed them from a pawnbroker; I said if I was satisfied they were his brother's, I would treat with him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182201090017"/>for them; I sent my man with him to his brother - they both returned together; my man said the prisoner had said, it was of little use going to his brother, for he was not at home, and that as they were returning he altered his mind, and said I think we had better go; that they turned back, but that he again altered his mind, and said he would come with his brother at twelve o'clock. I sent for an officer; I told the officer to go to Chiswell-street, and bring his brother, he left the shop with the prisoner.</p>

I was fetched to Sadler's, and found the prisoner there; I accompanied him to No. 21, Chiswell-street, he enquired for his brother, the man in the shop said he did not know him, and that he had no lodgers; I brought the prisoner out - he said he was very sorry, and would tell the whole of it; I told him to be cautious what he said, as it must be given in evidence; he said, he lived with Messrs. Todd's, of Fore-street, and took them from there. I found twelve duplicates on him, for forty pair of stockings.</p>

The prisoner was employed in the hosiery department, at a salary of 35 l. a year, he boarded in the house; it was not his business to take out any stockings without directions, I saw him at nine or ten o'clock that morning, with his hat on, going towards the door; he lived three months there.</p>

               <p>MR. ROBERT HANSON. I am a pupil at the London Hospital. I saw the deceased directly he was brought into the hospital, he had a fracture on the scull on the front of the head; we examined him carefully, but did not discover the fracture till two or three days after, but observed a considerable laceration on the head; he did not appear to be under the apprehension of death, a mere fracture in the scull does not always produce death, this fracture was not calculated to produce death - he died early in December, having come in on the 13th of November.</p>

               <p>Q. Of what did he die - A. Of an inflammation on the lungs, we opened him, apparently he had been subject to that complaint, but I have no doubt but that the exciting cause of the inflammation was the fracture on the head.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Will you explain that - A. Many external violences affect the lungs, they had been previously afflicted, without doubt; the fracture was remotely the cause - he would have died of the fracture, had he not died of the inflammation. I say so from the observation I made on opening the body.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you mean to say the fracture of the scull, was certainly the cause; for instance, if the fracture was shewn to you, would you say of course, that he must die - A. No; there was a separation of the membrane of the brain when we opened him, which was sufficient to cause his death - he laboured under two diseases, the inflammation caused his death - I cannot say whether it existed before the wound or not. It might have been of much longer standing than the wound.</p>

            . On the 12th of November, the prisoner and him were at my house, after twelve o'clock at night. I let the prisoner and three others in; the deceased came in about ten minutes after - he and the prisoner had a few words, the prisoner said</p>
               <p>"Dick, don't you remember giving me a slap in the face, when I did not deserve it? the deceased said</p>
               <p>"Don't bear malice, forget that," they drank together, and then the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"Dick, look out for yourself, for I shall look out for you." Nothing else passed in my hearing; they left the house directly after, within three minutes of each other; they were not intoxicated - the four who came in had two pots of beer, and Dick drank with them, and he had a companion - I do not know whether he drank.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did the deceased come from - A. From a club; a man came in with him, and three or four followed. Stubbs and Haines were two of them; the prisoner called for the beer, and asked Needs to drink; Needs did not first speak of the quarrel.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the quarrel happened at your house - A. Yes; seventeen months before - nobody endeavoured to keep the prisoner in the room to fight, there was no scuffle - I cannot say which went out first.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure the beginning of it was the prisoner asking if he remembered giving him a slap - A. Yes; he said,</p>
               <p>"Look out for yourself," it was not said in an angry way, he did not explain what he meant. I do not know that. I had seen them together after the quarrel. Needs was a lamplighter, and lived in Essex-street, Whitechapel - the prisoner worked at a gas factory, in Goldston-street, and lived in Castle-street, near Essex-street.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer. I knew Needs. On the 12th of November, I was with him; we came from a club together, we and the patrol Sanson went into the Green Man, public-house, about half past eleven o'clock. When we first went in, I saw three Irishmen standing by the door, with a pot of porter in their hands - one of the three spoke to the deceased, and calling him out, asked him to drink with them. One of the Irishmen said,</p>
               <p>"Do you remember a quarrel which ensued," or something of that sort; the deceased said,</p>
               <p>"I hope you will think nothing of that," the other said,</p>
               <p>"Look out for yourself;" he then left, and I asked one of them to drink. Needs went up stairs, I stopped at the bar door talking, I was in the house three quarters of an hour altogether. I was there a very little time after these words passed. Needs went out before me, I did not see any of them go out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see Needs come down? - A. No; there were four or five Englishmen, Needs drank with the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a costermonger. On the night of the 12th of November, I was in Castle-street, Whitechapel, about one o'clock in the morning; and saw the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182201090019"/>prisoner in the passage of the Green Man, public-house, with a pot of beer in his hand, drinking with another; the prisoner and Needs had some conversation together, I do not know what it was; the prisoner went out with his partner. Needs went out in about half a minute, alone, I and Francis came out of the public-house together after Needs went out, and saw him about twenty-five yards from us, the prisoner and the other man were before him. We saw Needs fall, and the other two run away - at this time, they were not above two yards from him. We pursued them, and sung out Watch! and Murder! he did not overtake them, and returned to Needs, who was with the watchmen, they held him up as well as they could. I went home with him to Catharine Wheel-alley, he was cut on the side of the head and bled very much, I cut the hair off his head, I got a plaster, put it on, and went away; he was taken to the Hospital the next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You and Francis were the nearest to him when he fell - Yes; it was a moonlight night. When the alarm was made, three or four more came out of the public-house. The prisoner went out first, and Needs after him, he was going the nearest way home - Catharine Wheel-alley, where he lives, is near Essex-street.</p>

            . I am a shoe-maker. I lived in the same house as Need's, No. 24, Catharine Wheel-alley. I was with Hains on the 12th of November in Castle-street, near the Green Man, public-house, in the street, about seven or eight yards from the prisoner; I heard him say,</p>
               <p>"Dick come along," a man was with the prisoner. Needs went on following him about forty yards behind in the middle of the street, and they walked by the side of the houses, and when they got to the bottom of the street, I saw Needs fall, the prisoner and his friend were about ten yards from Needs when he fell, and I about twenty yards behind. I ran as hard as I could to have the prisoner and his companion stopped, as they ran off directly; I called, Watch! and Haines called out, Watch and Murder! he was behind me, but did not overtake them, I returned to where the deceased fell, he had been taken away. I saw him at his own house about five minutes after, sitting in a chair between two other men bleeding at the head.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You lived in the same house - A. Yes; since April, I do not know whether he ever saw Needs; Needs had had a very bad cough for twelve months, but sometimes he was quite hearty.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Needs to go out after the prisoner - A. We were all going home; I did not tell him to follow Mahoney; he said,</p>
               <p>"Dick come along," they walked about forty yards before he fell.</p>
               <p>MR. HARRISON re-examined. He only had one blow, that certainly might be occasioned by a fall on the curb-stone, as well as a blow from a stone.</p>

I found him in bed, he lived about one hundred and fifty yards from the deceased. I took him into Need's presence, there was five or six persons in the room; I told the deceased to look round to see if he saw the person, he said,</p>

I was coming down the road from John-street, towards Tyburn-turnpike, about half-past nine o'clock, and passed by a gig, which was alongside of the curb-stone on the left; the horse's head was towards Tyburn-gate. A gentleman was standing alongside his horses on the left hand on the near side. I passed by about twenty yards, and heard the smacking of a whip behind, and instantly heard a crash; I turned round, and went to the spot. I saw a coach lying on its side, four or five doors from Queen-street, in the Edgware-road; the horses laid down on their sides. I held my lantern while a gentleman was dragged from under the fore part of the coach; the chaise-horse was running away, and the chaise tumbling to pieces. A woman was picked up, who I knew by seeing her frequently on my beat. The coachman called for help, and turned the coach on the wheels, got his horses up, and led them; it was a dark night. I cannot say who the coachman was. The road was lighted by oil on the side the gig stood, and it was just by a lamp.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. The road was only lit on one side - A. No; the gig almost touched the curb; I suppose the coach occasioned the crash. I found it two yards from where I saw the gig; it laid more over in the road on the right. I did not see the coach before the accident happened.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the man who led the horses take any notice of Mr. Slade - A. No; he led his horses away, and took no notice.</p>

            , ESQ. I live at Portland-place. I was in the Edgware-road; there were two women looking at some jewellery in a shop; a person inside came to the door; the women ran from the shop towards Paddington; they were hailed by a coachman on his box, who asked them to come up, using very coarse language at the time. He handed one up on the box, the other got on the roof behind the box; the coachman drove off rather rapidly till he came close to the turnpike, and having cleared the gate, he drove off very rapidly; I heard screams almost immediately after he cleared the gate. I returned to the spot, and saw the woman who had got on the box, fainting on the ground; she was supported by some person. On my asking what had happened, a boy held up the wing of a gig; I then saw a gentleman leaning against the rails, two doors beyond where the women were - he was in great agony, and could scarcely speak. I advised his being taken in doors, and he was taken in. I then saw the body of the gig nearly opposite, at the top of George-street; it was shattered to pieces. The gig-horse was brought back. Just as I was leaving the pavement to ascertain the name on the coach, the coachman drove off full gallop. I do not know him; I think he saw me, and whipped his horses. I could discern the words Notting-hill, on the front pannel, on the near side of the road, coming from Paddington. It was a fine night for the time of the years. If I had been driving to town, I could certainly see any other vehicle on the road with great ease.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. The gig was on the proper side, and the coach going in the direction it did, was on the right side also - A. Yes; he only trotted to the turnpike. I guess that he went faster afterwards by hearing of the chain of the coach, but I did not see it. It may be that the coach came suddenly on the gig, and could not turn, but had it gone at a proper pace, there was space enough to turn, and he might have pulled up - the remains of the gig were two hundred yards from the turnpike. I am certain that he quickened his pace on getting through the turnpike.</p>

            . I am a bookseller, and live in the Edgware-road. On the 29th of November, about nine o'clock in the evening, I heard a sudden crash opposite my door. I went out, and saw a person standing on the flag, in great agitation; he appeared very much hurt. I picked up a female who was laying on the ground, and in the interval, Mr. Slade was taken into my room. Some persons were lifting the coach on its wheels, but I cannot identify the coachman. I did not see what coach it was; it was not a dark night.</p>

I remember this accident, the first thing I saw was the deceased sitting on a chair; the person hurt was brought into the house in which I live - I ascertained that it was Mr. Slade, of Tottenham Court-road; Mr. Bryan, the surgeon's young man came - I saw a coach in the road, I knew it to be the Bayswater, by the colour of the body; Paddington was written on it; I did not look for the word Bayswater, as I only knew one coach of that colour. Mr. Slade left my house in a coach with one of Mr. Bryan's young men. When I saw the coach, it stood between two lamps, about seven yards from each. I do not know who drove.</p>

            . I am a wheelwright, and live in the Edgware-road. I remember the accident happening; I heard a noise, and went to my gate, and saw a stage coach.

I did not see it go away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then how did he lead the horses - A. He just straightened them, they were fastened to the coach. I saw him drive that coach the day before, and at other times. After he straightened the horses he came up, and said,</p>

            . I recollect the accident. I know the prisoner, he is a coachman - I was an outside passenger from the Star and Garter, public-house, to Bayswater, he drove the coach - I was on the roof. When he got through the turnpike he stopped the coach to put down a passenger, or to do something to the coach; I did not see any one get out; he got off the coach and gave me the reins to hold, as he was getting up again, I had the reins in my hand, the horses moved, and I dropped them; he got up, and tried to recover the reins but could not - he was on the box when the accident happened; I was so frightened that I held on the coach, and cannot say whether he had the reins or not, he stooped down towards the horses' backs to get them, but whether he did or not, I cannot say; I was thrown off, and fainted away, and saw part of the chaise, after I recovered; the coach was going fast. I was going to Bayswater.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom were you going there - A. To no one in particular; it was about nine o'clock. I live in Lisson-street, Paddington.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Had he hold of the reins when the horses first set off in a gallop - A. No; I dropped the reins before he got up, as he was getting up.</p>

I conceived him to be in danger from the first moment I saw him; I saw death approaching on the Monday, he died on Wednesday. He felt convinced he should not recover from the first, he said from the beginning, and also on the Monday before his death, that he was sure he should die; he always expressed himself as having no hope of recovery.</p>

We encouraged him to hope, and said it was possible and propable that he might recover; this excited his hopes a little, but he never expressed satisfied that he should live; his spirits were not so much depressed; after we gave him hopes, he was certainly not under the apprehension of immediate death.</p>

             lodges with me. On Sunday, the 23d of November, my wife and son went to church, and about half-past eleven o'clock, I and my youngest son left home to go to church also. We occupy one room up stairs, and one below. I locked the door of the room where all this property was, and put the key in my pocket. The window is about four feet from the ground. Only one pane at the top opens to admit the air; that was also shut. I do not know whether I left any body in the house. I came home first, about one o'clock, and found the room-door open. A drawer was open, which was shut when I went out. The bolt of the lock stood out. I found an eight-day clock taken off the bracket, but not taken out of the room. The cupboard doors, where I had locked the property, were wide open. I missed twelve sovereigns, one guinea, with the impression nearly worn off, a 1 l. note, 4 l. in silver, and 30 s. in copper. The silver was in one green baize bag, and the gold and note in another; the copper was tied in 5 s. papers, with packthread round them. I alarmed the house - Mrs. Allen came down with several other lodgers. I went with Cooper, the officer, to the Rising Sun, public-house, Bedfordbury, about four o'clock, and waited there; the prisoner came in about a quarter before five; Cooper took him, and found the green bag, which had contained the silver, on him - there were nine sovereigns, the smooth guinea, one 1 l. note, and 4 l. in silver, in it. I knew the guinea and the note - it had my own writing on it;</p>
               <p>"Nesbitt, 33, Oxford-street," was on it. The prisoner had lodged with me for two years; we were intimate; his father lodged with me before that time. He had been in my room about nine or ten o'clock on the Saturday night, and at that time, I had three sovereigns and the guinea in a glass on the mantle piece.</p>

I went at eleven o'clock to make the prisoner's bed, but he was not up; he lodged on the first floor, and is a locksmith. I made his bed at twelve o'clock; he was gone out then. He had locked his door, and put the key under the mat.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. Goddard came to me; I went with him to the Rising Sun public-house, Bedfordbury; the prisoner came in at a quarter before five o'clock; I took him. On our way to the watch-house, I asked him where he had been since he left<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182201090022"/>home; he said, in the Park. I asked who he joined in the Park; he said, Nobody. I asked where he had dined; he said, he did not know that he had dined any where. I asked whether he had any more money in his pocket than he could account for; he said, No. Upon searching him, I found a green baize bag, containing nine sovereigns, a smooth guinea, 4 l. in silver, and a 1 l. note; and in his pocket, 17 s. more. I undressed him to search him, and asked if he could account how he got it; he said, Yes. I took him into another room, and then he said he picked it up in the bag in the passage, as he was going out, between eleven and twelve o'clock. I again asked him where he had dined; he at last said he had dined with a man named Johnson, but declined telling me where he lived. I found two keys on him, one of which opens the door of his own room.</p>

            . I am employed by the Gas Company. The property was found at my house, in Mulberry-place, Upper Charles-street; it was brought to me in the space of a year and half, by the prisoner, at different times, he gave them to me. I had known him two years and three quarters, and knew he lived with the prosecutors - he asked if I was married, I said Yes; he said if he thought so, he would make me a present towards housekeeping - he said he was in the habit of having small presents from different manufacturers, who supplied his master.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What are you - A. A brazier; I work for the Gas Company. I used to attend at the prosecutor's warehouse, four time a week, to burn the air out of the pipes. I was only there a few minutes, and Mr. Burnell was generally there - I was taken up, and immediately said he gave them to me. Mr. Palmer, junior, was examined, and said he sold the prisoner some things which he had brought me - I did not think them stolen.</p>

            . I am a marshalman. I went to Otherly's, on the 1st of January, with Mr. Burnell, and found two quart decanters, six tumblers, five wine glasses, four salts and stands, all cut glass; two cruets, two pair of cups, with silver tops, six china cups and saucers, which the prosecutors claimed - they were on a sideboard. He said the prosecutor's servant brought them there at different times; he gave his account without hesitation, he thought he received some small things from them at a public-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not young Mr. Palmer say he sold him some of them - A. He identified some small articles, as having sold them to him - Otherly was kept in custody three or four days.</p>

            . I am book-keeper to Messrs. Burnell and Palmer. I only know that the articles are the property of the prosecutors. I believe them once to have been theirs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He had things with your permission - A. He had two vinegar cruets, a mustard pot, two pepper castors, which were found, he had from me, and I sold him two decanters, twelve wine glasses, six tumblers, six goblets, four salts, a wine bason, and chamber pot, and sundry other articles, of which I made no memorandum - he has paid me for part of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he is charged in your books for them - A. No; I never entered them - the prosecutors were not aware of it; it was an account between me and him, some of them were sold twelve months ago.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever tell your masters, that you sold him the things - A. I do not recollect mentioning it. I intended him to pay for them - I did not enter it in any book, and cannot tell what he owed; the decanters produced, are a different sort to those I sold him, they had rings round the necks - I believe I never sold him those, I will not swear it, I positively swear I never sold him the decanters.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. You swear it - A. Yes; these are cut glass - I entered some things on a slip of paper twelve months ago, (producing it) they were sold at three different times within twelve months - I have put no dates to it, I speak from my memory, that they were ring decanters. I have frequently sold things, and not entered them but when I receive the money, I give credit for it - if they are bought on credit, I enter them, but if paid for, I enter the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not enter Capper's - A. They ought to have been weighed, to ascertain the price, which I had not time to do, it was inconvenient - I cannot say these were ever the prosecutor's property, or if they were, that they were never sold.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You sold them to him at three different times; do you mean to say, that this memorandum was written at three different times - A. Yes; I kept the memorandum in my desk a long time, and then loose in my pocket - the first entry was made about four months after the second.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner at the corner of Chiswell-street, Finsbury-square, at half-past eight o'clock on the night of Christmas-day; he had a basket with two hams in it. I asked how he came by them; he said he brought them from Mr. Simpson's, Royal Exchange; and I believe he said Simpson was a tailor. I asked where he was going to take them; he said to Mrs. Armstrong, No. 29, St. John's-square, Clerkenwell, and that he lived there. I took him to the public-house; I detained him, and sent Bridges to Simpson, and next morning I went to No. 29, St. John's-square. His mother worked there, but did not live there; it is a sash-maker's; Mr. Younger claimed the basket. I found a watch on him, but it was not the prosecutor's. I took him to the watch-house, and sent Bridges back to the public-house, to search the spot where he stood; there were other people in the house, but we had him close under the window, in a corner opposite the bar. I asked where he lived; he then said at No. 10, Aylesbury-street. I found his mother lived there, but not him; he afterwards said he lived on Addle-hill, which I found true.</p>

            . I live in Little Bell-alley, four hundred yards from Younger's house. On Christmas night, about eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner, I am sure of him, his back was against Mr. Younger's door, he seemed to be looking at the opposite house; I then saw another man about a yard from him - I turned the corner about a dozen yards, and then returned to Younger's door; the prisoner then moved, and nudged the other; they went towards Angel-court - I went with my wife to Southwark-bridge; then returned, thinking something was going on a miss in the neighbourhood. I tried the door of the opposite house, it was safe; I went away, the party was gone - next morning I heard of the robbery; I said I should know one of the men, and hearing a man was in custody, I went to Worship-street, and saw the prisoner at the bar with another man, I knew him immediately, and swear positively to him; I should know the other if I saw him; there was two gas lamps within thirty yards, which both give strong lights - I looked him full in the face; he was looking up at the house, so that I saw his countenance plainly. I am confident of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was it - A. About eight o'clock, he had his hat on. One gas light was about twelve yards from him. I am an officer, and have been so seven years.</p>
               <p>MR. YOUNGER. The basket is one I left in the house, my initials are on it, in my own writing, and I believe the hams to be mine. I should think it would take one man five journies to take them all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The gentleman says another prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182201090024"/>was at Worship-street with me, I was at the bar alone. I assure you I was innocently led into it.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

The prisoner came to me on the 29th of December, saying she was very ill, and must have money, and claimed assistance as one of our parishioners. I took her to the churchwarden; she had a written order into the poor-house; she sat herself down on the step of the door, and said,</p>
               <p>"Here I will sit till twelve o'clock tonight, but I will have money - I want money, and I will have it." I took her to Mr. Gould, who gave her in charge.

            . I am a compositor. On the 25th of December I saw the prisoner at the King's Head tap, Old Change. He enquired for Tommy, who was a carman. I said he had been there, and had left, but would return shortly. Previous to his coming there, he passed a base half-crown for a pint of porter. I took it without looking particularly at it. I was in care of the tap; it was quite a new half-crown. I put it in my pocket, supposing it good. Soon after Tommy came; they complained to each other for being kept in waiting; they went into the back parlour, and in consequence of information, I looked at the half-crown, and found it was bad. I had no others but quite old ones - I immediately went into the parlour with it in my hand, and said to the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"Why do you come here smashing, you ought to have gone further, as you know I am an officer." Sadler, who is Tommy, declared his innocence. As soon as I entered the room, I saw a quantity of base silver on the table in a paper - I seized it. and dropped the half-crown; there was nothing in the room before they went in - on the table, I found a bag with 5 l. worth of shillings, six pences, and half-crowns, all counterfeit. I took Sadler to the Compter, and found a bad half-crown and a shilling on him in a bag; and on the prisoner, I found a paper of sixpences, with paper round every one, of the same die as those on the table; and the half-crown was the same die as them on the table. There were seventeen sixpences in the paper, and three loose in his pocket.</p>

            . I am labourer to Mr. Ray. On Wednesday morning, the 30th October, at five o'clock, I went to the premises, it was very dark; I found the lodge-gate open, the passage door, also the wash-house door, the stable door, and the harness-room doors were all open; the wash-house and the harness-room doors were forced open, and the stable door, with the coulter of the plough. I found it near the door, it was in the plough near the hay-stack the night before. I applied it to the marks, and have no doubt but it was the instrument used.</p>
               <p>JOHN HARLAND. I am coachman to Mr. Ray. I sleep in the house, I left the stable and harness-room about eight o'clock at night, I locked them and had the keys in my pocket; I left four shirts, six neck-cloths, six pair of cotton stockings, two pair of worsted, one silk handkerchief, one striped waistcoat, and one pair of cord breeches there, which were mine; there was a cloth livery coat and waistcoat of Mr. Ray's, and a pair of blue velveteen breeches, the livery was new. I had not worn it above five or six times, there was a coachman's coat laying on the box of the carriage in the coach-house. I got up about twenty minutes past five o'clock, and found the door forced open with the coulter of a plough, it fitted the marks.</p>

            . I knew Deakin. I lived with him in October last - I am not his wife, I lived with him seven years. On the morning of Wednesday, the 31st of October, between six and seven o'clock, some persons came to our house, I and Deakin were in bed, I did not know the persons then, but do now; it was the prisoners, they came with some things, they knocked at the door two or three times; at last I heard them, and awoke Deakin, he went to the door and let them in; we sleep down stairs, they came into the front place where we live, the door was a jar. I laid in bed, and could hear what passed; I heard these men ask Deakin, if he would take these things which they had got; he replied, that he was very much against taking them; they said, he need be in no fear, for all was right,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182201090026"/>and straight; he gave consent to take them, and one of them said, they must have some money of him, he gave them a sovereign.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that he did that - A. Yes; I heard the words pass between them; he then told them to take the things and leave them at the Jolly Butchers, public-house, which was about a mile from Bow-farm, where we lived, and to leave them with the ostler, till Deakin called for them - they then went away. Between breakfast and dinner, Wilson and Tufnel came again to our house, Deakin was not at home when they came in, only myself, Wilson said to me,</p>
               <p>"Well, old woman, where is Deakin." I said,</p>
               <p>"He is not at home," he was gone to West Green, on his master's business, about some potatoes, he was servant to Mr. - Bow's-farm; he said, he should very much like to have seen him if he had been at home, to know whether he meant to have the other things or not; I said,</p>
               <p>"What things is it you have got?" He said,</p>
               <p>"Why, I cannot tell you rightly what there is, but, there is a bag full of them, wet and dry together," he said,</p>
               <p>"For they will lay in the field and spoil," there was silk stockings; laces and dresses, for all that he saw, he was ******** if he did not take that; Tuffnel was present, and one of them said, that as they stood in the house, they had a great mind to hang the things on the hedge to dry them, as they were so wet; Tufnel joined in the conversation - they both came again next evening, Thursday, Deakin was at home, and all three consulted, how they were to get the things away; they asked Deakin, how he meant to get the things away that were at the Jolly Butchers, they said, they had left one parcel at the Jolly Butchers, and one parcel in the field, in White Hart-lane; he told them he had got them from the Jolly Butchers, and they were in the house; he said, he would get rid of the things that he had got from the Jolly Butchers, first, and then he would tell them more about the others, he said he would get Balaam's cart on Friday morning, and take them down to Mr. Hart, the Jews, at Tottenham - they said, they wanted more money, Deakin said, he did not know how to let them have more till he had got rid of the things, but he gave them 10 s. more that night. He had locked the things in the bed-room before they came. I saw them there in a sack; there was a large blue coat, with three capes, and a great coat, with one cape, both livery coats; one loose-bodied servant's livery coat, a pair of corded breeches, and another plumb-coloured velveteen; two servant's waistcoats with sleeves, and another without, a pair of fustian overalls and jacket, three pair of white stockings, and three very large cambric neck handkerchiefs, they went away - next morning, between eight and nine o'clock, Balaam's son came with the pony and cart, and this sack was put in the cart. Deakin was apprehended on Saturday, and a great number of things taken away which Balaam's cart had brought back on Friday. On the Wednesday after Deakin was taken, Wilson came about eight o'clock in the morning, I said I was but very middling; he asked how Tom was, I said, he was but very middling, considering the place where he was, and very low in spirits, he was then in Newgate. Wilson said,</p>
               <p>"More fool he to be low, for I have seen a sufficient person in town on Monday, who said, if he would keep his own counsel and not tell of us, they cannot hurt a hair of his head;" he said, he supposed he must have a Counsellor. I said, Yes, I dare say he must; he said, he would get him one, and that neither me nor my two children should want. Brown, my father-in-law, was sitting at breakfast at the table at that time, and heard him. I have been married to Bonner; I did not see Wilson again till he was before the Magistrate, nor did I see Tufnel.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you here when Deakin was tried - A. No. I first heard of the robbery on the Thursday after it was committed. Deakin is now in Newgate. They came on the morning of the robbery, Deakin was in bed all that night, he came home about eleven o'clock, and was very fuddled - I did not get up when the prisoners came, and did not see them; they came three times before Deakin was apprehended; they came openly in the middle of the day - Tufnel said no one knew him about there, but Wilson said, the men who were working in the road knew him very well.</p>
               <p>Q. You are in hopes of saving Deakin's life by your testimony - A. I do not know, I have not been told that it will be of benefit to him. I am twenty-five years old.</p>

I saw Wilson again at my master's house, in the tap-room a few days after - I knew him again, as the man who brought the sack. Deakin was then in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Many people come to your house - A. Yes. I remember him as the man who brought the sack; I did not speak to him.</p>

            , JUN. My father is a blacksmith, and lives at Bow-farm. He sent me to Deakin's with the horse and cart on a Friday, about two months ago; it was a good while before I heard of the robbery - I went to Deakin's in the morning, and took something in a bag in the cart; he got in with me, we went down White Hart-lane, and I saw both the prisoners in the lane, one was in a field, and the other sitting on the stile; I did not know them before, they did not speak to Deakin; Deakin left me in White Hart-lane, and took the bag, cart and all, and returned with the cart empty - I saw the prisoners again, as we returned lower down the lane; Deakin got out and spoke to them, I do not know what he said; they talked together about five minutes, Deakin went with Wilson up a little bit of a lane, leaving Tufnel, they had nothing with them then, they came back to the cart in a little while, and brought something in a bag. Wilson brought it, and put it in the cart, without either of them saying a word; Tufnel stood ten or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182201090027"/>twelve yards from the cart; I drove on; Deakin walked with them behind the cart, in conversation, not far up the lane; then the prisoners went back, and Deakin came on with me. I drove to Deakin's house, the bag was taken out, and carried into his house; Mrs. Deakin was there - I went home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You never saw them before - A. No. It was broad day light; I had heard of no robbery then, it was on a Friday a good while ago.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first say you knew those men - A. Before the Magistrate at Edmonton, I believe it was on the 1st of January, I know them by their faces; I noticed them very much, and am sure of them; I never said I was not certain, I never doubted it. I am thirteen years old.</p>

            . I live at Palmer's-green. I did not marry Bonner's mother, her mother is my housekeeper. I remember Deakin's being taken up; Bonner was at my house after that, Wilson came there on the Wednesday after Deakin was taken; I was sitting at breakfast, Bonner was there, and a man who is in the country; Wilson said to Bonner,</p>
               <p>"How are you," she said,</p>
               <p>"I am middling,"</p>
               <p>"How is Deakin," said he, she said,</p>

               <p>"Don't make yourself uneasy about him, for I have been to a good sufficient person in town, and he says they can't hurt a hair of his head if he does but keep his own counsel," I said,</p>

            . I am a constable. I took Wilson in custody. As we went to prison, he said voluntarily in the office after the examination, that no one could hurt him but the woman, meaning Bonner; he said it was dark, and how could she see him, she had appeared against him. As we came to Newgate, he said,</p>
               <p>"I know I shall go into them cells." When Tufnel was in the cage, at Lower Edmonton, he voluntarily said,</p>
               <p>"I am the fellow who broke the locks, and I had a good swig at the cream;" he was talking to a person who gave him some beer. I overheard the conversation.</p>

             re-examined. The dairy is near the laundry, there was milk and cream there, the milk was thrown about, and had been taken off the shelf; some cream had been taken off, ready for churning - there is sometimes a dozen pans of cream; I cannot say whether it was disturbed. Here is the property which was produced last Sessions; they are my master's, the marks of some are cut off, and the marks of some stockings are picked out; the mark of the red cotton still remains.</p>

On the morning of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182201090028"/>the 20th of November, I was awoke about twenty minutes after eight o'clock, by my errand boy, the prisoner, H. Brown, coming to my bed-room door, and crying out,</p>
               <p>"Master, Master, get up, you have been robbed, and every thing is stripped and turned topsy turvy." He had lived six months with me; I immediately got up, went into the shop, and found the pins of my cabinet punched out; they contained the best part of my property; the pins of the hinges were out; the shop is in the back attic; the cabinet was secured by two bolts and a patent lock, (Braman's.) I had left it perfectly secure at ten o'clock the night before, as I imagined; but on the morning of the 19th, about seven o'clock, I had heard a knocking.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the pins punched out, in what state was the lock. - A. There had been an attempt to break open the lock, but they could not; the cabinet contained three hundred rings, lockets, watches, pins, seals, brooches, ear-rings, snuff-boxes, scent boxes, snaps, pearls, emeralds, &amp;c. The whole of the property in the cabinet amounted to about one thousand seven hundred pounds; the whole of it was gone; I found all the drawers of the workshop scattered about, and about 500 l. worth of unfinished work gone, which had been in the drawers; I examined the drawers, they were all unlocked but one, and that one appeared to have been wrenched open by a crow bar; it was the foreman's drawer; Brown was with me when I examined, and found a metal gilt watch; he said,</p>
               <p>"Master, here is one of the watches," and cried bitterly; and said, what should he do, for I was ruined; I found three keys laying together in the workshop which did not belong to me, and two or three days after, we found a part of a dark lantern in a cistern, where the men used to wash themselves; my workman, Shepperd, found the other part of the lantern; the parts corresponded together; I found a lamp which I use, in the front parlour, which was not the place for it; I sent Brown to my father, and got assistance from Bow-street; a man who worked for me and had been recommended by Brown to me, stated something about his friends being bad, and we took Brown to Bow-street; he made application there to see me; I saw him, and held out no expectations whatever to him; Davis was present.</p>

             re-examined. I went in with Davis, who said to him,</p>
               <p>"I understand you have something to say to your master." Brown then said, that on the 19th of November, he let in Thomas and Brown. I am sure he mentioned those two, and I believe he mentioned Newman; but I cannot be sure; he said he let him in about seven o'clock; and after showing them round the shop where the property lay, and where they would find it, that they went up in the loft over the workshop, and concealed themselves there all day; and that we should find Thomas and Brown at a man named Allen, at Eagle-court, Catharine-street, and that one of the boys lived with Big Eyed Sook, and the other with Poll Lamb; and we should find one on the first floor back, and the other on the second floor front. He stated that he let them in on the day of the robbery; he said nothing more at that time. I asked him who punched the pins out of the cabinet; and he said he did; but did not say how. I have not recovered one article.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BROWN. Q. I never said I punched out the pins - A. He did, in Davis's presence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did he sleep in the house - A. No. He came about seven o'clock in the morning. He told me of the robbery about twenty minutes before eight.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. What time he came to the premises you cannot say - A. No. One of the servants would let him in. I know Stokes carried on the business of a steel pipe watch key maker; a furnace is not necessary in his business. I have been to his premises, and find he has one which will melt fifty ounces of gold at once.</p>

I know Brooks; he was with us on Saturday night, the 17th; we were altogether under a gateway, two doors from Frost's. Brown, Thomas, Brooks, and Newman, were together - we agreed to do the robbery, and went under the gateway - we did not get in that night - it had been talked of several times when we had been at the play.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night you met, who began to talk of it. - A. We all agreed under the gateway to go in that night.

On Monday morning, between five and six o'clock, Thomas, Newman, and I, went to the White Hart, public-house, Swan-yard. Brooks had not come. We went without him, as Brown said we must come directly, and he could not stop.

Brooks did not join us at all. We got up to the workshop at the top of the house. Brown said he would file the edge of the cabinet, which he did, as it should not make a noise when we came to open it. He then shewed us the cock-loft over the shop, where we were to hide - we went in there - we had three keys, and a dark lanthern.

             came up with some victuals to us; I told him to go to Mr. Allen's, and fetch me the crow-bar. Allen lives at No. 1, Eagle-court; he went and brought it to me - I told him to ask Allen for the victuals, and I suppose he brought the victuals from there. We continued in the loft all day, till between twelve and one one o'clock on Monday night, then got down and got into the workshop - we had a phosphorous box and dark lanthern. We opened all the workmen's drawers that we could; they were not fastened - one drawer on the left hand was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182201090029"/>broken open with a crow-bar. Some unfinished rings, a pair of gold watch cases, two gold snuff boxes, lined, and several other unfinished articles, and bits of gold, were taken from the drawers. We then took the cabinet hinges off, as Brown had directed us - they had been filed - we took from there eight gold watches, a few diamonds, a great quantity of rings, ear-rings, rubies, bracelets, and pearls. We left the drawers all scattered about the place, and tied the property up; we put some in our pockets, and some I carried in my hat - each took what he could - when we had got the property, we could not take the dark lantern or the keys; we threw the lantern in the cistern, and put the keys on the work bench - we took the crowbar away with us, and then came down stairs - it was between three and four o'clock. We could not get out, as the street door was double locked, and the key taken out. We opened the parlour window shutters, threw up the sash, and got out that way - we first went into the kitchen, - we went into the Strand, and took a coach, and went to Turnmill-street, Clerkenwell, to

             was in bed there - she got up, opened the door, and let us in, and we all went in. Newman called her up. The street door is always open. We had the property with us. Newman said she must get up, because he wanted her. She lit the fire, put the kettle on, and then prepared some tea; and while the kettle was getting ready, we took out the property, and put it on the tea-board, and then put it on the bed. She was in the room at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said by either of you - A. She said she should like a pair of pearl ear-rings, and a locket, which would do for the child, to put hair in, and she should like one of the watches, which was done with pearls. We told her where the property came from; we asked her what the things would fetch. She said it would be about eighty pounds a piece. Newman said he must get up, for he wished her to carry these things to a place. We sorted the finished from the unfinished things. Newman put them into a bag. They were to be taken to the prisoner Williams, who called himself Stokes. Newman said they were to be carried there. Eates carried the bag - we all went with her to Stokes's house in a court in Goswell Street; we got there about six o'clock in the morning, and saw him; Newman called him on one side of the room. Stokes, Eates, and him, went out of the house to have something to drink, leaving me and Thomas in Stokes's workshop (he makes, steel pipes for watch keys). He returned in about ten minutes - Eates went away. Stokes's wife was then getting up; she came into the room, and he told her to go down, which she did. Newman then called Stokes aside, and told him he wanted his crucible; Stokes went and cleaned it out to melt the gold. Stokes made a fire and put it on, and we put the unfinished work in, such as watch cases and chains, and all the unfinished work, and melted it. The snuff boxes were given to Stokes, as he said he thought he could sell them, and one he said he would keep; they were made a present of to him, as he said he might sell them, and make a little money of them. Newman gave him two sovereigns for the use of the place to melt the gold, and gave him the two snuff boxes, and two old gold seals. There were only two snuff-boxes; the rest of the property was left at Stokes's. Mrs. Stokes came in, and we gave her a pair of ear-rings, and two finger rings, which she said she should like; we then wanted to know where we should sell the property. Newman called Stokes aside, and left me and Thomas by the fire; this was about two or three o'clock in the afternoon. We had been there all the morning, melting the gold - there was very little fire, and the heat was not sufficient. Newman came to us, and said he would take a coach, and fetch a man to buy the property. We took a coach, and went to Solomon's, Petticoat-lane - I, Newman, and Thomas went. Newman went in at the door, and we waited outside. In about five minutes he came out with Solomon, whom we took back to Stokes's with us in the coach. Stokes came into the room - he, Solomon, and Newman, went aside, and had some conversation together. Solomon said he would not look at the things there; but told us to go to the Rose and Crown, public-house, and he would take them there. We went to the Rose and Crown, public-house, Bunhill-row. Newman told us to go in the parlour, which we did. In about ten minutes Newman and Solomon came, with the property in two bags, as we had left it. Solomon brought it into the room - Newman had some private conversation with Solomon, and told me and Thomas to go into the yard; which we did. There was a window there, so that we could see all over the parlour; and saw the property on the table. Solomon was sorting it; we saw him put it in two bags, and twist it up; and then they called us on. Newman said he had agreed with Solomon about the property. We asked Solomon what he was to give for it. He said 200 l. for the whole - that he had only 100 l. with him, which he paid. He said he would fetch his partner,

Newman called us into the parlour - we had something to drink. Nathan said he had paid the 100 l. to Newman, which made up the 200 l. Yates came in, and we had something to drink at the bar - Nathan was gone then. The 100 l. was left in the care of Newman. Solomon came with Nathan, and was present when the 100 l. was paid - he brought

             then gave me 15 l.; I had more afterwards, in all 30 l. After I received the 15 l., Solomon and Yates were drinking at the bar. Solomon said, the best thing I and Thomas could do, was to go into the country - we said we would - Nathan was gone then. Newman then told us to go to the Cobourg Theatre, and wait there till he came. I saw Brooks on the Friday - he said he heard the robbery had been done, and he expected his regulars, meaning the share of the money. We three gave him five sovereigns each, which made up 15 l. I directed Dawes to Solomon's and Nathan's houses.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. At what time did you and the others meet in Swan-yard - A. On Monday morning between five and six o'clock; we got to the house about half six; Brown let us in, we saw him about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182201090030"/>breakfast time; I sent him for the iron between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, and did not see him after dinner time, which was one o'clock, till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>The Court ruled that there was no proof of Brown being a principal in the robbery, and as such, the indictment could not be sustained.</p>

On Thursday night, the 20th of December, I put eleven table-cloths, and seventeen napkins, in a bag - brought them from Mr. Green's, and left them in my front room, on the ground floor, at half-past five o'clock, the lamps were lit, and it was dark, the window-shutter was bolted, and the street door also; I went up stairs to tea, came down about six o'clock, the street door was still fast, and I missed the bag with its contents; the shutter was wrenched open, and the sash lifted up; I ran out and screamed; a man said somebody had picked something up - I ran, and met a person who gave me five glass cloths, which I had rolled up and put in the top of the bag - a napkin was left on the window, the bag was only twisted round; I found the property at Queen-square - it is worth 8 l.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. On the 20th of December, a little before eight o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner in Tothill-street, about a quarter of a mile from Buckland's with this bag, and the linen in it; another boy was with him, who ran away directly he saw me; I followed the prisoner, and asked what he had on his shoulder, and just as I stopped him, before he made any reply, the prosecutrix's daughter claimed it as her mother's which she had lost; I put him in the watch-house; he said a young man employed him to carry it, who was dressed in blue - there was no young man near.</p>

I beg leave to state, I was brought into this unfortunate situation by some designing and experienced practitioner; a man in a blue coat gave me the parcel in York-street, and told me to wait at the corner of Tothill-street, and wait his coming; and while I was waiting for him I was taken, if I had stolen the property, instead of wandering in the street, I should have concealed myself; besides, I was apprehended two hours after the robbery; I was to have 6 d. for my trouble - I beg to offer this circumstance as favourable to the Court and Jury.</p>

            . I live in Margaret-street, Cavendish-square. On the 6th of December, between five and six o'clock, I was by Bass's house, on the same side of the way, two or three steps from his shop door, and saw a man come out of the private door. I cannot exactly say who it was. I have seen the prisoner at the office; but I have seen a man since, so much like him, that I cannot say whether he was the man. It was dark - the man had a bundle under his arm, and the tail of a coat hung out. He went to two persons who were waiting at the corner of the street - he joined them - they walked away together. The one who came out of the house carried the bundle. I returned and told Bass the private door was open. Tegg and I went in pursuit. The one who came out of the house, was dressed in a blue or black coat; one of the others, in a fustian jacket and trowsers, and white apron. We found two men together at the corner of the street, and one of them was putting a great coat on - he had a black coat on. I pointed him out to Tegg, who asked him to give him the coat. He said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, dear! you are mistaken." Tegg asked me if that was the person that came out of the house. I said, Yes. I thought him the man at that time He walked away. I do not know what became of the great coat. The same two were with him whom I had seen at the corner; they walked away with him; he turned round to one of them, and said,</p>
               <p>"Harry, don't leave me." He still went on with the coat on; the other two ran away, and he struck Tegg several times, before he attempted to take him. He was secured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You were merely passing by - Yes; I had not observed whether the street door was open before he came out. I do not now believe the prisoner to be the man, because I have seen another like him.</p>

            , and is worth above 30 s. It hung in the passage with the pelisses, by the private door. I cannot say the door was not left open. Westwood alarmed me. I followed with him - and in Golden-square, about ten yards off, I saw a man putting on the great coat; he pointed him out; another person in a fustian jacket, was by his side. I charged the man with having the coat on - he was walking on, and struck me, and ran away. I only saw one of his companions. The man who was putting the coat on, had a dark coat; I think it was blue. He struck me three times, and ran away. I pursued, I followed, crying Stop thief! but could not overtake him - he got away with the coat on. I saw the prisoner on that night at the Sun, public-house, Bedfordbury, and believed him to be the man - I am not positive. I think that it was a taller man.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your belief now - A. I think he is not the man.</p>

On the 20th of December, a bill was in my window to let my house; the prisoner came about two o'clock to inquire about it, and said a family were coming to see it. I said they could see it any time; she returned at three o'clock, and went into the back parlour, saying she would wait for the lady. She was there about ten minutes. I left her in the room for about five minutes; she came into the passage before I returned, and said she would go to the lady, in Baker-street, and let her know she could see the house directly. I let her out without any suspicion, and immediately went into the parlour; and in a quarter of an hour, missed the watch from the window, worth 4 l.; and a shawl from the sofa, worth 2 l. They were in the room just before she came in; nobody but her could take them. She never returned. I have found neither of them. I found her in custody about a fortnight after.</p>

She kept on walking with me, and when she got down the street, she met a little girl, and asked her if she had 2 d. to give me to go on the errand. She said she had; and the prisoner said I should have it when I came from her sister's; that I must go up stairs; but I must not carry the bundle, or her sister's husband would think it was some of his clothes, and keep it. She said,</p>
               <p>"I will hold your bundle." I said No. She then said,</p>
               <p>"Let the boy have his own way, and go with his bundle." I went up two or three stairs of the house; she pointed out, that I was to go to the first landing; she stood outside, as she said she did not want her sister's husband to know she was there. I went up two or three stairs, then the prisoner came behind me, and snatched the bundle away, and said she would hide round the corner. I ran after her, crying Stop thief! and in the market, a gentleman ran and caught the little girl. I am sure the prisoner snatched it from me. She was taken that afternoon. I saw her at the watch-house, and am sure of her.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You live on the second floor, might she not go into her own room - A.

            . I am a tailor, and live in the front garret, at No. 83, Rosemary-lane. On the 18th of October, from nine o'clock at night, till very near eleven o'clock, I was at the Seven Stars, public-house, Rosemary-lane; I knew Jacobs, by seeing him come there to drink his beer, he was a Prussian. I have since seen him in Newgate; he came to the Seven Stars a little before nine o'clock that night, and was very drunk indeed when he came in - he had a pint of beer and sat down by himself, in the same box as me, and while we sat there the prisoner came in; I am certain of her person; she was very much intoxicated; she took up his pint of porter and drank out of it; he rebuked her; he said,</p>
               <p>"You have no right to drink that, without my privilege" - she called him a son of a w***e; he spoke to her again.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he use abusive language - A. No, he was grumbling; I said</p>
               <p>"Mr. Jacobs, it is very rude for any one to come and drink your beer, - I should not like it myself;" the prisoner turned round and staggered towards the door, and when she recovered herself, she sat down by the side of Jacobs, and remained there till eleven o'clock - they did not talk together.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened near eleven o'clock - A. Jacobs got up, and said, I will go home - he was so much in liquor then, that he staggered up against the door, and was near falling; the prisoner was very tipsy, she said she would go, and in following him to the door, she fell down; I said I would go, and went over and picked her up; Jacobs went out - she followed him, and I followed them.</p>
               <p>Q. At any time during this period had the prisoner a bonnet or hat on her head, shawl or handkerchief on her neck, or bason in her hand - A. She had not, I am quite positive of it; Jacobs went on staggering, and she went after him, they went on as far as the Alderman Parson's head, public-house, which is about two hundred yards off in Rosemary-lane; it is the next public-house; she then put her hand round him, laid hold of his hair, and fell down, he tried to disengage himself from her, and owing to her drunkenness, she fell; a parcel of people came by, somebody helped her up; Jacobs went on, and I crossed the way, and left them - it was in my way home - I live at the further end of the lane.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How do you know this was the night Jacobs was taken up - A. Because I went up stairs and was eating my supper, and heard the call of Watch! I came down and asked a man who was passing, what was the matter - he said, it was a drunken man, named Jacobs, going to the watch-house; I did not go to see him; I had my work to go to in the morning - I did not see Jacobs again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not the curiosity to go to the watch-house next day - A. No, I went to work at six o'clock; I did not see him till after he was convicted; I did not know it would get to such serious consequences; I did not know where he lived; I worked for Messrs.

            . I live in White's-yard, Rosemary-lane, in the two pair front room, and work in a glasshouse, for Mr. Glover. On the night Jacobs was taken, I was at the end of White's-yard, about eleven o'clock, I never saw the prisoner before that, she asked me if there was any public-house open where she could get refreshment; Jacobs was by her; I did not know him; I saw him next day at Lambeth-street office, under examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Jacobs was with her - A. Yes, he and the prisoner were standing together at the top of Whites'-yard; they were both very much intoxicated; the prisoner had a blue gown on, and her bosom was all exposed; she had neither shawl, bonnet, or handkerchief on, or bason in her hand. I told her the White Lion, in White Lion-street, was open. Whites'-yard is about twenty-yards from Alderman Parson's head, and more than that from the Seven Stars; she and Jacobs went round White Lion-street, and while they were walking along she called for assistance of the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what happened to make her cry - A. No, they had got a little way from me; I went up, and she then gave charge of Jacobs for robbing her of her shawl, bonnet, and one shilling.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You heard the charge? A. Yes, Jacobs attempted to strike her.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he hold of her - A. No, for the watchman knocked him down, then sprang his rattle, and brought more assistance; Jacobs made no resistance; I followed him to Whitechapel watch-house; he was taken from there to Wellclose-square, as they were repairing the watch-house; I was returning home, and two watchmen took me in custody, as the prisoner swore I took the property from Jacobs; the watchman told me she said so, and she swore it at Lambeth-street, next day. When she was giving charge of Jacobs, she said she was a married woman; I said, if she was, she would not be out at that time of night, and an hour after that she gave charge of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you was not taken in charge as you were returning home - A. Yes, the watchman charged me with receiving the property; I was not taken for an hour after, and was at the watch-house - I had been waiting near Wellclose-square.</p>
               <p>Q. If a gentleman meets you, you go home with him. A. I am out at night - I never saw Jacobs before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you discharged at Lambeth-street A. Yes, I was taken before the Justice - and discharged; I knew nothing about Jacobs' trial; I did not think it would come to such a pitch as it did; Jacobs did not know where I lived - I was not sent for - I knew nothing about Jacobs' trial.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first tell any one what you knew of this business - A. About two days after, several people came to Lambeth-street, and I told them; I was applied to to become a witness on this trial about a month or six weeks after.</p>

            . I live with my father, who is a silversmith, and lives in Cornhill. On the night of the 18th of October, I was passing the end of Rosemary-lane, it was after eleven o'clock; I saw the prisoner - I do not recognise her features - but from her stature and appearance I believe it to be her; I saw Jacobs and a woman (whom I believe to be her) in contact together; he had hold of her arm, and did not seem inclined to loose it - some words passed between them both, and in about two minutes a watchman crossed over and laid hold of Jacobs, and endeavoured to loosen the woman from Jacobs' hold; he released her for a moment, but she came round towards the watchman and he caught hold of her again; the watchman endeavoured to loosen her again, but finding he could not do it easily he struck the man three or four times over the arm; and in consequence of their struggling several watchmen came to their assistance; I do not recollect the rattles springing; they then endeavoured to get him to the watch-house, which they had great difficulty, and trouble to do - he laid hold of the shutters, and did what he could to prevent them; then one of the watchmen came behind and struck him a violent blow over the head, and knocked him down; both him and the woman were drunk, beyond a doubt - there was never more than a dozen persons collected.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of them use any threat to the woman what they would do, or threaten any violence - A. None whatever, I am positive of it - Jacobs was taken to the watch-house - I left them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear whether the man was charged with any offence - A. As far as I saw, the woman was running about the street saying,</p>
               <p>"I will give charge of him," but I did not hear what she charged him with; she had neither bonnet or shawl on - she was brandishing her hands about.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to hear of this matter - A. At the time it occurred, I did not hear the man's name, nor did I hear the trial, but I read the trial in the Sessions Paper; and hearing the man was ordered for execution, I supposed it to be the same party as I had seen; I made enquiry; went to Newgate to see the man, and knew him to be the man; he referred me to his master; when I went to see him I told him what his dress was at the time - it was a slouched hat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is false that I was ever in the middle of the street - or said I would give charge of him.</p>
               <p>Witness. I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. All I have to say is, that when I was here before I told the truth; when I was at the office all the blunder I made was, the watchman said it did not matter whether I said where I was going, and at the office I said I was going for a pail of water; but before you, my Lord, I told the truth.</p>
               <p>The prisoner then handed in a paper complaining that she was prosecuted by a wicked set, who were determined to have her life, that they had come forward at the expence of 3000 l. to prosecute her, and had purchased witnesses against her; that it was a conspiracy against her life; that she considered herself entitled to the name of Alderson, as she lived with Alderson on honourable terms.</p>
               <p>JAMES M'NIFF re-examined. She was at the Seven Stars, public-house, two hours - the landlord is not here.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Collins's office. On the 11th of December, I heard he had been robbed; I went to the shop of one Bailey, Holywell-street, near Shoreditch turnpike; between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, and saw the two prisoners in the shop, they had a small round close basket. I had previously told Bailey, my suspicions, he was to buy the four pigeons that they had brought; I waited in the shop till they were bought, and then examined, and knew them to be Mr. Collins's property. I went out and returned in about half an hour; while I was there with one of the pigeons in my hand, the prisoner came again with the same basket, and a larger one, which was full of pigeons, I think about seven or eight pair, and the smaller one had about four pair, I knew them to be Mr. Collins's. When they came in, I put the one I had into another basket, that they might not suspect; Gascoigne looked at me, and said to Green,</p>
               <p>"The gentleman has got one of the pigeons which we brought this morning;" he said to me,</p>
               <p>"That is a fine pigeon, it is so tame, it will go about the house." I asked if it was one of his, he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes," and pointed to the two baskets which he had brought; I lifted up the lid of the small basket, and saw four of Mr. Collins's pigeons. I got a constable, and asked Gascoigne how he got them; he said, he bought them of a neighbour, who kept pigeons. I said, it was strange, he should buy of one dealer to sell to another, he made no answer; Green said, he knew nothing about them, he only assisted in carrying them.</p>

            . I am under gardener to Mr. Collins. On the 10th of December, at seven o'clock at night, I saw the pigeons safe in the house, there was twenty-four in all; next morning, at six o'clock, I found only three, they never fly at night - I know them to be my master's; I found a ladder thrown down in the yard, which was taken from under the hay-stack; it was a wet morning, there were three or four foot-marks by the gate. When they were brought home, they were let loose, and flew into their own place.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to Gascoigne's lodgings, and found a pair of boots very wet and muddy, it was about one o'clock, on the 11th of December, he lives in Hoxton New Town, nearly two miles from the prosecutor's, Green said, he lodged on Saffron-hill, I went to the house, and found a person named Green, but not the prisoner, I could learn nothing about him. Gascoigne said, If I would come to his house at seven o'clock at night, two men would bring some more pigeons and live pigs; I went and stopped till nine o'clock, nobody came to it.</p>
               <p>MR. COLLINS. I am certain the pigeons are mine.</p>
               <p>- BAILEY. I live in High-street, Shoreditch. I never saw the prisoners till they brought the pigeons; I have the four they brought first, Mr. Rippingham's account is correct.</p>

            . I am a coal dealer, and live in Bird-street, Golden-square; the prisoner came by my shed and asked if I wanted to buy some harness. I looked at it, this was Friday, the 14th of December, between ten and eleven o'clock; I gave him 2 l. for it, I saw him again on the 20th. I was taken into custody, as it was found in my possession, he was quite a stranger - I described his person, he told me he lived in the neighbourhood; I hung it at my door for sale.</p>

            . I used to go on an evening to Mr. Wetherill's house, in Providence-row, to keep the prisoner company; and on the evening of the 1st of December, he asked me to pawn a piece of black kerseymere, which was at his master's, where we were. He told me his master allowed him to pledge these things when he wanted money. I was to ask 11 s. for it; I went to Mr. Attenborough, Sun-street; the prisoner stopped outside the shop - the pawnbroker offered me 8 s. I brought it outside, and told the prisoner; he told me to pledge it for 10 s. I went in again; they sent me to fetch him in. I told him that Attenborough wanted to speak to him, and took him in. He asked him a few questions - the prisoner said it was his cloth, and he bought it at a pawnbroker's. He ran out - and I was detained.</p>

I had a watch about me; when I came to myself, I missed it. On Saturday morning, I was ill in bed. I came down in the afternoon, and heard her blaming every body in the room for stealing my watch; she accused the landlord and landlady of it. I said I would give 5 l. to any body to get it back. I said if it was not brought back, I would be severe, as it was a family watch. She trembled, and then went to the privy. I suspected her, and went backwards, as soon as she returned. I found my seals in the privy; but have not found the watch. I found her in the tap-room, and held them up and said,</p>
               <p>"There are the seals." She said,</p>
               <p>"Never mind; I shall only have a twelvemonth and a day." I had her taken; she said then she was innocent; but was an accessary.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live in Cambden Town. I was passing the prosecutor's house, between six and seven o'clock that night, and saw the prisoner standing outside the door, a boy came out of the shop with a till under his arm, which he gave to him - I followed the prisoner along King-street, to George-yard; I then went to the prosecutrix, then went, and met the prisoner coming out of the other end of the yard into Macclesfield-street; I secured him - the till was found in the yard; he had the money and padlock in his apron. There was nobody in the shop.</p>

On the 2nd of January, between two and three o'clock in the day, I was in Jews'-row, Chelsea - I am a pensioner. I met the prisoner - I was rather tipsy. She asked me if had got my pension. I said Yes. She told me to come home to her place, and she would take care of me. I went to her room, and sat on the bed. I fell asleep, and felt her hand in my pocket - I got up, and missed my money; she ran into another room - I brought her back, and held her. She struck and scratched me.

               <p>Q. Why did you not take the cap off - A. I did not like to take the law in my own hands. I was quite sober.</p>

I suppose the prisoner missed his way. Daniels said he was gone into the kitchen. I found him behind the door - I took him up. He dropped a tea-canister, and the flannel was found on him.

On Monday, the 7th of January, between ten and eleven o'clock, in the morning, I sold some meat to a lady, for which she paid me a sovereign. I put it in my till, the prisoner was in the shop at the time, my attention was called outside the shop to a customer, of whom I took a few half-pence, and on returning inside the shop, I put the half-pence in the till, and missed the sovereign; the prisoner being near the till, when I entered, I charged her with taking it, she denied it - I sent for an officer, and in about an hour she was taken to the watch-house, and searched, the sovereign was not found on her; the officer went home with her, and charged her with swallowing it, and caught her attempting to do it, the watch-house is next door to my house.</p>

The tea-kettle was on the fire. They went away about five o'clock. I missed it soon after - I have not found it. One went out a little before the other - they came again into the tap-room in about an hour - I accused them of it, and gave them in charge - there was one person in the tap-room with them. It was safe when the prisoners went away. One of them must have taken it - they drank together, and were in company.</p>

We went into the public-house, (the next premises) and found them there - five were covered over with straw - the prisoner was concealed at the corner of the yard. We found another dead, and three running about alive - the five were about a yard from him.

On the 15th of December, I was coming from Harrow-on-the-hill, with a quantity of umbrellas, and different things. I went into the Coach and Horses, public-house, on the Harrow-road, near Paddington, in the evening; the prisoner was in the house - I had seen him before, I asked if he was out of a situation, and treated him with a pint of beer. When I went to take up my things, I missed a bag. I had drank a little, I do not know what time I left the house, there was no clock there, it was before dusk. I stopped about half an hour and left him in the house - I had got about three quarters of a mile from the public-house, he came behind me, and snatched my bag off an umbrella, which was slung on my shoulder; then came in front of me, and took some rings from a small box which I had. I happened to stumble, and the drawer which the rings were in, fell out.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to stumble - A. The road being dirty, I slipped; I picked up the rings, and was putting them into another drawer, when he took the articles stated in the indictment. I told him to take care, for I would have him in custody if ever I saw him again - he immediately ran away. When I came to the Green Man, public-house, I gave an alarm and described the property to the officer; he was taken next day, and two rings and a bag found - I had been drinking but was sensible.</p>

On the 7th of January, at half-past seven o'clock, at night, I saw my watch and keys hanging in my bureau bedstead in the parlour, where I sleep; I rent the house, and let lodgings; a person came and took a a lodging, and the prisoner came while I was out, as his wife. I came home at ten minutes past twelve o'clock, and missed the watch, and inquired for it in a loud voice; two young men slept on the first floor, and the prisoner slept in the same room, I went up and asked the young men what they had done with it, she heard me, and made answer, that the boys were as innocent of the watch as a child unborn; I turned round, and said,</p>
               <p>"Then you know something of the watch," she said nothing, and I said, you shall go into custody, she wanted me to search her, but I would not; I went down stairs for a watchman, went up again in two minutes, and she was out of bed, dressing herself; I have not found it, it was worth 3 l. I had it a year and a half, the seals were worth 4 l. Her husband passed by the name of Johnson.</p>

            . I am wife of the last witness; a man named Johnson came to lodge with us, he was there three nights before this happened; the prisoner came about half-past ten o'clock, on this night for the first time, she sat down by the fire in the room, where the watch was, for an hour; I saw it about half-past eleven o'clock, she and Johnson were then in the room, nobody else - the watch was missed when my husband came home; a knock came at the door about half-past eleven o'clock, I went to see who was there, and left a little boy, (Habitt), sitting in the chair, and while I was standing at the shop-door, Johnson went out at the private door, I have not seen him since; I had no reason to suppose, he was going out - I said, I must go and make my bed, the prisoner then said,</p>
               <p>"Please to give me a light, and I will go to bed; and said to the little boy, my husband is gone into the yard, I wish you would tell him to come up." I said, No, your husband is gone out. Habit went down to see for him, for she would have it, that he was in the yard, he came up and said, he was not there; she then began to cry, and said it was, because she did not give him money to send for beer and things - she then asked for a light, and said, she would go to bed, for he would come in in an hour or two - he never returned. She went up to bed crying, and said, he was always serving her in that way. I began to make my bed, my husband knocked at the door, and the watch was missed. I went up stairs, and do not know what passed; she was dressing herself when the watchman came.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you were at the door, did you not let two lodgers in - A. Yes, they went up to their own room, I gave them a light to go to bed, and when I came in, she asked for a light - they were never in the parlour.</p>

            . (This witness being questioned, appeared perfectly to understand the nature of an oath.) I am ten years old. I know the prisoner, pointing to her; I remember when the watch was taken, it hung by the wall, on a nail, by the bed side, the prisoner and the man were in the room - the man stood by the parlour door, inside the room. I saw the prisoner take the watch off the bed side, and give it into his hand, and he put it into his pocket - she told him to go away, he went outside the door - Mrs. Watkins was at the shop door at the time. Nobody but me was in the room with them; I went to bed soon after, I do not know the time, but it was late.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. While Mrs. Watkins was at the door, did not Johnson get up - A. Yes; I did not ask what o'clock it was.</p>

I came from the country; I had been to Chelsea two days, and went to my friends who could not keep me; I went to a public-house, Johnson, a man, and woman were there, they made me drink with them; I enquired of them for a lodging, Johnson said he could recommend me to Mr. Watkins; I said I had rather go with a woman - he went out, returned, and said he had mentioned it to Mrs. Watkins, and had said I was a friend of his, and told me not to contradict it; I gave him 6 d. for the bed; he said I could not have one unless he slept with a single man; I went to the house, but never said I was his wife or any thing of the sort; two boys came in soon after. Mrs. Watkins went to answer a knock; Johnson rose and went out at the private door without speaking to me; when she returned, I asked where he was, she said he was gone out; I said he went out at that door, she said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, that is the private door;" she went out to fetch liquor for a man and woman, they were drunk, and she put them to bed; I went to bed, fell asleep, and heard the boys saying</p>

On the 11th of December, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, I saw two men standing at the area of No. 4, they appeared to have a bundle; one of them set twelve cheese plates down on the curb. I believe the prisoners to be the men. I called out to know what business they had there, they made no reply, but ran away; I went to No. 4, and found the lock of the pantry door partly forced open, and the articles stated in the indictment, gone. The window was broken open. I saw Christopher in custody at eleven o'clock. I believe them both to be the men.</p>

I first saw the prisoners in company together, with a little boy seven or eight years old, in Leicester-square, about half-past five o'clock, they were all three together. I followed them all the way to Charles-street, it being in my road home; I saw Mr. Crouch between Wardour and Dean-street. Green and the little boy went on first, the little one attempted to pick Mr. Crouch's pocket. Paskin was behind them, and when they hung back, he pushed them forward. The little boy took the handkerchief out, and held it behind him; Paskin put his hand out to take it, but Green took it and put it in his bosom. I laid hold of him, took it out, and shewed it to Mr. Crouch. Frazier took Paskin, he resisted, and tried to get away - I said, if he did not come along quiet, I would strike him.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's brother. On Thursday, I returned Mr. Vollar fifteen duplicates which the prisoner sent to me - I had tendered them to him before, and he refused them; I went to him, and said, if he did not take them, I should throw them in the street; but before that, (after he returned from Brighton) he told me he approved of her conduct much.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was this - A. When I first took him the tickets, he wished her to come forward and have five tickets, which she had left with him. She desired me not to tell him where she was to be found.</p>

            . I am an officer of Islington. I saw Smith in Farringdon-street, Russell-square, (which leads into the mews behind Mr. Phillimore's house) with a large bundle. I went after him, and asked him what he had there - he said he did not know. I asked whose it was - he said it was not his. I told him that was an evasive answer, and I should take him custody. I found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182201090057"/>it contained the articles stated in the indictment - I asked where it came from - he at first said it belonged to his fellow-servant, and then that he brought it from Mr. Phillimore's stables. I took him to the watch-house - then went to Mr. Phillimore's, and saw the coachman in the stable. I searched for the prisoner Nicholls; but could not find her. About five minutes after, I saw her in the house, in a very great perspiration, and very muddy - it was wet weather. I took her into the library, and asked how she became possessed of the property I had taken from Smith - she said she could account for every thing but the iron pot - and that some of them were given to her; which Mrs. Phillimore denied. I took her to No. 5, Coram-place, to Smith's, her brother-in-law, as she called him; but could find no such person. I searched her at the watch-house, and found twenty-six keys, and sixteen sovereigns on her - she said it was a general custom with servants who had been a long time in place, to take care of themselves, and she supposed I saw no harm in it - she then asked if there was no way of getting a friend to bribe me. I desired her to hold her tongue.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. When did you first see her - A. About nine o'clock - I saw Smith at eight o'clock. Mr. Phillimore claimed three or four of the keys, and I found they opened the drawers which he pointed out.</p>

            . On the 14th of December, about half-past eight o'clock, I went to Mrs. Phillimore's - Smith had been taken - we went to the stables, and saw the coachman there - went into the house, to look for Nicholls; but was not there - in about ten minutes, I saw her come in at the back door, from the street. She was asked where she had been? she said she had not been out of the house - she was very muddy, wet, and in a dreadful perspiration. She was questioned before Mrs. Phillimore, and said Mrs. Phillimore had given her the things - which Mrs. Phillimore denied. She did not say the iron pot was given to her; she said her brother-in-law, Smith, lived at No. 5, Coram-place. I asked why she said she had not been out - she said she did it to please her mistress. We went to Coram-place; but could not find him. I was present when she was told the bundle was found on Smith. The articles were read over to her - she said every thing but the iron pot was given to her.</p>

            . I am footman to Mr. Phillimore. When the officers came to the house, I was in the pantry. Nicholls came and asked me for the key of the area gate - I unlocked it for her; and while I stood there, I was told the officers were in the house. She ran across the road as hard as she could, in the direction for Coram-place, which is not above five minutes walk from the house. I think she returned before she could have gone there.</p>

            , ESQ. I live in Upper Montagu-street. Nicholls was four years in my service, as cook. The officer produced two bundles of keys, and several separate ones. I told him immediately that one loose one would open the tea-caddy, and the other the library table drawer, where I keep the keys of my cellar. I tried them, and they opened it - and four more on one of the bunches, I believe to be mine. One fitted the library table at my chambers, and the other the celeret. I had lost them about a year.</p>

I watched them for half an hour, they then went to Pilkington's shop - Bond stood against the door, Bensurilla stood against the window, and Stronic at the corner, watching. Bond bobbed in and out of the shop, and at last took the pigs head from the window, then went to the private door of the house, which is in Bedford-street, Covent Garden; the other two went up and joined him. Stronic put a handkerchief over the head, put it in his jacket, and went away - I followed and overtook him in Covent Garden with it under his jacket. Read took the other two.</p>
