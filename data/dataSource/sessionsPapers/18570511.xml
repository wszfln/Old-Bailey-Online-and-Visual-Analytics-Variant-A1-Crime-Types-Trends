He lived there previous to my coming there, two years and a half ago—he is in the Post Office—I do not know what his income is—he occupies the whole house; I do not know the rent of it—he is married, and has six or seven children at home, and one is in a public institution, Christ Church—I have frequently noticed the boy who is now standing on the floor of the Court; I first noticed him about twelve months back; he is a little vacant, which attracted my attention, and two or three months after that I noticed that he was very dirty, and was frequently scratching his head, and destroying the vermin that fell from him—he continued under my observa<lb/>tion from that time till Feb.—I communicated with the parish, but they took no notice; I communicated with them again about a fortnight after<lb/>wards, and next day the defendant came to my house after the authorities had been there—I said that I believed he was starving the boy; he said that he was doing no such thing, for he could assure me that he always cut</p>

               <p>public house, Half Moon Street, Bishopsgate, with a friend—I was sober—I saw the prisoner there and another man, who had on a flannel jacket and a cap—we had two pots of porter; three of us drank out of it, and the prisoner and his mate were asked to drink out of it, and did so—I do not remember coming out of the public house—I found myself in the station house—I had a watch when I went in, and a purse, containing a sovereign in the small compartment, and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the other part—it was safe when I took it out to pay for the beer—when I recovered my senses at the station, I had neither watch, purse, or money—my watch guard was round my neck, and the key attached to it was inside my waistcoat, as it was when I went out in the morning—I have not found them since.</p>

I remember sending six cases of goods to the St. Katherine's Docks on 27th March, 1856, intended for Adelaide, South Australia—I initiated the matter, and therefore I am positive as to the day—I recollect it from my books; from entries in my clerk's handwriting, and vouchers, and checks; they were seen by me at the time they were made—on many occasions I did not see the entry, but in this instance I did—that enables me to say that they were sent on 27th March—the prisoner took them in his father's cart; he carted all goods for me—I saw the goods delivered to the prisoner, and saw him start with them—there were no other goods in the cart—no directions were given him as to when he was to take them to the docks, but in the usual way; it was usual to take them at the time—the docks are about a walk of a quarter of an hour, or a drive with a small load of five or six minutes, within a mile—the marks and numbers of the cases were "C. C. and Co." and "G." over, "1088 to 1093"—they were packed in cases made of wood, covered with oil cloth, covered with tarpaulin, and covered with canvas, sewn up—the numbers were marked on each end of the packages twice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was it the ordinary kind of trunk or case that you made use of in your business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The ordinary kind—I was present when the book was compared with the marks on the cases—when I am in the way, I generally check these entries—I did so in this instance—I swear that—this is the entry of the warehouseman Nicholson—I saw these</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185705110019"/>
               <p>individual cases packed—I saw the oil cloth put on, the tarpaulin, and the canvas, all three—I saw two only put on, because the third was naturally put on; it was put on when the case was finished; the one I saw on, and the other two I saw put on—the marks are on each end, on the outside—Maybury's cart was in the habit of taking goods for me, sometimes two or three times a day, and sometimes about half a dozen times a week, I think for about two years and a half; during that time I have sent a very great many cases in his cart—I first heard of the loss of goods in July, last year; that was not of these, but some other goods—it was about two or two and a half months ago that I heard of these goods—I remember the prisoner going away with these goods—he generally carted smaller lots; when the quantity was small, his father has said, "I will send my son for them;" otherwise there were generally two men with them—I have a distinct recollection of this particular transaction—I swear that I recollect this individual cart going away with these six packages, and that there was nothing else in the cart.</p>

I know the prisoner by sight—in March, 1856, I received a shipping note; I have it here; I cannot say that I received it from the prisoner—I cannot say who the carman was—I received it, together with six packages, from a carman, on 28th March—after endorsing the charges on the back, I put it on the file in the office—it was then entered in a book, which I have, to ship from—I kept the note; it has been in the Company's possession ever since.</p>

                  </hi>. In March, 1856, I was mate of the <hi rend="italic">Narrahyarra</hi>, lying in St. Katherine's Docks. I have not got with me a list of the packages shipped on board the <hi rend="italic">Narrahyarra</hi>, I produced it at the Mansion-house a fortnight ago, but now it is in the ship, and the ship sailed ten days ago—I was present when the ship was unloaded—I witnessed the opening of three packages, containing soot, dirt, and rubbish; they were long trunks covered with tarpaulin, and sacking over the top; if I remember right, I think they were marked "G." on the top, and "C. C. and Co." underneath—I do not remember the numbers of those that were opened—I know the numbers were from 1, 088 to 1, 093—I think I saw two more packages, of the same description as the three I saw opened; one was opened before I went there, and one was left unopened.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's service. The prisoner has been in their service for ten years—he was employed in the workshop—in that workshop Was a box, which I placed a seal on, and delivered it to the policeman—that box was used by the prisoner himself, and I have seen him wear this coat that was taken out of it—this silk is the kind of silk that was used in the workshop, of which the prisoner was the overlooker—he had no right at all to any of this silk as perquisites—this silk is worth about 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound—this cloth is the property of Messrs. Moses—it is in pieces, but every particle of this cloth could be brought into use for making boots—I have examined all this property—to the best of my belief, it is all my employers'.</p>

Moses's—they are cut in this way for their business—here are six bundles of this linen—I do not identify these buttons, but I can identify the boxes they were in as having my mark on them—we buy them from different manufacturers—when the buttons are used the boxes become waste boxes—I identify these pieces of cloth with the seal on them—I believe I have examined all the pieces in these bundles—a great many have no mark—I am only able to</p>

               <p>identify those which have the "E. M.

Moses twelve years—I have sold the prisoner a trowsers length of cloth, for which, of course, he had a bill—I do not know whether there were bills found in his possession; there might be—if I have sold him anything, it would be a length for a pair of trowsers—I may have sold him other things for his own wear; I really cannot tell—I do not know whether he had a shop—I will not undertake to say that he did not keep one—I may have sold him cloth; I never sold him silk—I do not recollect that I ever gave him things to take home to work at; I might have done it; I cannot tell what, nor when, nor what sort of things; it must have been clothing—he was to work at them, and make them up—he was not to cut them out—the cutter would cut them out—they would not come into my hands after they were out out—the material is given to the cutter to cut out—it would then go to the trimmer; he would put the trimmings—they would then come to the giver-out, Mr. Griffiths, and it would be his business to give them out—I give them out occasionally—I know a person named Kelly—I do not recollect that I have sold cloth to him; I might have done so, not on many occasions.</p>

Dear Sirs,—You will greatly accommodate me by sending per bearer the enclosed order. I shall be calling on you in the course of the week to make a selection, when I will settle my account with you. Yours respectfully, J. W. Webb,—16 plate to pattern, 1 gilt spring, 3 1/4 in. wheels, 1 1/2 in. ditto thick, and 1 bag of plaister")—I objected to give him the goods, because it is usual to pay for one order under the other, and the order of 9th April had not been paid for—I told him so, and he said that Mr. Webb had sent no money, but would call—I requested him to wait while I con<lb/>sulted my brother, upon which he made for the door, opened it, and went out—he ran down the street, and was brought back by one of our men, and was given into custody; he said nothing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the detective officers of the City of London—I have been employed for some time in endeavouring to trace letters of this kind—I took the prisoner into custody on Wednesday, 22nd April; Thain was with me—she was taken to the station; I told her we took her into custody on suspicion of writing these abominable, disgusting letters to Messrs. Welch and Margetson, and numerous other persons in the City—she said, "How can you say so, Mr. Bull? how can you prove it?"—she was living at No. 5, Bridge water Square, at this time—I received this key from the female searcher—I asked the prisoner if it was her key; she said, "Yes," of her room door—I found it open the room where she lived—I went there with Thain, accompanied by Mr. Bruff, the landlord box there I found these two letters, one addressed to Mr. Simmons, No. 21, Gutter Lane, Post-office; and the other, "For the person who conducts the stock and mantle business;" one of them is of the most filthy description—on 1st Dec., I saw the prisoner write a letter which I have here—I have also another letter addressed to me at the police station; I spoke to the pri<lb/>soner about that letter the same day that I received it—I said, "I have received this letter from you, Miss Hamilton;" she said, "Yes, I wanted to see you, Mr. Bull"—to the best of my belief, these two letters of 24th March and 1st April, are in her handwriting—I also produce two letters which I found in a cupboard at Mrs. Burley's—I went there in consequence of what the pri<lb/>soner said—when Thain and I waited on the prisoner, and told her we were very anxious to find out this matter, the prisoner said, "If you searched for stolen property you would find it, would you not?"—I said, "Yes, if it was in the house"—she said, "Well, if you go to Mrs. Burley's, I have no doubt you will find some letters there"—we made an appointment to go there with her; we wanted to go at once, but she said, "No, you had better go in the evening," which we did, about 9 o'clock—the prisoner went in first—Thain</p>

               <p>and I went in seven or eight minutes afterwards—I looked over the room, and she said, "Look in the cupboard, Mr. Bull, look in the cupboard;" I did so, and there found these two letters; they were at the corner of the cupboard in a saucer; I believe these to be in her handwriting—Mrs. Burley was in the room; I should say she was drunk; from inquiries I made, I find she drinks about sixty pennyworths of rum a day—she is a fortune teller—upon these letters being found, she said in the prisoner's presence, "It is a plant upon me; I know nothing of them"—Mrs. Burley was taken into custody, and remanded for a week, and was then discharged.</p>

                  </hi>. In March, I had some premises at No. 21, Little Alie Street, where I carried on the business of a waterproofer. On a Sunday nigh in March, my house was burnt down—I was away from home at the time—the two prisoners had worked for me—a person named Myers Goldsberg was my foreman—after the fire, I took a place at No. 6, George Street, Minories—shortly afterwards the two prisoners came to my house, with a third person—Robinson came up stairs to me, and said, "Mr. Stern, I want some money"—I said, "What for?"—he said, "I must have money; I am very poor; I have got no work; I want to go to America; you must give us 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each to go away, or I will go to the insurance office, and say that you set your house on fire"—I told them to come again in an hour's time—they all three came, and Robinson spoke out, and said, "I am <hi rend="italic">hard up</hi>, will you give us the money or not I"—I said, "I have no money; you know my own things were damaged by water and fire; I have no money"—I was a quarter of an hour talking to him—a gentleman came knocking at the private door, and I went away with him—during the quarter of an hour they were with me, one said, "If you don't give us 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, I will go so far" (<hi rend="italic">Drawing his hand across his throat</hi>)—they said they would swear anything, they would swear black was white, if I did not give the money—Robinson said, "I will give you till 4 o'clock to go for the money"—I said, "Yes, you wait here"—he said he had read the papers, and found that I was insured in the West of England, and should receive the money, and I must give him some—I went away with my friend, and left them—I met Robinson six or seven days afterwards in Whitechapel Road, opposite the church—I was with another man, and we all three walked together; Robinson began to laugh—I said, "What do you laugh at?"—he said, "I am very sorry I went to the insurance office, and said you set the place on fire yourself"—I said, "It was very wrong to go and tell a lie; you know I was not at home at the time; I was away during the time it was on fire"—he said, "You know very well there is no work; I want to go away from London; if you will give me the money now, I will go away to-morrow morning, and will not go against you"—he told me to meet him by Aldgate Church, between 8 and 9 o'clock—I told him I should bring the money there—I said to him, "Where are the others?"—he said he had been to one of them, and could not find him—I met him at 8 o'clock by Aldgate Church—he said he could not find the others—he said he would go to Goldsberg's—I said, "Go, and I will wait for you"—I did not wait—he went away—I next saw Greenbow, and he told me to come with him to his brother's, and give him the money there, and he would go away the next morning—I said, "I can't give you any money, if you do not give me a receipt"—he went away, and brought Robinson with him to Whitechapel, and we went to Morris, a cigar maker,</p>

               <p>at Aldgate—when we got there, there were two policemen in plain clothes, placed there by my direction—I came into the shop, and Mr. Morris said to the policeman, "I have some private business to do, will you walk out?" and they walked into the front shop—I, and Morris, and the two prisoners went into the back room—I had left directions with Morris what to do, to make a receipt for the money—Green bow then said to Robinson, "There is something suspicious here; I will tell you what, we won't take the money here"—there was a little talking together, and they walked away, and I went with them—while we were there, Robinson said he had made up his mind; he could not go with 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he must have 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he must have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to buy some clothes—when they walked out, and I was with them, Robinson said, "You had better come to my landlord; you give me the money here, and I will give you the receipt"—the prisoners were both together at that time—the policemen were behind, and I gave them both in charge—they were taken to the station, and they were discharged—the inspector said, "If they come again to annoy you, lock them up."</p>

               <p>Robinson very particularly, I want to call him into a public house and give him something to drink; I want to give him some money"—I said, "You are a very liberal man to give him some money, perhaps you will give some to me"—he said, "No, I have no reason to give you money, you don't know anything at all about the case"—he did not come by himself he came with Mr. Goldsberg, and another man—I listened to all he had to say—he said, "I want to give him some money if he would leave England"—I and I could not say anything, I could not interfere in it—Robinson lived in my house three or four months; he was always honourable to me—I never heard anything against him.</p>

I am a confectioner, of No. 52, Blackfriars Road On 24th April, a little before 10 o'clock, I was looking at the soldiers exer<lb/>cising on Tower Hill—I felt something knock my leg—I put my hand to my pocket, and saw the prisoner Lander pass my cigar case to another thief, but my tobacco box was found on him—I did not give him time to pass the tobacco box—it fell from his hand, and I picked it up—I got the two boys, one in each hand, and took them to near the Mint, by a clothes shop, where the prisoner Phillips called to me, and said, "There is a policeman;" taking the other boy by the collar—he said to Lander, "What is the matter, Rob!"—he said that I said he had robbed me—Phillips immediately took my arm, got the thief by the collar, and said, "Leave the boy; go away"—I found that a trick was being played on me, and said, "I shall not; I will give him in charge"—immediately on that a mob came round me, and treated me very badly—a man got hold of my watch, and I was obliged to let my prisoner go to preserve it, and Phillips said to the boy, "Bite his arm"—I am certain Phillips is the man.</p>

On 24th April I was having my shoes cleaned on the elevated ground between the Shipping Office and the Crooked Billet—I saw the prosecutor by Postern Row, facing the pump, with two boys in his hands—he was from 170 to 200 yards from Slowman's shop, coming towards it—they came up on the Tower side, and then crossed the road, passed Slowman's shop, and continued up King Street—I saw Phillips standing in the doorway, with his hands in his pockets—he never moved outside the lobby—I crossed over to the coffee shop opposite, and saw the rescue—the prosecutor moved seventy-two feet six inches beyond where Phillips stood</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185705110063"/>
               <p>before the rescue took place, the mob then met him; he turned round, and was hit on the arm, or pushed against, and he let go of the boy who he had with his left hand, and retained the one in his right—the other boy fell—the person who hit him had a moustache, and a light great coat—during the whole of that time Phillips did not leave the shop.</p>

I was taken into custody, charged with being concerned in this robbery; I was discharged—on 7th April I saw the prisoner come along Whitechapel, and at the cor<lb/>ner of Thomas Street, three men laid hold of him; one of them, who I know by sight, put his hands round his neck, and I saw the prisoner stand<lb/>ing before him, but could not see what he was doing, or whether he had his hands in Cavalier's pocket, as the prisoner's back was towards me—they ran away, and Cavalier fell down and remained in that state about five minutes; he then got up and called "Police!"—I picked his hat up, and a policeman took me into custody—I told him what I knew about it—I have known the prisoner about three years—he called on me in the House of Detention, when I was remanded, and asked me whether I was going to say anything about it, and I said, "No."</p>

About 9 o'clock on the morning of 21st April I saw the prisoners in the Commercial Road, together—Pokes was carrying a bundle and Wheeler a coat—I saw Wheeler go into a pawn<lb/>broker's shop; Pokes stayed outside—I waited till Wheeler came to the door, and then I asked him what he went there for—he said, "A coat"—I went in with him, and the pawnbroker gave me the coat, and Wheeler gave him back the money—I took him into custody—I asked him where he got it from; he said that it was his brother's—I said that was not satisfactory, and then he said that a man had given it to him, that he had changed boots with him—another constable then took Wheeler—afterwards I made inquiries, and went to Messrs. Wagoner's, the sugar refiners, in Wellclose Square—I examined the front doors outside, they were folding doors—the wood work had been cut away, making a place large enough to admit a man's hand, so that he could open the door—I was let in, and in the sugar warehouse I found a box, broken open—the lock had been forced—Mr. Bonta came in afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. On 7th April I went, accom<lb/>panied by a gentleman named Greening, to the office of the <hi rend="italic">Day</hi> news<lb/>paper; I saw the defendant—I took this copy of the <hi rend="italic">Day</hi> from my pocket, and said to Mr. Nosworthy, "There is an article in this paper called, 'Well Served, or the Biter Bitten,' you are the printer of it?"—he said, "You will see at the bottom; I did print that copy"—I said, "The object of my calling upon you is to get you to give up the author;" he said, "I shall require time to consider whether I shall do that"—Mr. Greening asked whether Mr. Scott was in—Mr. Nosworthy said, "No," and that he was out of town, and would not be back either all that day or for some days, I am not sure which—at that moment Mr. Scott came out from the back room half dressed—Nosworthy appeared extremely confused, and said, "Why, what, are you up?" which Scott did not appear to understand—I showed Mr. Scott this paper, and referred him to the article; I said, "Will you give me up the author of that article?"—Mr. Scott replied, "Go to the <hi rend="italic">Times office</hi>, and ask the editor for the author of the leading article there"—I then turned to Mr. Nosworthy, and said, "Do you intend to give me the name of the author or not?"—he said, "No, I shall not"—I said, "Am I to consider that your answer?"—he said, "Yes, that is my answer"—I then said, "If you decline to give up the name of the author, you, as printer, must take the consequences"—he said, "Very well," and then turned and walked out before me.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a compositor, at No. 11, Red Lion Court—I have always understood it to be the office of Mr. Scott—I believe Mr. Scott gave the article to me—I set up the commencement of the type—Mr. Scott was not present all the time—Mr. Nosworthy was in the house at the time it was being set up—he was present during part of the time it was being set up—he saw it to my knowledge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you a servant of Mr. Scott's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was a workman of his—the type was set up on the day which is attached to the paper, March 7th, in the afternoon—a small number of copies were taken off to be circulated among the parties that were written about, that were concerned in it—that was the afternoon before it was published—I have no recollection of what day it was, but copies were printed of it before it was published—I remember Mr. Nosworthy being away ill at his place at Hoxton some time—I do not know when that was—he has been away ill several times; I cannot say whether or not before or after Saturday, 7th March—some one gave this article oat to be printed—I do not think it would have been printed if Mr. Scott had not been there—my reason for saying that is, that Mr. Nosworthy scarcely ever undertook anything of importance if Mr. Scott was not there, and he was then there—I earn, under 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—Nosworthy was paid as much as he could get, sometimes, much and sometimes little—Saturday was considered the pay day when he could get it—I cannot say that I have seen Mr. Scott pay him money, but I have heard Nosworthy say he had received a trifle—I am jobbing now for Taylor's—this place, No. 11, Red Lion Court, is supposed to be Mr. Scott's—Nosworthy managed Scott's business—he called him a foreman, but we called him an overseer—in Nosworthy's absence Scott mixed himself up in the business as much as he could—Scott lived upon the premises, and gave out the copies—I know a person named O'Donnell—it was supposed that he took the place of overseer in Nosworthy's absence—I do not know whether he might be considered as managing the business, but Mr. Scott gave him copies to give out—he did Nosworthy's duty when he was away—the way I remember this particular article is this, after I had received the subpœna (for I was not at all acquainted with the substance</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185705110074"/>
               <p>of the article)—I came to the office, and then I showed it to Mr. Scott and Mr. Nosworthy, and it was brought back to my recollection, and I recol<lb/>lected it when I turned things over, and Mr. Nosworthy brought me forward the slip, which was my bill, and then I remembered that I had put some of it up—a portion of my bill was paid on that Saturday, I think by Mr. Nosworthy, but I do not recollect—I believe the article was given out by Scott—I do not recollect by whom a part of my bill was paid—I will not swear that Nosworthy paid me, or whether I received any money at all that night—I do not know when the name of Nosworthy first appeared as printer to this paper, or when his name was removed after 7th March—I know there was a difference between Mr. Scott and Nosworthy about Nosworthy not coming to do his duty—it was a difficult thing to please Mr. Scott—Nosworthy did not please him—I do not recollect the date when this difference occurred—I know that about this time there was some difference between Nosworthy and Scott, and that then Mr. Scott removed Nosworthy's name from the paper—Scott said he would not put up with it any longer, but would have some one who would do better—I understood he sent for a man named Jones, of the <hi rend="italic">Dispatch</hi>, but he did not get him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 11, Red Lion Court.

I said, "You had better step up to the <hi rend="italic">Times office</hi>, and inquire the practice there"—Nosworthy had been absent since the Tuesday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a trimming manufacturer, and live in Hunt Street. On the morning of 30th April, I had been in the Whitechapel County Court, and a verdict was given against me—it was for a milk business which I had purchased of the defendants—on leaving the Court, I saw the defendants; neither of them said anything to me then about buying the business back, but a month or so before Griffith Griffiths had said it was worth 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he would not mind giving me that for it—on the evening of 30th April, I went to Griffith Griffiths to ask if he would give me the money he had said—I had not seen Robert Griffiths for a month before—my wife, my daughter, and my son, went with me, and I said to them, "You stop here while I go and see if Griffith Griffiths will give the money"—I arrived at his place, in Slater Street, about 8 o'clock—Robert Griffiths was at the door, and Griffith Griffiths was sitting by the fire—I spoke to Robert Griffiths, as I had not seen him so long, and I was going to ask him to have a glass of ale—he told me to be off, and he struck me in the eye with his fist, and then he struck me on the head with a long stick, with a knob to it—I considered it was one that they drive the cows with—it was with the knob he struck me on the head—I was stunned for a moment, and fell, and on recovering I looked and saw Griffith Griffiths strike my daughter across the forehead with a poker—Robert Griffiths caught hold of me, and while I was tussling with him, I caught his coat, and part of his coat came into my hand—that is all recollect.</p>

"I will give you something," and he was holding up the stick—I went to the station, and was attended by a surgeon for eight days.</p>

I took the state of it—it was 13, 600, it having been at 0 when it was put up—the state of the wet meter was 189, 300, it having been at 176, 200 on 7th Nov.—that shows a consumption of 13, 100 feet—about 500 feet difference between the two metres would be reasonably accounted for by the single light—the meters, according to my judgment, acted correctly one with the other—I again, on 17th Dec., examined the test meter—it was at 41, 600, showing a consump<lb/>tion since 22nd Nov. of 28, 000 feet—the other meter had only registered 192, 800, showing a consumption of only 3, 500 between the two dates, so that the balance against the Company was 24, 500—I deduct about two feet an hour for the single pipe—1, 000 feet would be a very ample allowance—I again examined the test meter on 27th Feb., and found it at 116, 600—the other meter was at 257, 900, the difference being 9, 900—that consump<lb/>tion of 9, 900 feet, would have gone on for about ten days—I went to the defendant's premises on 27th Feb., saw a girl in the bar, and spoke to her—the cellar door in which the meter was, was open, and I saw the defendant in the cellar—on getting up to the meter, I found this piece of India rubber pipe with unions (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) affixed to the meter, so that it would carry away the gas—it had a piece of cane in it, to keep it expanded—one end was attached to the service pipe, and the other to the fittings, passing over the meter—there was a light in the cellar—the defendant said that he had occasion to take the meter down, as his light burned badly last night, and he was going to send notice to us—nothing further passed till I went for Mr. Hersey, who was outside—he looked at it and told Mr. Silcock that it was a very serious affair; that the Company were defrauded to a very great extent, and that they must make an example of it—he said that he hoped he should not be the first, for the sake of the respectability of his family—a candle was brought afterwards, and there was no escape of gas; if there had been, there would have been an explosion, we could not have taken a light there—if 24, 000 feet had escaped in a quarter of a year, a person could not have gone down there with a light with safety—the defendant's meter was taken down on 4th March—it was tested, and found to be quite correct—the test meter was tested on 27th Feb., and found to be correct—I had also examined it before it was put down—the defendant's meter had been proved about twelve months before.</p>

SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> by you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—this picture represents a meter with the fittings complete, and another with the fittings detached, and a temporary pipe put up to keep up the supply—it does not represent any premises precisely—here are two vaults and two wet meters—a dry meter has chambers through which the gas passes, and in this case it was placed in an adjoining house—two chambers in it are made of leather, and while they are filling with gas they expand; they then discharge the gas, and fill again, and the valve marks in feet the gas dis<lb/>charged; and there are arms which regulate the extent to which the cham<lb/>bers</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185705110087"/>
               <p>should expand—each chamber holds a certain quantity of gas—it is not exactly like a safety valve—a pressure of one-tenth of gas will work the meter—if the leather is worn out, it would lead to an error, but it is regu<lb/>lated by the arms—the gas will not escape from the chambers until the arm is extended—I do not consider a dry meter a more certain test than a wet one—I put down a dry one because it is more convenient—if I had put a wet one in an exposed situation it might have been frozen—wet meters are liable to be affected by frost in exposed situations—I do not call a cellar an exposed situation—I should not object to pass a night in this cellar—the pipe connecting the service with the meter has not been out of order—we have been doing something to it very lately; not because it was out of order, but to test the soundness of the pipe which we were laying in the ground—that was done two or three days ago, for the purposes of this case—they were sound, and nothing was done to them but what was necessary to test their soundness—no repairs were done to them—Walters is a gas fitter—I am not ashamed of a gas fitter, but I objected to mention his name at first, because I thought it was not quite prudent, it might prevent us getting infor<lb/>mation—I am not going to work Walters again, as well as the dry meter—I may be wrong, but I want it to be understood, that if persons give infor<lb/>mation, their names shall not be mentioned—I have to make a quarterly return to the Company—I do not know that the defendant has been charged on a calculation of the lights burned on the assumption of the meter being down; he was charged for 29, 000 feet, which was estimated from the gas<lb/>burners when the meter was down—that is the extent that was calculated in proportion to the working of the meter while it was up—it is a simple rule of three question—we had notice of it then—I cannot say now whether we had that notice through the gas fitter; he is the person to give the notice—I found that Walters was the gas fitter, but it was not through him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Dry or wet, if the meters are in good order, do they register accurately the number of feet of gas which is consumed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—dry meters have been used a dozen or fifteen years, and wet meters a much longer period—although they act differently, they make an accurate register, and the result is the same—these two meters were in perfectly good order—I tested them on 27th Feb. and 4th March—it is impossible that if they had been out of order while the gas was working through them, that they could have been in good order again when I examined them—about eight gallons of water is sufficient to charge the wet meter to the proper water line—I never gave any one permission to do this—I was not aware that this India rubber pipe had been used—the calcula<lb/>tion of 29, 000 feet is a simple rule of three sum by which we ascertain the consumption for the time, but in that instance we had notice, and the meter was taken down at Mr. Silcock's request, he being of opinion that it was out of order, and it was proved and refixed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The soundness of the pipes that you tested were the service pipes between the defendant's meter and the test meter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—if a wet meter freezes, the consumer gets no supply; and if the water gets too low, he will be without light, but varying according to the degree—when the water is below the water line, the consumer gets an advantage, as the chamber is enlarged—he gets rather more than is registered, but when the wet meter was examined there was a sufficient quantity of water in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief inspector to the Metropolitan Gas Com<lb/>pany. On 27th Feb. I was sent for to Mr. Silcock's; I went into the cellar, and found him and his man there and the last witness—the pipe connecting the inlet with the outlet of the meter was disconnected, and the two pipes were united together by this india rubber pipe (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the Company lay down the pipes to the consumer's house, and from the house the pipe belongs to the consumer—I asked the defendant to give me an explanation of the meter being disconnected and the pipe being put there; he said that the meter was out of order, and he had taken it down, and put the pipe, as the supply was so bad—I asked him if he had given any notice; he said that he had not, he thought the fitter would have done so—I said that it was a very serious case, I had had information that he had been taking gas in that way for a very long period, and that the Company were determined to prosecute all these cases for the sake of example—he said that for the sake of his respectable family he hoped he should not be the one to be made an example of—I asked him if he could give me the name and address of the fitter who had placed the india rubber pipe there; he said that he could not, he only knew him from his occasionally coming into his public house to get beer, and that the pipe was the fitter's property, and he thought if I would give him time, that he could find him—I told him he had better come to the principal office, in John Street, in the after<lb/>noon, and give an explanation; he came, and then said that the pipe had been up two days, and that he had also had it in use before Christmas, about six or eight months previous—I inquired if he had given us any notice at that time; he said that he had not, neither had he said anything to the collector when he called for the money—he said again that the cause of his removing the meter was his having a bad light—I arranged with him that he should attend at the Company's works on the following Wednesday with his meter, for the purpose of having it tested, to see whether it would give sufficient light, and to have some experienced person with him on his part; he said that he would produce his gas fitter, that he thought he should be able to find him by that time—Marriott went down to his house to take the meter down, and it was brought to the works, but he did not attend—he sent a respectable gas fitter in his neighbourhood, Guy—I saw the meter proved; it was perfectly correct and allowed sufficient gas to pass for more than the number of burners he had—I did not test it when it was put down, but it was proved by the Company—if it acted correctly on 22nd Nov., and acted incorrectly afterwards, it would not be possible, in my opinion, for it to get into good order again by the time I examined it—when I was in the cellar I smelt nothing, nor was there any explosion; if there had been an escape to any large amount, I should have noticed it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gas fitter, of No. 7, Blandford Street, Portman Square, and have been so nineteen or twenty years. I have worked for the defendant for the last four or five years; I blow joints in the cellar for his beer casks—I first saw an india rubber pipe similar to this in the cellar about the illumination time; it was on a beer barrel—I first saw it in operation on either 8th or 9th Sept., 1856, in the morning—I had my boy with me at work there—the connecting pipe was taken off the meter, the india rubber pipe was affixed, and the gas was going through—I said to Mr. Silcock that same day, before I began to work, "You are burning gas without going through the meter;" he said, "I know that, I have got per<lb/>mission</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185705110089"/>
               <p>from Mr. Marriott"—I believed that, or I should not have done the work without giving the Company notice—I worked for him after that, on the beer pipes, during the alteration of the gas and the iron work; I was sent by the builder, as the house was going through an alteration—I was not there all the time, but whenever I went into the cellar at other times I saw it on—I spoke to Hamilton, the man, about it, but the defendant was not present—I afterwards told the defendant he would get himself into trouble if he did not have the pipe disconnected, and get me into trouble likewise—that was in front of the bar, in October—I went into the cellar to carry a water pipe along it; I affixed a new ring, and put the supply pipe into the bar; and when I was in the cellar, I said to Mr. Silcock, "That pipe is still on, we shall get ourselves into trouble; you will get yourself into trouble, and you will get me into trouble"—I told him that he would get himself convicted <hi rend="italic">to</hi> prison; he told me that I need not trouble my head with his business, and directly I came up the steps he up with his fist, and <hi rend="italic">floored</hi> me in the bar, and we had a fight, and then we went outside, into the arch, and finished our fight out, and in the heat of passion I called him a d—d thief—it was made up afterwards, so far as we had a drop of gin and water together—I finished my work the same afternoon—when I saw the <hi rend="italic">pony</hi>, I put the meter into it's place, and left it in order, and gave the <hi rend="italic">pony</hi> into Mr. Silcock's hands, and he put it down under the bar.</p>

Q.</hi> You had your gin and water, and you informed the Gas Company? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I told the defendant that he would get convicted and sent to prison, because I knew Mr. Marriott would not have given permission to use that pipe for a month—I did believe that Mr. Marriott had given him permission to use it for one day, but it was working all the time I was there—if I had disconnected it, I must have given the Gas Company notice—I have been to the defendant's house many a time since; I have not told him that the whole case depended on my testimony—I have said nothing of the kind—when I was subpœnaed as a witness, I told him of it—I went there and told him, as I was in the habit of going there three or four times a week—I told him that I was sub<lb/>poenaed because he told me he was summoned—I believe that was all I said on the subject; I do not know whether I am compelled to state every word that was said—I cannot recollect it; that is all I remember—I said nothing about the nature of the evidence I should give that I am aware of—I did not say that on my evidence he must be convicted, that I am aware of—it was before we went to High Street that I went and told him I was subpœnaed—I told him that I was the only witness against him, and there was no harm in telling him that; I did not mean any harm by it—I should not have liked to take any price not to tell—it is not very likely that I should have yielded to a little gentle compulsion—I decidedly did not go for the very purpose of getting money from him—I did not go to arrange the affair—it could not be much harm to tell him that I believed I was the only witness against him—I went to a man named Parsons; he was working with me in Silcock's cellar—I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the work he did for me; I did not offer him another 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I spoke to him about the pipe; he saw it on, and was subpœnaed by the Gas Company and also by Mr. Sil<lb/>cock—he was working in my shop; I did not ask him to come and give evidence, certainly not; I said, "You saw the pipe on, <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi>, did not you?" he said, "Decidedly so," and he was subpœnaed by the Gas Com<lb/>pany—I did not tell him he would be well paid by the Company; I said that he would be paid his expenses, as he said that he could not afford to lose his time—I was here as a witness a little time ago, in Sergeant Bew<lb/>lay's</p>

I have carried on that business eleven years, and have had much experience both in dry and wet meters—I examined the meter in the defendant's cellar last night; it was in a proper position, and worked correctly if properly charged with water; it was then properly charged—the evaporation of water in three months would be about a pint, which would be about 1 per cent. against the Company and in favour of the consumer—there was no escape of gas, the pipe was close to the meter—if there had been a large escape, it would have been dangerous if a light was brought there.</p>

I know the prisoners; they came to my house, and took a room, on 19th of March, a month before they were apprehended—I only knew the name of one, which was Wilson, I did not know the name of the other—they lived together, and occupied the same room till the Thursday when they were taken.</p>

On Friday, 24th April, I was in the garden about 5 minutes after 3 o'clock, I cannot speak to a minute—the house stands back about ten yards from the iron gates—I was standing at the corner of the house about four yards from the hall door—I saw a man leave the hall door with a sort of carpenter's basket in his hand; he walked direct from the door to the iron gate, opened the gate, and as he was shutting it, he raised his hat, and said, "Good day," as if he was speaking to some one at the hall door—I see that man in Court, it was the shortest prisoner, Day—as he went from the hall door to the gate, I only had an opportunity of seeing his face sideways—I saw him at the gate when he shut it, and then as he turned towards the hall door, and I saw him after<lb/>wards in the cart—there was a cart outside, and a tall man in it; I could not swear to that man—I did not see Day get into the cart, but I saw him in it before he was well seated—I had an opportunity of seeing his face after he got into the cart, he turned and looked back towards the house, towards where I was standing in the road—immediately ascertained that a robbery had been committed—on the next Tuesday evening, the 28th, I went with Cowan, a policeman, and Hunter, a detective officer, to Bethnal Green, to the Reindeer public house—I went in with one of the officers, and saw some men there—I did not see Day there—we came out, and went across the road to the other constable, and as we stood talking there, the prisoner Devo came outside the door, and looked right and left—I spoke to the constable; Devo went back into the house again—the constable and I then went into the house, and met Devo returning, and Day along with him, down the steps into the street—I immediately recognised Day, the moment I saw him—the officers took them both into custody—neither of the officers had pointed Day out to me—I have no doubt now (<hi rend="italic">looking at Day</hi>) that he is the man I saw leaving Mr. Green's house on the occasion in question—Devo resembles the other man that I saw in the cart, in figure and appearance.</p>

Q.</hi> How do you happen to know that this was Friday, 24th April? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have a most excellent guide to go by, and that is that the Excise officer called in at my place on that day, and took my permits away, and signed the book the 24th April—that was at 2 o'clock or a little after—I do not know the Excise officer's name; he never signs his name, only just puts his initials; he is not here, I meant to bring the book—Devo was in front of the bar, not in my room—the three persons I have named were not standing with him the whole of the time—it was about half past 2 o'clock when Mr. Magnus drank with the prisoner—Mr. Magnus did not remain there any length of time, for he had an execution in a house opposite, and he was obliged to go backwards and forwards there—Moulton came in somewhere about 3 o'clock, it was just before the prisoner left—Mr. Magnus had gone then—I think he and the prisoner both went out together, but that I cannot exactly say, for I was about the place about my duty—I did not see Devo leave, but it is my usual practice to go up stairs and lie down about 3 o'clock, and I recollect going up stairs, and leaving him at the bar—Britton was standing at the bar with him; I believe they left together, but I left them at the bar when I went up stairs—I did not look at the clock when I went up stairs—I should not think I lost sight of Devo for five minutes during the whole of the time he was there—I had my dinner while he was there, but my bar parlour is almost in the bar, so that we do not lose sight of any person—I was examined before the Magistrate last Saturday week.</p>

I know Devo—I saw him at my house on 24th April—he came in about a quarter past 3 o'clock, and I left him there at 25 minutes to 4 o'clock, when I went out—I did not see any one else—there was no other customer in the house but him at that time—I did not hear of his being in custody until nearly a week after—I was then called on, and gave evidence before the Magistrate.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When were you examined before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Last Saturday week and last Saturday—I recollect this was on 24th April, because I was filling up gin at the time, and found I was short of spirit, and I said, "I must go to Booth's directly," which I did; I was going there when I left—he was in front of the bar—I do not believe there were any other customers in the house when he came in—there might have been a casual customer come in afterwards, I cannot say—I have never seen Devo and Day together, to my knowledge—I have seen Day before—I do not know that he is a leather seller—Devo occasionally comes to my house; I dare say he has called in something like once or</p>

               <p>twice in a week, and sometimes not once in a month—I should think he had not called in for three months before—I cannot mention any other day on which he was there—I know the exact hour on this occasion, because I could not see Mr. Law, the head man, at Booth's after 4 o'clock, and that made me look up at the clock, and it was a quarter to 3 o'clock just before Devo came in, and as I passed Shoreditch Church it wanted 20 minutes to 4 o'clock—my house is something like 300 or 400 yards from Shoreditch Church.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a parcels deliverer to the General Steam Navigation Company. On Friday, 17th April, about 6 o'clock, I was in Woolwich, in a public house, the Star I think—I was with Ager, a friend whom I had been to see at the barracks, and we had some half and half—the prisoner was there drinking with another female; they asked Ager to drink, and he did so, and I think I did—they finished what they had, and went out, leaving us there; we went out about five minutes afterwards towards the Arsenal, and met them, and all went to the Mortar Tavern, and waited till 9 o'clock, when it was time for my friend to go into the barracks—he wished us good night, and I went with the two females to a public house about half a mile away, and from there to their home—I was in their room for an hour; I was with the prisoner, and a young man, who was a stranger to me, was with the other—we then all four proceeded to another public house, we went to a room at the back of the bar and sat down, and while there I fell asleep; when I awoke I found my waistcoat undone, and missed my watch and guard, and about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the girls were then gone, and this young man, whom the prisoner had represented to be her cousin from Dart<lb/>ford, said that they had only just gone out, and would be back directly—I first saw him at the Mortar Tavern; he came in, and the prisoner got up and had a slight conversation, and he sat down, and remained in our company till I fell asleep—he said, "I will go and see if I can find them, and you come with me"—he took me about the town, and when we were by the side of Woolwich theatre, where there is a little turning, he said, "Stay here, I shall not be a minute;" I thought he was a long while gone, and looked down the court, and found that he had gone—I found my way back to the green<lb/>grocer's shop, where the prisoner and the other woman lived, and a <hi rend="italic">lady</hi> put her head out at the window, and said that they had gone—I left my name and address there, and they said that they had no doubt she would be there again, and they would give her in charge—I have seen my watch and guard since—I was perfectly sober; I had had no spirits, only half and half, and I did not take enough to make me in the least intoxicated.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer and fruiterer, and am the landlord of this house. The prisoner lived there two nights—on the first night, the 15th, she took a single bed for herself and her companion, and next morning she took a furnished room, and told us that she was an arti<lb/>ficial flower maker, and that the other was a dressmaker—they came in on the evening of the 17th with Laing, at a little after 9 o'clock, but I did not see him till they came down—perceiving that things were not right, my wife went up and knocked at the door, and told her it was time for the com<lb/>pany to withdraw, for I did not like their proceedings, and the prisoner came down to know if I would allow the young men to sleep there in their bed—I said, "No"—she said, "Will you allow them to sleep in the bed we slept in the first nigh?"—I said, "No"—she said, "If you will not allow the young men to sleep, we will not stop"—I said, "You can do as you please," and they went out, but without their things—I and my family went to bed, and just before 12 o'clock the prisoner came knocking at the door in great haste—I said, "You. might have told us you were coming in, and I should have sat up"—she said, "My brother has come down from London, and has brought me a watch, my aunt sent it to me by my brother"—I said, "Go along up stairs to your room, I do not want to know anything about your watch"—she said, "I am not going to stop," and packed up her clothes, and was off in five minutes—I saw a watch at the police court, it was the same that the prisoner showed me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Lieutenant Robert Saxby, of No. 6, Queen Elizabeth Row, Greenwich. He is attended by a medical gentleman—I saw him this morning, he is too ill to attend this Court—on Friday, 24th April, I saw the prisoners; they first came to my master's house about 7 o'clock in the morning—I saw them both, the prisoners are the men—Janes spoke to me and said, "Shall I take the dust away?"—I said that my master did not like it taken away before he was about—he said there were two of them, and they would not be long taking it; French was then standing just by the gate—there was a cart and horse there—I had an opportunity of seeing French at that time—I refused to let them have it, and they came again a little before 10 o'clock—my master was up at that time, and I then gave them permission to remove the dust—there is a short garden from the front of the house to the road—the dust bin is in the back yard—the prisoners had to pass through the passage from the front door to the back door to get to the dust bin—there were several coats hanging in the passage—Janes came in with the basket to remove the dust—French stood by the cart, he did not do anything—they were engaged about half an hour in removing the dust—while they were removing it, my mistress called me—I came up to the passage, and found a coat lying in the passage—I picked it up, and hung it on the pegs again—it was my master's, and the other coats that were there were my master's—when I came up into the passage, being called by my mistress, I saw Trench standing by the cart—I returned to the kitchen again, which is underground, and while there heard persons walking along the passage—my master was in the back garden—on one occasion I heard the person who went along the passage stop short before he got to the back door, and having stopped he turned back to the front door, and went out, without going through the passage—no one came to the house while they were there—the cart drove away—that was about two minutes after I had heard the man's steps come into the passage and return—I went up to shut the door directly I saw the cart go away from the door, and when I came up I saw Janes, who was just coming back with the cart; he asked me if I saw any one drive the cart from the door—(French was not with the cart when it came back; I did not see any more of him)—I said, "Very likely the man that was with it"—he said, "There was nobody with me"—I did not notice the state of the coats in the passage at that time—Janes finished taking the dust, and went away in about ten minutes afterwards, and in about three minutes afterwards my master went in the passage—he called me—I went up and missed a black frock coat, the same that I had picked up—my master went out after the cart.</p>

We usually kept the key of the Old Bell—Croft came and got it on Friday night, 12th Dec., and brought it back on the Saturday night—in the course of the evening Johnson came to my door, and asked me for a light; I gave him one; he asked if my husband was at home—he was in the back yard, not in the cottage—it was between 6 and 7 o'clock—I heard the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> come back about half past 8 o'clock I think, but did not look out—after Johnson asked for a light, I did not see him again; I saw him next day and every day for a week following—Mr. Watts also came for a light on that night; there was some one with him, who I could not see—Watts went with the other person, and took the things from the empty cottage opposite, and I saw a person carrying a sack across into the Old Bell—next morning, about 10 o'clock, Watts and Hyde came down; Watts had a yellow handkerchief under his arm, and I saw the impression of a boot in it—they had to go a little below our door, and were 6 or 7 yards from me—they came again between 12 and 1 o'clock the same day, but they did not have anything—neither of them came to our cottage that day—on the Friday night I saw Watts give my husband a bundle—on the next Saturday I saw some persons in the yard, who I afterwards ascertained were police, and from that time I never saw Johnson in the yard till a week or two ago.</p>

On Monday evening, 13th April, I was on duty in Arthur Street West, and a lad was taken into custody for picking a pocket—the prisoner stopped me and said, "I wish to give myself into your custody"—I said, "What for?"—he said, "For setting fire to a hay rick about four miles from Kingston"—I asked him when—he said, "On Friday, between 10 and 11 o'clock"—I asked him what he did with himself after that—he said that he concealed himself from Friday to Sunday night in an outhouse—and came to town on the following day—I asked him why he gave himself into custody—he said, "I know the parties are after me, I saw them on London Bridge this afternoon"—he said that he had been to a beer shop and went into a farm yard, and there were two dogs, and one of them flew out and bit his hand; I examined his hand, and found that it had recently been bitten—he said that a party belonging to the house came down stairs on the Friday night, who asked him if he could give him a lodging, and who said, "Yes, a policeman will be here presently, and I will give you a lodging"—that he then went round to the rick to look for his bundle, struck a light to light his pipe and found the rick on fire—I asked him if he gave any alarm—he said, "No"—I asked him how he knew the rick was burnt down—he said that he stood and looked at it for an hour.</p>

On Tuesday, 30th Dec., I was on duty at the station house in Kennington Lane, when Mrs. Bacon came there accompanied by Mrs. Payne, about half past 1 o'clock in the afternoon—Mrs. Payne said she wished me to come to Four Acre Street, she considered something had taken place very serious there—Mrs. Bacon did not say anything then—I went with them—on the way Mrs. Bacon said that a person had come in at the window and cut the children's throats, and her own as well—she did not say when that had been done—when we got to the house, Mrs. Bacon unlocked the door with a key—I went into the back room—the shutters of the front room were closed—we all three went into the back room pretty well together—I there found a little boy in a chair, with his head on his little table before him; his throat was cut, and he was quite dead—there was a good deal of blood about; some on the wall and on the floor—I then inquired of Mrs. Payne where the other child was—she said, "Upstairs, in the back room"—Mrs. Bacon was present—I found an infant lying on the floor, in the back room up stairs, with its throat cut, and quite dead—there was a child's bed in that room, there was no blood on the bed—it appeared as if the bed had been slept in—the child had it's night dress on, and the little boy also—they both had a portion of clothing on—they had night shirts on-—on seeing this I said, "This is a bad job"—Mrs. Bacon said, "I did not do it, a man came in at the back window and <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it"—she did not say at what time it had been done—she meant the window of the back parlour, on the ground floor, where the little! boy was—I noticed that window at the time, it was fastened, but not properly, the hasp was a little askew, not straight, as it ought to be; it was enough to hold the sash—no one could open it from the outside or raise it—the glass was quite sound—there is only one window to that room—there is a little yard or garden outside, inclosed by a railing, not a wall—it is a row of houses and a little garden behind each—I did not then make any examina<lb/>tion outside the window—I went into the front room, first floor, and saw a female's night dress lying on the bed there, it was very bloody, there was blood pretty well all over it; all the front part chiefly—I did not notice the sleeves then, I afterwards saw that there was a quantity of blood on the sleeves—there was also blood all round the neck, just in the front part—I found a pool of blood on the floor, as if it had been dropping down, several spots into one—the back parlour is the room where they used to live—there was a lot of lumber in the front room—there are also two little rooms be<lb/>sides, a kind of wash house and a room over it—I went all over the house, there is no room over the first floor—while I was making a search in the front room first floor, Mrs. Bacon passed behind me, and went to a little box on the drawers, and took out this envelope, and said she must send it to her husband—it is addressed, "Mr. Bacon, Mr. Marriage, Ironmonger, Market Place, Reigate," and has a postage stamp on it; it contains a blank sheet of paper—she said the address was her husband's writing—I then went back to the station, and took Mrs. Bacon with me—I did not take her into custody altogether; I said, "We will go back to the station now"—she "went with me of her own accord—Mrs. Payne also went with me—Mrs. Bacon was detained when we got to the station—the acting inspector told her that we should detain her as regarded the murder of the children—she made no answer to that—she was taken before the Magistrate that same afternoon and remanded—before that, I went to the house again with Mr. Bushell, the surgeon, and a brother officer—Mr. Bushell saw the children—on that occasion I found three knives on the table in the back room, down</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185705110137"/>
               <p>stairs; not the table where the child was sitting, but another table—I have here two knives out of the three—I left the other behind, as it was quite clean—they are common table knives—I observed something similar to blood upon them, on one of them more especially; one did not appear to be stained with Mood as the other one was—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—one of them presents the appearance of having been recently sharpened—this is the one that I thought was the bloody knife that was used—Mr. Bushell saw it—I examined the sill of the back room window next morning, Wednesday, about 1 or 2 o'clock—there was dust on the sill—there was not the slightest appearance of that dust having been disturbed—there were no footmarks, nor the slightest appearance of the ground next to the window having been disturbed at all—it is gravel immediately under the window, just as back door places generally are, it is rather in a rough state—it would show the impression of feet—it was not exactly gravel, it was earth, sufficiently soft to show the impression of feet—I did not look at the hasp then, I had noticed that the day before—on Tuesday, 6th Jan., I received from the turn<lb/>key at Horsemonger Lane Gaol, where Mrs. Bacon was confined, this che<lb/>mise, there is a great quantity of blood on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical practitioner, and live in Lower Ken<lb/>nington Lane. I was sent for to the police station there on 30th Dec., about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, or a little after—I found Mrs. Bacon there—I asked her how she did—her reply was, "Very poorly;" at the same time, without any more remark, she followed it up by saying, "A man got in at the window, and out my throat, and my children's also"—I asked her to let me look at her throat—I did so, and examined it—I found several outs or marks on the throat, one from the lower part of the throat, extend<lb/>ing from the left to the right, two or three inches long, avoiding the wind<lb/>pipe—the wound continued across the windpipe, but not wounding it; there was another cut from that downwards, about two inches long; there were several outs appearing to be backwards and forwards, all above the first cut that I have named—the whole of these cuts I could not find to be continued from right to left, or from left to right; they seemed to be out both from the right and from the left—they were what I may term scratches, or abrasions of the skin—the principal cut was the one passing over the windpipe; the depth of that was perhaps rather more than the eighth of an inch in the deepest part; it was deeper over the windpipe, but not much; it was altogether a slight cut; blood had come from the whole, even the scratches—it was not bleeding when I saw it—all the wounds I saw might have been done by herself; if they were inflicted by another, she must have remained quite quiet during the time, quite passive and consenting, with the head extended back—while looking at the wounds I remarked to her, "This has been done some time"—she replied, "Yes, 8 o'clock last night"—I examined her hands; the left hand was covered with a brown colour, as if from the stains of blood only partially washed from it; there was a still deeper stain round the nails—the fore and second fingers of the right hand were also partially stained in the same way, with blood partially washed from them—I did not call her attention to it in any way—after this interview I went to the house in Four Acre Street; I there saw the bodies of the two children—I found the throats of both the boy and the infant out fatally—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a knife</hi>) the wounds I saw would have been very likely to be caused "by such an instrument as this, most likely—I saw the knife on the table on my searching the room, and I saw immediately that it had been wiped, and I directed the officers to take possession of it,</p>

               <p>and to be careful of it—I have since examined what is on it by the microscope, and have ascertained it to be blood; I have every reason to believe it to be human blood—that is as far as I can go; there is a difference between the globules of blood of some animals and human blood, but it is difficult to distinguish human blood from the blood of some animals even by micro<lb/>scopic power—the knife had every appearance as if it had been recently rubbed on a steel—my attention was drawn by the officers to the window of the back room; it was fastened; it could not have been lifted up in the manner in which it was then fastened—it was fastened so that no one could have come in—I do not think it could have been so fastened by any person that went out;—I was shown a woman's night dress, it was on the bed in the front room—there were marks of blood on it; it had quite a different appearance from the blood from the neck; it might have come from any other source than the neck; there was blood on it that I think did come from the neck; that was at the upper portion—the blood on the lower part of the dress was distinguishable from that; it was blood that had either flowed more rapidly or had been rubbed from some clot of blood of a differ<lb/>ent character from the blood from the throat—there was also some blood on the sleeve—I was afterwards shown a shift; there were marks of blood on that, near the hem—a pair of moleskin or fustian trowsers has been shown to me by inspector Young—there are appearances of blood upon them, on the front—I saw a waistcoat on the bed; it has since been shown me by Young; there was a spot of blood on the collar—I first observed the waistcoat on the bed where the night jacket was, the first day I went, but I did not examine it till afterwards; when I found the spot of blood I recognized the waistcoat directly—these are the trowsers—there are several marks on them of the appearance of blood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Sergeant, and live in Four Acre Street, next door to the prisoners—I heard of the murder on the Tuesday morning, I think about 12 o'clock; the last time before that on which I had seen Mr. or Mrs. Bacon was on the Sunday—I saw them go out together on the Sunday afternoon—I did not see either of them after that, until this discovery was made—I noticed their house on the Monday—I did not notice the shutters or blinds—I was sweeping in front of my door about 11 o'clock that morning, and in sweeping I accidentally struck against the sill of Bacon's door, so as to make a noise—I thought I heard some one moving in their house on that, in the passage on the ground floor—it appeared as if some person was coming to the door; the door was not opened; I heard the footsteps return down the passage again—that was the only noise or movement that I noticed in the house on that Monday—the children were accustomed to cry frequently—I could hear them in my house—one of them was a fretful child, and was frequently crying—I cannot say which it was—I did not hear any crying at all during the whole of that Monday.</p>

               <p>that paper—I did not mention it to Bacon; it was his brother's request that I should not name it to him at that time—the watch was advertised and circulated in our division, but not in print—it was described by num<lb/>ber—the number had been obtained from Edward Bacon—it was No. 31, 798, a silver Geneva watch—I have since seen a watch bearing that numbers—Sergeant Broad brought it to me—I did not see Bacon with any watch in his possession when he came back from Reigate—the first time I saw a watch in his possession was on Wednesday, 7th Jan.—he told me that he had been down to Stamford on the Saturday preceding and returned on the Sunday—I asked him where his watch was, and he showed me this one (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>), it was not then in the state it is now—it was complete except the minute hand—I looked at it and saw the number—it is No. 13, 663—a few days after the 7th Jan. I was at the prisoner's house making a search of the whole of the premises—Bacon came there while I was there—I was in the back kitchen—there is a cellar opening from the pas<lb/>sage; I told him I should look then and I sent for a candle for the purpose—I did not see Bacon go into that cellar—my attention was called by hearing a noise in the yard, and Broad calling out—I went out and saw Bacon there—Broad had him on one side, and he told me that he had put something into his pocket—I put my hand into his pocket and found this watch in the state it is now, with the glass broken—it is the watch I have last spoken to, No. 13, 663—Bacon first told me that he had received a check for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Atter, of Stamford—he always described it afterwards as a check for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he had cashed it at the London and Westminster Bank, and received four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and 10 sovereigns—he said that he had deposited one of those notes for safety in a box for his own purposes, to purchase furniture with, and that he had paid the other three notes away—he assured me that the fourth note was in the box when he went to Reigate—I made inquiries to trace those notes, and have the witnesses here—I afterwards told Bacon that I had made inquiries with regard to the notes, and I told him that I had found a fourth note in circulation which had come from him, and asked him for an explanation—he then said that he had received another 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, that he had given a person change for it in the street—I have traced that 5<hi rend="italic">.</hi> note, it is the fourth received for the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—he gave me a description of the clothes, which I took down in writing—he has since given me another description of them—on 7th Jan. he described the great coat as rough great coat, with two pockets behind, and the other as a black cloth shooting coat, with pockets at the side—he said the great coat had been made by Mr. Dixon, of Stamford, that he had made all his clothes for the last twenty years—I afterwards received a letter from Mr. Dixon respecting the clothes, and I told Bacon that I had heard from Mr. Dixon, and that he had never made him such a coat—he said "The coat is not so rough as the one you hare got on"—he then said it was rougher, and afterwards he said that the reason he called it a rough coat was because it was an old coat—I observed the cut on his finger on Satur<lb/>day, 3rd Jan., when he first came to the station—it was then closing, and gradually healing—it was on the first joint of the first finger of the left hand—it was a strait cut, about half an inch long and about one eighth of an inch in depth—he told me, without my asking bin, that he had done it whittling a stick—on Wednesday, 7th Jan., he told me that he had done it while carving at dinner on the Sunday—he was very much agitated at the time—I asked him if he had seen his wife before leaving home on the Mon<lb/>day morning—he said he had left her in bed, that she was vary comfortable,</p>

               <p>that he had kissed her, and that she had bound up his finger to prevent his catching cold in it—I was at the police court on the 21st of Jan., when he was taken into custody—he was taken to the station to be given in charge after the letter had been read in the court—on the way there he said, "Oh! Mr. Young, is it not shocking that she should say I did it? I do not fear; the Lord will help me through it; my poor boy, I could not hurt a hair of his little head; the truth will always go the farthest."</p>

               <p>or improbability of a man coming in and committing this offence without stealing anything—he afterwards told me that some things had been taken from the house; I should think that must have been a week after the Wednesday I have been speaking of—he said he had lost some money, he did not tell me how much, and a great coat, and a suit of clothes—I asked him whether Dixon made the coat; he said, "No"—I asked him how he came by it; he said he took it for a debt—I said, "Who did you take it of;" he hesitated, and could not answer me, and I told him I believed what he told me was false—he said he had lost a watch; I told him I did not be<lb/>lieve it—I knew of his having a watch; he had it when he came back from Reigate; this is it—this is the watch that his brother made, and the one I have been accustomed to see him with; it is No. 32, 798—this is the watch I saw him with when he came back from Reigate; he had no other watch then—I remember his going to Stamford; I believe it was on the Saturday after he returned from Reigate; he had this watch when he came back on the Sunday (No. 13, 663)—on the Sunday after Christmas Day, when Mrs. Bacon was at my house, she sat alongside of me on the sofa—I asked her how she could leave those two children like that in a house, and nobody there—she sat a little while, and I said to her, "Martha, if my mistress had left my children like that when I was young, I should never have forgiven her as long as I lived"—she said, "Uncle, don't you fret about the chil<lb/>dren; they are happy enough"—I thought Mr. Bacon looked very much confused that evening—Mrs. Bacon and I were talking about family matters, and she said, "Hold your tongue; here is Thomas coming"—he did not seem as if he wanted to see me, nor yet his aunt; he seemed very much agitated, I thought—the last time I saw him, the night before he was taken into custody, I said to him, "Thomas, I have laughed and joked with you a good many times; I am now going to talk to you seriously; how will you fare if your wife turns round upon you to-morrow, and says you have done it?"—he said, "My wife never did deceive me yet"—I told him that was more than he could tell—he said, "Did my aunt ever deceive you?"—I said, "Yes, many a time"—he called her in, and asked her whe<lb/>ther "she ever did deceive me—she said that was her business—he then bade me good night—I told him I might bid him good bye, for I did not expect to see him any more, without it was when he was locked up—I was not at the police court next day—I had no reason to believe that his wife was going to make a statement against him when I said that to him; I did not know whether she would or would not—I had not had any communica<lb/>tion with her on the subject.</p>

I went to Bacon's house, in No. 4, Acre Street—I took some washing there—I noticed some blood on a shirt that I had to wash—it was on the right side, above the gusset and on the wrist—I asked Mr. Bacon what it was, and he said it was produced from the bleeding piles—I said, "No such thing; I have nursed persons with that disorder, and I am sure it was not that"—it was different—it was a smear—it did not look like the marks of fingers—I was at the house from the Tuesday to the Friday night—he was there at that time—he appeared to be in a very frightened state, very timid—I asked him what made him so frightened, and so timid, and nervous; but he never gave me any answer—he spoke of the death of his children a great many times—he said he was very sorry for the death of his children.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of John Hopkins and others—we are drapers and silk mercers in Shoreditch—the prisoner has been in our employ seven or eight years as shop walker—he was a person in whom con<lb/>siderable confidence and trust was reposed—he was the most confidential person we employed—in consequence of some information that was conveyed to me, I asked him whether he had any objection to my going to his house at Norwood—his wife keeps a shop there—he was in the habit of purchasing goods in our establishment from time to time—on his purchasing them it would be the duty of the clerk to enter them in our books—he had no authority to take any goods without their being reported by him to me or our clerk, and their being entered—there is one clerk in particular, Mr. Harber, to whom always it was his duty to state the goods he was about to purchase, and it was Mr. Harber's duty to enter them in the book that the prisoner had—without that the prisoner had no right to take them away—I accompanied the prisoner to his shop at Norwood—it is respectable, but comparatively a small one—I went with our clerk, Mr. Harber, and he took his book with him, which contained the prisoner's account—on entering the shop, I gave the prisoner's wife to understand that I had some painful busi<lb/>ness to state respecting her husband—that I had to bring a very grave charge against him, and I should be very glad if I could be satisfied as to the nature of the charge—I came down to the shop, and I took down from a line seven shawls—I folded them up, and I said to Mr. Harber, "Just turn to the account, and see if these are entered"—he did so, and he stated,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185705110154"/>
               <p>"They are not entered"—I said, "Be particular; loot again"—he looked again, and handed the book to me, and said, "Do you look, Sir"—I did so, and they were not entered—the remark was then made to the prisoner, "How can you account for these?"—he said, "I suppose they were entered as dresses"—T said, "See if you can find anything to correspond with these"—he did, but he could not—we made a further search, and found these gloves, which I immediately recognised as our property—we examined the account, and these gloves had not been entered to the prisoner—I saw the gloves found under the window board in the window—I said to the prisoner, "Can you explain this?"—he could give me no account—he did not say anything—there were other articles found—some silk handkerchiefs, some muslin trimmings, and a quantity of ribbons—the prisoner was not present when the ribbons were found; they were found on a second visit—on the first examination I offered the book to the prisoner, and said, "Will you search for yourself)"—that was with reference to the handkerchiefs and shawls—I think he looked in the book—he did not show me any entry at all—it was on 22nd April I went to Norwood—the goods are here—I have looked at them, and can swear to them—here ore our special tickets on them—if we had sold these things, these tickets would be removed—here is the private mark in my own handwriting—I have never sold these goods to the prisoner—on these gloves here is our private mark—here is a peculiarity about the tops of these gloves which has only been introduced in the market since Feb., and we have not entered any gloves to the prisoner since Nov.—these gloves came into our stock in Feb.—these silk handkerchiefs have our mark on them—I never sold any of these goods to the prisoner.</p>

On Saturday, 25th April, the prisoner came to my shop and bought some meat—it came to five pence or seven pence, and he tendered me a counterfeit florin—I broke it in two pieces—I gave him one piece, and the other fell on the floor—my shopman, Curtis, said to me, "Examine that crown piece that you took just now"—I looked in the till and found a counterfeit crown—I followed the prisoner and overtook him, and brought him back to the shop—I said to him, "Where is your <hi rend="italic">pal</hi> that passed the bad crown piece just now"—he said, "I have no <hi rend="italic">pal</hi>"—I said, "Where is that bad florin"—I took his hand, and took from it the piece of the bad florin which I had given him—I gave him into custody—I returned from the station and examined the shop, and found the other part of the florin on the floor—I had received the crown piece five or six minutes before I received the florin—it was paid in purchase for some pieces of meat which came to five pence or seven pence—I gave change for it, and put the crown in a bowl in the till—I gave the pieces of the florin and the crown to the officer.</p>

On 3rd April I was coming along St. George's Read, about 2 o'clock in the morning—a woman accosted me—I could not get rid of her—she was very violent—I had been dining out, and was not perhaps <hi rend="italic">compos mentis</hi> as I am at present, but I wanted to get rid of her—two men came up, and said, "What are you doing with that woman?"—I then thought I had been robbed, and I went to seize the woman, and was tripped up, and fell down, and cut my face and hands—when I got up, the prisoner was within arm's length of me—I seized him, and kept him till a policeman came—I had missed my pone before I seized the prisoner—I said to him, "You are one of the parties who have attacked and been robbing me"—he said, "No, I am not"—I could not identify him, and I let him go—I was going with the constable to give information of the robbery, and we went back and took the prisoner—he is the same person that I caught hold of the first time—he said, "I saw yon in the Wagon and Horses, treating a lot of girls and that is where you lost your purse"—I was never in the Wagon and Horses in my life—I had not been in any other public house in the neighbourhood that night—my purse has not been found.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 6 1/2, Lyon Street. On the morning in question I was in St. George's Road—I got to the corner, and saw the prosecutor having hold of a young girl by the arm or wrist—I heard him exclaim, "Police! I have been robbed!"—two men were standing at the corner, about four yards from him—the prisoner was one of them—I heard one of them exclaim, "Let the girl go;" and one of them went and parted the prosecutor from her, and the girl ran down St. George's Road, and the prosecutor after her—the other man ran behind the prosecutor, and tripped him up—the prisoner was close behind the man who tripped the prosecutor up—I am sure the prisoner is one of the men who were there, but I did not see him do anything—he was standing there.</p>

I have done nothing"—Mr. Evans said that he had been robbed—I asked him if he knew who robbed him—a policeman came up, and the prosecutor said, "This is a very nice thing, is it not, for a gentleman to walk along, and to be knocked down and robbed) I will go to the station, and let them know"—the policeman said, "I will go with you"—the prisoner said he had done nothing, and I heard him say at the station that he had been in the Wagon and Horses, and that the prosecutor was in there—he denied it.</p>
