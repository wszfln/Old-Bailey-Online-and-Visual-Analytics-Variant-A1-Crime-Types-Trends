                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Edwards, a mechanic's labourer, of 3, Shoemaker-row, Blackfriars—I know the prisoner—his wife keeps a school in Church-entry, Broadway, Blackfriars, and he resides there with his wife—the children were accustomed to play in the square or passage before the school, the gates being left open—on 25th August, about 1 o'clock, I was in my room, from which I had a view of the schoolroom—I did not see the prisoner at that time—I saw some water come out of a second-floor window; I could not see who threw it; it came on the children, and wetted one of mine who was playing there—upon that I came down into the court—I then saw the prisoner speaking to Mrs. Evans—he was on the threshold of the gates, and he was taking a life-preserver out of his breast-pocket—I saw him take it into his right hand and twist the cord round his wrist, and he deliberately struck Mrs. Evans on the head with it, and knocked her down with the blow—I said to him, "Oh, you wretch!"—he then struck me in the mouth with the life-preserver in his hand; it made my mouth bleed, and knocked out two of my teeth—I flew at him and made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at him in my own defence, and I then received several other blows on my hands and my face—I had a frightful face, and he struck me at the corner of the head, which stunned me—I did not see the blade part of the preserver—I had one blow on my chest and one on my arm—I did not feel anything when I was struck in the chest, because I was in a stunned state—I did not see any policemen there, they came up afterwards; I was taken up by one or two females; the witness Loom was one—I was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185910240002"/>
               <p>taken into Mr. Langford's shop; from there I was taken to the hospital, and going along, some one saw this instrument sticking in me—I thought my ribs were broken—I saw it taken out, and it was the blade part of the preserver.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How far do you live from the school house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps about thirty yards—my children have, like the rest of the children, been in the habit of playing in this place—the prisoner never complained to me of the annoyance which they caused him; he only threw water on them and struck them; he never complained to me—there has been a piece of work several times through his throwing water upon them; I have interfered two or three times—I never heard him complain of the annoyance, unless it was when he summoned me up to the Court twelve months ago—I never heard that he complained of acts of indecency against the door—I was taken before the Magistrate on a charge of assaulting him, and bound over to keep the peace—I certainly did say several things to him that perhaps I ought not—Mrs. Evans had nothing to do with that piece of work—I have heard her speak of his brutality to the children—within the last three or four months there have been continued rows outside the door, and mobs of people collected—I do not know that Mrs. Evans was bound over to keep the peace towards the prisoner—the children go into school about 2 o'clock—this occurred about 20 minutes to 2—I could not see the schoolhouse-door from my window—I saw four little children and two big ones, and one had got a baby in her arms—I did not see a number of grown-up persons; there was no crowd till afterwards—I did not call out upon the prisoner throwing water out of the window; I had not the opportunity before he struck me—there was not a crowd round the door abusing and pulling the prisoner about before I was struck; there might be two or three persons, but no one was speaking to him but Mrs. Evans—there were not ten or twenty persons there, I can swear that—there was no mob abusing him and pulling him about until after he had struck me and Mrs. Evans; there was a mob then, and they did not treat him very gently after they found what he had been guilty of—I did not address the mob; I spoke to him when he struck me—I did not abuse him and make use of very foul language to him; I believe the mob did, and I believe they tore the clothes pretty nearly off his back; I was told so; I did not see it—I did not hear him calling out for the police—I was never before a Magistrate upon any other charge of assault than the one I have mentioned—my father-in-law is a witness here to-day; he was one that was wounded—I never heard my father-in-law tell the prisoner that if he appeared against me upon the summons, he would take care and do for him—I believe my husband went to him to try and make it up, but I was not present.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fishmonger, and live at 3, Shoemaker-row. On 25th August, about half-past 1 in the afternoon, I was standing at the corner of Church-entry, and saw three or four children come round covered with water—Mrs. Evans came to see about it—I went down to the school-room, looked round the corner, and saw the prisoner there; he was just inside the gate—there was a mob, a few persons—as I was going down, I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185910240003"/>
               <p>saw one woman struck, I do not know which it was, and she fell down—when I got there I saw Mrs. Edwards struck by the prisoner; that was not with the life-preserver—then the old man, Mr. Edwards, came to see about it; and the first time of my seeing the life-preserver was when he used it on the old man—he made a hit at him; I thought it would be on his head, but it hit his ear and rebounded on his shoulder—then there was a lot fell down together—with the assistance of a policeman, Mrs. Edwards was got into my shop, and I drew the dagger from her side—it was in her gown; I can't say whether it was in her flesh; I pulled it out; she looked very ill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> At the time the water was thrown out, did you hear any women calling out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; Mrs. Evans came up a very few minutes afterwards—I did not see Mrs. Edwards come up; she was there when I came down—when I first went down there were only a few persons there, I should not think twenty; they were collecting—the crowd had not increased considerably before I saw any blow struck—I should not think there were more than twenty persons there when Mrs. Edwards was struck—when she fell down there were lots of people trying to take the in<lb/>strument from him—I heard no calling out before that—when the police came up they were all in a muddle—the prisoner was not beaten and ill-used by the mob, that I saw—he would not let go of the life-preserver—he seemed rather bare afterwards—at the time I saw Mr. Edwards struck, the prisoner was three or four steps up; the people were not crowding up the steps to where he was; Edwards was asking the reason of his daughter-in-law being ill-used, and he said, "If you come up," or something like that; I heard no more, but he made a blow with the life-preserver—I did not observe the old man make a blow at the prisoner—I was standing just by the iron railing facing the prisoner's gates—there were a number of people, I did not take notice of the number, say thirty, all intermixed together.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Loom, a cab-driver, and live at 5, Fleur-de-lis-court—on the afternoon of 25th August, about twenty minutes to 2, I was there—I could see the prisoner from my window—I saw him throw water over some children—upon that I came down stairs into Church-entry, and I saw the prisoner strike Mrs. Evans—they had then got to the school gate—I saw him take this life-preserver out of his left-hand pocket—he twisted the string round his wrist, and I saw him strike Mrs. Edwards—I could not say whether he struck her with his fist or with the life-preserver—I saw her mouth bleed—her father-in-law, Mr. Edwards, then came, and the prisoner struck him on the ear with the life-preserver—I then saw the blade of the life-preserver—he then struck Mrs. Edwards again, and then Mr. and Mrs. Edwards and the prisoner fell—he struck Mrs. Edwards the second time with the life-preserver—the blade was then out—I did not see the blade till Mr. Langford pulled it out of Mrs. Edwards—there were a great many people there when he first struck Mrs. Edwards; I dare say twenty—after that the crowd came and they tried to take the life-preserver away, and then the policeman came.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I was house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital on 26th August—on that day Mrs. Edwards was brought there—I examined her—she had several bruises about the face, one on the forehead, one on the cheek, one on her mouth, and a bruise on the back of one of her hands—I also found a punctured wound on the left side of the chest, just below the region of the heart—it was about three quarters of an inch in depth—it did not penetrate the chest; it ran in a slanting direction back<lb/>wards and downwards—such a blade as the one produced would produce such a wound—it was in a dangerous part—it is quite well now—it healed in about a week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>I have observed children there creating a constant noise and annoyance—they were doing nothing beyond making a noise and obstructing the passage, and after the house was painted they scratched off the paint—I have not been present on occasions previous to the 25th August, when there were rows and mobs collected—on 25th, I was at home standing in front of my house—I heard the school bell rung violently—I saw some children inside the railings and up the steps inside the inclosure—they were playing; and there was a fish boy pulling up tufts of grass—I saw some water thrown over the children—they were then going away—the fish boy still continued pulling up the tufts of grass, and he threw them up at the window—I then saw Mrs. Evans come down Church-entry with a towel on her arm wiping her hands; she rang the school bell twice and the prisoner came down to answer it—she began shaking her fist at him—in the mean-time Mrs. Edwards came down to him and began threatening him likewise with her fist—I did not hear any words, not being near enough—he was standing, facing them, in his own gates, inside the school-house—there are steps which lead up to the school-house—other, persons came up—when they made their threats at him with their fists, he took his left hand and pushed Mrs. Evans away—Mrs. Edwards then flew at him in the face, and he took up his right hand and hit her in the face and she fell back; she returned to him again and I saw her nose was bleeding—she did not touch him when she flew at him—his blows prevented her—he took and <hi rend="italic">blowed</hi> her off; if he had not defended himself she must have hit him—there were about two or three persons there at the time he struck her—I had seen nothing of the life-preserver at this time—shortly afterwards Mr. Edwards came up, and then there were two or three blows struck between him and the prisoner—Mr. Edwards struck first; it was a regular fight—a mob immediately collected, and several of them called out, "Drag him out, drag him out"—he was then in his own place on the footway where the steps are—the children I saw playing were in the court-yard between the Church-entry and the school-house up the steps—when the mob called, "Drag him out," the prisoner fell back, put his hand in his left breast pocket and drew out this life-preserver—he was then about two steps in the school-house—the mob were all quiet the moment he took the life-preserver in his hand—he then placed it back in his pocket again, and then they all wanted to rush on him again—they tried to come on him and he pulled it out again—they rushed on him, and he took the life-preserver in his hand and hit Mr. Edwards, who was in the middle, on the head—they were all three upon him then; Mrs. Evans, Mrs. Edwards, and Mr. Edwards—as soon as the blow was struck, from the weight of the mob rushing on him, he fell and they came on the top of him—he dropped his hands to save himself, and Mr. and Mrs. Edwards got hold of the life-preserver and held it, and kept hitting the prisoner, and he was hitting them back again; this continued about a quarter of an hour before the police came up—I did not hear the prisoner calling out—I was at my window on the other side of the Churchyard—when the policeman came up he tried to get the life preserver from them, and said, "Oh, he will give it up to me"—the prisoner said, "I will"—he tried to get it out of their hands but was not able—they fell on him and hit him, and tore his coat off his back and threw it up against the house—he was completely saturated with blood—that was after the police had come up—the row still went on after that.</p>

I am a bookbinder and live at 8, Broadway, close to Church-entry—on 25th August I was at home having my dinner; in consequence of hearing a noise I went out and saw the prisoner down Church-entry—there were fifty or sixty people there at the time; they were very noisy and fighting with the prisoner—I did not see him strike any one—I saw them strike him and knock him about—when I first saw him he was by the gate—I did not see him fall back—the next time I saw him was in the entry; they got him up into Shoemaker-row out of the entry—I saw the policeman come up in about 10 minutes; during that time there was a continuance of what I have described on the part of the mob; they all got on him; he could not do anything, some were holding him, and others punch<lb/>ing at him.</p>

I am a bootmaker at 1, Cobb's-court, Blackfriars—I could see from my house the place where this occurred—Cobb's-court is a continuation of Church-entry—on 25th August I was sitting at my dinner; there was a dreadful noise below—I went down and saw the prisoner in a fearful state, and before him was Mrs. Evans, old Edwards, another person, a painter, and the fishmonger, Langford—there had evidently been a great deal of fighting before I got there, because the prisoner was cut in the face and his shirt torn off—Mrs. Evans's daughter said to him, "If you hit my mother I'll hit you;" that was a watchword for another attack—there were a great many people there—the excitement was very great—I only wish to confine myself to the parties that struck him—old Edwards, the painter, and the fishmonger laid into him unmerci<lb/>fully; they knocked him into the shop of Mr. Trimm the butterman, who is one of Langford's party—Trimm was standing in the middle of the road at the time, and he came and shoved the prisoner out of the shop, and then the attack was renewed, Langford in a most cowardly manner beating him behind, and swearing he would have his b—liver out before he had done with him—the prisoner was no friend of mine; but I shouted out, "Take him off, I don't care what he has done," and that is how it was stopped—the policeman stood at my left but he did not interfere, he looked very pale—my cry stopped it by magic—I had never spoken to the prisoner previous to this, but he was a well-ordered, well-conducted man, I never saw aught against him—he went away very quietly with the policeman—he bears a respectable character in the neighbourhood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the city of London constables—on Monday, 19th September last, I went with Mr. Rock to Noble's shop, and saw him there—Mr. Rock first spoke to him—he asked if his name was Noble, at the door; he said it was—Mr. Rock said he wished to speak to him, and we went inside; and he then gave the prisoner his card, and told him that we were two police-officers (that is, myself and Legg); that he understood he had some of his property there—he said that he had a small quantity that he had bought from a woman—I asked him if he knew who the woman was—he said he did not know her name, but she was there on the Saturday night, and he gave the address, 16, Grove-street—I think both I and Mr. Rock asked him then if he would show us what goods he had of Mr. Rock's—he looked round, and put about two dozen books on the counter, and said he believed they were all he had—Mr. Rock then said, "There are a quantity in a glass case outside; they appear to be my property"—the prisoner said, "Oh, yes, there are some in a glass case outside; they are nearly all your property"—they were brought in, and found to be Mr. Rock's property, nearly the whole—I asked him again if he had not asked the woman her name; he said he did not—he said he did not know whether he could find her, but that was the address she had given—I said, "Well, I will give you a fair chance to find her; you get into a cab and go with Legg, my brother officer, and see if you can find the woman"—previous to his going I had asked him if he had any bills or invoice of the goods; he said he had not—I asked him if he had any entry of this in his books; he said he had not, and that he had bought them a few at a time on different occasions during the last twelve months—he then went away with Legg—I told him that in the meantime Mr. Rock and I should look over his stock to see if there was any further property belonging to Mr. Rock—Mr. Rock and I found a small portion more in the front shop—we then went into the back shop, or rather a room at the back of the shop—I have the property here that we found (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there are some packets not opened—nearly the whole of this property was found on shelves in the back shop, with tiers of books in front of them—nearly the whole of the property, with the ex<lb/>ception of the memorandum books were piled up behind, with a tier of books in front of them—when Noble came back with my brother officer I asked if they had found the woman—I found they had not—I then said to Noble, "You see the quantity of property we have found here belonging to Mr. Rock; I don't consider your account of them to be satisfactory, and it will be our duty to take you into custody for receiving them, knowing them to be stolen"—he made no reply to that—I said, "I shall take you to Bow-lane police station, and take the property with you"—the property was then put in the cab, and Legg and the prisoner went away to Bow-lane police station; but after he had got in the cab I said to him, "I am going to your father's shop, shall I find any of Mr. Rock's property there?"—he said, "Yes; you will find a quantity there which I have given my father to sell for me"—I then went to the father's with Mr. Rock, and received this parcel from the father; it was open about the shop—I packed it up together—there was a large quantity of note paper that had never been opened; about seventy parcels, I think, in their wrappers—I think they had no name on the outside, but there are some marks upon them by which Mr. Rock knows them.</p>

Noble, bookseller and stationer, Commercial-road"—I had not seen that before—that was in one of the packets that has not been opened since we have had it—Mr. Rock can tell you better than I whether it may have been opened or not; the prisoner told me he had received these in small parcels—he did not say the woman represented herself to be the wife of a manufacturing stationer; I am quite sure of that—I did not search for any stock-book on the premises, or any account book at all; nor did any of the other policemen—I cannot tell whether he had any book in which entries of stock were made—I did not think I had a right to look into other persons' private books—I thought I had only a right to meddle with that which Mr. Bock said was his property—I brought away, I think, two reams of ruled paper—Mr. Rock said he was not positive about that being his, but he believed it to be his; that it was the same make, and he thought it was their ruling—I also brought away some bill-paper—I don't know whether this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was claimed by Mr. Rock—if it came out of the basket, it was brought away with the others—but I don't recollect seeing this before—there is a door leading from the front shop to the back room—you can see into it from the street—it is a continuation of the shop—I don't know that I saw any of these books exposed on the shelves—I think some of the note paper Mr. Rock gave me from one of the front tiers—I can't say that the books that were at the back were continued on from where the paper was—my impression is that they were behind—there was a large quantity of books in the back shop—I have often seen books put one behind the other—all the books were in glass cases, both in the front and back shops—they were on shelves with glass slides before them to keep the dust from them—I did not go to look for the woman, Legg did; I went with the prisoner's brother to the father's—I took him to see two women a day or two afterwards, that we had some suspicion of, and he said neither of those was the woman that came to the brother's shop.</p>

I am a wholesale stationer at 11, Walbrook, in partner<lb/>ship as Rock Brothers &amp; Payne—I communicated with the police, and afterwards went with Legg and Knight to Noble's shop in the Commercial-road—he appeared to sell second-hand books—it was certainly not an ordinary stationer's shop—I saw him, gave him my card, and said that I wished to speak to him—I then informed him that I had understood he was in possession of some goods of ours, that had been stolen; he said he so understood—the officers I think asked him if he had any objection to allow</p>

               <p>us to examine—that was after he had produced a small proportion of the goods—I saw a glass case outside the door, and in that was a considerable quantity of goods of our manufacture—I asked how he came into possession of these goods; he said he bought them of a woman, but he did not know her name—I asked over what period of time the purchase had extended—I think he said twelve months—I asked if he knew the name of the person—he said he did not, but he gave an address which I forget; shortly after he left in company with the officer, and I proceeded to make a further examination—I found a considerable quantity of goods; nearly the whole was found after they had left, in a back room adjoining the shop—they were in glass cases, and almost without an exception behind printed books, so that an ordinary observer would not notice them—I believe they are all here—there are several which have not been opened; they are in the wrappers as they left our warehouse—none of the note paper has been opened; some few of the books outside the shop were marked at certain prices—here is one marked 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the retail price of which is 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and our price to the trade is about 12 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I should say that there was about one tenth of the property found outside the door—the value of the whole that I found was about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that would be retailed at a price considerably beyond that—there was a very small quantity of stationery on the premises which I could not identify, perhaps 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, not more—Talbot was a porter in our employment, and I think had been so for twenty years—I do not remember his address, but it was the same house to which I went with the policeman—Talbot had access to our stock; to this class of stock particularly—the policeman went to Talbot's house on a Monday in September—the following day he absented himself from his duty—I never recollect his having done so before without leave.</p>

On the morning of 4th October, about half-past 12, I went to the house of the prisoner Mead at 1, North-wharf-road, Paddington—as I was coming up to the house, I saw Alfred Grantham coming out of it—when he came out I went in—I took Mead in custody on another charge—I saw Alfred Grantham again about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes afterwards; he was coming into Mr. Mead's shop again as I stood at the door; he made a dart back again when he saw me, and looked in at the window; I caught hold of him then; I asked him what he had underneath his slop frock; he did not say—I pulled up his slop and I pulled these out; one brass inscription plate and two small leaden inscription plates, and a part of a lead coffin—Mr. and Mrs. Mead then went behind the counter to a sack of white rags, and they took out three or four more brass inscription plates that were concealed underneath the rags; Mrs. Mead hid them in her dress, and walked into the parlour—I ran into the parlour and took them away from her—I have them here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—when I came out from the parlour, Mead said to me, "Between man and man, I have got some iron down in the cellar; for God's sake, let me go down and put it over the wall of a neighbour of mine"—Sergeant Potter then came with another constable, Bungay, and we took Mead and Grantham to the station—Grantham said, "I am no worse than the others; some other man gave it to me to sell"—we went back to Mead's shop again, and then</p>

               <p>Sergeant Potter commenced searching to see if he could find any more leaden plates—Alfred Grantham told us the names of two or three men, and we went and apprehended them—he gave the name of Groves and another—he said that Groves and the other man were with others working in the vault all together; that they were all the same; they all had the money, and shared it together in beer—I said to him, "I saw you come out of the shop before; you went in and sold something before"—he said, "What I sold before, Mrs. Mead gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for"—we came back to the shop to search, and found about 250lbs. weight of lead coffin and plates altogether—we found some underneath the counter; some of it was packed underneath the shop window; and one more lead plate I found in the sack of white rags where they had taken the others from—I was present when Charles Gran<lb/>tham, junior, was being taken to the station-house, and Charles Grantham, senior, also—I heard the elder say, when Bungay took him into custody, and told him what he was charged with, "I have expected this before, and if I had known you had been coming, I would have seen you d—d before I would have come"—he also said he was not the foreman; that Bland was the foreman, and had all the money—he said that he had not got any of the money—Charles Grantham the younger said when he was going along in custody, "There is a man there of the name of Cole; he had as much to do with it as I had; he had as much of the money as I had"—the church is about two minutes' walk from Mead's house—on the 5th, I saw Bland about 12 o'clock at night, going down into Praed-street; I told him that I wanted him; that he was charged with others for being concerned in stealing coffin plates and parts of lead coffins; he said, "I am not Bland at all; you are joking with me"—I told him that he must go with me; he said, "Very well"—he walked about a hundred yards very quietly; he then twisted himself round from me and another constable, and ran away as hard as ever he could; I followed him and took him into custody again in the Irongate-wharf—he said, "It is a bad job; we only did it to make a few shillings to get a drop of beer with."</p>

On the morning of 4th October, I went to Mead's shop; it is a marine-store dealer's shop—I found him and Alfred Grantham in the custody of Doble—I did not say anything to Mead before I took him—I heard Doble charge him with having some brass plates and lead in his possession, and he said, "For God's sake let me go down stairs and put some iron over the wall"—we did not allow him to do so, but took him at once to the station—at the station I asked him whether he kept a book or made any entries—he said he had got none—after leaving him at the station, I went back to the shop—I had left a constable there in charge, with Mead's wife—I proceeded to search—I found six plates, two or three brass, and some leaden plates, all with inscriptions on them—they were concealed under one end of the counter, under some other property—I found some lead, a great quantity of which has been produced here to-day—it has been all in court—I found it at the end of the counter nearest the shop, all packed up under the counter—after taking the lead to the station I asked Alfred Grantham bow he got the lead—he said it was given to him by the men at the vaults, mentioning several of their names—he mentioned the name of Cole, Edinborough, and another who was discharged, of the name of Groves—I apprehended Charles Grantham the younger in the vaults—I told him that he must consider himself in custody for being concerned with others in stealing brass plates and leaden coffins—he said that it was a bad job; and, pointing to a man of the name of Cole who was at work at the top of the steps as we were leaving the vaults, he said, "He has had as much of the money as I have;" I then ordered Cole to be taken, and he was taken and discharged—I went to the vaults again next morning and made an examination of them with Merry—I examined four coffins and I found that the plates had been torn away from the tops of the coffins by tearing them away; three coffins were covered with black cloth, and they had rent the cloth very much in getting one of the plates off—among the plates I found at Mead's, there was one bearing the inscription of Major-General Pilkington; I took that and applied it to the coffin; it corresponded and matched the place in every respect, and also the one now lying on the table, of Thomas Beaman, which I also found at Mead's shop—I applied that to a coffin covered with cloth where the plate was missing, and found it corresponded exactly, and the cloth had been torn by the manner of tearing away the plate.</p>

I am one of the senior clerks in the General-post-office—in consequence of some communication from the Northwestern district office I made up a letter on 4th October, in the presence of Mr. Clare—I knew at that time that the prisoner' was a letter-carrier at that office—I rolled two half-sovereigns in a piece of paper, and secured each end with a wafer, they were the property of the Postmaster-general—Mr. Clare wrote the letter; I enclosed the two half-sovereigns and the letter in an envelope addressed. to Mr. Robert Simms, 4, Harewood-mews, Harewood-place, Oxford-street, London—the envelope was addressed by Mr. Clare—I put a mark on the half-sovereigns before I put them into the paper—after I had done that and fastened up the envelope, I gave it to Mr. Clare to post—(<hi rend="italic">the fragments of a letter were here produced</hi>)—I have examined these frag<lb/>ments and am quite sure that they are parts of the letter that I gave to Mr. Clare—on the following morning, about 11 o'clock, I asked the prisoner about the letter—I made a memorandum of what passed—I asked him what time he came on duty this morning; he said, "About 5 minutes to 6;" I said, "What walk were you on?" he said, "The Gloucester-crescent walk;" I said, "Did you assist in dividing the letters fur the Gloucester-crescent walk?" he said "Yes;" I said, "Do you know anything of a money letter addressed to a Mr. Robert Simms, 4, Harewood-mews, Hare<lb/>wood-place, Oxford-street, London?" he said that he did not; I asked him if Harewood-mews was in his delivery; he said that it was not; I said, "What should you have done with a letter so addressed, if found with the letters of the Gloucester-crescent walk?" he said he should have put it out with the missorts—I then directed the officer Bingham to search him, and gave him into custody—Harewood-mews would not be on that walk—if such a letter was placed among the Gloucester-crescent walk the prisoner should have placed it among the missorts.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an Inspector of letter-carriers—on 4th October I wrote and directed a letter, addressed to Mr. Robert Simms, Harewood-mews, Harewood-place, Oxford-street—I saw Mr. Gardner enclose two half-sovereigns in it—it was given to me fastened with adhesive gum, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the evening of October 4th—I posted it the following morning, October 5th, about 5 o'clock, in the hole of the letter box at the chief office, St. Martin's-le-grand—notice had been previously given to those in charge at the Northwestern district that such a letter would come—after I had posted the letter on the morning of October 5th I went to the North-western office—I was there about 6 o'clock in the morning—a bag despatched from the chief office would reach the Northwestern district office between half-past 5 and 6 that morning—when I went to the Northwestern district office the prisoner was there, sorting letters at his seat—I saw him at his seat dividing his letters, and whilst dividing them he felt some letters with his thumb in this way (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>)—he laid several letters on one side of him, and after he had divided the letters for the district he brought those he had laid on one side out from his seat and took them to the sorting-table; whilst sorting those letters he kept feeling them, and appeared a little agitated and as if he was secreting something up his sleeve; he was fingering the letters about in his hand and pushing about his sleeve—I then saw him leave the sorting table and go to the letter-carrier's door and take up a bag that had arrived—he took it with his left hand, keeping his right hand close up with his coat sleeve, under his fingers against his breast—he took the bag with his left hand across the office, and threw it up on the</p>

I am Inspector of letter-carriers at the Northwestern district—I had a communication from Mr. Clare, in consequence of which I noticed the letters which arrived on 5th October, in the mail bag—among them I noticed a letter addressed to Mr. Robert Simms, 4, Harewood-mews, Harewood-place—when I saw the letter it was signed "unopened"—it ap<lb/>peared to contain coin—I felt it for the purpose of ascertaining, in consequence of the information I had received from the head office—Mr. Clare had told me what he had done—the letter was enclosed under cover addressed to me—I put it at the sorting-table where the letters are sorted for the Gloucester-crescent division—the prisoner sorted there himself; he was alone at that table—there were other persons sorting at the adjoining table—I saw him sorting a parcel of letters, among which was this one addressed to Simms—I saw him leave his seat when it was about nearly half-past 6 o'clock—I instructed him to clear the letters round that were for his district—I saw him go to the table where he ought to have taken the missorted letters—he took some letters with him there—this letter containing coin, being missorted, he ought to have brought it to me.</p>

               <p>about ten minutes; and after Mr. Sharp had been in bed I should say about ten minutes, the prisoner went into the cabin where we lived—the cabin is all under one roof, but is separated off into different sleeping berths; you go from one berth to another—it is one cabin under one roof, and under that roof was the captain's cabin, the chief mate's cabin, and my cabin, all different compartments—I did not notice which compartment the prisoner went into—he went into the cabin which we took our meals in—in the centre part of the cabin is the place where we live, and the little places where we sleep are cabins out of that—the prisoner went in at the cabin-door; I cannot say whether he went into any of the small cabins, or where; he then came out on deck, and a few minutes after he returned to the cabin again—he then came out again—he might have been about ten minutes in the cabin, at the longest, both times—when he came out the second time, he went forward on the starboard side and turned round as if he was looking to see if I was watching him—when he saw me standing looking at him, he came aft again into the galley—I still walked to and fro in front of the cabin, across and across; he then came out at the galley door on the port side; he went forward on the port side; he stood still a second or two, and when he saw me looking at him he returned in to the galley—I then went forward to the fore part of the ship; I was talking to two of the men, and while I was talking to them I heard a scream—that was perhaps 10 minutes after I had seen the prisoner return into the galley—I did not see him leave the galley on this occasion—the time between my seeing him go into the galley and hearing the scream, was about three or four minutes at the outside—when I heard the scream, I jumped on to some spars on the port side—I saw the prisoner standing, holding a five-barrel revolver pistol in his right hand; standing threatening the men, with his right hand up—he was standing about three yards from the entrance of the door where the men lived, where they slept—he was standing with the revolver in his right hand, and a knife in his mouth—Cumming was standing at the entrance-door of the place where the men lived—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the revolver and this is the knife; he held it in his mouth by the blade—the revolver belonged to the captain—when I saw Cumming, the fore part of his shirt, and his cheeks were covered with blood—he said, "The villain is murdering of us"—on his calling out that, I ran into the cabin to arouse the captain—when I got to the entrance of the captain's state-room, where he slept, I called to captain Barker; I called his name out twice—I received no answer—the door was open—it had been open all night—it was open at 12 o'clock—I went in—I went to take hold of his leg, and in so doing I discovered blood running under my feet—I immediately looked up to the captain's face—he was lying with his head nearly off his body, in a complete pool of blood; he was lying on the bed, not exactly on his back; he had a little <hi rend="italic">cant</hi> on one side; his throat was cut, and his head was nearly off his body—the bed clothes were uncovered from the chest upwards—I rushed out of the captain's cabin to call the chief mate—I found his door shut—I called out, "Mr. Sharp," twice—I had to break the door open; I could not open it from the outside—I called twice and he answered; he got up directly—I told him the captain was murdered—he said he was locked in—I found that to be so—there was no key in the door—the door was locked; I burst it open—there were marks of blood near the key-hole; I could not find the key—when the chief mate came out, after I had burst the door open, I saw the prisoner standing amidships, outside the starboard-cabin talking to the men—he then made an attempt to come aft to the</p>

               <p>cabin where the chief mate and I were—I shut the cabin door, and I and the chief mate ran inside—the prisoner had the revolver and the knife with him at that time—I shut the door until we got something to arm ourselves with—there were no other fire-arms nor weapons of any kind on board the ship but this revolver—I took a screwdriver, and the chief mate took a saw—I then opened the cabin-door and we both went out on to the deck to secure the prisoner—he was on deck standing holding the revolver, threat<lb/>ening to shoot the men that had been asleep, the watch below—there were four or five men standing there—the chief mate went on the top of the long boat to watch his movements—I then went to the fore-part of the vessel and mustered my own watch, and got them armed with anything they could find about the deck—the prisoner then ran into the cabin—the mate immediately went and shut the cabin door and shut him in, and the other men on board armed themselves with anything they could find—I watched the prisoner in the cabin, through the glass-door—he was in the after-cabin—I saw him breaking the drawers open; I saw him break two writing desks and the chronometer—the drawers were in the after-part of the cabin, not in the captain's state-room—I do not know what he broke the writing desks with, I could see him smashing; he had the knife in one hand and the revolver in the other—he broke them most likely with the revolver—the chief-mate was at the top of the cabin, looking through the skylight, watching the prisoner's actions—he broke two or three pieces of glass, and threw them in the prisoner's face—the prisoner snapped the the revolver twice, pointing it towards the mate—the caps on it went off—the mate said, "Ah, you villian, it is not loaded"—after that the chief-mate called to me to look out, that the prisoner was coming towards the door—he came towards the door—I then opened it—the prisoner came out and threw his arms up, with his back towards the poop, the cabin—he had not the revolver with him then, nor the knife in his hands, that I saw—when he threw his arms up he said, "Me kill the captain; me kill no more peoples"—the mate then struck him on the right shoulder with a scrubbing-brush, he was on the top of the cabin above the prisoner, and I struck him with a belaying pin—we secured him between us—he had on a wide sash twisted round his waist—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I searched the sash, and found this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) concealed in it; also this tin box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) containing pistol, bullets, and caps to suit the revolver—there were about a dozen and a half of caps, and eight balls—they were concealed in the sash round his waist, in the folds of the sash, and the knife also, tucked between the sash and his body—the pistol balls and the caps were both in the same box—we secured him and put him into the long boat—when we secured him and took the things from his sash, both his bands were bloody—after we had secured him, we mustered the crew and went to the captain's cabin, and saw the captain—on searching the after-cabin, I found this blue frock (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)it belonged to the prisoner—he had it on at 4 o'clock in the morning—when we took him he had this striped frock on—he had this striped frock on that morning, and this blue one over it—I got this large knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the chief-mate, that same morning—there were spots of blood on it—I took the two knives to the prisoner about half an hour or an hour after we had him in irons—I showed them to him, and asked him which knife he killed the captain with—he said the big knife—I asked him what he was going to do with the small knife that he had on him; that is the one that I took from the sash; he said to stick some people, suppose they strike him—they are ship's</p>

               <p>knives; the carving knife was generally used in the galley, the prisoner used it—the other is one of the table knives—they were both used in the galley, they belonged to the ship—there were spots of blood upon them, and they had been fresh sharpened on the grindstone—I showed the prisoner the blue frock at the same time, and asked him how it came torn and lying in the cabin—he said, "When I go to cut Joe's throat, Joe tear it"—"Joe," is Joseph Cumming, the seaman I mentioned before—I did not find the key of the mate's door—it was found afterwards by the boy—we buried the captain on the fourth day after this occurred, in the ballast, we bore up for Falmouth, and arrived there on 31st August—the ship was at this time on the high seas—the captain's name was Philip Barker.</p>

I am an apprentice on board the barque <hi rend="italic">Margaret</hi>—I remember the voyage from Lisbon towards Nova Scotia, and the day that the captain was killed—I remember having some conversation with the prisoner on 21st August, the Sunday previous to that day—he asked me for some gunpowder to put on his little finger—I was in the galley with him—he had torn a little bit out of it with the sail-hook—I told him that I would ask the captain for some for him, and he said, "No, no;" but I did—I jumped out of the galley and asked the captain for some—the captain told me to tell the prisoner to go to him—he went to him—the captain asked him what he wanted with the gunpowder—he said that he wanted to put it on his finger, and the captain told him that powder was no good; that he was to get a bit of rag and wrap round it—the prisoner said, "No, powder and vinegar will make it dry, and make it good"—the captain said, "Very well, I will give you some by and by"—he did not give him any, because the prisoner turned in directly after—the day after the captain was killed I had some conversation with the prisoner—I asked him what he killed the captain for—he said, "You know very well, Jem; the captain give me too much work"—then he said, "A good job for you Jemmy you came out of the cabin with the second mate"—he said, "Suppose you no tell me where the powder was, I cut your throat all the same as the captain's"—he told me the day after that conversation how he had killed the captain—he was not in the long boat then; he was on the after hatch, against the galley—he had come out of the long boat—he had irons on him—I said to him, "I would not be in your shoes for half-a-crown," and then I asked him how he killed the captain—he said he put his hand over his whiskers and the knife went all the same—he did not say anything else-after it was found that the captain was killed I looked in the cabin, the same morning that he was killed, Monday morning; I found the key of the mate's door under the table, in the ship's cabin, where the captain lived.</p>

I am a carman in the employment of Mr. Hanson, of Bo<lb/>tolph-lane—I live at 8, Sweet-apple-court, Bishopsgate-street, on the first floor, and the prisoner lives on the ground floor. On Saturday evening, 8th October, I went home to get a cup of tea, I had a slight quarrel with my wife, and she went downstairs—soon after I heard the prisoner abusing my wife, and I came down and said, "What are you abusing my wife for?"—I was standing two stairs from the passage—I said, "Talk to a man; don't abuse a woman"—he made no more to do, but <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his hand, and <hi rend="italic">catched</hi> me between the shirt and handkerchief, and pulled me down on the ground—he was in his shirt only; I laid hold of the tail of his shirt, and he kept on pulling me by the collar to get me in his room; I kept by his shirt, and when he pulled me into his room, his shirt gave way and he fell down on me—he then tried to get my ear in his mouth—I got my thumb in his mouth, and I <hi rend="italic">gagged</hi> him off me; he made no more to do, but turned round and got me by the windpipe, so that I was nearly choked, and I called out "Murder!"—a policeman came in and knocked his knuckles to get him off of me; he then took the poker out of the fire, and struck at the policeman first, and then struck me on the head with it—I was knocked senseless—I came to my senses in Guy's Hospital on Sunday.</p>

               <p>you?" and he ran to the fire-place and picked up the poker, and made a blow at the policeman, and split the panel or the wainscoting; he missed the policeman—the policeman went for further assistance, and I followed him out—finding the prisoner did not follow, I went back; again, and caught hold of Aldis and dragged him out—I found him lying on the ground, bleeding from just above the eye; he was insensible—I dragged him out into the passage opposite, and he was afterwards taken to a hospital.</p>

On 8th October, Aldis was brought to the hospital between 7 and 8 o'clock—I examined him there—he was suffering from a clean cut over the left eye-brow, and a severe bruise round the left eye—the cut went quite to the bone; it was from an inch to an inch and a half in length—it could certainly have been produced by this poker (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—at first I thought there was a fracture of the skull, but it did not prove so—he is still suffering both from the cut and from the injury he received round the eye—I do not think that both might have been produced by the poker—I understood from him that he had a kick there, besides the hit from the poker—there were two distinct blows given—I think the wound was inflicted by the sharp part of the poker—I did not see the slightest signs of the poker having been red-hot; there would have been, unless it was a very rapid blow—it must have been a rapid blow to have produced a clean cut—if it was a very rapid blow, I conceive that a clean cut of that sort could be produced by a red-hot poker without showing any marks of the poker being red-hot—the rapidity of the blow would prevent the singeing that would otherwise take place—supposing the wound to have been produced by the poker, it must have been used with considerable force.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I am 32 years of age. I was engaged in my own country, but was obliged, on account of some offence for which I was convicted, and had six weeks imprisonment, to fly to England, about a year and a half ago. I had a great many letters of recommendation from German merchants; I was employed at a merchant's, and while I was there I was pardoned by the king on account of the baptism of the young prince, and received a passport which will prove that at the present moment I stand here as a man whose character is not tainted; my character can be proved by Mrs. Fish, with whom I have been living. The reason I left the prosecutor was he gave me only 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and even this not regularly; he gave me on one occasion a bad half-crown; he did not act like an English gentleman, but a man who was not ashamed to enrich himself with my drops of blood. He knew that I gave lessons to several English gentlemen, and he employed me over time in order to prevent me. The character of the other witnesses will be known to you by their own confession before you; the case itself you will find is not at all a case which will form even a charge, but will fall to the ground. According to the prosecutor there must have been forty dozen of caps stolen, which could not have been taken out of the warehouse described by the prosecutor, because he always had the key of his shop with him; he was the first who opened the shop, and the last in the evening who locked the shop; this little room would not hold such a quantify. Amongst the caps I sold to Richardson were several cloth-caps, some velvet and Scotch wool, which I bought from the prosecutor and several other manufacturers; I bought 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of the prosecutor, to send them to Germany to a friend, who was to take orders and send them to me. I have pawned them in several pawnbrokers' shops. This great lot of caps would have to be kept somewhere, though I have always lived at Mrs. Fish's in St. Mary-axe, and this lady has never seen the things in my room, and I could not speak English to sell them some-where else. This woman has painted her name over the door, and she has bought stolen goods, and has lately been obliged to give back a lot that she had bought She has only lately sold stolen goods, and she has pawned the caps in question, and given the money to the witness Rotchford. If you consider this you will let me go, I having been already four weeks in prison.</p>

               <p>round us—she begged me to let her go, but I said No; I would not—I had the shilling in my pocket which I had taken on the 6th or 6th, and I showed it to her and asked her if she knew that shilling—she wanted to go, but I would not let her, and then the policeman came up—she snatched both the bad shillings out of my hand—I gave her in charge to the police<lb/>man; she had them in her hand then—I kept the first shilling in a bit of paper in my pocket—I am quite sure she is the woman who passed the first bad shilling.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Bishop and Blundell—on 27th August, I was at the pay table when the defendant came in and presented the accounts of the various work people—I produce one account, in his writing, which he rendered me on that day, headed, "Downe, one ream, imperial; second coat, 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I understand by that, there was work done of a certain kind to some paper of the size called imperial, by a person of the name of Downey—I know we had a person of that name there some time—I paid him 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 10th September I was at the pay table; he then produced a similar account, and a similar account on 17th September, the following week—both these amounts were paid him by me—on the week following September 17th, he again came to the pay table—I looked over his accounts, and picked out one headed "Downey," similar to these, and I asked him who Downey was—his answer was "I am Downey"—I forget the next remark that I made, but his answer was "I did the work, and I have kept the money"—I then asked him why he did not make out the account in his own name, if he had done the work, and he said if he had made it out in his own name it would have been objected to—I said, "If you have done this work it must have been, in our time"—he said he had done it during his dinner hour, and at leisure times—that was the whole of his answer to the best of my recollection—I was not in the factory during these three weeks that I have spoken of, more than once or twice—the description of the work mentioned is done there—it is an ordinary week's work for one woman—the amount is 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

               <p>—we have been married nearly 21 years—on 23d September last, about 2 o'clock, I was up in my own room; my husband came home at that time; he called me names when he came in—he had been drinking—he then took hold of a table-knife, which he got out of a drawer, and said he would run it in my inside—he attempted to do so—I screamed out, and the old lady down stairs came up and made me go out of the room—I went into her room, down stairs, for an hour—about 3 o'clock I went up stairs again, thinking his passion might be over, but he began in the same way—I then went down again into the shop to another person, where I was ironing—while I was there I heard a noise up in my husband's room, as if he was breaking my things—I went up stairs to the room, the door was locked—I asked him what he was breaking up the things for, and asked him to open the door—he opened the door, and I took the rail of a chair that he had broken, and struck him—he then took the leg of the chair and beat me on my arm and fingers and cut my head open—I bled very much—I screamed for the old lady to fetch an officer, and an officer came—I was taken to St. Bartholomew's Hospital—I was attended upon by a surgeon—these wounds were inflicted by my husband with the leg of the chair.</p>

I am the wife of Robert Allen, who lives in Gough-street, Poplar; he is in the service of the Trinity Company—the prisoner and the deceased came to lodge at our house on 10th November last—the deceased took the lodgings in the name of Mr. and Mrs. Royal; they took a back parlour—the prisoner was then working for a firm in Whitechapel as a shoemaker—they seemed to be living together on middling terms—her health was particularly good—I knew she was in the family way from the time she came; she had told me so; I could see it—I remember the child being born—I was present; it was on 28th April—there was a midwife there at the time of the confinement; her name was Medwin—she had a very good confinement, and a good getting up; she was able to go about, about a fortnight after her confinement—I know that, Mrs. Medwin is herself just now lying in—on 31st May I heard a moaning sound in their room, which attracted my attention; that was before 3 o'clock in the morning—I had not heard any moving about the room before that; I did afterwards—at 4 o'clock my husband knocked at the door and inquired what was the matter—the prisoner answered him; he said that his wife had got the cramp in her inside—I told him to get some brandy for her, and bring the baby to me, for the baby was crying—my husband brought it to me—there was some brandy sent for, to his sister's, I believe; the prisoner went himself for it—he took it into the room—I went into their room that morning about 7 o'clock, the first time; the deceased was vomiting then—the prisoner was not in the room; he came in afterwards—he said he had fomented her stomach with hot water and flannels—I don't think he said any more—I asked her what she had been taking, and she at that time said she had taken nothing; but further in the day she said she had had some coffee on the night before when she went to bed—they had been out together the day before, all the afternoon, and came home in the evening; she had had nothing out only a little beer—I made her some tea several times, and made her gruel and arrowroot—I applied some hot fomentations to her stomach, with flannel—I procured those flannels from out of the house; but that was not until the forenoon—I did not see any flannels in her room—when I first questioned her she said she was very sick, and said she had a very violent pain in her stomach; and further in the day, when I made inquiry again, she said she had a burning sensation in her throat, and her feet and legs were numbed to the knees, and a very severe pain in her stomach; that never left her—during that day she vomited a great many times, more in the after<lb/>noon—her bowels were acted upon a great many times—she was too bad to be moved—in the evening I went to look for a doctor, because I found the prisoner had not brought one; and then I went to look for her mother—I had asked the deceased twice if the prisoner had gone for a doctor; she said she did not know, and I said, "Well, if one does not come soon I will go and fetch one"—that was about 4 o'clock in the day—I then went to the parish and told Mr. Smith, and he gave me a powder to take home to her, and he told me to get an order from the house, and he would attend—I gave her the powder in sugar and water—after I had given it to her I remained with her about a quarter of an hour, not longer—the prisoner was not there during that time—I then went after her mother—she came about 8 o'clock, I think, and she was with her almost the whole time until her death.</p>

On the Friday morning, about 11 o'clock, I said to her, "Are you aware, that you will not get better?" she said, "Oh, yes, I am quite aware; my mother has told me so"—I said, "Have you taken anything to injure yourself?" she said, "No, not any<lb/>thing "—I said, "Be particular, for the innocent might be blamed"—I then said, "What did you have, when you were out, that Monday after<lb/>noon? "she said, "Only one glass of beer, and George drank the remainder"—I said, "Well, did you have anything after you came home at night?" she said, "Yes; I had a little coffee, and it was very bitter"—I said, "What did you drink it for, then?" she said, "Because George made me; there was nothing else in the room"—she said nothing more to me on that occasion—further in the day, I asked her if I should go and fetch a minister, and she said, "Oh, yes; do fetch somebody to pray for me"—she did not say anything else when I had that conversation with her, but afterwards she said, "God forgive that wicked man"—she said that a great many times—the child that was born was a fine healthy baby—she suckled it twice only in my presence during her illness—I can't say on what day; it was when she was first taken ill; she was unable afterwards to give it suck; she tried—the child died some weeks after her death—it was very ill from her death—before she went out on the Monday, I saw her with some cotton stockings—she had been drying them in the yard, and was taking them to her own room to put them on—I said, "Don't do that; hang them to the fire first"—she took them away afterwards; they appeared dry to me; I turned them myself.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you caution her about putting on wet stockings, was she careless in her habits? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and there<lb/>fore I was afraid she would put them on wet—I think shortly after one's con<lb/>finement, putting on wet stockings might have a very serious effect—I saw nothing particular in the terms on which they lived, more than any other working people—they had a few words at times, that was all—I supposed them to be man and wife—as the world goes between man and wife, they lived like other people—I never heard anything to the contrary, but that he was a very sober, well conducted person, with the exception of a few times, he would take a little too much—generally speaking, he was a sober well conducted person—I remember, before her confinement, that she was frequently attacked with spasms, and I got her ginger tea when they occurred, but that was nothing uncommon for a person in her situation—she had been very violently attacked on former occasions with spasms, but not to last any time—I remember my granddaughter getting up one night before she was confined, and making some ginger tea for her, when she was in very great pain from spasms and pain in the stomach—my granddaughter sleeps in the same room as myself—on that occasion, my granddaughter said, "There is something the matter with Mrs. Royal, do you hear her?" I waited for a little time, and then I heard her—I said, "See what is the matter;" and then my granddaughter got up, gave her some hot water, and she made the tea herself—I believe that was it—I have twice made ginger tea for her when she has been attacked with spasms and cramp—I have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185910240058"/>
               <p>only done it twice myself—I can't say whether the prisoner on one of these occasions, when she was seized with pain in the stomach, went out and got some brandy for her—I do not remember—Sunday was a wet day, but not particularly so; it rained several times in the day—the deceased went out on the Sunday evening to go to chapel—it was not very wet, because I was out myself and I did not get wet—it could not have been raining very much, but it had been raining several times during the day—on that night I was at home when the deceased came in from church—I had the baby—I nursed it for her whilst she went—she did not go to church alone—her husband went with her—they went together and they returned together—I do not remember when they returned the prisoner asking her to take off her shoes and stockings, because her feet were wet, and she might get the cramp as she had done before—she had strong leather boots on, and her feet were not wet, because I inquired of her—I said, "Have you wet your feet when you were out?" and she said, "Oh, no; my boots are thick"—I asked her the question, thinking she was a short time out of her confine<lb/>ment, and if she got wet, she might be ill—I did not hear the prisoner say to her, "Don't mind about the thickness of your boots, you take them off, your feet may have got damp"—he may have said so—I don't remember hearing him say so—I cannot go to the extent of saying positively that he did not say so—I can't tell whether they had supper together that night—I never saw them at meals together but twice—I can't tell you what kind of food they usually lived upon—I only saw the mother of the deceased in the house once before she was taken ill—that was on Christmas eve, or Christmas night, I don't know which—from Christmas night till she was taken ill in May the mother had not been there at all, that I had seen—when I had the conversation with her about the coffee and its being bitter, she said, "There was nothing else in the room but the coffee"—she did not say there was no sugar when" she said it was bitter—she did not say, "We had no sugar in the room, and I was so thirsty I was obliged to drink it, for we had nothing else"—she never named thirst at all—I said to her, "Why did not you send in to me for a cup of tea?" she said "Oh, you had got some one with you that evening, and I did not like"—I had some person with me up to half-past 10 that night—my daughter went away at that time—she did not tell me at what time in the evening before the persons went away she had taken the coffee—my friends were with me all the afternoon—it must have been some time after 8 o'clock, I saw her at 8, and she did not ask for anything then—she was unable to give the child suck after the Tuesday—she told me on the Wednesday that she had no milk for it, and was not able to suckle it; but on the Tuesday we attempted to give the baby the breast, and she said she had no milk to give it—I saw the child put to the breast—it appeared to suck but not to get anything—she had a full supply of milk up to the day before she was taken ill—I saw her nursing the child on the Monday morning—I do not know whether she attempted to give it the breast on the Tuesday morning—I did not see her—the prisoner might have gone twice to the doctor's, but not with me—I think he went there with the deceased's mother; I think that was afterwards—the mother came on the Tuesday evening—I fetched her—I could not walk so fast as her, and she was there before me and she was speaking to the prisoner when I came home—I do not know what it was about—it was in their own room—she did not, before me, charge him with poisoning her daughter—I heard from others that it was so—I cannot tell whether it was on that Tuesday evening that the prisoner and the mother went to the doctor's together—on</p>

               <p>the Wednesday he said if any one would go with him to the doctor's he would go, and I said I would—he did not say, "I have been once, and I will go again as often as you please, to any doctor you like to take me to"—what he said was, "I should like to go to the doctor's if any one will go with me, and I said, "I will go"—it was not the subject of conversation, in my presence, on the Tuesday evening, that the prisoner had poisoned the woman; it was on the Wednesday morning in the kitchen—there were six persons living in the house at this time besides myself, the prisoner, and the deceased—I had just previously read in the papers of another case in which somebody was said to have been poisoned—the prisoner read it to me on Sunday morning—ho was in the habit of reading the newspaper—he asked me if I had read it, and I said, "No, read it to me"—I was cooking at the time—my mind was not full of that case; I thought nothing more about it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But when the deceased was suddenly taken ill then it all came back to your mind, I suppose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I had seen other persons that had been poisoned; thirteen at one time, and they all had the same appearance—sometimes the prisoner would come into the kitchen on the Sunday morning and read the paper to me; but not to all in the house—I think it was the very Sunday morning before this occurred; but I am not positive.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). I am a Fellow of the College of Surgeons, and medical officer of the western district of the Poplar Union—in conse<lb/>quence of an order from the relieving officer of the union, I went to the lodging of the deceased, Zipporah Wright, on Tuesday evening, 31st May—Mr. Smith, my then partner, went with me; he had seen her previously—I think it was about 11 o'clock, or between 11 and 12 when I saw her—I found her in bed—she had a very anxious countenance, expressive of great pain; there was a damp perspiration over her face and limbs, and a very frequent and small pulse, and upon pressing on the stomach, there was evidence of considerable pain and tenderness elicited—she stated that she had a good deal of pain in her stomach; that that commenced the night before, some hour or two, or soon after the taking of some coffee; that the pain bad increased up to 2 o'clock, when vomiting came on, which was soon followed by purging; which purging and vomiting had continued for several hours—she did not complain of burning sensation of the throat at that time—I learnt from Mr. Smith what he had prescribed for her; it was opium with some calomel—I directed that that should be continued; that some rice milk should be given her to drink, and warm fomentations to be continued to her abdomen—I thought at that time it possibly might be a severe attack of diarrhoea or English cholera, which was at that time prevalent—I did not see her again until the Thursday—on the Wednesday I inquired of my partner, Mr. Smith, how she was, and was told by him that she was much better—on the Thursday, I found all the symptoms aggravated, the anxiety was very much increased; she was very much more prostrated; the damp perspiration over her face and hands was increased, and the tenderness was very much increased—she then complained of burning in the throat, and of intense thirst—on the Wednesday, the prisoner came to me with Mrs. Allen—I had not seen him before, that I recollect—he stated that he wished to speak to me privately—I took him into an adjoining room—he there said that his wife had been suffering some two years from venereal disease—I told him that would not account for her present symptoms, they were either the result of cold or of some irritant; he then stated that she had gone out on Monday, and had put on some damp stockings—on the Thursday, Mrs. Wright, the deceased's mother, brought me some</p>

               <p>vomit—I placed it in a private cupboard, and locked it up, putting the key, in my pocket—on the Thursday, she was in a hopeless condition—I did not see the prisoner on the Thursday that I recollect—I told her friends what her condition was on the Thursday, and I told her herself on the Friday morning; she was conscious of her condition—I asked her why she took the coffee—she said, "He gave it me, and it was very bitter"—she had told me herself, on my first visit, that she had taken some coffee—she died early on the Saturday morning—with Mr. Smith's assistance, I made a poet mortem, examination of her body, in that same room on the Monday following—I made some memoranda of that examination on that same day—I have not, got them here; they are at home; they are very rough notes; merely some headings for the information of the coroner; I do not require them; they would not at all assist me on the present occasion—I found a quantity of dark brown matter escaping from the mouth and nostrils,—the abdomen was, very much distended—on opening the abdomen we found the stomach con<lb/>tained some four or five ounces of dark brown matter, which I set aside in a bottle for subsequent examination; and on looking at the coats of the stomach, we found a portion of the mucous membrane here and there abraded; there was a general redness or inflammation of the mucous mem<lb/>brane of the stomach, and also of the small intestines—the mucous membrane appeared to be blistered, or there were small vesicles present on the transverse folds—a portion of the small intestines at one spot, two or three feet from the stomach, was more inflamed than the other—all the other organs of the, body, the heart, lungs, and liver, appeared to be healthy—we examined particularly the generative parts, and they were healthy; we could not detect any trace of venereal disease.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WELSBY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment, from what you observed during life and after death, what was the proximate cause of death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Some</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185910240066"/>
               <p>irritant poison, producing inflammation of the lining membrane of the bowels, and of the muscular coat of the bowels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon what do you form your judgment that the inflammation was produced by some irritant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> First, you have the description of the patient herself; her statement with respect to the coffee in the one instance, and the milk in the other, soon followed by pain, vomiting, purging, and the usual characteristics of inflammation; the post mortem appearances; the result of the analysis, and the effects of the extract which Dr. Letheby obtained, produced on Dr. Letheby's own lip, which I witnessed, and on my own tongue—on Dr. Letheby's lip in a few minutes some vesicles or small blisters made their appearance, intense inflammation spreading round within a quarter of an hour, which blisters remained for two days, I think; and upon my tongue it produced a very stinging pungent sensation, causing considerable pain for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before I could get rid of it—I believe shoemakers occasionally use oxalic acid in their trade for the whitening of boot tops—the appearances in this case were not at all consistent with the administration of oxalic acid; the death was much more rapid, and that is easily re-obtained by analysis—I am not able to pronounce with certainty what the irritant was that was extracted by the analysis.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you say among what class of substances it would probably be found? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it is either an animal or a vegetable irritant; it pos<lb/>sibly may be cantharides; I cannot say for certainty that it is—it may be croton oil; it is as much like croton oil as cantharides; or it may be a combination of that with other vegetable irritants—there is no one vegetable or animal irritant that I know of that would bear out all the symptoms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> At the time you were called in, there had been severe diarrhoea prevalent in the neighbourhood, had there not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There had been diarrhoea prevalent—the account which the deceased gave of her symptoms led me at first to believe it might possibly be something of that kind—I felt her abdomen; there was not a general tenderness of the abdomen; there was a tenderness of the stomach, but only elicited upon firm, deep pressure, showing that it was in the lining membrane of the stomach—pain or pressure is an indication of the presence of inflammation—there is a difference in the character of the pain in inflammation of the mucous and serous membranes—when I first saw the deceased she complained of a pain over the pit of the stomach—Mr. Smith had given her calomel and opium; calomel alone would act as a purgative, with opium it would not; the opium controls its purgative effects; whether it would do so entirely, would depend upon the dose of calomel given—I believe the dose Mr. Smith gave was something like three grains of calomel, with two grains of opium, which would not purge—I believe before I went he also sent some chalk mixture—I approved of the treatment he had pursued—up to that time he had communicated to me upon the case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And up to the time when you first saw her, and examined her, you still believed that she was labouring under something in the form of severe English cholera? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not quite so; I believed that it might possibly be so—I also believed that all the symptoms might be produced by some irritant administered in the coffee, as stated by the patient—the symptoms were not consistent with peritoneal inflammation; there would be a difference in the character of the pulse; the pulse of peritoneal inflammation is essentially hard and wiry; and there is a difference in the character of the pain; the pain of pe✗onitis is a short lancet-like pain, exceedingly tender upon</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185910240067"/>
               <p>pressure so that the patient can hardly bear the pressure of the bed-clothes; in this case it required firm deep pressure to elicit the pain—there was no peritoneal inflammation present at that time; that was on Tuesday-night—on the post mortem examination the peritoneum presented evidence of inflammation, as if it was an extension of the inflammation of the muscular coat of the stomach and bowels; it was only to a slight degree; not sufficient to kill—it was generally over the intestines.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were not the symptoms which were developed by the deceased perfectly consistent with <hi rend="italic">enteritis</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; up to a certain extent they might be consistent with <hi rend="italic">enteritis,</hi> because the effect of an irritant is to produce <hi rend="italic">enteritis</hi>—that which is known as <hi rend="italic">gastro-enteritis</hi> is a complication of it—as far as the symptoms themselves went, they were substantially the same as in <hi rend="italic">gastro-enteritis—gastro-enteritis</hi> might be produced by natural causes, or from an irritant—I have conducted many post mortem examinations—I have never seen a death from <hi rend="italic">gastroenteritis</hi> from natural causes; such cases are very rare indeed—I do not know that "The Principles and Practice of Medicine" by Dr. Rogers and Professor Lee is a work of authority; I saw the book some ten or fifteen years ago, but I do not know it as a work of authority in the profession; I dare say it is, I don't know it as such—I believe they are Dr. Elliotson's lectures edited by those gentlemen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does this coincide with your opinion, in reference to <hi rend="italic">gastritis:</hi> "Although it is very possible that death may ensue from things taken into the stomach, we are never justified in saying, from inflammation of that organ, that the various morbid appearances which we see there, have been owing to poison, unless we prove its presence; if it were not for an accurate knowledge of those circumstances we might suspect that poison has been taken without there being any justifiable reason whatever for the opinion, for the appearances within the stomach may be precisely the same as those induced by taking poison or some other injurious matter, when it is simply common inflammation, and the effects of it"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; common inflammation, certainly, but the post mortem appearances, as described by me, are not com<lb/>mon—to a certain extent what you have read does meet with my sanction; but common inflammation, however produced, will produce the same appearances—I happen to have attended those very lectures of Dr. Elliotson's, but as far as the work itself is concerned, I have not read it, nor do I know that it is at the present day recognised as a work of authority by the profession; I had thought that the work was obsolete—I know Dr. Christison's work on poisons; I recognise that as a work of authority—I agree with the following passage: "It is necessary here to give a detailed account of the symptoms of simple cholera; there is the same burning in the stomach and bowels as in irritant poison, the same incessant vomiting and frequent purging, the same tension and tenderness of the belly, the same sense of acidity in the throat, and irritation in the anus, the same depression and anxiety, the same state of the pulse."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From your knowledge and reading in respect of death from poison and from natural causes, do you think that there may arise cases in which death from irritant poison may not be distinguishable from death by natural causes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From the symptoms during life alone, I think it possible—without a post mortem examination I would not venture to say that the person did not die a natural death, with this reservation, that here all the pain and all the symptoms appeared to have arisen, in the first instance, from the taking of the coffee, and in the second instance from the taking of the milk; the woman stated that she was perfectly well up to the taking of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185910240068"/>
               <p>coffee; that the coffee was very bitter, and that soon after the taking of the coffee she felt pain and inconvenience of the stomach; that the pain increased for two or three hours, until vomiting was produced, and purging, and that pain continued for perhaps twenty-four hours—she told me that she had vomited two or three hours after taking the coffee—vomiting does not usually take place in much less than two or three hours after the intro<lb/>duction of a violent irritant poison into the stomach; ordinarily speaking, it takes place very soon after the introduction, sometimes in a quarter of an hour, sometimes an hour, but it may extend: take arsenic as an example; arsenic may produce vomiting within a quarter of an hour, or not for six or eight hours—I do not suggest arsenic in this case—I do not suggest any mineral; I believe it to be a vegetable, an acrid oil of a vegetable nature—the period at which vomiting would take place, would depend upon the dose, the quantity of food in the stomach, and a variety of things; it is very uncertain in the action—as a rule I should expect that a large dose of an irritant would produce vomiting in a quarter of an hour—irritant poisons, as a class, are very uncertain in their action, as regards the time of the pro<lb/>duction of the symptoms—if the extract which is said to have killed animals was introduced in that form into the stomach, it might produce vomiting immediately, but it does not follow that it was given in that form; it might have been given in a dose larger in quantity, but less active in its principle—I have no very great experience of the action of vegetable irritants as a poison—I have attended several persons who have died from poisoning; those were from mineral poisons, principally oxalic acid—an acrid oil would, I think, be insoluble in water or coffee; if put in either it would float, being specifically lighter; but it might have been well mixed with the coffee, and so diluted—what I mean is that it would divide the globules or drops; I don't say that it would be dissolved—I knew that the deceased had been confined about a month previously—supposing she had caught cold by exposure to wet, the proximate effect of that would probably be peritoneal inflammation, but very different in its character to the condition of this patient—the probable result of that inflammation being set up, would be a suppression of the lacteal secretion—I have heard that the deceased was not able to give the milk to the child on the Tuesday evening—in puerperal fever the milk is absorbed into the tissues as a result of the inflammation—if the deceased had caught cold on the Sunday previous, suppression of the milk might follow from that cold, two days afterwards, but the other symptoms would be very different—the absorption of bile into the system sometimes causes a pernicious effect upon the blood—I do not know that the absorption of the milk into the system causes a vitiating or poisoning of the blood—I have dissected puerperal patients—the slightest puncture in dissecting a puerperal patient will sometimes cause the death of the operator—the condition of the system when suffering from puerperal fever will produce poisonous effects upon any one dissecting a dead person—the system of a patient suffering from the absorption of the secretions is poisoned undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the secretion of milk to be suppressed on the Tuesday evening, and the milk as a natural consequence to be absorbed into the system, would not that which remained secreted, be by some process, the operation of which is not yet known, converted into a poison? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not agree to that point; I am not satisfied that it is so—it may be that animal fluids secreted during disease are believed occasionally to act as poisons—I know "Beck's Medical Jurisprudence"—I am not acquainted with Morganie, the French toxicologist—I have read Beck—I can conceive that a large</p>

               <p>quantity of the fluid secretions of the human body may acquire from disease such an acrimony as to be fatal to animals, without the introduction of any irritant poison—I do not know it to be a fact that the fluid found in the stomach of a diseased person dying from natural causes has been administered to animals and caused their death; I never knew an instance of that sort—I have never beard of a poison called the <hi rend="italic">necroscopic</hi> poison—I am acquainted with Dr. Copland's "Dictionary of Medical Science"—I do not happen to have read in that book of a poison of that description generated in, the system, and not referable to any poison whatever—I have not heard or read of animals being killed by the introduction of a fluid found in the stomach of a person dying of natural disease—it may be seventeen, eighteen, or twenty years since I read Beck, I have not looked into him at all before coming here (<hi rend="italic">Upon</hi>

               <p>symptoms of the deceased, when I saw and examined her, were consistent with an attack of <hi rend="italic">gastro enteritis</hi>—in a complication of diseases of the abdominal viscera, you may sometimes find inflammation both of the peritoneum and of the mucous membrane—I cannot say that in any post mortem I have met with the mucous membrane in a softened condition where death has arisen from natural disease—the gastric juices on the mucous membrane, if there are no contents in the stomach upon which to act, will act upon the stomach itself; and after death still more violently and powerfully than during life, and to that extent as to cause a considerable softening of the mucous membrane, and also an abrasion—it will cause inflammatory appearance and occasional patches of abrasion in the duodenum and the ilium—I was present when the analysis was made by Dr. Letheby—the contents were sent to him on the 8th—he set about the analysis immediately, the same morning—he did not carry out the whole of the analysis—he commenced first to test for mineral poisons—I think he did that on the Wednesday—he placed some of the organs that I took, in a bottle, and poured some ether upon them—the viscera that were placed in bottles were not put into any fluid, simply the viscera as taken from the stomach were placed in a bottle without any preservative; without alcohol—the post mortem was on the Monday—I put the viscera into a bottle and corked it up, and sealed the cork, without any alcohol or any preparation to preserve it—I left it from Monday till Wednesday to be the subject of decomposition and putrefaction, without anything in the shape of an antiseptic—the analysis was not proceeded with on the Thursday; it was arranged that it should stand over for four or five days—I did not replace the viscera in the same bottles—I saw them placed in another bottle—the bottle in which I had placed them was left in charge of Dr. Letheby—I left the viscera in charge of Dr. Letheby on the Wednesday, and arranged to come four or five days subsequently, I forget the exact day, and see the result of the analysis—after the Wednesday I had nothing to do with the mode in which the viscera were preserved—the matter which was vomited on the previous Wednesday, I sent to Dr. Letheby the week after I had it, together with the viscera, in separate bottles—to the best of my recollection the portions of the intestines with the stomach were placed in one bottle, and a portion of the liver, lungs, and kidneys, in another bottle—I did nothing with the vomited matter between the Thursday when it was sent to me, and the succeeding Wednesday—I did not subject it to any analysis—I put it in a bottle and sealed it up—it appeared to me more of a yellowish colour than green—I did not observe any difference in the vomited matter between the time I received it on the Thursday and the Wednesday—the colouring matter was bile—the bile naturally flows from the liver through the proper vessel into the duodenum, not into the stomach; it is out of place in the stomach; that is caused by a reversion of the action—some-times it is ejected from the mouth in vomiting—the natural colour of bile is a yellowish brown—when it obtains anything of a greenish colour, that I believe is the result generally of the action of the gastric juices upon it—I have tasted bile that has been taken from the stomach of a diseased person—I cannot say that I am familiar with the taste of bile in its natural condition—it is very nauseous—if thrown out through the oesophagus in the shape of a vomit, it would produce a very nasty sensation in the throat, together with the muscular action of vomiting; that gives rise to that which patients frequently complain of, a nasty rasping sensation in the throat—I assisted in the second post mortem when the body was exhumed,</p>

               <p>about a fortnight afterwards; it was not then that I applied the vomited matter to my lip; that was within ten days of the death; within ten days of the first post mortem—the death took place on the 4th or 5th, and the post mortem on the Monday—on the 8th I had the conference with Dr. Letheby, when I made the first examination—on that occasion I did not put any of the vomited matter or any other matter to my lip—I think it was on the following Monday, but I am not quite sure as to the exact day—that was nine or ten days after the death—no solution of alcohol or anything was put into the bottle with: the vomit—it had twelve or thirteen days for whatever chemical process might be going on, to affect it, before I made any test of it—it was before the exhumation that Dr. Letheby mode the alcoholic solution of the stomach and intestines which resulted in the four drops—the results of the different processes were placed side by side and found to be all alike—after the exhumation, I had a portion of the viscera which I took to Dr. Letheby and have seen nothing of it since—I was present when he made an alcoholic solution of the stomach and portion of the intestines which I first took him—at that time he made an analysis of the vomited matter and also of the contents of the stomach—when the body was exhumed, decomposition had set in—I placed the portion of the viscera which I then took, into a stoppered bottle and sealed it up.</p>

In May last I was in partnership with Mr. Webb—on Tuesday, 31st May, I was sent for to see the deceased, Zipporah Wright, about 5 o'clock in the evening—she was suffering from great pain in the region of the stomach—she complained of a dryness in the throat and great thirst—the first thing I administered was a powder containing three grains of calomel and two grains of powdered opium, and I afterwards gave a chalk mixture—I sent that, I think, two hours afterwards; I mean two hours after the calomel was given—the chalk mixture consisted of chalk, sugar, and powdered gum arabic and water—that was before Mr. Webb had seen the woman—I afterwards attended her for several days with Mr. Webb—I saw her on the Wednesday—I found her symptoms better; there was still a redness in the mouth and tongue, but it was not so dry as on the Tuesday evening—the vomiting had ceased when I saw her on the Wednesday; I did not see her on the Thursday—on the Friday I saw her with Mr. Webb—at that time she was sinking rapidly—it did not appear to me that there was any inflammation of the peritoneum; if so, very slight—I did not see it—I was present when Dr. Webb made the post mortem examination—I have heard what he has stated with regard to the appearances that the body then presented.</p>

I am professor of chemistry at the London Hospi<lb/>tal, and medical officer of health to the City of London—some portions of a human body were brought to me by Dr. Webb for the purpose of chemical analysis—the first portions were brought to me on Wednesday morning, 8th June—4 bottles were brought to me; the first bottle contained a stomach and two pieces of small intestines; the second bottle contained a piece of liver, a piece of kidney, and a piece of lung; a third bottle contained 4 ounces of matter vomited by the deceased; and the fourth bottle contained the contents of the stomach—each bottle was carefully secured with the seals, which I produce unbroken; I proceeded to the chemical analysis of the contents of these various bottles—I first took the stomach from the bottle and found it to be inflamed on the mucous coat—the mucous coat was everywhere softened, and in one place dissolved off; it was covered with a dark-brown mucus, which I found, upon examination microscopically, to be altered blood—the walls of the stomach were very slightly acid to litmus paper—there was no odour whatever of any volatile poison—the stomach was immediately treated with alcohol, and I searched in the alcoholic solution for mineral poisons but did not find any—I then con<lb/>tinued the search for organic poisons, and obtained from the alcoholic solu<lb/>tion a small quantity of a treacle-like liquor, which, upon digestion with ether, furnished, as nearly as possible, one drop of an oily-liquor, which I tasted and found to be very acrid—I then rubbed a small quantity of it on the corner of my lip; it produced severe burning pain in the course of 5 minutes, and at the end of a quarter of-an-hour my lip was considerably swollen, and was covered with little watery vesicles, pimples; the next day a scab formed there, and the effects lasted for 3 or 4 days—that was the result of the examination of the stomach only—the stomach was then treated by Reinsch's tests for mineral poisons, and it furnished a trace of mercury, but nothing else—the lungs were also there, and they were treated in a similar way, but I found nothing in the lungs; in fact, the stomach and the lungs, with all of that bottle, was at once treated with alcohol—the first bottle contained the stomach and some portion of the small intestines, they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185910240074"/>
               <p>were treated together, with alcohol—I have given the result of the first bottle—the second contained a piece of the liver and kidney, and a piece of lung; they were all treated for mineral poisons by Reinsch's test, and I sought for mercury, for arsenic, and for antimony, but I did not find any<lb/>thing—I then examined the vomited matter—I found, as it stood in the bottle, that it had separated into two portions, an upper layer of curd and a lower layer of whey; that was in bottle No. 3—the second bottle was not tested for organic poison, only for mineral; in the tissues themselves you would not find anything but a mineral poison; it would have been waste of labour—a few organic poisons get into the tissues, but not generally so; here it would have been quite a waste of labour—the vomited matter in the third bottle was of a greenish-yellow colour; I ascertained by proper tests that the colour was due to bile—I examined the curd under the microscope and found that it consisted of the curd of milk, together with a small quantity of starch, like arrow-root; it was treated with alcohol together with the clear liquor, and I found in it precisely the same kind of acrid matter that I had obtained from the stomach; I also obtained from it a mere trace of mercury, but nothing else—I then took the contents of the fourth bottle, it was labelled, "The contents of the stomach;" it contained 2 ounces of a dark brownish-red fluid which was very alkaline in its aspect, and which I found, by examination under the microscope, consisted entirely of altered blood; a little of it was filtered away, and I sought in the filtered liquor for oxalic acid, but I did not find any—I then treated it with alcohol, in the same way as I had treated the former portions, and I obtained a resinous looking matter, which gave to ether the same kind of acrid substance, which blistered the other corner of my mouth—I searched in the residue for mineral poisons and I found only this small quantity of mercury (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>), nothing else.</p>

                  </hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the result of your examination? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That there was present in the stomach, mercury, which had been ad<lb/>ministered, and an acrid matter, the nature of which I could not determine—I then requested that the body should be exhumed, in order that I might have further matter for investigation—that was done on 21st June, and I received a large wide-mouthed bottle and a glass jar, both secured and sealed; the bottle contained a spleen, bladder, uterus, kidney, and 6 pieces of intestines; the intestines were cut open from end to end, and there was nothing except altered blood lining the interior part of them; the mucous coat throughout, near to the large intestines, was very much inflamed and softened; at least it was red and softened—at that distance of time I could hardly tell whether the redness was due to inflammation, or to post mortem appearance—I searched very carefully throughout the whole of the intestinal canal for solid particles, fancying I might discover some solid material, and all I found was about 8 or 9 small seeds which I found to be the seeds of black currant jam, and a small quantity of the pulp of orange; that was all the solid matter I found in the intestines—that would give no result to assist me in my search—I sought, by means of the microscope, for the presence of vegetable poison, but I found none—I then treated the contents of the stomach with alcohol and ether, as I had done before, and again I obtained the same acrid matter from the intestines—the acrid matter alto<lb/>gether that I had then got amounted to just four grains; it was mixed so</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185910240075"/>
               <p>as to obtain the whole, in the endeavour to ascertain what its nature was—the fact of Mr. Webb not having put alcohol, or any other antiseptic into the bottle, would not at all interfere with the proper result of the analysis; 5 it is not the rule to do such a thing; it would tend to affect the inquiry to such a degree, that the identity of the material would be lost; we should not be able to judge of post mortem appearances, if alcohol was added; instead of aiding it would obstruct, it would not have interfered with my chemical investigation, but it would have interfered with my post mortem inquiry into the case; it is not at all a usual thing to do—when I received the various bottles, they were closely sealed down—I was not able to determine the nature of the acrid matter, I thought it might be cantharides, and I set to work to make experiments with cantharides on my lip, but I found it pro<lb/>duced a very different effect—I did not come to any conclusion in regard to the nature of the substance, until I had made experiments upon all the pure acids that I could obtain—I examined croton oil, veratria or white hellebore, mazerium, black hellebore, colchicum, euphorbium, colo<lb/>cynth, gamboge, and cantharides: all these are vegetables—I tried the effects of all these on my lip, and I found that the only one that pro<lb/>duced effects like it, was croton oil—the cantharides blistered, but in a much longer time, and in a very different way; but croton oil produced effects on the lip exactly like it—I then tried the effect of this which I had extracted from the stomach, on a guinea pig—I mixed it with a little water, injected it into its mouth, and it died in 10 minutes, as I thought, from spasm of the glottis—I then took it from the stomach of the guinea pig, by means of alchohol and ether, in a similar manner, and then tried it on sparrows; it was dropped into the mouths of the birds—it killed the first bird in 4 minutes—it killed the second bird in between 4 and 5 minutes—I then concluded that these effects were entirely due to the irritating effect on the throat of the birds—I took a third bird and gave it some treacle and water first; to distend its stomach and lubricate its throat, and the bird was violently sick in a quarter of an hour, and died, I think, the next day—I then tried to get it from the stomachs of the birds, and administer it to another, but it had no effect, it had become mixed with so much fatty matter, which I obtained from the stomachs of the birds, that it seemed to destroy its action—I then proceeded to examine the action of these various irritants upon birds, and upon guinea pigs, and the result was, that only one out of all these irritants, produced any effects like it; and that was veratria—so that veratria did not blister my lip, but killed the birds; the croton oil blistered my lip, but would not kill the birds—the result is that I cannot speak positively as to the nature of the material that I found—I can speak very positively to its being an irritant poison of a very formidable character; I have not the least doubt about that; it acted upon both sides of my mouth, and upon Mr. Webb's also—the whole quantity that I found was very small—if a larger quantity had been administered, although very much diluted, constant vomiting and purging would no doubt be very likely to have god rid of a considerable portion of it—I should not look fur it in the state in which I experimented upon it; I had it in a concentrated form, and it produced greater action on my lip and on the birds than it would in the state in which I found it in the stomach.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, supposing it was administered, you do not apprehend that it was administered in the concentrated form in which you found it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I should think not; I adopted a chemical process to get it so.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That is, produced by disease artificially created, and not arising naturally? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Just so.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SOLICITOR-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that a clear opinion that you entertain, or have you any doubt about it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no doubt at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It has been suggested that this acrid matter may, by some process of nature, have been the result of spontaneous generation in the body; in your opinion, could that have taken place under the circumstances as they have been stated? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot speak as to what is possible; all I can say is, that I have examined perhaps more than a hundred bodies chemically, and I never found such a thing arising from natural causes—I am not aware, from my reading or knowledge, of such a thing being generated naturally, or in consequence of decomposition—I found a portion of the same in the vomited matter—I think that fact would completely negative any such supposition: the fact of its being found in the stomach, in the vomited matter, and in the contents of the intestines, shows that it was right through the alimentary canal—I have never met with a case of <hi rend="italic">gastro-enteritis</hi>—I have opened bodies in which death has taken place from <hi rend="italic">gastro-enteritis,</hi> but I know of no case in my experience of <hi rend="italic">gastro-enteritis</hi> arising spontaneously.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The conclusion at which you have arrived is based upon the symptoms detailed to you, the post mortem appearances observed by you on the mucous membrane, and your experiments with that which you extracted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I do not think I should have come to that conclusion from the symptoms alone, nor from the post mortem appearances alone—a draught of cold water might produce effects such as I saw—I don't think I have observed similar appearances in death from <hi rend="italic">gastro-enteritis;</hi> not taking them altogether—there was a break in the symptoms which is very remarkable—taking the post mortem appearances alone, they were not such as I have observed where persons have died from natural causes; they were of the kind that I should hesitate to form a positive opinion upon—I think it possible that such a condition might arise from natural causes, but I have never seen such a thing—I think I saw the mucous membrane within ten days of the death—the mucous membrane is liable to very important changes "within ten days, and within three or four days; but there was an effusion of altered blood, from post mortem effects, on the inner lining of the membrane, the inner walls of the intestines—although I might meet with a post mortem appearance, viz. great redness,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185910240077"/>
               <p>which I should have great difficulty in forming an opinion upon, as to whether it arose during life or was a post mortem effect, I should have no difficulty in deciding upon the case, when I found altered blood along the lining of the intestines—in inflammation of the mucous membrane of the stomach from natural causes, you do not find blood poured forth, unless there be ulceration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> We have already heard that the gastric juice has a power upon dead mucous membrane of softening and even of dissolving? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You must first get the gastric juice there to do it; and when there is a stomach empty, and when, in my testing, I do not find gastric juice, I am relieved at once from any doubt that might be in my mind from the action of gastric juice—there was no gastric juice—the mucous membrane was in a softened and partially dissolved state—where that has been produced by the action of the gastric juice, there is a chemical and corrosive action—the gastric juice is an animal matter, a combination formed between them; but the gastric juice is not poured out into the stomach or intestines unless there be food or something in the stomach to cause the gastric juice to flow—in the case of a person who has died of disease and has not had any food for some time, there is an entire absence of gastric juice—I never saw a case of a circulation of gastric juice when the process of digestion has been going on at the time of death.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then the gastric juice would not distinguish the state of the stomach before and after death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at all; but there is no gastric juice in an empty stomach.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does not the appearance considerably depend on the distance of time at which the examination takes place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at all; we may have a redness of the whole alimentary canal simply from post mortem action, without there having been any redness there at the time of death, simply from the action of sulphurated hydrogen, from the blood being locked up in the intestines, which makes it dark—the morbid appearances vary as the examination is made at a proximate or remote period—we find the intestines after death becoming of a very dark red, although there might have been no redness or inflammation at the time of death—that is entirely a post mortem appearance; but I never found another Appearance which I had here, and that was extravasation of blood into the intestines, and that altered blood; I never saw that as a post mortem appearance—the viscera to which I am now referring was obtained after the exhumation of the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that you never saw extravasated blood as the result of post mortem action? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to the extent of this—recollect I had two ounces of blood taken from the stomach—when I speak of post mortem action, I mean what takes place in the body after death—blood in the interior of the stomach is a post mortem appearance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In death from natural causes, if the examination be delayed for any length of time, so that decomposition takes place in any degree, would you not find the whole of the parts red, and the. Blood completely transuded from the vessels, thus dyeing the whole substance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Just so; but not coming into the cavity of the intestines; it goes into the tissues—there is this difference in the cases you are referring to, which are very common, and are observed by anybody who has any experience in post mortem examinations; if a post mortem is delayed many days, the intestines would put on a dark red colour, the result of extravasated blood into the tissues, not into the cavity of the intestines; but here are two ounces</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185910240078"/>
               <p>of blood taken from the stomach two days after death, and no post mortem effect could have produced such an appearance as that—I know M. Belard, the pathologist, by repute—I do not know it to be a fact that there is extreme difficulty in distinguishing between the morbid and pseudo-morbid redness of the inner coat of the alimentary canal; not when the exami<lb/>nation is made immediately after death; it is certainly very difficult when made some days after—no doubt, in order to arrive at an opinion as regards the contents of the viscera and their morbid appearances, the examination ought to take place as immediately as possible after death—it is of great importance that the examination should be made immediately, that there may be no dispute with regard to the degree of the colour, and the vascularity of the parts—I do not say that if that course is not pursued, membranes, in which few or no blood-vessels are at first observed by the naked eye, would become vascular and venous, and assume the appearance of inflammation—there is extravasation of darkening blood into the tissues, which is so likely to be deceptive as to create a good deal of difficulty in deciding as to the case.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you make a distinction between vascularity and effusion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Decidedly; vascularity is a sign of inflammation during life; extrava<lb/>sation and effusion into the tissues is a post mortem appearance; and there may be difficulty after death in distinguishing one from, the other if the time is long.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Am I to understand you to say that there is never an effusion of blood into the stomach, such as you found, except as the result of some irritant matter being applied to it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not say so—I think I cannot hesitate as to whether it was effused before or after death—I never knew of an instance of blood being effused in the viscera after death, and I do not think it is possible—in my opinion it must have been effused there during life; and I believe it was the consequence of an irritant, because I found an irritant there—blood is effused into the stomach during life, and without the presence of any antecedent disease; but allow me to say, that if a stomach comes to me with two ounces of blood in it my conclusion is that it has been effused during life; and I cannot, at that stage of the inquiry, form any opinion of the cause of that effusion—I am certain in this case that the blood was effused during life—it is not merely an im<lb/>pression—I cannot conceive it possible that it could have taken place after death.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you find a dead body with a large bruise, or what you call an ecchymosis, you know very well, do you not, that it must have taken place during life? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; or so immediately after death that the circulation has not ceased—you can judge from the appearance of a bruise whether a blow was given during life or after death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is not the effusion of blood into the stomach consistent with natural causes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it is not, not with the symptoms; there are no natural causes that would have produced the effusion of blood into the stomach, which would have been accompanied with the symptoms—there is such a disease as <hi rend="italic">gastro-enteritis,</hi> but it is never accompanied with the symp<lb/>toms that we have in this case.</p>

               <p>finished my investigation and have found an acrid, then I have found the cause—the mere finding of blood in the stomach would tell me nothing beyond this, that it had been effused; I could form no opinion of the cause—from the symptoms alone I should not have been very positive in my opinion as to poison; but I say that there was a break in the symptoms that is not in accordance with symptoms arising from natural causes—I am anxious to qualify my previous answer to this extent, that I say the symptoms alone would not have justified me in forming a positive opinion, nor would the post mortem appearances alone, or the fact of there being blood in the stomach; but then I go to the chemical analysis—the blood might have been in the stomach as the result of disease or natural causes—the four drops was the result of alcoholic solution, and etheral solution—it was an oily matter of about four drops, and was the result of the analysis of all the viscera, and the contents of the stomach, which were given to me, from beginning to end—I did not, for the purpose of making that analysis, put together the contents of the stomach, the vomit, and the viscera—I treated them all separately; I got about a drop from each, altogether four drops, or four grains—I put it in a pair of scales and weighed it; a fluid drop of oily matter is equivalent to a solid grain—the duodenum and the stomach were in the same bottle—there was very little of the oesophagus attached to the stomach, just where the pyloric opens into the duodenum the contents had been taken out, and put into a separate bottle, before the stomach was put into the jar—a portion of the duodenum was cut open, also—I was not present at the exhumation—the fourth bottle contained the intestines taken after the exhumation—the spleen, the bladder, the uterus, and the kidney were all in one jar.; they were separately examined, and I found nothing in them—I don't think I submitted them to alcoholic treatment; I think I searched only for mineral poisons in them—in all cases of mineral poisoning the tissues ought to be examined, and tested for its presence—I first applied this condensed matter to my lip; the croton oil blistered my lip—it produced the same vesicles, I can't call it a blister; a blister is produced by a Spanish fly different from that—the croton oil killed the animal, but not so quickly as the other substance—I treated it in exactly the same way as I did the contents of the stomach—I did not give the croton oil, as croton oil, to the sparrows; but I treated it with ether, in order that it might have the same effect, and that killed the birds in three-quarters-of-an-hour—the veratria did not blister my lip, but killed the animals in three, four, or five minutes, just like that I got from the stomach—I tried the croton oil upon two birds; one died in three-quarters-of-an-hour, and the other in an hour—it produced vomiting, but not purging; there was no time—the birds that were killed with the acrid substance did not vomit, only the last one, which I gave the treacle to, was very sick—I gave some treacle alone to others, and that had no effect—I selected a guinea-pig for my experiments, because I had so small a quantity that I could not venture to try it upon a very large animal—I do not say that no reliance is to be placed upon birds—I do not know that Orfila has obtained such results as to render that doubtful; I dont remember such a statement—I read Orfila much—there is a difference in the minds of toxicologists in regard the value of experiments upon animals—Orfila, and the French toxicologists place great reliance upon them, and English toxicologists but little—as to the whole class of acrids which we are now speaking of, we only know of their effects from the experiments made on animals, by Orfila—I don't think that it is regularly laid down by toxicologists that experiments on animals should rarely form a</p>

               <p>part of a medical man's inquiry into a charge of poisoning—there are many poisons that we know nothing of, except by experiments on animals—I selected the animals because of their smallness—a guinea-pig is very closely related to man, that is, it feeds on food which is not very different from our own; it is not an animal feeder, but a vegetable feeder, therefore the experiment would be against me, because vegetable feeders are not so susceptible—the guinea<lb/>pig is not so different in the quality of its food, and in its structure from man as to justify me in not selecting it; or rather to form an objection to my selecting it.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As good as a cat or a dog? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They would be preferable, if we had a larger quantity of material to act upon, but I did not like to make an experiment upon a cat or dog with four drops—the cat and dog are only selected by toxicologists for experiments, when they have a quantity of material to operate with—I say the guinea-pig is equally applicable, because the viscera are precisely the same, and I suppose the functions are precisely the same—they are very nearly like that of man, with this exception, that they are vegetable feeders, and therefore have a larger alimentary canal, and a more capacious stomach—with that exception, the structure of the guinea-pig is like the structure of man—I never observed that the guinea-pig did not possess a gall bladder—I have opened a great number of guinea-pigs—that is a feet that comes to me now for the first time—I do not think it is so; as far as my knowledge goes, it is not so—I cannot say it is not so, because this is the first time the matter has come before me, but I think I should have observed it—I did not feel that experimenting upon an animal, in any respect different in its viscera from man, would be an unfair test; not under such circumstances as these; we have simply an irritant to test, and the experiment might be made almost upon any class of animal where we might observe the effect—in my opinion it does not matter a bit whether the animal has a gall bladder, a spleen, or a liver; that does not appear to me to affect the question of the irritation on the mucous coat—in administering this to the guinea-pig, I first added, I think, half-a-dram of water to the four drops; stirred them up, put them into a glass syringe, opened the mouth of the animal, and carefully, drop by drop, put it into the mouth—I suppose that might have occupied a minute and a-half—I then put the guinea-pig down; it appeared to be greatly distressed, fell over on its side, and in 10 minutes, as I stood with my watch in my hand, it died—the animal did not lap it up—I put my finger and thumb to open the mouth—I held it by the jaw, not by the neck—it is not the more scientific way to make an incision in the oesophagus, introduce a tube and pour it into the stomach that way—I suppose I have performed as many experiments upon the lower animals as any one, and I have never done such a thing—I know that Orfila recommends it when experimenting upon dogs, because they are so prone to vomit and to cast up the irritant matter immediately, and you are obliged to tie up the oesophagus; but he never does it except on compulsion, in that way—upon an irritant matter being passed over the glottis, the valve which covers the wind pipe, causes spasm, and spasm of the glottis and the larynx causes suffocation—that is one reason why the experiments are conducted by Orfila in the way described, in order that there may be no mistake of the operation on the</p>

               <p>stomach, but the main reason is because dogs vomit so readily—I treated the sparrows in this way, I had the material in a small glass, and held the sparrow by the wings; blowing at the sparrow it opens its mouth, catches the glass, and while biting at it, it is carefully tilted and it drops into its mouth—I used a small glass beaker, like an inkstand—it is quite true that what is poison to man is not always poison to the lower animals, and that some of the lower animals are poisoned by substances not hurtful to man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you agree with this: "With respect to <hi rend="italic">gastro-enteritis,</hi> the previous illness is not essential to the supposition of a case of <hi rend="italic">gastro-enteritis;</hi> it some-times makes its attack suddenly without any precursory symptoms first appearing, by vomiting and frequent evacuations, with griping and purging?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If by <hi rend="italic">gastro-enteritis</hi> you mean what I have stated, universal inflammation of the mucous membrane of the stomach and intestines, I do not agree with it—in the term "universal inflammation" I do not include the serous as well as the mucous membrane—if I had heard nothing of the history of this case, or of the symptoms, but had merely heard the post mortem appearances, I should have said that they were not the result of disease produced by natural causes—I do not intend to say that it is impossible to have arisen from natural disease, but it is altogether opposed to my experience and knowledge—I do not know that there is a marked sympathy between the soles of the feet and the peritoneum—it is stated in books that peritonitis is sometimes the result of damp feet, but I have never known anything of the kind occur—I do not agree with that statement—I do not think that inflammation of the mucous membrane of the stomach may be produced by natural causes, without the introduction of any foreign matter—I believe the opinion of the profession generally at the present day is that acute in<lb/>flammation, as in this case, of the mucous membrane of the stomach does not arise except from the direct application of an irritant—I do not believe that a poison can be generated in the human frame capable of producing inflam<lb/>mation of the mucous membrane of the stomach—I cannot say that a case has ever fallen under my own observation where the post mortem appearances have been so analogous to poisoning as to induce an opinion that the death was the result of poison, and where subsequent research has proved that opinion to be a mistaken one; but I can hardly doubt that it may be so—I am not acquainted with a case reported by Dr. Hastings, of a young lady who was supposed to have died from the administration of cantharides—I do not remember the case—I have formed no opinion as to the nature of the irritant obtained from the viscera of the deceased—I never met with a case of poisoning by croton oil—I should not think that in a case of poisoning by croton oil the inflammation would be greater in the large intestines than in the small; but I have no knowledge of the matter—I have only seen one case of poisoning by cantharides, and in that case there was a specific effect upon the kidneys causing strangula—I do not think Bichat is looked upon as a very high authority now—upon some points he is, but many discoveries have been made since his day—there is no doubt that in disease the secretions from the different glands become greatly changed; but I am not aware of any gland secreting in disease that which would be more poisonous than that which it secretes in health: I do not know that the bile may, from disease, acquire such an acrimony as to be fatal to animals; I do not know it from my personal observation, or by communication with other medical men, or by my reading—I have read Christison on poisons—I have not read Orfila; I have read extracts from Morganie in other works—Christison and Orfila are first-class authorities as toxicologists—there is not much reliance placed upon anything in Morganie at present—in the older writers I know that cases are cited of the bile becoming so vitiated by some unaccountable change as to prove poisonous to animals; but my belief is that among toxi<lb/>cologists of the present day it is not believed—I do not mean that the cases to which I have referred were fabricated cases; but I believe they are not now accepted as the foundation of medical opinion—I believe that the bile may have been given to animals, and that the animals may have died after</p>

               <p>it; but I believe there has been some fallacy in the case; from experiments that are made now it is generally believed that there has been some fallacy in the case—I do not doubt that such cases have been recorded.</p>

Louis states that in 6,000 cases, in 500 consecutive post mortem examinations, no case of gastritis was found—idiopathic gastritis is exces<lb/>sively</p>

               <p>rare—I have never seen a case of acute gastritis, except from irritant poison—I have been physician to a hospital for twelve years, and we have numerous cases every year—I do not think I have seen as many as fifty cases of gastritis—enteritis is inflammation of the small or large intestines—from the post mortem appearances which have been detailed, I consider that enteritis, combined with gastritis, was present—I believe enteritis is sometimes produced by natural causes—I believe it is possible for cold to cause it; in cold, I should include damp feet—I do not believe there is any particular sympathy between the sole of the foot and the abdominal viscera—cold is a cause of many inflammatory diseases—the result of my reading and experience amounts to this; that acute gastritis, as I have stated before, idiopathic gastritis, is extremely rare, but that cases which perhaps might be called idiopathic, or, not produced by an irritant poison, occasionally occur—it is stated that the drinking of a very large quantity of cold water upon a heated subject, has been the cause; and it is stated also that in certain forms of gout acute gastritis has occurred, and from eating very im<lb/>proper diet—I should say that a woman is more liable to be affected by a smaller amount of cause than a man, as a general rule—any powerful im<lb/>pression on the system while suckling, is likely to lead to the diminution or suppression of the milk—I should say that the milk which remains does not become deteriorated or vitiated by the action of inflammation, so as to poison the blood; certainly not—in a case of puerperal fever, I should ascribe the suppression of the milk to the puerperal fever; not the puerperal fever to the suppression of the milk—in puerperal fever, the milk found in the sub<lb/>ject alter death is not in a vitiated state; not more than the other se<lb/>cretions.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That increase of suspicion, being followed by the detection of the irritant poison that you have heard stated, would you or would you not, entertain a clear opinion as to the cause of death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot explain the whole case, except upon the supposition of an irritant poison—looking at the symptoms I have heard described, there is no ground at all for sup<lb/>posing that puerperal fever was present—as far as my knowledge, and reading, and experience goes, I should say there is certainly no ground for</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. LETHEBY</hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). The fact of the deceased person having used some washing soda on Friday evening, in making the tea, and its having given Mrs. Stubbs a violent pain in her stomach, does not make any alteration at all in my view of the case—it is not in any way calculated to throw any light upon it; soda is commonly used for the purpose of softening water, particularly where they wish to have apparently a strong cup of tea—druggist's carbonate of soda is mostly employed, but many persons use the common soda—there is a difference; that which the chemists sell is a bi-carbonate and the other is a neutral carbonate, containing one equivalent of carbonic acid, the other contains two, but they both have precisely the same effect upon water.</p>

               <p>on the intestines as a purgative; I may be permitted perhaps to say that the tests I employed, viz. alcohol and ether, will not dissolve carbonate of soda, therefore what I obtained could not have been any preparation of soda; I further ascertained that, the ackaline of the blood was due to the phosphate of soda, a natural constituent of the blood—if the soda bad been taken some days before, no doubt a good deal of it would be carried away by the vomiting and purging, but I should expect to find some of it.</p>

About a quarter to 1 on the morning of 21st September I saw the prisoner and some other men go to Shadwell-bridge and make some disturbance; they were sent away by some policemen—a little afterwards I saw the prisoner and Fry on the ground near Wapping-wall—Fry called out, "He has stabbed me"—the prisoner was holding this knife, and swearing that he would rip Fry's b—y guts out—I got on him, and got it from him.</p>

I am a surgeon of High-street, Shadwell—I attended Fry, and found an incised wound on the front part of his thigh, in a slanting direction, commencing on the outside and extending towards the inside; the first part was only under the skin for half an inch and then it went to the great depth of two inches; it went deeper inwards—it was a dangerous wound; he lost much blood, and I told him that he must leave off duty—for three weeks he did no duty at all—it came near the femoral artery, and if that had been wounded it might have been fatal, if no one had rendered him assistance—this knife might have done it; it is smothered with blood—a great deal of force must have been used to cut through his coat and trousers and then make such a wound—he is a healthy man or he would not have gone on so well.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 7, Tottenham-court-road—on the evening of 26th September, at half-past 10 or 11 I was at the Moss public-house close to the Euston-square station—I saw the prisoner there in his shirt sleeves; he was holding the door as I entered—I stood at the door and had a glass of gin, and waited for the ram to leave off—I went to the door, and he said that it was a very wet night—said yes; I am afraid it will not leave off; he said, "I think not; I live a long way from here, over the water, in the London-road, and I have never been on this side before"—I asked if he should ride or walk; he said that he should walk it—there were a great many people there; one of them was a stout fres<lb/>coloured man, a Scotchman, he was stooping overcome person who sat down—we remained speaking together 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour—the rain left off—there was another pot had and the stout man shared it—he and the prisoner went to my house; they remained there about a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes, and had a pot of porter—I told the prisoner that it was time for us to disperse as it was getting late; he left, the stout man re<lb/>mained in my room—I left the house by myself about 5 minutes after-wards, leaving the stout man in my room—when I got to the street door I saw the prisoner and said, "I thought you were gone home," he said "Not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185910240100"/>
               <p>yet"—I saw a man and women at the foot of the stairs, and the prisoner spoke to them—I then saw the prosecutor standing on our door-step, with his hand on the rails; he asked me where I was going, I said, to the Ship public-house; he went with me, and the prisoner followed—I believe they had ale or stout there; the prisoner said that they might call for what they wished and he would pay for it; the prosecutor had a glass of stout to him-self, and I had a glass of brandy, and the prisoner had some ale, for which the prosecutor paid—we remained a few minutes, and the prosecutor and I left together, and went to the door; the prisoner and his mate followed—the prosecutor asked us if there was another house where anything could be got to drink; I said "Yes," and we went to the Beans; the prisoner and the stout man followed us—that is the man who I had left in my room—the prisoner had asked me if his mate was still in my room; I said, "Yes"—he said, "Tell him I want him," and I went in and brought him in his shirtsleeves—that was at the first public-house—when we got to the second public-house, he said he would not pay for anything there, because of the number of people that got round him, and I said, "Do not"—we left that public-house and went towards Tottenham-place; the prisoner and the stout man followed us a certain space behind, about as far as I am from the Judge; to the corner of Grafton-street, where the stout man seized the prosecutor by the throat—he threw him on the pavement, on his back, the prisoner fell on him, and I saw a watch and chain in the prisoner's hand; they then flew back immediately in the direction that we had come—the prosecutor laid insensible for a few seconds—I stood still for a few minutes; I could not speak, as I could hardly believe what had taken place—I called "Police" twice, and the prosecutor called out likewise—I left him there and went to look for a policeman—I did not see him again till I was brought to recognise the prisoner.</p>

I am a surgeon, and live in High-street, Shadwell—I saw the policeman Soley—I found an incised wound on the upper lid of the left eye, and a punctured wound on his nose—it was all done with one cut—the wound was just over the ball of the eye, and it had passed down to the cheek-bone—it appeared to me that the upper lid was taken down over the eye, and the instrument then went to the cheek-bone—it must have been done with considerable violence—it was a miraculous escape for the eye—it was in a very dangerous place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was here read as follows:</hi>—"At 8 o'clock last night I was returning home, when I was called, by a woman who calls herself my mother, a b—y thief I asked her why she did it. She said, 'You won't let me see my children.' I said, 'You shan't see them.' She again began her abusive language, and while I was looking at her I was knocked down by my father, and while I was down, three sailors, as well as my father and mother, ill-used me, and I was glad to escape from them into my own house. While I was sitting on a chair, three constables came into the room. I asked what they wanted. They said they wanted me as a prisoner for abusing a woman. I said, 'Produce the woman that gave me in charge;' and I said I was the abused party, and they should hear it when I got a warrant at the police-court. The officer would insist on taking me. I said he had no right in my house, and I said I should not go with him. He struck me on the head with his staff, and before I could recover myself he struck me again on the left arm. With that I took hold of something that was on the table, I don't know whether it was a knife or a fork, and I struck at him. I thought it was wrong, and whatever I had I threw it on a dresser, and then put down my arm and said I would go quietly."</p>

I live at North Woolwich—I was with the prosecutor on the afternoon of 13th September, in the Victoria Tavern—I sat upon one side of the prosecutor, and the prisoner on the other—the prosecutor was going to treat me to a pint of beer, and pulled his purse out—I saw the prisoner knock it out of his hand, and the money fell on the floor—I picked up a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, and gave it to the prosecutor—I saw the prisoner pick up some money, and then run away—he went out for about two minutes and then came in again, and sat down drinking some beer—I saw him afterwards rustling the prosecutor about—it began by the prisoner running his head into his bosom—I saw a knife in the prisoner's hand at the time—I had seen the prosecutor's watch before on that afternoon—I saw it just before this happened—the prosecutor afterwards left the shop—I did not know his watch was gone till he came back with a policeman—he had been to Poplar Station—he left the public-house immediately after the prisoner left.</p>

On 19th Sep<lb/>tember I was standing at my door, and saw her passing by in the street—I saw the top of this tap projecting out of her apron—I went and said, "You have my tap"—she said, "No, no"—I went and took the tap away from her, and said it was all nonsense—this is the tap—I afterwards took this pipe away from her—she told me, if I let her go in the house she would hand it to me, she did not want the mob to see her outside—I took her in, but when she was in she refused to do so, I had to force it from her—this is the tap and pipe—I had seen them safe on the Monday afternoon, about 20 minutes before 4 o'clock, and I saw her with them about a quarter past 4—the tap was fixed in the water-butt in the yard, which is on a stand—this pipe was fixed to the wall—the prisoner had no authority to take them away.</p>

I am the wife of John Kirk, an engineer; I live at Bermondsey—on 5th September, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon I went to a public-house in Bermondsey-street to get some refreshment—I saw the two prisoners there, and some conversation ensued between us—Smith said she had a very bad hand; that she had been to the Hospital, and been laid up for 6 weeks with her hand, and had no means of getting her livelihood—Crouch also complained of being ill—Smith offered to show me her hand, and she took the cloth off and showed it me—I asked them if they would take a glass of anything to drink—they both said they did not mind—they said they would take a little gin; I called for sixpenny worth, and it was drank, and we came out—Smith asked me to go to their place; I said, "No, I only live a minute or two's walk from here, and I will make you a cup of tea, such as I have"—they went home with me, and before I went in I purchased a haddock—when we got home I had a damson pudding in the cupboard, and I took the pudding out and asked them to eat that till the kettle boiled, if they were hungry—while they were eating the pudding Smith got up and told me my face was dirty, and offered to wipe it if I would allow her, which I did, and she rubbed my face on the left side and over my mouth and nose, and I remember nothing after that till I came to, about half-past 5 o'clock—when I went home with them, as near as I can tell, it was about a quarter-past 2 o'clock—when I came to myself I was lying on the floor—neither of the prisoners were there—there was nobody in my apartment—no one came in; I went down to my landlady in the kitchen—I felt wry ill—I examined my room—the things were all turned over; the cupboards were open, and all the things were taken away—I missed a barege dress, a pair of trousers of my husband's, the stuff for making a black alpaca dress, a bonnet, a black apron, a table-cloth, a scarf, and several other articles, and all my victuals that I had in my house—I gave information to the police directly—I afterwards met with the prisoners by Billingsgate steps over London-bridge on the Tuesday week afterwards, as I was taking some work home—Crouch was wearing my bonnet, and Smith had my collar on—I did not give any of my property to either of them—I did not give them authority to remove any of them—Crouch saw me, and ran down the steps, and Smith walked on and I followed her—she went several times, up and down as far as the Monument—she made a stop, and I said, "You may as well stop, for I shall give you in</p>

               <p>charge"—she said, "What for?"—I said, "For robbing me"—she said she never saw me before—I said I should follow her, and one or two gentlemen told me to hold her—she began to swear, and said she would give me a b—y good hiding—I said I would follow her, and she said she would b—y nigh half kill me if I did, and she made her escape through the crowd—I got information afterwards—I have not been able to discover any of my things—Smith was taken afterwards, and Crouch was in the house, but I could not identify her at the time—I saw her in the morning with a bonnet—while I was in the public-house with them, we had sixpenny worth of gin; nothing more between us all—I had had half a pint of porter before.</p>

I followed Smith—I did not say anything about the other woman—she ran away—I did not know the way down those steps then; I have been since to see where they led to—I followed Smith for some time—I was close to them—it was between 8 and 9 o'clock at night—I was coming from the City—I had been taking work home—the prisoners were not apprehended till after I got information where they lived; they both lived together—I went to the house with an officer—Smith and Crouch were both there—Smith came to the door—I went in the house and saw both of them—I identified Smith though she had no bonnet—I was unable to identify Crouch, and she was not given in custody till the next morning—I was taken to the house again, and Crouch was gone out—I saw her in Bermondsey-street, coming out of a public-house—she had a bonnet on, and then I identified her—the bonnet I lost was a black silk bonnet I had made myself—when Crouch was taken, she had a black bonnet on, but it was not mine; but she had my bonnet on when I saw her and Smith by the Billingsgate steps—when I saw the two prisoners at the public-house, I had never seen them before—we had sixpenny worth of gin; it was divided between us—we were a quarter of an hour there—I can't tell whether the barman or the master served us—it was a man—I can't tell whether there was more than one man behind the bar—there were no people there but us—I could not tell the name of the public-house—I could find it—I went with a policeman, and pointed it out—none of the property I lost has been discovered—the prisoners' lodging was searched—I am sure about the hour and the day—it was Monday, 5th September, at 2 o'clock, just after dinner.</p>
