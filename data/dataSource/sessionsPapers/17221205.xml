That they call'd for a two Shilling Bowl, and Michael Young bid them make it a half Crown Bowl; but when the Reckoning came to be paid, he would not pay any Thing toward it, but challenged any of them to fight. That they went out of the House, and in a few Minutes Joseph Hutton and the rest of the Company came in again, and about half a Quarter of an Hour after Michael Young came, and brought with him five or six Men.

Landry Dawson depos'd to the same purpose, adding. That when the Prisoner came in, he deny'd to be in Liquor, and that he refus'd to pay part of the Reckoning, upon which high Words arising, he challeng'd to fight one of the Company; but the deceas'd said, He should not fight with that Person, because he was not an equal Match for him; that then the Prisoner challeng'd him, or the Best Man in the Company.

             depos'd, He had had frequent Dealings with the Prisoner for 2 or 3 Years; that he had 6 Bobbins of Silk from Mr. Gering's and that he sold them to the Prisoner for 2 s. That she knew the Silk was stolen, knowing in what Shops he worked; and consequently how he must come by them: That she us'd to turn off the Silk, and give him the empty Bobbins again. That she had been the Ruin of him and his Family, in that she did sometimes come to his House, and tell him, that she had no Goods in the House to work, and he must get her some as soon as he could, which she knew could be no other Way but by stealing of them. Mr. Gering depos'd, There were 2 Bobbins with Mr. Crush's Mark, found in the Prisoner's House, and that one of them had some Silk upon it, which Mr. Crush affirmed to be his Silk. Mr. Dole deposed, That in searching the Prisoner's House a great Number of Bobbins were found, with the Marks of divers Silk-Throwers; whereas they were always so careful of keeping their Bobbins, that if at any Time they grew unfit for use they either burnt them, or cut out their Marks: Or if a Person dy'd and his Bobbins were to be sold, the Buyer immediately put on them his own Mark. And also in a Garret over another House, they found a private Throwing-Mill for Silk, that carried 40 Spindles, which was an unlawful Mill; that there was Silk on the Bobbins upon the Mill, and that no Person of a Silk Thrower, might imploy any such Mill, under the Penalty of 40 s. a Month. Several other Evidences confirm'd the same: And also that there were 6 Bobbins of Mr. Gering's, with Silk found in the Prisoner's House. And Mr. Powel depos'd, that the Prisoner had own'd she did lend Rudgate 2 s. upon them. The Prisoner in her Defence produc'd an Evidence who depos'd, He had at one Time sold the Prisoner 9 Dozen of old Bobbins: And another Evidence, That Rudgate had brought empty Bobbins to her House. Another Evidence depos'd, He did see Rudgate at the prisoner's House, and that he told her, That he was afraid of being arrested, and desir'd her to lend him 2 Shillings. And that she afterwards seeing the 6 Bobbins of Silk (which appear'd to be Mr. Gearing's) in the Window, was surpriz'd to see them. She pleaded she us'd the Mill in her Business, she dealing in Waste, Silk, for making Ferrets, and also in the Silk Stocking Trade. She call'd some Persons to her Reputation.
