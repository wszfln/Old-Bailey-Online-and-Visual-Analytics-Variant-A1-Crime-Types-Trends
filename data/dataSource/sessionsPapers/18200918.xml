On the 5th of June, a little after ten o'clock at night, I was coming up the street, and heard the watchman's rattle sprung; I went to the house, several people had collected before I arrived, but none had entered the house. I went home, got a mawl, broke the pannel of the door open, and was the first person that entered the house - the street door was bolted, and had a small chain across, which would enable it to be opened a little, if unbolted. I let the people in, went along the passage, and on the right hand, at the end, I discovered a fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the fire-place - A. I cannot exactly tell, there was a great deal of smoke. I saw the fire burning under what I thought was a boiler, but afterwards it turned out to be a cask with a cock to it - it was in the bar; we called for water, which the neighbours handed in, and we put the fire out in the bar, and at the bottom of the cellar stairs we found a pile of wood on fire, against the partition which was also on fire - it did not blaze - water was thrown on it, and it was put out. I then got the watchman's lanthorn, and opened the cellar flap. I had made a hole in the floor to throw the water into the cellar, but on examination found it was not opposite the place. I saw the prisoner about eleven o'clock, but had no conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Do you not know that coals and wood were kept in the cellar - A. I do not know. The fire had burnt through the floor to the bar.</p>

            . I live nearly opposite to the King's Arms. I heard a noise about eleven o'clock at night, and went to the house - they were then throwing water on the fire. I went home, changed my dress, and on my return they were opening the cellar flap; I entered the cellar with other people, and observed the partition burning, and a quantity of wood laid against the partition - it appeared a place intended to keep wood in. I took up a piece, it was the stave of a cask; Randall, the fireman, was knocking the partition down. I remained there until the fire was completely extinguished, we went to the front room on the first floor, which was full of smoke. We opened the windows, and examined every room - there were beds there, but no sheets on them. I went to the back parlour, and saw some pieces of paper and other stuff on fire in the cupboard, sparks of fire were on them; they were opening the cupboard, and taking the paper out as I went into the parlour. The bar is on the right-hand side of the passage, and the room with the cupboard was on the left - it was impossible for one to burn through to the other; the closet was near the stove of the back room, but there was no communication between them; a bundle of candles were taken out of the closet, partly burnt, and the door of the closet was blistered inside, as if by fire. The house was quite different from being fully furnished. I am an appraiser myself, but had rather not set a value on it - it was quite contrary from being good.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long had the house been closed - A. Only since September I know there was a petition from the churchwardens and inhabitants to renew the licence. The place in the cellar appeared a place to keep wood in. Several people were in, I saw none with torches, but the watchmen had their lanthorns. The people had been in the house an hour or more before I went to the cupboard; part of the paper was consumed, but there were only sparks when it was discovered.</p>

            . I am an officer of Shadwell. About ten o'clock at night I heard of the fire, and was among those who first went in. I ordered two men to get pickaxes and break open the door. I did not examine the back door until sometime after - it was then open; the fire in the bar had burnt upwards and downwards. I went down and found the wood burning against the partition - there was no fire-place in the cellar. I came up to the back parlour, opened the closet door, which was closed, I opened it with my fingers, and discovered pieces of paper burning, but they were all burnt out then, and were in a state of tinder; there were sparks of fire and two bundles of candles lay there, a little burnt and melted, and the door rather blistered. It seemed a general closet for all sorts of things. I went to the cellar again to look under the closet to see if any fire was there, but found none. There was no fire in the fire-place of the parlour, but on a round table there was a small bundle of matches, a tinder box, and a candle half burnt - it was not burning then; none of the matches were burnt. I examined the house, and found some empty boxes, the drawers were also empty, and the beds had no sheets or curtains on them. There was not much furniture in the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. There was no fire in the parlour, therefore it was necessary to have matches to strike a light - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a fireman of the Phoenix Fire Office. When I arrived at the fire several persons had entered the house. I got there about eleven o'clock, and entered at the cellar window - water was brought, and I put the fire out. I went to the upper rooms - we opened the staircase window on the first floor to let out the smoke. I found a room on the second floor fastened by a piece of wood being put through the asp, I went in, and found the furniture in confusion - a quantity of loose paper laid on the floor, in a heap, I suppose a bushel. We then came down to the back parlour, and saw the officer open the cupboard door; a fellow-servant of mine held up a piece of wood or iron with the embers of fire on it. I found Mr. Bates at Mr. Jones's, Stepney-green; he came to the door - I had my fireman's dress on - I told him the house had been on fire, but it was then out, he said he would go with us - I had not asked him. On our way he asked me if I had the keys? I said No, we were obliged to break the door open. I asked him whom he was insured with - he said with the Sun. Mills, who was with me, said</p>
               <p>"Was not you in your house this evening?</p>
               <p>"He said Yes, and supposed he left about half-past eight o'clock. Mills asked him if he locked the door after him, and if he was the last person in the house - he said he was. Mills then said,</p>
               <p>"Certainly you must have the key." He said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, dear! Mrs. Bates has got it." When we got to the house I told the Sun firemen he was insured with them, and left him with them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The room where the papers were was up two pair of stairs - A. Yes; there was no appearance of fire in that room.</p>

            . I am a constable of Shadwell. I went to the house, and saw a quantity of loose stuff laying on the cupboard floor - it appeared a general cupboard to keep things in. The wrong end of the candles are melted, the tops are not burnt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. It was a cupboard where the refuse for lighting fires in the house was kept - A. I supposed so.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MATTHEWS. I am a watchman of Shadwell. I saw Lawley break the door open, he was the first person that entered. I went to the bar, and found it on fire; after throwing water on it we found it arose from the cellar, which had burnt through. I did not see the back door.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The front door was fastened inside, whoever locked it could not have left that way - A. No, my Lord. I went into the parlour on the left, and saw some remains of fire in the grate; a sailor-looking man threw water on it by my desire, the smoke was then so great I was obliged to go to the front. I know the prisoner was master of the house.</p>

            . I am surveyor and appraiser to the Sun Fire Office; it is my duty when a fire happens to survey the premises. I went to these premises on the 6th of June, which was the following day; it was impossible for the fire in the cupboard to be occasioned by the one in the cellar - they were twenty feet asunder - nor could the fire in the grate communicate to it, there was at least eight feet of brick-work between them. I saw Bates on entering the house, and after examining it had some conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What furniture did you discover - A. A very miserable quality; I valued the whole, including his own wearing apparel and his wife's, at 115 l. 15 s., which was all there was to satisfy articles insured for 1000 l. I found china and glass, value 9 l. 7 s. insured at 100 l., and the stock and utensils, which I consider the fitting up of the bar and the fixtures, value 96 l. 8 s., insured at 500 l. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180005"/>asked Bates if he had lost anything - he said Yes, he had lost a leather portmanteau about a yard long, from under his bed in the front one pair room, and it contained a quantity of plate, which he mentioned, it was a silver teapot, nine table-spoons, seven tea-spoons, four dozen of ivory handled knives and forks, with silver tips, a gold necklace, two silver snuff boxes, a pair of sugar tongs, seven or eight rings, a pair of silver buckles, and many other articles of jewellery. I enquired if anything else was lost, he said only eighteen common dinner plates from the kitchen. I said the circumstances of the fire were so very suspicious, that I could not presume for a moment, that he would be paid a farthing for his loss - he said it was a hard case.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The beer and other things constitute the stock in trade - A. Certainly. I do not know whether the brewer can tell what beer was there. It would cost him nothing to renew his policy when his licence was renewed. His bed appeared to have been slept in, but there were no sheets on it. If he had moved his stock the office would have allowed him to transfer his policy. His wife subsequently complained of linen being lost.</p>

            , ESQ. I am a magistrate of Shadwell. The prisoner's licence was suspended twelve months ago, not in consequence of his misconduct, but his wife's. The licencing day is to-morrow.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I trust I shall give every satisfaction. I hoped to obtain my licence again, and remained in the house. Immediately as my business was over I went to the Excise Office, withdrew my entry, and returned my beer and liquor. I thought it not worth while to alter my policy. When they sent to me to pay the money I took my policy and gave it to the gentleman, he said the old policy would do; he took 2 l. short in payment, sometime after they sent to inform me of it, and I went and paid it. A Mr. Jones had agreed to take a house about the time of the fire, we were to meet his brokers at the Sampson and Lion, public-house, about it, at eight o'clock. On the 5th of June Jones called on me, we went with his wife and mine - all four set off together - the brokers did not come; we left, went to a house in Neptune-street, and remained there about three-quarters of an hour - it was then near twelve o'clock; we then went towards Jones's house, called at the Ship, and asked the landlord to let us take home half a gallon of porter, as it was late; just as we had had supper at Jones's, a knock came at the door, I heard myself asked for, and was informed my house was on fire; I got my hat, and ran after the man. I said I had given my wife the key. I never saw the house after I left it at eight o'clock.</p>

The firewood and coals were kept in the cellar. There was a black and white cat in the house, I saw it after the fire, it had the hair on its back burnt.

            . I am a publican, and keep the Sampson and Lion, East Smithfield. In the early part of June I lived at Stepney-causeway; I intended to go into my house on the 6th of June. I saw the prisoner on the night of the fire, I had called on him with my wife at eight o'clock, for him and his wife to go with us to the Sampson and Lion - I called by appointment - we were going to meet the brokers. I went into the prisoner's back parlour, we came out at the front door, he fastened himself in, and came out at the back door; we waited for him in the street, and he came round to us; we then went to the Sampson and Lion, stopped there till near half-past ten o'clock, the brokers did not come, and we went away. It rained hard when we got to the Neptune, at the corner of Neptune-street, we called in there until the rain abated, then left; it rained again, we called at the Ship, remained there until half-past eleven o'clock, then proceeded to my house at Stepney-causeway. About half-past twelve o'clock a knock came to the door, and Mr. Bates was asked for. He had remained in our company from the time we left his house until then.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you expect to be kept so late at the Sampson and Lion - A. No, the brokers were to come at eight o'clock. It was nearer to go to my house than to the prisoner's. He was to sleep at his own house that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you prepared any bed for a stranger that night - A. No; Mrs. Bates did not go with her husband, she went into Seabrook's, and remained behind.</p>

I returned in about half an hour, and found the door half open - I am certain I had locked it. I think it had been opened by a picklock-key, as no force had been used. Two boxes in the bed-room were broken open, and all the things strewed about; my wife was at work at Bayswater Tea Gardens, just by. I missed the articles stated in the indictment, 25 s. in money, and other things. I saw the money safe, and both boxes locked, about half an hour before.</p>

On the 25th of April, about one o'clock, I saw the prisoner and Price, who was convicted last Session, come out of Harper's fields, which lead from Bayswater into the Edgware-road; the prisoner carried a large bag across his shoulder, the other man walked at a distance behind; they turned down John-street, Edgware-road, and walked very fast - I suspected them, and followed at a little distance. Harper's fields is in almost a straight line from the prosecutor's. Price looked back to see if any one was watching them; they crossed the end of Cato-street, the prisoner returned back, and went into Cato-street; I then got up to Cato-street, and saw the prisoner turn into a house, Price looked back, ran by the door, and ran out at Queen-street end; by the time I got to the door the prisoner was in the passage; he rebounded back out of the passage, with the bag behind him, and dropped it - I secured it, and he ran into John-street again; I called stop thief, he ran into Mitcham-street, through a house, got out on Lisson-green, and escaped. I can positively swear he is the man. I kept the property till Price's trial, and then returned it the prosecutor.</p>

I called out stop thief, he ran about twenty yards, and was taken; I went up, and knew him to be the same man. The parcel was a sample of the bale.</p>

I saw the prisoner come suddenly up to our door, with his face against the glass, as if he was hiding from some one; he folded his arms, and then he put his hand to his pocket, and almost at the same instant he started from the door; I heard a cry of stop thief, opened the door, and ran after him.

            . I was standing at the gate in Bread-street, where I live, I heard the cry of stop thief, and saw the prisoner running violently, and crying stop thief most lustily, I caught hold of him, suspecting he was the thief; he said I was mistaken, for the man who stole the parcel had ran into Cheapside. I held him till Grant came, he immediately said he was the man, and he could swear to him. Grant desired me to take care of a knife which he had in his pocket. I fetched the officer, and while the officer was searching him I saw him pull his hand from his breeches pocket - I seized it, and took the knife from his hand.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker. On the 15th of July. I was coming from a friend's, at Ratcliff, across Tower-hill, and up the Minories, I saw eight or ten men surround Mr. Knox; I immediately went to assist him, and saw the prisoner with the watch in his possession - I saw the seals through his fingers - I did not see him receive or take it. I collared him, and tried to take it from him, but he knocked me down. I got up, seized him again, and he dropped the watch. I made a second attempt to pick it up, and was knocked down again. I held him till we got him into a shop - somebody picked the watch up, and gave it to the prosecutor. I am certain the prisoner is the man. I did not let him go for a moment.</p>

            . I am fourteen years old, and live with my mother, at Hackney. On Saturday, the 1st of July, I was crossing the London field from town to Hackney, at two o'clock in the afternoon, and met the prisoner - I am sure he is the man; he passed me, and as soon as he got behind me he laid hold of me, and snatched my watch out of my fob; he caught hold of my arm with one hand, and snatched it out with the other. He said, at the same time,</p>
               <p>"I'II cut your throat." I was frightened, which prevented my resisting. The watch was not gone from my person when he said those words. He let go of me, went a little way, and then stood still, and looked at me; as soon as he saw I went away home, he went towards town. I saw him again on the Friday following at the watch-house, where he was in custody on another charge, and am sure he is the person. I found my watch at the pawnbroker's.</p>

            . I am housekeeper to Mr. Swallow's lodgers. On the 8th of July I missed a purse from the kitchen drawer, containing three guineas, a gold ring, and some memorandums. I afterwards saw the purse at Queen-square.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. The ring and purse were given to you - A. The ring was returned to me in Mr. Swallow's presence. I saw a woman bring it, whom I believe to be his mother - the purse was not offered to me.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. I took the prisoner at Mr. Swallow's shop. I found a watch, a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180010"/>little pocket-book, and a knife, on him, but no money. I asked him what he had done with the money - he said, voluntarily, that he had spent it, and had bought the watch, seal, and key, with part of it, at a shop in the Broadway, Westminster; he said he did not know the man's name, but he knew the shop; that he spent the rest of the money; one part he hired a horse with, and that the purse and ring were at his mother's, in Warwick-row, Pimlico. I went there, accompanied by him and Mr. Swallow, he went in, and whispered to his mother, she then produced the purse, and said the ring was given to some young woman, but she would get it. The prisoner said he gave the guineas to Mr. Rudd, a broker, in Pimlico, to change, who changed them at Wadmore's, the Magdalen, at Pimlico. He took me to the shop in the Broadway, where he bought the watch. I returned to his mother's in the evening, and found the hat and box, which I produce.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live at Pimlico. On the 19th or 20th of June the prisoner requested me to get some guineas changed - it was about a fortnight before he was apprehended. He asked me if I could give him change for three guineas, as his master was distressed for change, and he was going somewhere with goods, and wanted change. I said I had not sufficient. I went to Wadmore, who keeps a public-house, and got three 1 l. notes and three shillings, which I gave him - he waited in my shop. I told him I would get the change there.</p>

I immediately went up, found the door and window open, and a lamp, which I always leave when the child is abed, put out, and put under the bed - the door was on the latch before - it was always kept locked till the child was put to bed. This property was gone. I immediately called my husband up - he came, saw the state of the room, and concluded some one had got in unperceived, and put the things out of window. On the Saturday following the prisoner wanted to go away; I consented to her going on Sunday - she said she was going to her friends in Herefordshire, and on Sunday morning, when she left, I had her apprehended by two constables. My property was all produced on the Thursday following by Coates - it was worth above 10 l. She told me she was first going to Kensington Gravel-pits.</p>

            . I am a constable of Marylebone. On Sunday, the 6th of August, I was sent for to the prosecutor's, and watched the prisoner out of the house, thinking she was going to Kensington Gravel-pits, instead of which she went into a house in Oxford-buildings. She had a box with her - she came out without it. I apprehended her in a few minutes, took her back to the house, and told her I took her on suspicion of being concerned in robbing Mr. Shain, she declared her innocence. I then searched her box, and found two wine-glasses and some papers of tobacco. I took her to the watch-house, and on Monday morning she said to me,</p>
               <p>"Do you suppose Mrs. Shain will forgive me, if I inform her where her things are?" I said she might do as she pleased, I could not tell what Mrs. Shain might do. She then said if I would let her go close to Charing-cross she would fetch the box. I went with her and another constable to a house in a court in Villers-street. She took me up stairs to a room, unlocked the door with a key which she took from behind a partition; we found no box there - she appeared alarmed about what had become of it. The woman of the house came in, she asked her where the box was? she said,</p>
               <p>"I have sent it, according to your direction, to your mother's in Herefordshire - I have taken it to the Green Man and Still to go there." I took the prisoner to the Green Man and Still, and found a box had been sent on the day before, which was Sunday. I took the prisoner to Marlborough-street, and set off for Hereford. She gave me a direction; I wrote it down as I stood by her - I have lost it. She told me it was directed to

            . I live next door but one to Milburn. On the 30th of June I was cleaning the first-floor window; my father was passing, and said he believed some one was breaking into Milburn's house. I went, and found the garden-gate broken open - I also saw a window open. My father being lame, told me to get in at the window - I got in, and he stood outside. I saw the house had been rifled, and searched two rooms. I thought I heard a noise in the third room, went in, and heard a noise in the chimney. I called my father; he went to see that the person did not get out at the top. I put my hands up, laid hold of his leg, and pulled him down - it was the prisoner - I brought him out to my father through a door, which was open - he was secured. The drawers were open, and sooty marks on the linen.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to Aldous's to redeem a suit of clothes; I met with Cundell - he said,</p>
               <p>"If you have got money to spare here is a bargain." He took me to a public-house in Oxford-street, where two men had the clock. He asked me to pledge it - I said I would have nothing to do with it. He said,</p>
               <p>"It belongs to me, and if you pledge it for 4 l. 10 s. you shall have the ticket." He staid outside while I went in. They would only give me 4 l., I went out and told him. I went there again in about an hour; Cundle was there then, and had opened the clock for the shopman.</p>

I do not know where he took me to, but he took me to a public-house; I went in, and gave him a glass of liquor; I took my purse out, which had 1 s. 1 1/2 d., rolled in a 2 l. bank note in it. The coachman said I was a poor woman, and he would pay. I put my money into my bosom - the prisoners were in the house, and could see me put my purse there. I went out, intending to go to Islington to see a friend. Battley took me by the arms and held me while Andrews took my money. Battley whistled, and down came twelve or fourteen men - they used very improper expressions, and if I had been a girl of the town they could not have used me worse. I should know three or four of the others if I saw them - they all appeared to be hackney coachmen - they all ran away. I told the watchman, he said there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180012"/>were too many, he was afraid to go near them, and I had better make the best of my way to Bow-street, which I did; an officer came down with me, and found them at a watering-house. I pointed Andrews out, he refused to go, and Battley ran out of the place - Avery ran after him and secured him; he had then the marks of blood on his face where I had scratched him. They had used me terribly, and turned my clothes over my head.</p>

I got to the beginning of London about one or two o'clock - I believe it was at Whitechapel church; I had been to Sudbury for a week - this happened on Saturday; I had left town on Thursday, the day before the robbery. Before that I lived in St. Martin's work-house. I had four or five lodgings in the course of the month before.</p>
               <p>Q. You got to town at two o'clock, and reached the public-house at five, what were you doing for three hours - A. The coachman kept driving me about, and these men were with him part of the way; the coachman got into the coach with me, and one of them drove. I took the coach in Blue-cross-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields, as they tell me. I had been there on business.</p>

             Davis. These things were in the stable, which communicates with the kitchen. On the 8th of September the doors were all made fast - there was a broken pane in the stable window, through which a hand might be put, and the window unbuttoned. Three gentlemens' servants came to me about nine o'clock, I went to the stable with them, and found the bed, bolster, and pillow on the stairs, tied up ready to be taken away. They were kept in a room over the stable. I missed some blankets.</p>

            . I am porter to the Earl of Radnor. I saw the prisoner and another man standing at the corner of Mr. Davis's stables. I had known him by sight for twelve months. Lord Sidmouth's coachman asked them what they wanted - the prisoner said he belonged to the premises, and began to pump at the pump; the other man said he came to fetch some things of the prisoner's away. The coachman told him to convince him that he had a right there to come to the Burlington Arms, as the people were there who knew the premises; the prisoner went to the corner, but would not go in. He referred us to the Green Dragon, in Swallow-street, where he said his coat and hat were. We went there, he took his coat off the bench, and went out with it, but without his hat. We afterwards went to the front of the house to warn the people, and found the prisoner in custody.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Ramsay, of Conduit-street. I heard the prisoner talk to Holding, and confirm his statement - they left me, and went with the prisoner to the Green Dragon. I then went to my stable in the same mews; I afterwards came out, and saw the prisoner coming up the street, he saw me, and made into the Burlington Arms - he was without his hat, but had his coat on then. I followed him into the yard, and saw him get on the parapet wall, and into the prosecutor's stable window. I called to him, he said he was going to sleep there. I said good night, then procured five men and a light, placed three at the back of the house, and took two with me to the front, and found him at the bottom of the stairs. The property was tied up, and his hat laid by the side of them - he claimed the hat. He said Lady Rumbold's coachman gave him leave to sleep there.</p>

I called Meakins and Bailey to assist me, followed them up Crooked-lane, and at the top of the lane Bayley took Hawkins, I took Dawkers and Collier - Dawkers immediately struck me several times over the head, and made a great resistance.

               <p>"There are the two men, I can swear to them." He took Dawkers and I took Collier. Dawkers began to get resolute, and said if we did not let them go he would knock us down.

            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 28th of July the prisoner pledged a pair of bronze candlesticks with me for 1 l. I asked very particularly if they were his own, and if he ever sold any of the sort; he said Yes, and wanted to sell me them, but I would not purchase them, he said he was the maker, and had just set up, and at this season trade was bad; when he left I went to see if he had given me a right direction, and found no such person; he called in a few days with a very handsome pair, I told him he gave me a wrong direction last time, he said he had not. I said it was strange no one should know him; he persisted that he lived there, and said if I would call at five o'clock in the evening he should be at home, and would shew me what he had for sale, but in case he was not at home to ask for the name of Blabrook, and he would tell me where to find him; I thought he seemed to be correct, and went at five o'clock, but then no one knew him. I went about the street enquiring, and at last came to where Blabrook lived, he was not at home. I went at nine o'clock, and described the man to Blabrook he was in the bronze way, and said he worked with him; I told him the prisoner had offered me some goods, he seemed astonished, and said he had no doubt but he had them from his employer. I told him to tell his master to call upon me.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 1st of September I was in the Park - the Queen was coming down, and a great mob running by the side of her carriage. I suspected something would take place, and ran to the Horse Guards - three persons, whom I knew to be bad characters, surrounded the prosecutor, and tried to get his watch. I believe they saw me and went off. The prisoner immediately backed behind the gentleman; I saw him lift the pocket up with his left hand, take the spectacles out with his right, and put them in his right-hand pocket; I secured him, and took them out of his pocket. With assistance I took him to Mr. Cochrane.</p>

I stood on the opposite side, where there were very few people, and observed the prisoner at my right hand. The moment the Queen was getting into her carriage, I stepped into the road that I might not be in a crowd; the prisoner came behind me, snatched my watch out, and ran towards Oxford-street; I followed, crying Stop thief! and before we got to the end of Oxford-street Toole stopped him, I was close behind. In the scuffle he got himself towards Mr. Thomas's, the grocer; he then took the watch from part of his dress, and threw it down the area. I attempted to catch it, but it fell through the grating, the servant took it up and brought it to her master, it was mine. The prisoner had been taken into the shop to prevent his being rescued. Bond came and took him in charge, he then fell on his knees and begged forgiveness.</p>

The servant, and another woman or two, were dancing. Carthy went to light his pipe and dance with them, I believe. Two of the Irishmen jumped from their box when they saw Carthy going to dance, pitched into him, and gave him three or four blows - they were Callaghan and

I saw Carthy next day, he was trying to work; he complained of a clicking in his head where it was fractured. I went with him that morning to the doctor's in Wentworth-street, near George-court, and saw his wounds dressed; there were two or three wounds and a large fracture in the skull. I saw him again next day, with his head in a dreadful state. He asked me to go with him to have it dressed, but I could not bear it. The plaister had worked off, it appeared to be a large wound, as if done with the knob of a poker.</p>

               <p>MR. JESSOP. Q. You left the house in consequence of hearing that the Irish were coming to murder you - A. Yes, I left hastily. I saw Carthy running out after me. The deceased got worse and worse, he did not appear in a condition to go to a dance on the Sunday.</p>

I recollect Callaghan, and Mrs. Donovan there; Callaghan was dancing with some women, Carthy got up to go to the fire to light his pipe; he took hold of the servant, and said</p>
               <p>"Betty, we will have a step together;" Callaghan then struck him, and immediately another man who is not here, came out and struck him too, he did not return the blow, but was sitting down, and was immediately seized by several people, who said nothing but dragged him away into the back yard, they were then going out as fast as they could - they collared him and dragged him away as though he was a child, he was on his feet as long as I saw him; I went into the court and saw a quantity of people rushing through into New-court. I saw Garvin and Marney with bludgeons, beating Carthy. I did not notice any of the prisoners. I saw several women heaving brick bats towards the deceased. I stood there till they had pretty well killed him. I suppose there were forty or fifty, men, women, and children there. I do not remember seeing the prisoners in the court, they might have been there.</p>
               <p>Q. When you last saw the deceased, in what situation was he - A. Apparently dead, and all over in a gore of blood, he appeared to be wounded in the left side of his head.

            . I am a German, and an apothecary. On the 26th of July, I was assistant to Mr. Rogers, in Wentworth-street, Brick-lane, about twenty yards from the George, public-house, an Irishman was brought in wounded, between ten or eleven at night. I ordered a hairdresser to shave him; he could not do it, and so I did it myself; his wounds appeared dangerous; it was the same man that afterwards went into the hospital, they called him Jerry. I dressed his wounds in Fortesque's presence, the principal wound was in the side bone, on the right hand side of the skull, that was the most dangerous. I probed it, but could not say whether the skull was fractured. I attended him four or five days and told him to go into the hospital, but he would not. I thought by good care his wounds could be cured, but he came more than once intoxicated. I told him if he did not pay attention, he would die of his wounds; the principal one seemed to be done with a blunt iron; he was bruised all over; when he was dead, I felt that his skull was fractured, but before I could not tell that, as it was so swollen. I had told him not to work.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When he first came to you, did he appear drunk or sober - A.Drunk; he called on me on the Monday after the accident, without any dressing whatever on his wound; he said he could not keep them on; he mentioned nothing about any accident happening to him on Sunday.</p>
               <p>MR. JESSOP. Q. You told him to take care, or his wounds would he fatal - A. Yes, I told him to take the people up. Such a blow would occasion a man to appear intoxicated, but he smelt of gin. There was no appearance of a new injury on the Monday.</p>

            . I am a pupil at the London Hospital. On the 28th of July, the deceased was admitted as a patient; the principal wound was on the left side of the head; he had a very trifling one on the back of his head. A small quantity of hair round the wound had been shaven off, they appeared to be inflicted by some weapon. I suppose they had been inflicted several days; the inflammation on the skin had subsided very much; the wound was closing. I probed it, there was a very trifling fracture of the external table of the skull, but it had rose again, there was a circular fissure but it was not depressed. In consequence of the wound an inflammation had taken place in the brain, which caused his death; but probably the inflammation would not have been so severe if he had not continually drank, but there would be no inflammation had it not been for the wound; the brain was injured both by the depression and inflammation, the blow naturally produced inflammation, and intemperance afterward would increase it. Intemperance would not occasion the inflammation if it was not for the blow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The skull was not depressed when you saw it - A. No. I suppose it had been, on account of the fracture all round; the diameter was about the size of a sixpence. The inflammation might be much aggravated by intoxication. If he had proper attention, and was kept sober, he probably might have recovered.</p>
               <p>MR. JESSOP. Q. He was in the hospital from the 28th of July, till the 4th of August, during that time there was no intemperance - A. Certainly not. I do not think the wound would have caused the death of the most temperate man, he was intoxicated when he came to the hospital, the wound might have been healed with proper attention, it was very slight; the fracture did not press on the brain, it was the pressure of the matter that caused his death, the accident was the existing cause, no doubt. I ascribe the inflammation to the wound.</p>
               <p>MR. JUSTICE BEST. Q. Suppose the man to have received the blow and lived temperately, and not had surgical assistance, do you think the blow would have caused his death - A. The blow of itself would certainly have killed him, if he had no had surgical assistance.</p>

            . I have kept the George since the 3d of July. I have been eight years in the business. I was at home until about seven o'clock, I then went into the City; the deceased had been working for me several days before. My wife sent for me, when I came home I found Carthy standing at the door of the taproom, it was about nine o'clock. I believe he was alone in the house, as the doors had been shut; I remonstrated with him for getting tipsy, saying, I supposed he had caused the quarrel, he said he had not, and immediately left the house - he was very tipsy then. I had refused to serve him about five o'clock in the afternoon; he was drunk the whole of the next day with his friends, and on the Saturday he came and blocked up a door-way for me, he had been drinking then. On the Monday or Tuesday following, when I got up, I found him at my door, he said he had been up all night, and went to sleep upon my table.</p>
               <p>MR. JESSOP. Q. Did you see the last witness at your house that night - A. No, I think Callaghan was there. I had seen the deceased ten days before that, he had two black eyes, and his temple was cut.</p>
               <p>MARY M'KENNEDY. I knew the deceased. On the Sunday after this row, I danced with him, there was a large party, more than three dozen - there was a piper, it was in George-yard, New-court, the floor give way under us, and we all fell into the cellar, Carthy fell - I saw him when he came out of the cellar, and I asked him if he felt hurt, he said Yes, in his head a little - the dance lasted three hours.</p>
               <p>MR. JESSOP. Q. You danced with him three hours - A. Yes. We took it by turns. He brought the piper into the court.</p>

I picked him up - his nose bled, I took him into the George, and asked him what he would have to drink, he said he could bear nothing, that his head and his heart were bruised, and he should never get over it.</p>

            , a Barrister, of Lincoln's Inn. I saw Mr. Curtis at the corner of Clement's-lane, the prisoner and two others were close by him in the lane, I perceived something red come from Mr. Curtis's pocket; it was taken by the prisoner or his companions - I saw it pass from one to the other. All three turned down Lombard-street, and Mr. Curtis crossed, I went to him, and told him that his pocket-book was taken, seeing it was something red; he felt, and missed his spectacles. I went after them, and laid hold of the prisoner, the other two went off. I saw the prisoner looking at what had been taken, which was in the hands of the other two. I told the prisoner he had been picking a gentleman's pocket, and by that time Mr. Curtis came up. I delivered him to Mr. Curtis, and went after the others, but lost them. I took the prisoner to the Mansion House.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner said he knew nothing about it - A. He did. I saw them speaking to him before and after the robbery, and all three walked away very leisurely. It was imposible for one not to know what the other was doing.</p>

I thought I could have reached the door-post, to have drawn myself into the shop, and tried all I could to do so, but they prevented me. I found my arms raised up, and several of them were close round me. About this time I felt somebody pulling at my watch - I was desirous of getting my hand down to prevent its going. The tugging still continued, and I saw by the muscles of the person's face that he was doing it with great force, I then felt it go; and the next moment the party who drew the watch out turned round and quitted.</p>
               <p>Q. How many do you suppose there were - A. I was much alarmed, and unable to count them, but suppose there were twenty or more. They threw themselves into the crowd, so as not to leave me altogether, by which means they concealed each other from my view - they ran away. I could only see the shoulders of two or three of them. I instantly walked into the shop and told of my robbery, and while I was so doing Taylor came in, and threw my pocket-book on the counter - till then I did not know that I had lost it, I then felt, missed it from my inside coat-pocket, and knew it to be mine - nothing had been taken out. I have never recovered my watch; it was worth 35 l. with its appendages. The pocket-book contained a receipt for 287 l. 10 s., which I was carrying to my banker's, to receive the money that day - it was to be paid on the production of that receipt; there were also seven 1 l. notes and some loose papers. I lost my purse from my right-hand breeches pocket, with 15 s. in it. I have no knowledge of the prisoners, they were both apprehended in about a minute after, Taylor produced the pocket-book. It happened between eleven and twelve o'clock, just as Sheriff Parkins's carriage was going by with the procession.</p>

            . I am an officer of St. James's, Clerkenwell. On the 15th of August, as the City were going up with their address to the Queen, I was on the alert with other officers, and took particular notice of a gang and followed them from the corner of Bridge-street, Fleet-street, as I knew several of them. I saw them what they call ramping every gentleman as they went on. They kept rather a-head of the Sheriffs' carriage; they kept the foot pavement to themselves. When they came to the end of Southampton-street I heard Mr. Middleton cry out</p>
               <p>"The scoundrel has got my watch!" I was then in the middle of the road close to the Sheriffs' horses. Mr. Middleton was surrounded by them. I saw them all in a cluster together. I think he was dragged off the foot pavement. I made an effort to get to assist Colton, who was with me - he had got hold of the person who robbed Mr. Middleton. As I was forcing my way in I saw a pocket-book come from a man, who, to all appearance, was Hopkins; he said,</p>
               <p>"Here, take it!" - it was thrown up above the height of a man. To the best of my knowledge it was Hopkins - it was not the man whom Colton had hold of, but to the best of my judgment the prisoner is the man, but I will not swear it. The book fell down, and I scrambled in among them and picked it up - the person it was meant for missed it. I was making my way out from them, and they sung out</p>
               <p>"Chiv him!" which means to use their knives. I got a cut over the knuckle, my hand was all over blood. I then got the pocket-book into my breast. Two or three persons said the gentleman was in the shop, I went in and found the prosecutor there. He described the contents, it was returned to me, I have had it ever since. I then found Smith in custody of Colton and Gook, we took him to Bow-street, and got him secured, we then went after Hopkins, and found him at Kensington with the same gang, opposite the Sheriff's coach. I pointed him out to Gook, and said,</p>
               <p>"That is the man." As soon as he saw me he kept dropping out of the gang. I said</p>
               <p>"I think he wants to be off" - we went into the mob and took him, he was walking away very quick. I told him what it was for, he said he knew nothing of it, and was not there. We found nothing on him, and took him him to Bow-street. I did not see him with the gang till we came to Kensington, as I did not get up with the head of the gang till then, but we overtook them about Knights-bridge, they were then keeping at the head of the Sheriff's carriage.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What time did you first see the Sheriff's carriage at Bridge-street - A. I should think between ten and eleven. The gang kept in a body by themselves.</p>

            . I am a broker. I was in company with Taylor before the procession came - we went into Fleet-street, and saw the gang waiting; we proceeded on to Southampton-street - I kept my eye on them. I saw them lay hold of a gentleman about the middle of the Strand, who escaped from them. I then told Taylor to be on his guard, and in about two minutes I observed they had got a gentleman up in the corner, it was Mr. Middleton. There was a board round a house which was repairing, which obliged persons to pass out of the great path; they got the gentleman in the corner, on the footpath; I pushed in among them, and heard one of them say,</p>
               <p>"D - n you, do you mean to rob me?" and trying to get the pocket-book into his side-pocket - it was the prosecutor's book. The man put it into his pocket as if he was in danger - it was neither of the prisoners. There were twenty-five or twenty-six in the gang, as near as I can tell, and were all young men, and many of them genteelly dressed. The man could not get the book into his pocket, being rather thick, he put it under his arm. I collared and held him, he lifted up his arm to strike me, and then the book fell. I was struck, knocked down several times, and got injured. What became of the book I do not know. The corner was rather clear for a short time. After I got out I went in pursuit of Smith - I am sure he was among the gang. I did not notice the prisoner, Hopkins. - I got hold of Smith as he went on, he was about the last of the gang. I got him down Cecil-street - all the rest of the gang immediately came down to rescue him, and cried out,</p>
               <p>"Chiv him." Several of them who knew me before pointed to me. I had a pistol of Taylor's, and with that I kept them off, detained Smith, and took him away, with assistance, to Bow-street. The gang all left. I am positive I had seen Smith endeavouring to prevent the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180021"/>prosecutor from getting into the shop. We afterwards followed, and got up with the gang about the half-way house, they were then rather before the Sheriff's carriage - Taylor pointed Hopkins out, he immediately dropped back, slackened his pace, and separated himself from the gang. Taylor seized him, and gave him to Gook.</p>

            . I am a constable. I met the procession opposite Somerset House, and saw the prosecutor at the time, the gang surrounded him; I saw Smith keeping them up with his shoulders as they surrounded the prosecutor. I saw the prosecutor's coat turned up, but did not see the pocket-book taken out; he was close to the prosecutor - one man was half between them, and he was keeping that man up to Mr. Middleton, who called out,</p>
               <p>"You have got my watch, you rascal;" or words to that effect. I then heard a cry of he has got the book. I saw Colton knocked down in the mob, and ran to his assistance - there was a call of Stop him! Stop him. I saw Smith running round the board from where he had been, I ran round a waggon, and caught him as he ran away. The gang were rather behind him in a body, when I took him. Considerable resistance was made, but Colton had recovered, pulled out a pistol, and they left - we secured him. I went on to Kensington, and took Hopkins, whom Taylor pointed out. I had not observed him.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the gang opposite Somerset House, and afterwards saw them surround the prosecutor - Smith was one of the gang. I saw him before the prosecutor was attacked. I did not see Hopkins, except at Kensington, he then shrunk back from the gang.</p>

I know nothing of Hopkins, and never saw him before.</p>

On the 17th of June the prisoner applied to me to purchase iron for a Mr. Dover, who he said, was a friend of his, stating him to be a respectable builder at Whaddon. and that it was to finish a house; when he first came he could not give a proper description of the goods, but afterwards produced this order (read.)</p>
               <p>"Mr. Mott, Salesman, Leadenhall-market, I received your letter on Saturday, ten bundles of double steel iron, eighteen inches wide, ten bundles of single from twelve to twenty wide, ten bundles of best plate iron, all different tiles; they will know at the yard. The plate iron is not restricted to width - I remain, yours,</p>

               <p>P. S. Mr. Cross is in town, and will bring it down. You will buy it in Newgate-market. Please to send the hats back.</p>
               <p>He gave me a bill of exchange to pay for the iron, I produced it; I asked who he was, and where Mr. Mott lived, he said he himself was Mr. Mott, the poulterer, of Leadenhall-market, and that the acceptor was a respectable builder at Whaddon. On his saying he was Mr. Mott the poulterer, of Leadenhall-market, I then said</p>
               <p>"You supply some of my friends with poultry," naming Messrs. Randull and Souter; he said</p>

               <p>"yes, I have supplied them for years." On that I was perfectly satisfied of the bill being good, it being the bill of Mr. Mott, and let him have the iron to the amount of 20 l. or 30 l. this is the bill he gave me; (producing it, read.) He sent a cart down for the iron, I did not see it taken away. I saw it afterwards at an auction room, and knew it to be the same I sold him; I think it was moved from my warehouse on Monday, the 19th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180022"/>or 20th. The prisoner said they were going to an inn to be sent down to Whaddon; I saw them at the auction-room on the following Thursday, I think. I have enquired, and find the prisoner's name is Mott, but not of Leadenhall-market.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. He did not ask for the difference of the bill - A. I think the iron came to more than 50 l. but I do not know the amount of it.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you said it was 20 l. or 30 l. - A. That is as near as I can guess, but I think it was more than 50 l. he said Dover was a friend of his, and he had an order from Mr. Dover to execute for the building for which Mr. Mott was to pay. I did not take the bill to Mr. Mott of Leadenhall-market. The prisoner particularly stated that he supplied the friends whose names I mentioned.</p>

               <p>Q. On your oath did you not tell Bailey you gave the prisoner this bill to get discounted for pork, but as he passed it for iron, he might take the consequence - A. No, I did not; I had no such conversation with him or Mr. Richardson. Bailey came to me and said, I am come concerning Mott, he is in the Compter about a bill, and if you do not go to him it will play hell with him. I said, I know nothing about the bill.

I went to Dover, and asked him to come forward concerning the bill of Motts', he said he had authorised the prisoner to part with that bill for pork, but not for iron.

               <p>COURT. Q. Have you received more than two letters from him - A. No, it was more than two years ago, the last is dated 27th March, 1818. I have not seen him write since that.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the post-mark on that letter - A. I cannot discern it, it came by the post. I did not preserve them, but when Mott was apprehended, I looked among my papers and found them, I looked at them to refresh my memory.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it Dover talked to you about them - A. About half or three-quarters of a year ago, when he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180023"/>wanted something for selling the goods, I allowed him 9 s. I think.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had not seen these letters, but spoke from your memory of a year and three quarters ago, could you undertake to swear as to your belief of his hand writing - A. Yes; I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live - A. In Charles-street, Commercial-road, I left Old Montague-street last week. I mentioned Old Montague-street, because the letters were directed to me there. Dover said the bill he gave to Mott was to be laid out in pork and not in iron.</p>

The Queen's carriage passed by, and there was a great rush, which carried everybody before it - at that instant I felt a violent snatch at my chain, I felt my watch rise in my fob, the chain broke or was cut, and the seal and key taken away. The prisoner was close to me at that moment, and he ran away as well as he was able, stooping down. I endeavoured to lay hold of the flap of his coat, but he slipped by me. I followed him about twenty yards, then seized him, and charged him with stealing my seal. I was within a yard and a half of him at the time. He said he had not got it. I shook him, and at that instant saw him fumbling about with his hands. I seized his hand, and the seal, key, and part of the chain dropped from it, I picked it up. He said he would not go with me. Several bad characters came round, and with the assistance of two persons I secured him. It was impossible any one but him could have done it. Some fellows behind him, said,</p>

On the 15th of August, between nine and ten o'clock at night, the prisoner came and asked for a ready-made shirt, I shewed him two, he selected one which came to 9 s., he also bought a pair of stockings for 2 s., and gave me a 1 l. note. I asked his address - Norbury and another boy were in the shop with me. He gave his name</p>
               <p>"Reeves, No. 2, Lisson-green, Paddington" - I am certain of it; I asked him twice - Norbury wrote the address on the back of it. I had plenty of change, but suspecting the note, I sent Norbury out for change. The prisoner remained in the shop; and while the boy was gone my husband came in, and asked what the man was waiting for? I said he was waiting for change, and that I had sent the boy for it. Mr. Byers gave me 9 s. from his pocket, which I gave to the prisoner. I told Mr. Byers I thought the note was not good, but he said,</p>
               <p>"It is good; I have seen it." The prisoner was near enough to hear it; he then went away. The boy returned in a few minutes and said it was bad; my husband immediately sat off up the street, brought the prisoner back, and asked him where he got the note? he said he took it of a higgler for fowls, at the Red Lion, Paddington. He was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You took the note of the prisoner - A. Yes, and gave it to Norbury, who immediately wrote on it - it was not out of my sight till he wrote on it.

            . I am an officer. On the 15th of August I apprehended the prisoner at Mr. Byers's shop, and found three duplicates on him, but no money. Seeing the name of Reeves on the note, I asked him if his name was not Lee? as I knew him before, he said it was. I asked him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180026"/>if he lived at No. 2, Lisson-green? he said he did not, but he had lodged there the night before. I asked at what place, Lisson-green? he said by Lisson-green. I asked the name of the street? he said he did not know. I said there were several streets about Lisson-green, and asked if he was sure it was No. 2? he said it was No. 2, but he could not tell the name of the street. I asked who kept the house? he said Dunford. I took him in charge. On the following morning I went to Lisson-green, and enquired at the neighbouring houses for such a place as No. 2, Lisson-green, but could not find any such place. I found a woman named Dunford, at No. 14, Little James-street, Lisson-green, but could learn nothing of the prisoner.</p>

I have lived half a mile from Lisson-green for nine or ten years. All the streets about there are called such a street, Lisson-green.</p>

I asked the prisoner to wait till my master came in, which she did - a customer was in the shop. I laid the note on the desk by itself. Roberts came in in two or three minutes, I gave him the note, he gave her the change, and she went away. After she was gone he made an observation of the note, and asked which way she went, I told him and he went out, brought her back in about five minutes, and asked her to wait while he went and enquired about the note, which she did. He went out - a gentleman came in, and while I was waiting on him she went away - Roberts returned in about five minutes, and fetched her back. He took up the note she gave me.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. King. On the 24th of June I found the prisoner in the shop, the boy said she was waiting for change, and the note was on the desk - she was near enough to hear him. I took it up, and gave her 15 s. 6 d., without particularly looking at it. After the prisoner left I examined it more minutely, and thought it bad. I went out, overtook her in Newport-street, and brought her back. I told her I wanted her address, she returned to give it me. When we got to the shop I asked her if she had any more money, and she offered me a good note. I left that on the desk, and told her to wait while I enquired further about the other, and asked where she got the first one? she said her husband took it for his wages. I went to Mr. Thomas two doors off. In consequence of what I heard there I returned and found her gone - the good note was not there either. I went in pursuit, and overtook her, walking pretty quick across Bedford-street to Maiden-lane, brought her back, and gave her in charge. I just put J. R. on the note, and before I parted with it I marked S. M. C. for St. Martin's-court, and put it in my pocket - (looks at it) - this is it. I saw 15 s. 6 d. found on her, which I had given her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You put it in your pocket with one or two others - A. No, when I take a good note I put it in my fob, I put this by itself.</p>

            , No. 1, Castle-street. The prisoner came to our shop on the 24th of June, and bought a piece of nankeen for 7 s. 9 d. - she gave me a 1 l. Bank note, and I gave her change. I looked at the note and noticed the signature, C. Watts, on it - I then put it it in my till, after making a slit under the letter L. I am sure she is the woman. A young man who lives with me put another note on the top of it - I saw him do it. We had occasion, about a quarter of an hour afterwards, to take this note out of the till, I knew it directly to be the one she gave. In consequence of Roberts's coming, I went to his shop, saw her, and desired<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180027"/>she should be detained till I returned for the note. I fetched it - (looks at one) - this is it; I am certain it has my mark on it. Our shop is next door but one to King's. I saw her there in a quarter of an hour, or less, after she had been in our shop. She was not there when I first went in - I returned, and found her in custody, I then asked her what became of my goods she bought and the silver? she said she did not know anything about me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not specify nankeen to her - A. I do not think I did. I cannot say there was no other note in the till signed Watts, but swear that is the note I took of her, by the slit which I made in it.</p>

I was in the habit of working for her and her husband, and one day, when I brought some work home, two women were there, one of whom bought two small mattresses, and the other some chairs - it was about ten weeks ago. She desired me to sit down till she had done with them. I was in the habit of working for the woman who bought the chairs - I have seen her in Giltspur-street Compter this morning.

I was asking the prisoner how he came to give me a bad note; he said he did not know it was bad; he was standing where I left him; he walked away from me; he said he received it of one Mr. Smith, down High-street, and would go and fetch the man who gave it him.

            , on Sunday last I went down to Seven Oaks in company with Goodhall, with whom I had been working at harvest work as a labouring man. We went down for the purpose of enlisting as substitutes in the Militia, and on the Monday following, we met the Serjeant of the Militia, at the Crown-inn, and I received 2 l. 10 s. from the Serjeant upon enlisting, as the bounty money.

Goodhall and the other men waited for me by St. Giles's Church, and when I joined them again I gave the young man 15 s. and Goodall 3 s. and the duplicate, and the young man then went away, and in about a quarter of an hour afterwards he met me and Goodall at a public-house, by appointment. I and the young man and his companion, then went to St. James's Park, where Goodall joined us, and the young man took the notes out of his pocket and wrote on one of them which he gave me, the other two were put in my snuff-box, which Goodhall took into his possession, and then went to Mr. Giles's shop, and offered the 1 l. forged note, when I was taken into custody.

I immediately said to him, there has been several bad notes passed this morning, and I am not the proper<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180029"/>salesman, if this is bad I shall get into disgrace. I then called Holden, the proper salesman - I was supplying his place. He came on board, I passed the note to him. I said in his presence, that the man wanted half a bushel of oysters, and had brought this note; he said that it was a bad one, for it looked very much like the others he had taken that morning; he had taken three before, and being backed with red ink as the others were; he left me to supply his place in order to go to the Bank; I believe the man went with him, but I did not move from my place.</p>

This was Wednesday, I think. He said he kept the note in his possession till he offered it for the oysters. He distinctly stated he did not know the person's name who gave it to him, nor where he lived, but it was in the neighbourhood of Long-lane. I asked where he sold oysters, he said no where particularly. I said,</p>

The prisoner's mother dealt with me, she lived in Bedford-street, Liquorpond-street - she left off dealing with me in May last; about ten days after the prisoner came and asked if I would trust her mother with a pint of beer - she had the beer, came several times after, and ran up a score of about 5 s., which, I believe, she paid in silver. She afterwards ran up another score of 7 s. or 8 s. and tendered a 1 l. note for it, either to me or my wife - change was given to her. About a week after she came and asked me to change her mother a 1 l. note, which I did. I omitted to mark one of them. This note (looking at it), No. 1250, is one of them I am certain. She afterwards came again, asked what her mother's scores were, and said her mother would either come or send in the evening. I told her what it was, she came that day and gave me a note. I gave her change - (looking at it) - this is it, No. 12134. I wrote Mrs. Burnham on it. I paid it away that night to Messrs. Barclays' clerk - it was afterwards returned to me as forged. I went to her mother, but could not find the prisoner. About three days after she came again, asked what her mother's score was, and said her mother would either send or come herself. I asked if she recollected changing a note at my house a few days ago, and asked if it was her note or her mother's - she said her mother's, and that it was her mother's score that was on my book. I asked what she meant by telling me such a lie, and took her to Hatton-garden.</p>

On the 27th of July, about five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my shop, and asked to see some wedding rings. I handed her three cards containing six gold rings each. On turning to shut the sash, I observed she had taken the six rings off one card, sat down, and shot all six into her lap - she had taken her gloves off. I observed a gilt ring, and a paste half-hoop on her hand, both on the same finger - she took them off, and fitted one of my gold rings on - one of them fitted her. She asked the price of putting a posey to it, and said she would write it. I gave her some paper, and she wrote</p>
               <p>"Love till death." She put six rings on the card, laying them loosely altogether. She then took up a second card of broader rings, and said that she should like a broader one - it was not for herself, but a young friend. On her taking up that card I begged of her to allow me to detach them, as I had observed her detach the others in an unpleasant way. I had observed that she had mixed her gilt ring with my gold ones. She paid no attention to me, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180031"/>stripped them off into her lap, and kept fitting them on her finger one after another, and at the same time asked me what I would take to mount the paste ring in fine gold, and if I would shew her some patterns; which I declined doing at that moment. I withdrew the third card, and laid it on the back counter - they had not been touched. She gathered the rings upon her lap, and put them on the second card as before, saying that none of them fitted her, and observing I had withdrew the third card, she wished to see it. I then told her there was one exchanged on the first card, and that one was missing from the second. I had only put the rings on the cards on the Friday preceding, and I am certain there was no gilt ring upon it when I handed it to her - it could not miss my eye for a moment if it had been so - it would be as conspicious to the eye of a jeweller, as black from white. I am also certain, no gilt ring was on the second. Miss Ballard was in the shop purchasing a ring, before she came in, and remained there - she did not touch either of the cards. The prisoner, as though not regarding what I had said about the ring being missed, put her hand into her basket, and took out of her handkerchief a 1 l. note making no reply to what I had said. At this moment another Lady came in, and wished to see some pearl and amethyst rings. I shewed her three, neither of them were the size - I begged her to call again on her requesting to see the tray, as I was particularly engaged at that time, and the prisoner said she could not wait. I have not seen that lady since. On her withdrawing she took the prisoner's basket; she had got to the door when the prisoner turned round, and said</p>
               <p>"Ma'am you have taken my basket!" - she returned the basket. The prisoner then went to the counter, and said if I would take ten shillings worth of halfpence, she would call again in a few moments - that was for the ring which fitted her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give any reason why you was to take halfpence - A. Not the slightest. I told her I must consider that a mere pretence for leaving the shop, for there was a ringmissing, and I thought as she had a 1 l. note, the best way would be for her to pay for it, and leave the shop. She said she did not know any thing about a ring being missing, and she certainly did not take it. I said if she wished me to consider her a customer, she should pay for the ring - as she had a note, and I had plenty of change. She said, she did not wish me to think she came to steal a ring - she would pay for the ring. I gave her 10 s. out of a 1 l. note. I then endeavoured to convince her there was a ring missing, by delivering her that which fitted her, and shewing her there were but four in the card. She said she had not taken it - I said I had no proof of that, and was alone in the house, and could get no proof of it; otherwise I did not doubt, but I should find it on her. I requested her to leave the shop - she said she had no objection to be searched, if I thought she had got it. I said I had no one to search her, and desired her to leave - she said I had grossly insulted her, and her husband should come and see her righted. I understood her husband's name was Collinson - I saw him at the Mansion-house, and found it was Borrenstein.</p>

               <p>Q. She said her husband should see her righted - A. Yes, I begged her not to interrupt me in my business and leave - I would put up with the loss. She then began to be violent, saying it was a shame I should charge her with taking a ring. I begged Miss Ballard to call in Mr. Nicholson, a neighbour - he came immediately, and said I had better let her go about her business. I said she insisted on being searched - she then said to him, that she wished to be searched - I believe she had loosened part of her dress; she came forward, and said Mr. Mott accuses me of taking a ring, and putting her hand upon the counter placed a gilt ring there, and said</p>
               <p>"Here is the ring." I am confident that before that there was no ring upon the counter - I then found it was a gilt one, and said</p>
               <p>"Ma'am this is not the ring, this is a gilt one" - that was a second gilt ring. I had no gilt rings near that spot. I have only a few in the shop, and they are very old, and are kept upon a wire in a drawer. I am certain that ring was not upon either of the cards in her possession - I had shewn her none. Mr. Nicholson then said I had been robbed and swindled too, and advised me to charge an officer with her, which I did. The officer proposed that Miss Ballard should search her; she went backward with her for that purpose - they returned, and Miss. Ballard said she believed she had nothing about her - the officer took her away. I think she first said she lived at Hackney, or that her friends lived there. She afterwards mentioned Blackfriars-road, and at the Compter she said John-street Blackfriars-road - I found she lodged there, and that her husband was a journeyman printer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. How many persons serve in your shop - A. One lad besides myself - I have had no servant this two or three months. Before this I had not shown those rings after they were carded.</p>
               <p>Q. She came as any other lady would - A. Yes, it was unusual for a lady to take them off the card, four of them might have been tried without detaching them. When she laid the rings upon the first card, there were still six, but one was a gilt one - she had put the one which fitted her upon the card with the others, and I put it aside. I wanted her to leave, but she continued to express her indignation at the charge.</p>
               <p>Q. She insisted on being attended to before the lady who came - A. I requested her to wait and she consented, but in a minute or two said she would not wait.</p>
               <p>Q. She might have kept a ring by mistake - A. That could not be, because a second was missing.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPLUS. Q. The first card had six rings, all gold - A. Yes; and she returned me but five gold and a metal one; and on the second card only five were returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she wish to be searched until the lady had left the shop - A. No, that lady had stood close to her side, their clothes might touch; the counter is about eighteen feet long. A metal ring was produced at the office as one found on her. This made a third metal ring.</p>

            . I live in Baker's-buildings, Old Bedlam; I was in Mr. Mott's shop when the prisoner came in, I did not particularly direct my attention to her, but to the best of my recollection, she sat herself down in a chair by the counter, and asked for a wedding-ring for a friend of hers, who was going to be married. Mr. Mott<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180032"/>took three cards from the window and handed her two, she took the rings off the card into her lap, I think she slipped both cards and put them in her lap together, but my attention was not particularly fixed on her. When Mr. Mott said he missed a ring, she said she did not take it, and the ring she fixed on she would pay for; she took a 1 l. note out of a handkerchief, and said she would go and fetch 10 s. worth of half-pence; that she was going to get it a little way from his shop, and would be back soon. Mr. Mott said he had plenty of silver, and would accommodate her with change. A lady came in and asked to see a ring which was in the window, it did not fit her. Mr. Mott said he should have a variety to-morrow, and as she was going out she took up the prisoner's basket, when she got to the door, the prisoner observed it - she had not been in the shop above ten minutes, and stood next to the prisoner - the prisoner got her basket again. Mr. Mott immediately said he missed two gold rings, and two base ones were substituted for them; she said she did not take them, and it was unknown to her, and requested to be searched. Mr. Mott said he had no female in the house. I afterwards assisted in searching her. I found nothing on her, and she was afterwards given in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She denied it, and behaved as an innocent woman would - A. Certainly. She took her gown and stays off, and shook them; I did not touch her clothes, nor did the maid who was with me.</p>

            . I am a constable; I took the prisoner to the Compter in a coach with Mr. Mott; I found a metal ring in the palm of her hand, in her glove, besides a gold and paste one, which she had on her finger. She was endeavouring to shuffle it down.</p>
               <p>MR. MOTT. I missed the gold ring, and found a metal one substituted for it before the other woman came into the shop; I missed one from the second card; I could not mistake them for gold rings for a moment, one is rather broader, which matches the second card, but it could not impose on a tradesman for a moment. The other woman did not touch the cards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I hope you will take my much injured case into your consideration. I went with intent to purchase a wedding ring, having unfortunately lost my own. I met my father in Old-street-road, on the Saturday before, and told him of the accident, he expressed his sorrow, and it being too late, and not being provided with sufficient money, he said I had better leave it till next week, and I bought a gilt ring as a substitute. On the following week, as I was going to my father's at Hackney, I called at the shop of Mr. Mott, when this unfortunate circumstance took place. I hope you will be satisfied I am not a person of that description.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's brother-in-law. On Saturday, the 10th of June, I was at his house, and saw Madden in the passage, nearly opposite the bar, alone - I saw him outside a minute or two after, in company with the other prisoners and another man, coming towards the house, and were about sixteen doors off. The three men came into the house - Callaghan stopped behind, and the men went into the taproom, I still stood at the door. Callaghan walked to and fro, then came in, stood in the same place where I first saw them together. I went into the taproom, and observed the men had got some beer and change. In about two minutes Callaghan came in and went to the bar. I went and observed her give the prosecutrix a note and pull a bottle out of her pocket - she was served and had her change given to her, and as she was taking up her change Madden came and stood at the taproom door, which is on a line with the bar - he could see what passed in the bar. When Madden observed her taking up her change, he said to the other two men,</p>
               <p>"Come, I am not going to wait any longer," and all went out in company together, the three men and Callaghan.</p>
               <p>Q. On the next Saturday was you there - A. Yes, I saw Madden in the yard; it had just turned four o'clock. I was going in to tell my sister, and just as I was going to speak to her I saw Newnam present a 1 l. note (I had discovered the first note to be a bad one) - Madden at that time stood on the back-door step, and could see what Newnam did at the bar. My sister said</p>
               <p>"This is a bad note, I shan't give you change or the note either." He was going to turn from the bar and I seized him - Madden was then on the step; I do not know what became of him. I gave Newnam in charge of one Wood, while I fetched Penfold. I went with him and Newnam, and as we went along, at the back of the house, I saw Madden and Callaghan in Gun-lane, looking at us on the opposite side of the way - Wood secured them in consequence of what I said. Madden said he was no thief, and where I wished him to go he would. He took a few halfpence out of his pocket, and began playing with them; he then fumbled in his fob, and took out a piece of paper, rumpled it up, and put it into his mouth. I could only see that it was paper. I immediately told Penfold I suspected he had swallowed a note - he throttled him, but he resisted, Callaghan struck Penfold, and he swallowed it. He said it was tobacco, but there was no appearance in his mouth of his chewing tobacco, for we made him open his mouth. I told him it was a note, he said I was a liar. I told Newnam he was at the shop on the Saturday before, he said he was not.</p>

I opened his mouth, but he had got it in his throat. He made a blow at me, and said he should like to give me a thrashing. I collared and struck him, and told him not to offer to strike me.

            . I am a constable of Limehouse. I assisted in taking the prisoners to the watch-house, and searched them there. I found a pint bottle on Callaghan; on Madden I found a good note and about 3 s. I partially searched them then, and secured them in the lock-up room. About nine o'clock I went to the watch-house, brought them from the lock-up room, and searched them again, but found nothing on them; but on searching a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180034"/>cast-iron privy in the lock-up room, it has a pipe leading to the drain, and on looking in there I discovered a parcel of particles of Bank notes in the bason of the privy, torn up and scattered. I collected them, with another officer, and pasted them together on a paper - they made three notes. I marked some, and Lines marked the others - (looks at them) - here are some which I marked.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MADDEN. Q. Did you not search every pocket I had - A. I believe I did. Nobody but the prisoners had had access to the privy. I only partially searched them, being a young officer I had not experience.</p>
               <p>JOHN LINES. I am beadle of Limehouse. I saw the iron privy at the watch-house cleared out on the 17th of June - nothing was left in the bason or tube. Nobody had access to it afterwards but the two male prisoners. When they were put in I informed them there was a privy. I returned and asked Madden where he resided? he said at his father's, in White Lion-court, Bermondsey-street. I went there and found his father, but Madden did not live there. About nine o'clock in the evening of the 17th I searched the privy, and found several pieces of Bank notes - they appeared quite new. I marked some and Vinee the rest - (looking at them) - here are some which I marked. The privy was cleaned about three hours before the prisoners were put there.</p>

I live in Maiden-lane; I bought a horse of Howe on Monday the 24th of July, to slaughter, he brought it to me, it was in a very poor condition, and fit for nothing but slaughter, and appeared completely worn out, and had been fired all round; it died before I got it into the slaughter-house. The prosecutor saw it, and claimed it.</p>

I came into the shop; Kemp was there then, he left as soon as Miss Bean gave him his change. She gave the note to her father, and he, almost immediately, said it was bad.

I said he must go with me, he wished to see my authority, I produced my staff; he said that would not do if I had no warrant. I said I should take him, and advanced towards him, he drew back about a yard from me, and pulled a pistol from his waistcoat, which was cocked, primed, and loaded with ball. I seized it; drawing my cutlass, and he surrendered. As I was taking him to the office, he said if I would not mention any thing to the magistrate concerning the pistol, he would tell me where to get plenty of forged notes. I said I certainly should mention it. I found another large pistol at his place, cocked and loaded.</p>

The bobbins were marked with Mr. Lawrence's name, or initials; the silk was wound round them. I saw him next day as I returned from town; I overtook him with a man who was much intoxicated. I had him apprehended, and next day in consequence of information, got a search warrant, and went to the prisoner's house in Angel-alley, with Mr. Lawrence and Matthews, while they were up stairs I found one of the bobbins below among the ashes; it was cut up, and partly burnt, and had Mr. Lawrence's name on it. Those I delivered to Cullen were of a similar description; they all came down stairs. I charged the prisoner's wife, in his presence, with burning part of the bobbins; she admitted it. Some more were produced.</p>

I and the officer went up stairs, leaving Dean below; we found the door open, and in the top room found the prisoner winding silk on one of my bobbins. I picked another off the floor, and asked if he knew the name on it; he said he did not. Matthews asked what he had done with the silk that was on the bobbins, and after some hesitation he said he had taken it off, and put it on a larger one, and sold it to a man who was gone to Coventry. He said it was the same colour as that of which part remained on one of them, which was sage green, and the same colour I had lost, and in the same state; it had been a little unravelled, and would not come off with the rest. We found twelve bobbins which I can swear to, they have all my initials or name on them. He said he did not know the man he bought the silk of.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He answered all your questions - A. Yes; I will swear it is the same silk.</p>

            . I live with my father, who is a silversmith, near Temple-bar. On the 23d of July, between ten and eleven o'clock in the evening, I was coming towards home, and was within six doors of <placeName id="t18200918-62-crimeloc349">Temple-bar</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18200918-62-crimeloc349" type="placeName" value="Temple-bar"/>

                        targets="t18200918-62-off347 t18200918-62-crimeloc349"/>; the three prisoners were behind; I felt my handkerchief drawn from my pocket within six doors of my home. I turned round, and saw Tobin and Garner (I had seen a third person with them before. I first saw them near Johnson's-court.) On my turning round, Garner said he perceived I wanted a pocket handkerchief, and he would lend me his with a great deal of pleasure. I said I did not want his, but was sure that he or one of his party had taken one belonging to me; he and Tobin abused me, and wanted to know how I could be so impudent as to charge such persons as them with it. I told the watchman at Temple-bar, that I had been robbed. He said point out the party, and I will take them. I pointed them out; there was a crowd, the watchman took them, and Temple came through the bar. They recognised each other; and said they had all been together the whole of the morning. I should not have known him without that. My father was with me, and with assistance they were taken to the watch-house. Temple had my handkerchief in his hand when he walked into the watch-house. I am certain it is mine. They spoke to each other as companions.</p>
               <p>MR. T. HARPER. I was with my son; I did not see the prisoners till he said he had been robbed. I then saw Temple go through the Bar in the road-way, and the other two went through the foot-way. Temple came round and met them; they all identified each other; observing, they had been together all the evening. It was Sunday night, they were decently dressed. I desired the watchman to take them to the watch-house. He quitted his hold of Tobin, and took hold of Temple; Tobin said he would go with us. But a little way further I met another, and desired him to take him. My son looked at Temple's hand, and said, that is my handkerchief, it was taken from him, and proved to be so. Three very good gloves were found in Temple's pocket. I asked what he wanted with three gloves; he replied one was his father's; but Garner cried out, that is my glove. They still continued to identify each other till the handkerchief was found. Then the other two declared they never saw Temple before in their lives.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did Temple conceal the handkerchief - A. I rather think he had it in his hand all the way; it was rumpled up in his hand in a very small compass. He held it between his hands.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty near Mr. Harper's door; the prosecutor, his father, and some others of the family, came home about eleven o'clock - the son came up, and said three notorious thieves had been at his pockets. I said point them out - I stepped with him under the foot archway of the bar, and there he pointed out Tobin and Garner. I collared them, and the instant I had done so Temple got to the entrance of the Strand side of the bar, coming into it - he advanced a few paces, Mr. Harper said</p>
               <p>"This is another of the fellows, I think." I let go of Tobin, took Temple, and with assistance the prisoners were taken to the watch-house. Garner was exclaiming against Mr. Harper for charging him with a crime - Temple said</p>
               <p>"Hold your tongue, there will be plenty of opportunity to say what you have to say afterwards." When they got to the watch-house, the prosecuter saw his handkerchief in Temple's hand, I also saw it at the same time, he said</p>
               <p>"That is my handkerchief" - Temple immediately laid it on the table - he claimed it, and Temple said nothing to it - one of them had three gloves, another who had only one claimed it. I cannot exactly say who it was.</p>

I heard Mr. Harper charge the two with picking his pocket, I naturally stopped, picked up the handkerchief, and followed them to the watch-house with it, and when I heard it was the same handkerchief which was lost I immediately produced it. I was not charged with the robbery till then. If I had intended to rob him of his property I should not have gone to the watch-house; I voluntarily produced it.</p>

On Sunday morning the 30th of July, about a quarter past six o'clock, I stopped the prisoner in Aldersgate-street with a basket, and asked what he had got - he said it was a piece of beef - I removed the cloth which covered it, and found it was a loaf of sugar. I asked where he brought it from - he said from Messrs. Eagletons' in Newgate-street - he wished me to let him go and keep the sugar myself. I took him to Eagletons', rang the bell - nobody answered. He then said he bought it of a man at the corner of Butcherhall-lane. Mr. Smith claimed it - it weighed 20 lbs. I found more at his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. I believe he keeps a small chandler's-shop - A. Yes, he has a very few things there. I had a man named Corney in custody for this felony.</p>

            . I am parish-clerk of Enfield, and have been so twenty-seven years. On Friday, the 30th of June, I was in the church at prayer-time till half-past twelve o'clock, I then locked the vestry-door and the north door. The church was hung with black cloth in memory of the Earl of Lisburne. A surplice, marked E P 3, hung in the vestry. I have many times known the church to be hung with black - most of it is given to the vicar, and part to the clerk. I was called up on the Saturday morning, a little after two o'clock, by the beadle, and went to the church with him and the constable. I found the cloth and surplice gone - a candle was found in the church; I received it from the Vicar and gave it to the constable. A small piece of cloth had been left on the sounding-board of the pulpit. Some cloth was afterwards brought to Enfield - I compared it, it tallied with that left on the pulpit, and corresponded in quality - I have no doubt of its being the cloth. The surplice was also produced. The churchwardens provide the surplice.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Who has the care of the church - A. I take care of the vestry and the sexton the church. I keep the keys of the vestry and north doors, and take them home with me - they hang in my room if they are wanted. The vestry is part of the church, and communicates with it.</p>

            . I am the sexton. I shut up the church about nine o'clock, the night before the robbery. I locked the front door. I went there at two o'clock the next morning with the beadle, on hearing the alarm, and found the south door open, which I had locked; we were the first that entered. I could see that the door had been unlocked, but no violence had been used. The vestry door appeared to have been unlocked too, but not broken - the cloth and surplice were gone. I found two pieces of wax candle and some pieces of matches in the church.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were the wax candles used at the funeral - A. The funeral was a month before. I had been at work near the church till nine o'clock, and went all over it at eight, to drive a bird out, and locked it at nine. I delivered the candles to the Vicar.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Enfield. On the 1st of July, in consequence of the alarm, I went in pursuit with Cufley. We received information, and got into Kingsland-road, and observed a waggon, with two bundles on the shafts, going towards town. The waggoner was with it, and three men walked by the side, rather behind, the prisoner was one of them. I went up and spoke to the waggoner, then one of the men came up and asked my business, and where I was going? I said I had been to meet my mother, who was coming up by the waggon, but she was not come. I walked on till we came nearly to Essex-street, Kingsland - there one of the men gave the waggoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180039"/>some money and left him, the other two went on with the waggon. It was just before we came to Kingsland turnpike. I first saw the waggon nearly a mile from Shoreditch Church. One of the men that remained had a grey-coloured coat and the other a blue one, the prisoner was one of them. The man who left had a black coat and waistcoat - the prisoner had a blue coat, light waistcoat, and boots on. Before the man in the black coat went away the one in the grey coat stepped back and said to the other two (one of whom was the prisoner)</p>
               <p>"Shall we take our luggage off here?" I did not hear what answer was given, or which answered - they did not take it off. The man in the black coat left, and the waggon proceeded up to the Mail Coach, public-house, about one hundred yards nearer to Shoreditch than Essex-street. It stopped, and the waggoner said to them,</p>
               <p>"You had better take your luggage off here before I go any further" - they were both together at the time. The man in the grey coat then went round to the horse on the offside of the waggon, and the prisoner came on the nearside. I observed him push very close towards the waggon, apparently to take the luggage off - he was close to the luggage. I went round and caught hold of the other man, called a man to my assistance, and gave him to that man, while I ran after the prisoner, who had set off as soon as he saw us scuffle (that man escaped). I ran after the prisoner, and gave an alarm of Stop thief! Two or three people tried to stop him, he knocked one or two of them down. He was not ten yards from me all the time. He had a nosegay in his hand, which he threw apparently at my face, but it went against the wall. He stumbled on some rubbish, and I gained ground on him. He tried to get through a door but could not; he then put his hand into his pocket, and threw away a canvas bag, it went on a shed close by - I saw some skeleton keys fall out of it; another person picked them up. I secured and took him to the Cherry Tree, public-house, searched him, and found a small crow, a snuff-box with tinder in it, a steel, and a small piece of wax-candle. The bundles were left on the waggon till I returned; I took them into the public-house. I found a surplice, and about fifty-five yards of black cloth in them - I compared it with that in the church. it appeared to be the same. A piece remained on the sounding-board, which I produce - I compared it with the cloth. it matched with the rest of the cloth, and fitted the different parts of the Church. I saw the skeleton keys tried, they opened the vestry-door; those I saw tried did not open the doors.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. At what time did you overtake the waggon - A. It was between ten minutes and a quarter before five o'clock when I was at Shoreditch church. I had been out on duty till past one that night. The man who came and spoke to me walked at a greater distance from the waggon than the others, but they were altogether when I first saw them, and kept together till he came and spoke to me. I saw them for a hundred yards before I came up to them. I do not know whether the other man put his hand on the luggage. I did not see the prisoner lay his hand on it, as I drew back. As soon as he saw me draw back, a signal was given and he ran. I saw the prisoner hold out his arms, as if to take it.</p>

            . I am a waggoner. On the 30th of June I was coming to town from Cambridgeshire - when I got a little on this side the Two Brewers, at Ponder's End, in the parish of Enfield, a man came up, and asked if I would take a parcel as far as Shoreditch church for him? I said he might bring it and lay it on the shafts if he liked - this was about twenty minutes past two o'clock. He said</p>
               <p>"Very well, my mate is just by with it," or</p>
               <p>"them." He was dressed in a dark or blue coat; then a man came up in a grey coat, with a parcel in a bag, and the man who first spoke brought a parcel in a silk handkerchief - we put them on the shafts, and the man in the grey coat said,</p>
               <p>"Give me the whip, and I will drive for you;" he did so, and I sat on the shaft, laid my head on the bag, and went to sleep. I awoke near Tottenham, got up, and looked back - the two men were then walking together, and one was driving - this was about three miles from Ponder's End - the prisoner was one of the two that were walking. The man who drove gave me the whip, and waited till the other two joined him, then all came on together. The man in the dark coat had got a handful of flowers out of a garden; I saw the prisoner with the nosegay afterwards. I went on with the waggon; they all walked conversing together. I heard Mead examined, his account is correct. The man in the dark coat went away before the other two - he gave me 1 s. for bringing the parcels. The prisoner and the other came on. I stopped opposite the public-house, and told them to take their parcels off; they were then on the path. The man in the grey coat went on the off-side, and the prisoner came up to the horse on the near side - I did not see him do anything. An alarm was given, the prisoner then went round the hind part of the waggon and ran away. I remained with my waggon, Mead pursued.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The man who came up to you at Ponder's End was not the prisoner - A. I cannot tell. I first saw the third man at Tottenham. I cannot say which it was, as I took little notice. The man in the grey coat drove. The bundles lay between the shafts, they might be reached from either side - the largest was more on the off-side than the other; the nearside was the handiest to get the least bundle. The man who first spoke to me in the dark coat had the small bundle, and the prisoner went nearest to the small one, when I said,</p>
               <p>"Take your bundle."</p>

               <p>"You have robbed a church, you know it." He then put his hand into his pocket, and took out something bright, which I supposed to be a crow, and said</p>
               <p>"D - n my eyes, I will serve you out!" I thought it was a knife, and immediately ran from him. He struck a blow with his fist, and knocked a man down, who was behind me. He returned from the lower end of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180040"/>the street, and ran towards Union-road, took a bag of keys from his pocket, and threw it on a high shed - I got it off the shed. One of the keys fell out of the bag, and it contained two double and one single one; there were only two in the bag. I tried the keys to the church; one opened the vestry-door. I found a large needle near his feet at the public-house, after he was searched.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you try them to the church-door - A. None of them would fit. I saw the bundles, they were done up in a bag, and directed to Mr. Robinson, Tailor, Houndsditch, it was sewn with the same sort of twine as that in the needle.</p>

I rent the front room first floor, he sleeps below; I was with him till past ten o'clock, I then went to bed, and believe he did. The house is generally fastened with two bolts. There is no key. I saw him at half-past two o'clock next morning. I heard him call

               <p>MR. WALFORD. Q. What are you - A. A carpenter, and work for Mr. Clark. The prisoner is a bricklayer, he takes jobs for himself. I did not go before the magistrate, as I did not hear of this till Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you first called on to be a witness - A. The day before yesterday; I did not hear he was taken up for a week or a fortnight after the robbery. I understood he was in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you heard of it on Saturday night A.- I heard he was absent. I never heard about what hour the robbery was committed. Speering knew and saw him as well as me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you talk over with him what you was to say when you came here - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>JAMES SPEERING. I lodged in the prisoner's house, and do now; he called me up on the last morning in June, I had been in his company the night before, and left him between nine and ten o'clock; he called me up between two and three, and soon after I heard the watchman call half-past two; it was earlier than I wished to get up, and I went to bed again. I saw him go out and fastened the door after him.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODERICK. Q. Will you swear you saw him go out at half-past two o'clock - A. Yes; I came here part of the way with Sidnell; we both talked about what we were coming here for. I told him more than a week ago that I remembered hearing the hour cried, and since that we have often spoke of it. He said he remembered hearing the watchman call the hour, and so did I. I cannot say that I saw Speering when the prisoner called me. Our rooms are both on one floor; I did not hear him speak to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Whether Speering awoke before you, you cannot say. - A. No, He was in the room with us the night before.</p>

            . On the the 30th of June last I slept at Stoke Newington, at Mr. Davis's house. I was making up his books. The prisoner came there about four o'clock that morning; it was Saturday, he came to look at a stove and copper, which was to be set. I let him in myself; he staid perhaps a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>MR. WALFORD. Q. What is Mr. Davis - A. He is in the wool trade; I was making up his books, he wanted to go to Wales, and asked me to sleep there that night to finish the books.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you let him in - A. Not at first, I understand he came before, then went and took a walk. I let him in the second time. I heard a noise when he came the first time. The house is three miles and a half from Whitchapel. I let him in ten minutes after I got up; and heard the watchman call half-past three after I was up.</p>

I first came up to the waggon about a mile from Shoreditch Church, and got to the church at twelve minutes before five; I took particular notice. I was at the church before I saw the waggon. I had been to town, and was returning; it was about five when I met him.</p>

On the 22d of July, at a quarter before seven in the evening, I served the prisoner with a glass of cyder in the parlour, which joins the bar. There is a door leads from the parlour to the bar; he paid for it, and left the house. At half-past nine the same evening I saw him again. I heard Murphy, the servant, speaking to some one on the stairs, and having no lodgers, I called to know who she was speaking to. I saw the back of a man going into the yard. I took a candle, and followed him. I found a small piece of muslin and a piece of cotton, strewed about the yard, which had come from my work-bag up stairs. I saw the man go into the privy, and I asked what business he had up stairs. He said, my name is

I threw the parlour door open; the prisoner then went into the parlour. I left him there while I went to look in the yard; I went to the privy, and there saw a bag down on the soil. I saw a man immediately take it up with a rake. There was an old silk gown, and some articles of no value in it, it was mine. I went into the parlour, and said to him, did not you take the keys out of the parlour cupboard,</p>

               <p>"Pray do tell me if you have." I had missed them ever since he came for the cyder. I sent for a smith, and had the cupboard-door opened, and to my surprise, there was no plate in it. I sent for Warren, the constable, who took him into custody. I had put the eighteen spoons in a box in the cupboard at six o'clock that night. I locked it, but did not take the keys out.</p>

I turned round, and followed them five or six yards, I then saw three of them close upon Dr. Bollman, I am sure the prisoner was one of them. I saw they were picking his pocket, but could not see which hand did it; and at the same instant I saw one of them give the prisoner a pocket-book. I collared the prisoner and another, both struggled to get from me; the prisoner succeeded in getting away with the pocket-book. I let go of the other, and ran after him, and saw him throw the pocket-book over the rails. A person came up, and made a desperate effort to knock me down as I was pursuing the prisoner. He was secured before I lost sight of him, and I am sure he is one of them. I climbed over the rails, and got the pocket-book, which Dr. Bollman claimed.</p>

I was at the corner of Bishopsgate-street and Leadenhall-street, I had just left the shop of Mr. Macklin the silver-smith, and on crossing to go home, I perceived a number of persons moving forward with flags and music.

I fixed my eye on him, and at that moment he made a desperate pull at my watch-chain while I was looking him in the face; I immediately collared him - my chain was broken and went with the seals, I think they were taken before he struck me - I found my watch still in my fob. I was surrounded by twenty of the gang, knocked down, and kept down until the prisoner escaped. As soon as I got from them, I ran in the direction the crowd took, came up with the prisoner at St. Peter's Church, and found a sailor scuffling with him - I endeavoured to get to them, saying</p>
               <p>"That is the man who robbed me," but the gang said he was not the man - they all set upon the sailor, and the prisoner escaped a second time. I found him in custody on the 16th of August, on another charge. I have no doubt whatever of his being the man; I was obliged to look at him some time at the Mansion House, because he was shaven quite clean - when he robbed me he had a very rough beard.</p>
               <p>JAMES REDFERN. I am a seaman, and live at Romford. On the 24th of July, I was in Cornhill going to the Jerusalem Coffee-house, and at the end of Bishopsgate-street there was a mob - I stopped and saw the prisoner trying to get from somebody. I am positive he is the man. A gentleman sung out</p>
               <p>"He has got my watch stop him!." I tried to stop him - the mob pushed me violently, and he got from me; they were crying out</p>
               <p>"That is not the man, let him go." When he got clear of me he pulled out a knife, and was going to cut away - the gang hustled him lower down, and I lost him. I saw him in custody two or three weeks afterwards, and I am certain he is the man.</p>

            . I live in Dorset-street, Spitalfields. On the 24th of July the weavers committee had a procession, which drew a crowd. About twenty men came up in a gang in Camomile-street and about the Old City Chambers, three of them tried at a gentleman's watch - they were with a little boy, which excited my attention. The gentleman gave him a rap on the head. I observed the prisoner and another with the gang. I went to the corner of Leadenhall-street - the prosecutor stood against a post, and ten or twenty of them stood close by him, the prisoner was one; he stooped right in front of the prosecutor. I saw his hand go towards Mr. Fernie, and before he could make any resistance he pulled out his watch; as I thought. Mr. Fernie said</p>
               <p>"I am robbed!" I said,</p>
               <p>"That is the man who has got your watch." He collared him, and in the scuffle both fell. The gang called each other, and all got round the prosecutor and rescued the prisoner. He got as far as the coach-stand, when the sailor seized him and held him as far as St. Peter's-court. The gang said</p>
               <p>"This is not the man," I said he was. The sailor held him a minute or two; he then cried out</p>

               <p>"He has stabbed me!" and let him go. I saw him afterwards at Lambeth-street, and am positive he is the man. He had a large brown coat on at the time.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Sparkes, a linen-draper, in Southampton-street. I saw Mr. Dent going down Southampton-street, and the prisoner with his hand in his pocket - a boy about twelve years of age was by his side. I ran out, at that time his hand was out of his pocket. I laid hold of the prisoner, and as I was calling Mr. Dent a boy said</p>
               <p>"Look behind you." I looked, and found he he had thrown the handkerchief down on a grating, which I picked up. The little boy went off directly.</p>

The piece of cambric was worth 4 l. I had seen them safe in June. I gave the prisoner in charge, and told him it was for felony - he said nothing, but next morning I received a letter from him, which I knew to be his writing - I had said nothing to induce him to confess. He left my service the latter end of June. At the time of the robbery 6 l. or 7 l. was due to him for wages.</p>

The fourteen yards of cambric were in two pieces, one of which cost me 84 s.; it was of a particularly fine quality. It was never sold.</p>

About two months ago the prisoner came to my house, and said he had left Mr. Craig about a month; that he had been to a sale of unredeemed pledged, and bought a lot of goods very cheap. Next morning he called with them, and I bought them of him. A day or two after he called, and said he had bought some duplicates, I said I would have nothing to do with them, and that evening I sent for Mr. Craig to the Feathers, in Hand-court, and shewed him some cambric.

On the 2d of August he came - he had been there on the 17th of July, and purchased about 2 l. worth of goods; he did not pay for them, but bought other goods at different times to the amount of 14 l., which he proposed paying for by a bill accepted by Colonel Gordon. On the evening of the 2d of August he brought me that bill - (looking at it) - this is it. I gave him 5 l. and some silver in change. The acceptance was on it then as it is now. On the same day, before he gave me the bill, he gave me a slip of paper to enquire about it; this is the paper - (looking at it,) read -</p>
               <p>"Draft accepted by Col. Gordon, 5th Dragoon Guards, at thirty days, payable at Cox and Greenwood's, for 20 l." He gave me this to enquire at Cox and Co.'s, if a bill so accepted would be paid. He came in the evening, and in consequence of what passed I took it. He afterwards bought more goods, which he proposed paying for by another bill; he bought part of them that day, after he had delivered me the first bill. A few days after, he bought other goods, and on the 9th more. On the 10th he gave me another bill, and said he would send his man for the change, or come himself for it. He had had goods and cash together to the amount of 8 l. 19 s.</p>

Mr. Thompson applied for a warrant on the 11th of August, and I apprehended the prisoner in bed at the Bull and Bush on the other side of Hampstead - I told him I had a warrant against him, and told him what it was for. He said it was all his own doings, that his servant had nothing to do in it, and he must suffer. I had told him I took him for obtaining goods from Thompson by a forged acceptance on Col. Gordon. Mr. Thompson came in directly with the prisoner's servant, whom I had apprehended. When I told the prisoner he was in custody for this offence, he said he thought it was his servant's doings - the servant said nothing. The prisoner immediately said it was his own doings, and his servant had nothing to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180047"/>do with it, and that he himself must suffer for it.

             re-examined. I went into the room with the officer - the prisoner, I believe, was asleep. Humphreys touched him, he jumped up and said,</p>
               <p>"What do you want with me?" he said,</p>
               <p>"I have a warrant against you" -</p>
               <p>"At whose suit?" said the prisoner; Humphrys said</p>
               <p>"At Mr. Thompson's." I immediately shewed myself. Humphreys said,</p>
               <p>"It is for obtaining goods from Mr. Thompson, and paying with a forged acceptance of 20 l." He got up in bed, and said</p>
               <p>"Good God! I am undone. It is all my friends' fault that they did not relieve me." He began to dress himself. He swore at his servant, and sent him for water to mix with some laudanum. He took a bottle out of his pocket, which he called laudanum - I asked him how many drops he wished to have? he said thirty - I told his servant to give him thirty. I left the officer and my son with him while he dressed himself, and we brought him to town.</p>

             re-examined. I was in the room nearly all the time - the others were not in above two minutes before me. I think the prisoner asked for soda-water and then some gin to take some laudanum in, which he had in a phial. I heard him say if he had got the money he intended to go to Bath and Ireland, and and would have sent us the money from Ireland. He had sent his servant for the change of the second bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the hand-writing of the body of the bill - A. I think it is the prisoner's. I saw him write the particulars of the bill - I cannot say it is the same.</p>
               <p>(The bill was here put in and read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, it was my intention to have left my defence entirely to your Lordship's mercy, but when I hear that brought against me which is devoid of truth I cannot avoid speaking. A circumstance has been mentioned which may operate very much against me. I broke a blood-vessel about two years ago - it was not my intention to use the laudanum improperly when it was given me by the doctor. I leave the rest to your Lordship and the Jury, with only this observation, that from the suddenness of the prosecution, I have not been able to call on the most respectable families in England to give me a character.</p>

            . I am a gold and silver refiner, and live in Chapel-street, Oxford-street, and have known the prisoner many years; on the 24th of June he brought me a ring and three pins, and asked if I would buy them, he said he had them to sell for a person who wanted 10 l. for them, and I should have them for 11 l.; he took them away. The prosecutor called on me that day, and it struck me it might be his property. I told him to come in half an hour, and I would get them from Leith, he did not come till a quarter past ten o'clock at night, and while I was talking to him, the prisoner was waiting at the door expecting either the money or the things, as I had got them from him. Haydon claimed them. I do not think them worth above 12 l.</p>

            , Little Brick Hill, Buckinghamshire." The first Sunday I was in Newgate, to my astonishment, I saw Sinfield in the chapel - he was convicted last Session of horse-stealing, which horse, I believe, was stolen from Buckinghamshire. I immediately identified him, and when I saw Mr. Sheriff Parkins I told him of the circumstance - he asked if any other person could identify him. I said Yes; he then ordered Sinfield to be put with other persons, and my friends were sent for, they immediately identified him. I requested he might not be sent away, but he was sent to Sheerness, and when he arrived there, I am informed, he wrote a letter to Mr. Hardy, stating that I was innocent.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Marne, who is a horse-dealer, in Great Dover-road, Borough. About the 14th or 15th of April my master sent me into Kent-street. I met a man in the alley on a horse, with a broken knee, and blind in one eye. I asked him the price - he said 4 l. but at last he said I might have it for 3 l. 10 s.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Should you know the horse again - A. Yes; I have not seen it since, but by the description given of it, I think this is it. I met a man about an hour after, who said Deneh had bought it. The prisoner is a costermonger - he did not deal in horses; he kept a horse and cart.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a man was it - A. A young man, rather pale, about my height; he had a brown coat, velveteen breeches, a redish waistcoat, and high-low shoes; he was sitting on an old coat, and had neither saddle or bridle, only a halter in the horse's mouth. The horse looked very poor - this was about nine o'clock on Saturday morning - both its knees were broken, but not bleeding; the skin appeared white.</p>
               <p>Q. It could not have been done so late as the night before - A. No, it was an old wound. I have not seen the man since.</p>

On turning round I caught the prisoner's hand in my breeches-pocket, which had 7 s. or 7 s. 6 d. in it at the time - when I got clear of the mob I found only 18 d. remaining. My knife and several other things were gone. I am sure the prisoner was one of them. I came home, told two or three people of it, and saw the prisoner next morning playing on a dung-heap with another lad, in the Jolly Butcher's yard, and knew him directly - I sent for Allen, who took him. I had seen him pass our door eight or nine times before. I live<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180052"/>within four doors of the Jolly Butchers. When I was robbed the skirt of my coat was thrown at me again. It was cut so as to take my inside and outside pocket; it was cut through the seam and then completely torn off. I am certain it was first cut with some sharp instrument. I was much alarmed at the time and resisted, but while some held my arms the others cut my coat away.</p>

As soon as I recovered myself a little I felt my watch go from my fob. Hemmings drove against me also with violence, as if he was in liquor. I felt my watch go, and saw it passed to Hemmings - I saw Jacobs hand it over to Hemmings; I immediately charged Hemmings with robbing me of my watch, as I saw it last in his possession, he said he had not got it - we secured them. I thought Connelly was one of the party, as he said he was an officer, and wanted to take one of them from me; he did not touch me or receive the watch.

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on Tuesday, the 12th, and found a 5 l. note, No. 19087, three 1 l. notes, and some silver on her. I charged her with robbing Mrs. Woodfall. She went up stairs to be searched by some women, came down again, and at the lock-up place she said she hoped Mr. Rogers would not be hard with her, and that she could not tell what she was about - that was all she said to me. I found some things at her lodgings, which she said she bought with the notes. I took the prisoner at Mr. King's. I produce the note.</p>
               <p>MRS. WOODFALL. I know my notes were following numbers. I produce one that was left in my box, it is 19088 - the notes that were lost were following numbers below this, I am sure of it.</p>

On the 31st of August, at a quarter past three o'clock, I saw Lee in Hill-street, looking into the front room, outside the area wall, talking to some one, but I did not see who. I could not see the side door when I was passing by him. I went and looked out of the side door, and saw the feet of two men, who were in conversation. I did not see who they were. I went in, shut the door, and went up stairs to the nursery, and in twenty minutes after I saw Lee go out of the front court, he looked up at me and shut the gate after him with both hands in his pocket. He went up Hill-street. I missed the clothes in about ten minutes. I had seen them in the wardrobe a day or two before. I found the window open, any one could get in there; it was over a cellar window, a man might step up from the ground and get in.</p>

I saw the prisoners together at one o'clock, coming across the Bird-cage fields, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutrix's house, and about two o'clock I saw them both together get behind the prosecutrix's area-wall. I watched them,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180054"/>and about three o'clock I went across to my place, and saw Lee lift Martin up, and take a bundle over the prosecutrix's fence. I ran and told her; pursued, and saw Martin drop the bundle. I ran on. The officer picked it up. I secured, and delivered him to Prescod. I am sure of both their persons.</p>

            . I am an officer. I pursued with Ballasier; I saw Martin drop the bundle, I picked it up; he begged for mercy. I had said nothing to him. I assisted in apprehending Lee two days after in Whitechapel. I had seen him running with Martin on the day of the robbery; I knew him before perfectly well. The clothes are worth 10 l. and are nearly new.</p>

            . I bought the mare of the prisoner about the middle of May; he brought her to me in Euston-mews, Euston-square, and asked for a man named Moore. I asked if the mare was for sale, he said Yes; and asked 6 l. for her, which I gave him after I had been to Jenkins to see if he would buy her. I am sure the prisoner is the person. He said he was a cow-keeper, and lived in Bishopsgate-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. When was it - A. I think it was on the 24th of May, it was about a week before Epsom Races. I believe after he was taken, the Magistrate allowed him two days liberty to find the man he said he bought it of.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner on the 8th of September, in Sweet Apple-court. I told him not to hurry himself, but to say how he became possessed of the mare. He said he swapped a poney for her at Blackheath-fair. He said he did not think he should know the man again. I then asked him if any witness was by. I told him not to hurry himself; he said he believed not; No. He said Slaughter sold her for him. He was examined next day, and told the Magistrate two Jews were present when he bought her.</p>

I had fetched the linen to take home to wash from Mr. Faber's, at the top of Bishopsgate-street. I live at Bethnal-green. It had not gone five o'clock. I was in Skinner-street, a little way out of Bishopsgate-street, and saw three men at the corner - I saw them very clearly, the lamps were being lit, and there was a great deal of snow on the ground - it was a clear night. All of a moment, one of them came and knocked me down, and attempted to get the bundle, but I held it fast, thinking it better to die than to loose it. The other came and dragged me till my strength was gone, and got the bundle from me. The third stood by my side, and said</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, mistress, do not hollow so - can I help you?" I am sure he was one of the three, I saw them all very clearly before. The man who had my bundle was convicted. The prisoner is the man who knocked me down, I am quite sure. I have not seen the third man since. I followed them as far as I could, and went to the lodgings of the one who had my bundle, and had him apprehended next morning. I have met the prisoner once since it happened; hat was three or four months ago, I could not take him myself, but went and told the officer. He was apprehended seven weeks ago (I think) and taken to the Mansion House. I am quite sure he is one of them, and was sure when I met him. I have no doubt whatever of it.</p>

            . I live in Crown-court, Angel-alley, Bishopsgate-street. I know the prisoner, and I knew Lomer, who was transported for life. On the evening the prosecutrix was robbed, I was going up Skinner-street, out of Bishopsgate-street, and in a little alley which turns down to Angel-alley I met Lomer, the prisoner and another man were walking alongside of him. Lomer had the bundle. I heard the prosecutrix cry out that she had been robbed; at that time, she was about half way down the alley. I ran back - she said she had been robbed of a bundle. I said</p>
               <p>"Come with me and I will shew you the fellows who have got it." I took her to Angel-alley, and shewed her the house where Lomer lived, which was opposite mine. We did not see him. I knew him well before. I have seen the prisoner several times since, and told of his being about. He was taken up about six weeks ago. My husband is a watchman. I do not know the third man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not go and tell Cox that Carr was taken, and she asked you if it was a fair or a dark man. - A. She did, I said it was a dark man; then she said, that is the man who knocked me down. The other was a fair man.</p>

            . I am a City officer. The end of Skinner-street, near Bishopsgate-street, is in the City. I apprehended the prisoner on the 22d of July, and told him it was for a highway robbery on Mrs. Cox, he denied it. On the following Monday Cox saw him among five or six more. I took particular care no one should shew him to to her. I asked her to point out the person, and she pointed him out. I had been looking for him ever since the 28th of December.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I returned from sea, I went to learn the shoe-making business at Groves's, and on the night of this robbery, I was going to my brother's, and in Skinner-street I saw two men pass me with a bundle. I went on; and afterwards moved to Nichols-street, Shoreditch, and remained there till the officer took me.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer, and work in Cloak-lane, close to Messrs. Waters' cellars. On the 2d of September, about ten minutes past six o'clock in the morning. I saw Roberts with a prickle-basket opposite the cellars, on the other side of the way - I saw a flag-basket also, they appeared to be full, another person was with him. I cannot say it was Smith - they both took the prickle-basket and wanted to carry it, but could not, it was so heavy, it fell down, and part of the bottles broke; they went away with the flag-basket, and returned in five minutes for the prickle-basket - they dragged it along the pavement; I thought they might be employed at the vaults. I saw Roberts at Lambeth-street soon after, and I am sure he is the man.</p>

On the 2d of September, about seven o'clock in the morning, Roberts came in - Smith stood at the door with a prickle and flag-basket which appeared full. Roberts opened a bottle of wine, and asked me to take some with him - I lent him a glass, it was white-wine, it appeared to be Lisbon wine, but I am no judge. Smith went away with the flag-basket, leaving the prickle behind, then returned, and they both took the prickle-basket away.

            . I am a porter at Whitechapel-market. On the 2d of September, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoners in Gulston-square, with a prickle on the pavement - I came by with my barrow; Roberts stopped, and asked me to let him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180057"/>have the barrow to take the prickle to Petticoat-lane - he was a stranger, I would not lend it him, but wheeled it myself. Three men put the prickle into the barrow, the prisoners were two of them. Roberts went away; I asked who was to pay me? the other man said</p>
               <p>"You shall be paid." Smith and the man remained, and steadied the barrow. They took me down Wentworth-street. I said the road was so rough the bottles would break - the wheel went into a gutter, and broke a bottle. It was white wine - they lifted the barrow out. I put the wine into a dirty house which I shewed the constable. They paid me 6 d., an elderly woman was there. I saw Roberts at the Mansion House a few days afterwards, and am certain of both of them.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended Roberts on the 5th of September, and told him he was charged with stealing wine; he said he knew nothing of it. Barrett shewed me the house, No. 146, Wentworth-street, Roberts occupied the very room he shewed me, I apprehended him there - there was a basket in the room. I went to the cellars, and found the padlock knocked off.</p>

Next morning I saw her bring his breakfast again, and saw him put something from his hat into her lap - I followed her and stopped her opposite Mr. Alderman Cox's. I found five illumination lamps in her lap. I went and took the prisoner at Mr. Patrick's; the child was brought before him, he said nothing to the charge.</p>

In consequence of information I received, on the 15th of August I searched his lodging, in Bear-yard, Lincoln's Inn-fields, and found the duplicate of a pair of trowsers. I found them at the pawnbroker's, and immediately knew them, as I cut them out myself - a customer had returned them - I saw them safe three or four months before. I saw the prisoner at his lodgings about an hour after, and asked him how he came possessed of them. He said,</p>
               <p>"Why, the blue trowsers, I had them with the things you gave me last." Those I gave him wore worn out, and these were new. The last blue trowsers he had was on the 20th of September, 1819. He afterwards complained of their being worn out, and had a pair of grey ones.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How long had he lived with you - A. Fourteen or fifteen months. I am certain they are mine - they were not much worn.</p>

On the 28th of August I was looking out of window, and saw the prisoner and his wife in the yard,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180058"/>with North, consulting about parting - his wife had cohabited with North, and wanted her clothes to go away with him; the prisoner said if she came up stairs she should have them - then all three came into the passage. I heard words at the foot of the stairs, went down, and saw North against the wall - he said,</p>
               <p>"I am done for." I saw his hand drop against the wall, it was all bloody. The prisoner was about half a yard form him. I did not see him do anything, and never heard him threaten North. I saw a knife in his hand, and said</p>
               <p>"Long take care what you are at, and give me the knife." He shut the knife up, and gave it to me - it was rather bloody. North had three cuts in his face; I saw nothing more. He was taken to the doctor's. A quantity of blood laid at the door. Whatever happened was done before I came down.</p>
               <p>HENRY BETTS. I am a constable. About eight o'clock on the night this happened, I was sent for, and knocked at the prisoner's room door, and told him to open it. I found it open, he was there in bed with his wife, she was in liquor. I took him to the watch-house. Four or five days after I saw North, his wounds were dressed. He had one cut from his ear down towards his mouth, his lip was cut, and he had a stab in his cheek.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My wife had deserted me, and gone with North; I met them together, and North said if I touched her he would break every bone in my body. She followed me home, I was going to take her up stairs, and he seized me by the throat.</p>

            . I am mate of the Voston. I did not sleep on board the prisoner did, alone; he had charge of the cargo and ship in my absence. On Tuesday, the 13th of September, a young man in the hospital gave me some information, in consequence of which, on Wednesday morning, at half-past nine o'clock, I met Capt. Gass on board by appointment - we sent for Walmsley, and sent the prisoner out of the way. We searched, and found that some of the cases of goods on board had been broken open; some were cases of hardware. We then went into the cabin, and found in the prisoner's bed-place, between the blankets, three white-handled clasp knives, and in the after-locker, on the larboard side, I saw a new blue surtout<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180059"/>coat and some spotted silk waistcoats (I think three) some of the prisoner's books were in that locker - I had often seen him go to it. We found a mahogany dressing-case in one of the lockers, with the name erased off it. I think we found a pair of white jean trowsers with the coat. I went again on Thursday with Murrant, and in the cabin, on the starboard side, we found a new blue coat, a dozen ivory-handled knives and forks and two pair of carvers. The prisoner had been apprehended at two o'clock on the Wednesday, I had frequently seen him go to all the lockers and the cabin. I took the keys of the hold away every night but one.</p>

            . I am twenty years old on the 3d of January. I am apprentice on board the brig Nelson, which laid in the London Docks at the time the Vaston did, she laid in the next tier. I got acquainted with the prisoner soon after the vessel came there, and was on board with him at different times. I went into the hold with the mate when the search was made. Some of the cases had been split and opened, and the cover of one had been prized open. I went down into the cabin one night, and the prisoner asked me to lend him a towell - this was above a month before the search. He told me to go down into the cabin and fetch a leather belt; I went down, put my hand into the locker, and felt a quantity of handkerchiefs. I came up and said</p>
               <p>"You have got a good stock of handkerchiefs on board" - he said</p>
               <p>"Yes, I was such a fool I forgot to get them out of the Dock." I helped to to push them into his pockets, and he went away with them. When I went into the cabin with the mate I saw a mahogany dressing-case, with the name scratched off the brass plate. I had seen the prisoner shave himself one night with one of the razors, which he took out of it - he put it in again. He took the dressing-case from under his bed in the cabin, and put it there again after using it. The locker where it was found was close to his bed. I saw the mate find all the things. About a week before the search I had been putting our Captain ashore, the prisoner was in the boat with me; he said</p>
               <p>"Jerry, did you ever see such a thing as this?" and produced a thing which had the handle done all over with red sealing-wax, it drew a piece of steel to it - he put them into his pocket; he said it was a magnet. The dressing-case was fitted up with a looking-glass, scissars, inkstands, and other things. About a fortnight before the search, I saw him open a chest of clothes in the cabin, on the starboard side. He shewed me a coat, some white waistcoats, and a piece of nankeen in it. He said his mother bought him the dressing-case, that it cost five guineas, and the razors cost a guinea each.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police officer. I went on board the vessel with the mate, and found the things as he has stated. I apprehended the prisoner on Wednesday, about two o'clock. I searched him the same evening, and found two keys in his pocket; I tried one of them to the lock on the fore-scuttle; it opened it, but any key would open it. A person might go from the fore-scuttle into the hold. I took possession of the property found on board, Mr. Smith claimed them. On Friday, the 15th of September, Mr. Haughton gave me a blue coat, three waistcoats, and two pair of jean trowsers - his neice,

I am neice to Mr. Haughton, who keeps the Three Crowns, near the London Docks, the prisoner lodged at my uncle's - he brought some clothes in a bundle there about a fortnight before he was apprehended. He used to come and dress himself almost every evening; he brought another blue coat, white waistcoat, and pair of trowsers, they were all new. He gave me two magnets and two pair of plated snuffers, and asked me what I thought was the value of them? I said I did not know. He said he gave 5 s. each for the magnets. Last Wednesday week, early in the morning, he brought a pair of scissars. I delivered the bundle to the officer, he brought every thing which it contained.</p>

On the 11th of August I left home before six o'clock, and came to my father's, which is opposite, a little after six, but did not go home till nine o'clock; I remained at my father's. I had left my wife and sister in the house, besides Mrs. Mason. When I came home, in consequence of what my wife said, I found my bureau, in the front room first floor, broken open, and about one hundred watches, and the rest of the property stated in the indictment gone - their total value was about 150 l.. I saw them all safe about nine o'clock in the morning, and also at five in the afternoon. I do not know that I left my bureau locked, but the room door was. The screw which fastens the knob of the lock was lost, and on touching the knob the spindle comes entirely out. Mason's husband also lodged in the house, but was not there when I left. When I came home and discovered the robbery, it struck me that nobody but Mrs. Mason was in the house, and it must he her - she was then, I believe, in bed with her husband. I went up and accused her of the robbery, she denied it. I sent for an officer to search her place; nothing was found, except three or four knives of mine, which were not stolen then. While I was at my father's I saw

On the evening of the robbery I lost a gold chain with a miniature, a pair of ear-rings, a cream jug, a necklace, and several other articles - my drawers were forced open, and the things taken out. I had left the room locked, and had the key with me. I was terrified on hearing of the robbery, and cannot say whether I found the door locked or not when I returned. I saw the things safe that day, and had shewn the miniature to Mrs. Mason that day. My husband's name is Charles.

            . I am sister-in-law to Joseph, but do not live in his house. On the night of the robbery, about seven o'clock, I went over to his house from his father's by his desire, to see if my sister (his wife) wanted me. On putting my hand to the knocker the door went open. I heard somebody on the stairs, went up, and saw the prisoner, Mason, pulling my sister's front room door to on the first floor - she had pulled the spindle out of the lock. She had something in her hand, which she either dropped, or it fell out of her hand, and struck against the side of a box, it sounded like a stone or some hard substance. She said,</p>
               <p>"Mind how you tread." I asked if my sister was at home? she said No. I thought I heard a moving in the front or back room; it was a rustling noise, as if somebody was moving. She had the spindle of the door in her hand. I tried the back room door, it was shut - she then stood with her back against the back room door and her hand behind her. I said,</p>
               <p>"I shall go up stairs, and see if my sister is up in Mrs. Ellis's room." She put her hand against the stairs, and said,</p>
               <p>"You need not go up, there is nobody at home." I then went down stairs. She told me to mind and shut the door, but she followed me down with the spindle in her hand, and shut it after me. Her dress was in disorder. I left. I had no idea of her doing any thing wrong.</p>

            . I am a brass-founder. On the 6th of August Robins sent for me. I was going to him but I met him in Holborn, he said we will have a walk. As I was walking with him, he said he knew of a good thing, and going down Drury-lane he pointed out Mr. Joseph's house, and said that his sister, Mrs. Mason told him, that in paying her rent to Joseph, she saw considerable property in watches in his bureau. He asked if I knew any person who would undertake the job; he said he knew one Schooley, who he was to see, or expected to see, and he was a very clever chap, and could open iron-chests. And there was a job at a watch and clock-makers in Holborn, and none but Schooley could do it, that several of them had attempted it, but that he could do it. And that there was a job at Coram's, where he lodged, and 14 l. was lost, and only 3 l. 10 s. brought to light. We walked over Waterloo-bridge and returned to Drury-lane, a boy ran up, and said,</p>
               <p>"Father, here is Mr. Schooley;" he came up, and said he could not come before, or something of that kind. We then walked round Russell-street, and looked about Joseph's back premises, then came to the corner of the court. Mr. and Mrs. Mason both came up at the same time to Joseph's street-door. Mason crossed the road, and Mrs. Mason stood with her back to the door. Robins and Schooley spoke to her as they passed. We then went up a court into Wild-street. Schooley pulled out a large bag with a good many keys, and said nothing would do. Robins said it was too late, and we walked into Wild-street, and at the corner of Holborn I parted with them. On the Monday following I had some business in Lee-street, and called at Robins's house, and saw Mrs. Mason and Mrs. Robins there, but not Mr. Robins. His wife said he was gone out with a man. I asked what man, she said she believed with the man her boy brought down to us in Drury-lane. I said what time did they come home last night. She said at half-past eleven o'clock. I said I left them at half-past nine. Mason said</p>
               <p>"Did Tom tell you any thing about that last night;" I said Yes. She said, I paid my rent to Mr. Joseph, and saw a great many watches and other property, in the bureau; that the lock was a common one, that the handle would come out, or it might be opened easily by a key. That they were out till past twelve o'clock last night. I went away, it was Monday morning. The same evening Robins called on me, and said he heard I had been there; he said he had been with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180061"/>Charley, that he had a partner at Hatton-garden, and would breakfast with him. He left me, and called again on Wednesday evening, nothing was said about this robbery then. On the Saturday morning following, I went up to him, he opened the door, which was locked inside, he said,</p>
               <p>"Do not come here, for there is a fine piece of work." I said, About what? He said the robbery at Joseph's, which had been committed. I said</p>
               <p>"I suppose you know all about it, but you kept the affair very sly to yourselves." He said,</p>

               <p>"Do not stand baffling here, you had better go about your business, if you are caught here, it will give you a good deal of trouble, particularly as you keep a shop." I was surprised, and went home. In the afternoon he came to me, and said, there was a fine bother, that his wife had gone down to Mrs. Mason, and he supposed they had kept her. I said</p>
               <p>"I could see from the first of it you did not intend to let me be connected in it. You have not acted quite right, but I am better perhaps without it." He said,</p>
               <p>"You had nothing to do with it, and can expect nothing." I said,</p>
               <p>"No; but you acted so d - d sly;" a person came in and he left, but returned in two hours, and brought a fork with him, he threw it down in the window, and said it would fetch something. He said that Schooley was a d - d rascal, and he was about moving, and he did not know where to, and he would go after him. When he left I thought the fork was meant to do me an injury; it was a white-handled one. I told a person of it; he said it was a trap, and so that afternoon I wrote to Mr. Joseph, saying I would come forward, and give every information. Salmon came to me about three days afterwards.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Saturday, the 19th of August, I went to No. 20, North-street, Pentonville, and found Griffiths and Goodwin in the house. I think Goodwin opened the door to me. She told me they had taken the house and come in that morning. I heard afterwards that a man was there, but I did not see him. She said she expected her husband home every moment. I went into the parlour, and found a deal box, asked whose it was, Goodwin said she did not know, nor had she the key. I broke it open, and found a quantity of jewellery which the prosecutor claims. Griffiths also said she did not know how it came there. The furniture was in the house, all loose, as if just brought in.</p>

He wanted to come in immediately. I said he could come at any time, he said he would come in early in the morning. I went to my master's in Tottenham-street, he followed me. I saw him knock at the door, I asked what he wanted, he said the key. I said he could not have possession till I saw my master. I gave the man possession on the morning of the 9th, and helped him to carry the box in, in which Limbrick found the property. Griffiths was there when they broke it open. I worked there all that day.</p>

I went into my room, and was not out of it again till Mr. Joseph came home.</p>

I received information on the 19th of August, and went with Limbrick, to No. 20, North-street, and found the prisoners there. Goodwin said her husband had taken the house. I found the back of my sofa on the bed in the left hand parlour, and the rest of it at the foot of the bed. The other property was there also. Goodwin said she bought the sofa of an upholsterer at the west end of the town two months ago, but did not know his name. I said I had only lost it five weeks, then Griffiths said they only had it three weeks.</p>

I stepped back from him, he immediately snatched my watch out, and ran up the court. I followed him to the top of the court, calling Stop thief! he attempted to turn round and fell. I attempted to seize him to get the watch as he was on the ground, and five or six other young men immediately came round him from the left side of the court (it is a thoroughfare) they stopped down in different directions, and I observed the watch pass from his hands to the hands of the prisoner; the chain was fastened to the watch. He walked off leisurely, but seeing me following him, he ran off into Shoe-lane, towards Fleet-street. I pursued him with several others. He was stopped by a man within twenty or thirty yards. I never lost sight of him - he fell down in endeavouring to hide the watch in the dark. As soon as he took his hand away from it, a person near him put his foot on it, broke it, and ran off. I took it up, and the prisoner was taken to the watch-house.</p>

I immediately laid hold of him, and heard Mr. Mann say, he had picked the watch up. He resisted as much as he could.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 23d of July. I apprehended the prisoner in Liquorpond-street, at a house. I went up stairs, knocked at the door, it was instantly locked, and something was put over the key-hole. I looked through a broken pannel in the door, I thought I saw a man going towards the window. I ran down stairs, and as I going out of the back-yard, he jumped out of the window. I secured him.</p>

Richardson was taken about thirty yards off as he walked away.</p>

I ran over to the Mansion House, and got Wiltshire, we followed them, and near Messrs. Goodbehere's, the prisoners Shaw, Johnson, and Sweeney ran up to the prosecutor - Shaw picked the handkerchief out of his pocket; we immediately ran over, and laid hold of the three. Richardson went away; I am certain he was in their company - I ran and secured him. Directly we went up the prosecutor took the handkerchief from Johnson.

               <p>Q. And now you charge her with a capital felony - A. Yes. When she wanted money she had it - she laid out money for the house. I am a journeyman carpenter. When I left her at one o'clock all this property was safely locked up, and I had the keys. I returned about seven,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180064"/>found the apartments locked, and she was gone. Next morning I found her at the Fox, in Charter-house-lane.

            . I work on board a barge, and live at Hammersmith, with my parents. I have known the prisoners two or three years. One night about April I slept on board Gearey's barge - it was two or three days before I heard of this robbery, I was under the boats head - it is a decked boat, but has no tilt; between twelve and one o'clock in the morning, I knew their voices, I laid still, and did not speak; they could not see me. there was a box before me; it was starlight, and I could see them. They brought something large on board - Goodrick said</p>
               <p>"Don't make such a noise, or some one will hear you." And Samuels said</p>
               <p>"How much do you think this copper will fetch?" Burke said,</p>
               <p>"It will fetch 20 s. or 30 s. a piece." They put it in the stern of the boat, under the hatches; their boat laid at anchor a good distance from shore, they put it in the boat I was in. Next morning, about four o'clock, Ledgewood came and put me into Goodrick's boat, and I went to sleep, when I awoke the boat with the copper in it was gone. Goodrick came on board his boat, and said,</p>
               <p>"D - n you, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180065"/>thought I told you not to sleep in a boat last night. I have a great mind to lay a rope's end about your back." I had been at work for him that day, and had nowhere to sleep. About three o'clock the day before the robbery Thomas broke a window in the pavillion, and at the same time he picked up two pieces of marble, and said they would do to pave his hearth.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first tell about this robbery - A. The next day I told Ford, the bricklayer, that they must mind they did not get taken up. I told my father of it three or four weeks after, when I came from Brentford, where I had been at work.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. Was you not put in the workhouse, charged with this robbery yourself - A. Yes; I did not hear of the reward till I came to Hammersmith. I worked for Goodricke, he discharged me the day before the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q, You said nothing about it till you was accused - A. Not till I was fetched.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Who sent you to the workhouse - A. Mr. Hanson, the Magistrate. I was taken before him to tell what I knew, I was not charged with being the thief. I went to work at Brentford on the day of the robbery and remained there three or four weeks. I was afraid to mention it.</p>

I told him I had a coat to sell, if he knew any body who wanted it, he asked to see it; he pulled off his own coat, threw it down, and went out with my coat on his back, he remained out about five minutes. He asked how much I wanted for it; I said 2 l. 5 s. my wife said, nobody should have it under 50 s. He then ran out and through the passage of a public-house. I lost sight of him. He had put it on over his own, and ran off with both. I have not found it.</p>

Just as I passed them, two came from them, one laid hold of me by the arm. I asked what he wanted and went on. Then another came and took hold of my arm. I asked what he wanted, he gave no answer. Three others came up, and said if they could not have me they would have my wife. Three took her away, and four surrounded me, and my pocket was picked of four 1 l. notes; but whether any of them were the prisoners, I cannot say. I laid hold of the man, and called out Watch! took my notes from him, and ran across to the watchman, and said,</p>
               <p>"Why did not you come to my assistance." He took my arm, and as I was crossing the road with two watchmen, Smith came up, put his hand round me, and took my watch from my fob; he was one of those I saw at the corner. I caught hold of him, and the watchman took it out of his hand. I did not see Tubbs at that time. I think he was not one of the party.</p>
               <p>LEWIS MYERSON. I am a watchman. I was on duty on the spot. Stocks came over to me, and I went with him. I and another watchman laid hold of his arm. Smith came up, laid hold of Stock, put his arms round him, and said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180066"/>to me,</p>
               <p>"You shall not take him the watch-house." (I was going to take him home). I saw him pull the watch out, and endeavour to hand it to a companion behind him; there were seven in the gang. Wood said,</p>
               <p>"There goes the watch," but I had seen it myself. I secured Smith, and took it from his hand, with great difficulty we got him to the watch-house, several attempted to rescue him. I am almost positive Tubbs was active in endeavouring to rescue him. He was apprehended afterwards.</p>

I went to a house with the prisoner alone, she locked the room door. I said</p>
               <p>"Do not lock it, for my waggon is going on." She said she must have something to drink, and called the other girl up to fetch some. Three other woman came up and shoved me down stairs, and took my purse in a moment, and ran off. I am certain the prisoner was one of them.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 22d of August, about five o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner and two others in Ryder-street, endeavouring to get the lead off the porch of the prosecutor's door - two of them were on the ground and another on the rails. I heard the lead fall and ran up, they all ran away. I lost sight of them for near a quarter of an hour. The prisoner was brought back - I did not know him; he had a light coat on, and so had the man on the rails.</p>

On the 21st of July, about eight o'clock in the evening, I heard some one run across the passage, followed the person out of the gate, and saw two or three lads running down the road. I returned to the parlour, and called a neighbour, but missed nothing then. I saw the prisoner in custody in about half an hour, and found the miniature at the office next morning.</p>

            . I am a flax-dresser, and live in Globe-fields. At eight o'clock in the evening, I heard a cry of Stop thief! in ten minutes I went into our yard, and found the prisoner between some tar-barrels there, with his right hand under his arm, folding something in a handkerchief - I collared him and asked what he did there? he asked what business it was of mine? I found the miniature in his hat. He began fighting me, and I took him to my master - he told two or three different stories. He said he had been selling apples about with a donkey, and somebody gave it to him, but he did not know who; and then he said his brother gave it to him. He was given into custody.</p>

             keeps the house - I have known the prisoner four years. On the 21st of June he called and said I was wanted by an aunt of his in Giltspur-street, named Kidder, who wanted to apprentice a youth to me, and that she lived in Nevill's-court. I said I did not want one, but would go and speak to her. He began talking to me, and waited to go with me - I was washing myself to go. At this time the watch hung on the work-board; all my workmen had left. The moment I began to wash myself, he said he would go and fetch the youth. I turned round immediately he left and missed the watch - he did not return. I went immediately to the house, and found I was not wanted. He was apprehended in ten days. The watch was worth about 36 s.</p>

He then bought three pair of white stockings, which came to 8 s. 6 d. I observed some money in his hand, and from its appearance concluded it to be counterfeit. He laid down 8 s., all bad, and a good sixpence; I mentioned it to Mrs. James, who fetched a constable - I went and closed the door, and said he must not leave. They succeeded in opening the door, when Mrs. James came and prevented them leaving. Corby secured them - I gave him the bad money.

On the 2d of July, between five and six o'clock in the evening, the prisoners came in; Macquire called for a quartern of gin, which came to four-pence; She gave me a half-crown, which I put into my apron pocket - I had no other there. They drank the gin together, stopped full an hour at the bar, and then called for a quartern and a half more, which came to sixpence. Macquire paid for it with another half-crown, which I put into my apron pocket. Another woman came in, they drank together, and went outside; came back, and Welch called for another quartern. While I was drawing it, one of the three put down another half-crown - I put it with the others, and Welch took the change up. I had no others, but what they paid me.

I observed a small cotton bag in Macquire's hand. During this time another woman came in, had a pint of beer, and gave me sixpence; I said it was a bad one; Wortley took it, gave it to the woman, and she ran away. This made my sister look at the half-crowns, and she found them bad.

Lloyd was shabbily dressed. The prisoner immediately took it, he and Lloyd went on to Newby's, and came out without pawning it. The prisoner took it to the opposite shop. Lloyd and I waited outside, he then went to a third shop in Stanhope-street, the prisoner went in alone, Lloyd and I waited at the corner of the street, the prisoner came out, and gave Lloyd 15 s. and the duplicate, deducting some halfpence. Lloyd parted with us at the end of the street, he then took a boat, went up the river, and returned to the office.</p>

I saw all three take notice of gentlemen's pockets, they came close behind the prosecutor, I watched them narrowly, saw one, (I cannot say which) put his hand into Wall's pocket, and draw the handkerchief a little way, and as they got opposite Exeter-change, they made a pull at it, and it came out, they had kept close to him for about one hundred yards. One of them immediately crossed into the middle of the road, the other two went on. Mason secured the one in the road, I secured the others, searched them, but found no handkerchief.

As I was taking them up Catherine-street, a young lad, whom I knew to be a thief, came up, and spoke to one of them, he attempted to strike at me with a stick to get them away, but I took them to the watch-house.

I saw him looking at the window of the opposite house; they walked away towards Holborn, then returned to Rawlins's; each stooped down and looked through the area window, then went by the house to Greville-street, looked down the street, and returned to the house - nobody was passing. The other man took some instrument out of the prisoner's hand, which he screwed together, put them through the grating into the kitchen window, and drew it back with a spoon at the end of it, and gave it to the prisoner with the instrument. They crossed and went up a court next to my house, which leads into Gray's Inn-lane. I came down,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180072"/>went up the court, and met a woman, who gave me information. I went into Holborn, and saw them walking on the pavement towards the City. They returned, and crossed over to the east end of Middle-row; I saw some watchmen and informed them - they went round and met them; the prisoner was secured. I went after the other but he escaped. As the prisoner crossed the road in custody, the instruments were picked up exactly in the crossing he went over. I saw the spoon found on him.</p>

A person called Stop thief! I looked to my left, and about six yards off a person was taken - I saw that person put his hand behind him and missed the watch - it was picked up and given to me. They took the person into my house, and Taylor took him away. I do not know who he was.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was at this place with nine other officers. I saw a gang of thirty or forty coming at the head of the glass-blowers. We followed them from Battle-bridge, and saw them surround Mr. Marks - I saw the prisoners among them, but did not see them do anything then; I am certain they were in the gang. I saw Mr. Marks's watch on the ground, and a number of people scuffling for it; I picked it up, and gave it to the prosecutor. I took the watch out of his hand, or they would have taken it from him again. I took Dunton into Mr. Marks's fore-court; we shut him in, as there was a cry of Rescue! We afterwards took fourteen more of the gang - Winkworth and Chapman were among them.</p>

Winkworth and Chapman, I am certain, called the rest of the gang; they came up, I was knocked down, and lost both the prisoner and watch. Dunton was taken into the prosecutor's house. Several gentlemen complained of having been robbed.</p>

On the 18th of September, I had a shutter put up to guard my meat, the defendant came home at five o'clock in the afternoon, and instead of going into his house, came straight to my door, and insisted I should take the shutter down, or he would knock it down. I perceived he was in a state of intoxication, and therefore made no reply, but stood before my door serving my customers. It was Saturday, he was not deprived of his senses; he began to push the meat and the stall-board about. I merely laughed at him; he turned himself round, and attempted to take the shutter down, it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180074"/>very slightly hung on a hook. He pulled it different ways, but could not get it off, turned round, and swore at me. He had some crumpets in his hand, his wife was at the door; she begged him to come in, and not make a fool of himself, and took him by the arm to pull him in, but he thrust her away from him, came back to the shutter, and pulled it violently; he at last saw how it hung, and lifted it off; he walked fourteen or fifteen feet towards the road-side, and pitched it into the road with all his force. I went to pick it up, and as I passed him he said,</p>
               <p>"There, d - n you, I will serve you the same." In pitching it down he fell himself, that was before I went to take it up. I was on the footpath, not within reach of him, when he fell, standing with my hands tucked between my waistcoat and apron, his wife came and picked him up, and begged him not to make a fool of himself. Instead of going in, he came before the shop, and pulled the stall-board and meat about, swearing he had bought the whole of the ground, and the house was all his, he had paid for it, and I had no business there; he swore by all the oaths he could make, that d - n his eyes, he would make me shut up shop, and run away. His wife and some one took him in doors. He had not been long before he came out with a great coat on, and went down the road, he returned in about twenty minutes, with his arm in a sling, and d - d and swore how he would serve me, and make me spend every shilling I had. He pushed me away from the front of the shop, caught up a chopper, and swore he would split my skull with it. I took it from him, and told him to go in doors. As the people came up, he said,</p>
               <p>"D - n it, do not buy any meat of that b - dy butcher; whoever buys meat of him, ought to go to eternal damnation." He collected a mob before the door, I sent for a constable. Just before the constable came he ran up stairs, opened his first floor window, abused me from there, and advised the people not to buy of me, saying I gave short weight. Essex, the constable, came, he abused him in the same way, and set him at defiance.</p>
               <p>Q. In the whole course of the transaction did you strike or kick him - A. No; I never touched him except to take the chopper from him; I never struck or threw him down. I was afterwards taken before a Magistrate by him, and put into Giltspur-street Compter, and was served with the summons which Mr. Leigh attended on my behalf.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. His wife keeps a haberdasher's shop - A. There is a shop of that description. I did not go near him till after he fell. I snatched the chopper out of his hand; I did not trip up his heels or push him.</p>

            . I am a cooper, and live next door to Lloyd. On the 18th of September I was coming out of Mr. Fuller's house, six doors from Lloyd's; the prisoner passed, he seemed in liquor. I walked behind him past his own door up to Lloyd's; he desired Lloyd to pull his shutter down, Lloyd said he would not, and told him to go in. Derry immediately swore, and said</p>
               <p>"These premises I have paid for, and you have no business here," and began to pull his meat and cloth about. His wife came and said,</p>
               <p>"Come in, and don't suffer yourself to be laughed at." He gave her some crumpets out of his hand, caught hold of the shutter, and endeavoured to wrench it down, but did not succeed, and began throwing the meat about again, threatening Lloyd how he would serve him. He turned again to the shutter, got it off the book, and carried and threw it into the middle of the road, as far as his strength would admit, and in turning round from throwing it he fell. Lloyd followed him with both his hands tucked in his apron, as he had stood all the while, picked up the shutter, and gave it to me - I took it in doors. In the mean time Derry was picked up by his wife and a man; he was using very bad expressions all the time. I went away, and saw no more. Up to that time Lloyd had not touched him.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the Bank, and live in Pott-street, Bethnal-green. I was buying meat at Lloyd's, and saw Derry come up and abuse Lloyd in a most shameful manner about the shutter - he had not said a word to him. He made several attempts to take it down, he succeeded the second time, and threw it into the middle of the road; the force he threw it with threw him down - Lloyd had not laid a finger on him; his hands were in his apron or breeches, and could not possibly touch him, he was as cool as possible - he went and picked the shutter up, and gave it to Mr. Eldridge. I then went away.</p>

               <p>"You must take that shutter down or I will" - Lloyd refused. He then attempted to pull it down, went away, returned in a moment, and got it down; he took it out, and threw it into the middle of the road - as he turned round he fell. My master went and picked the shutter up - I think this was before Derry was down. My master never touched him, his hands were in his apron. He gave the shutter to Eldridge, who took it in. A woman picked Derry up, and he went in doors. He came out again, went away, returned in a quarter of an hour, and abused my master very much. He had his hand in a sling. He took a chopper in his left hand, and said he would split my master' skull with it; my master took it from him without any violence, and sent for an officer; when he came the prisoner had gone in, and he abused the officer from the window.</p>

I saw him kicking up a row about the shutter, which he endeavoured to take off, but did not succeed; the second time he got it off, turned and threw it down, and by throwing it he fell himself. Lloyd was two or three people from him at that time, and not near enough to strike or kick him. I saw every thing that passed. Lloyd went out and picked the shutter up. Derry's wife and some one came and took him in; he came back before the shop, and used most horrible language; Lloyd sent me for a constable, I returned with one; Derry was then up at his window, abusing Lloyd. After the constable was gone Derry walked before the door, and said if he had a knife he would stick him.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Bethnal-green-road. On the 18th of September, between five and seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner sent for me - he had a sling round his shoulder, which appeared to have had his arm in it, but he was in a violent passion at this time. He threw one arm down violently on the counter, and held a knife in the other, swearing he would stab Lloyd if he could get at him. He used both arms with great strength; if he had been hurt it would be impossible for him to have used them in that way - by the action of his arms they could not have been injured. I saw him nine or ten days after, putting up his shutters with both arms.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS addressed the Jury on behalf of the defendant, and called four witnesses to contradict the case, but they confirmed the evidence for the prosecution.</p>

On the 19th of August, about five o'clock in the morning, I was alarmed; I arose opened the parlour window, and saw Finnigan in his shirt, saying thieves were in the house. I let the watchman in, and heard footsteps going down the kitchen stairs - the watchman brought the prisoners up. A man next door brought some lead which I found had been stripped off the roof of my privy; I compared it, and it fitted exactly. My neighbour's privy had been stripped the week before.</p>

            . I lodge next door to Harding. I was getting up about five o'clock, and saw Walker coming down off the roof of the privy, and White take his apron off and putting a piece of lead into it. They must have got in at the door of No. 12 or 13 to get there. They heard me open the door, and got in at the back-door of No. 12. I alarmed Harding, and found the lead stripped off. A strange key was picked up in No. 13, which opened the door.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I wanted some money to prevent a friend going to prison, I could get none of Mr. Bowlen, and his wife told me to pawn these things. His house is a resort for thieves and bad people, he stops up till four or five o'clock to receive thieves and their goods. I intended to have his licence taken away, and he does this to prevent me. The second night I was there three young fellows came in with a box of jewellery and went up to bed. He has a back door for them to escape out of.</p>

            . I am a labourer, at Staines. On Wednesday night the 21st of June, I was at the Phoenix, public-house, at Staines; I saw the prisoner there with two more - I knew him before. I left them there about twenty minutes past ten o'clock - it is about one hundred and fifty yards from the prosecutor's stable; he lived in the neighbourhood. Between two and three o'clock next morning, I saw him and two others within thirty yards of the stable - I only saw their backs; they were going in a direction from the stables. I did not then know of the robbery.</p>

            . I am a postboy at Leatherhead. On the 23d of August, I was at the Swan at Egham, and saw the prisoner on the road. On the 25th of August, I was at my father's at Staines; the prisoner came and asked if I knew who wanted to buy a saddle and two bridles; I said No, and asked him what they were worth; he said 15 s., I said I would buy them in the morning. I informed Mr. Finch, and went next morning to the prisoner, to buy them, he was abed; he said I was to wait at the Phoenix, public-house, until he came; I asked him where the things were? he said it would not do, I could not have them till night, and they were at a house at Knowl-green, where there was no suspicion. I found him at the Phoenix, public-house, at eight o'clock at night - I gave him a bag to put them in. We went to Knowl-green - he brought them out in the bag. I gave him 15 s., and went away. It was a saddle, two bridles, and a martingale.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was at the corner of Crawford-passage, about one hundred yards from the workhouse. Hearing the alarm I followed the prisoner, who passed my box, and was running very fast across the road; I lost sight of him for five or six minutes, and found him in charge of Taylor. I fetched the prosecutor, who said he could not swear to him. The prisoner then said we ought to be sent to the watch-house for stopping him. While we were round him at the corner of Baker's-buildings, I saw him stoop down and take the watch from his trowsers; he rose up with it in his hand. We had before that searched him outside, and told him to go about his business.</p>

I stopped the prisoner at the corner of Bath-street, he appeared to be out of breath, when he saw me he turned back, I did not follow him, but went up Bath-street, met him again, and took him. Day came up and said he was the man. We took him to the corner of Baker's-row. The prosecutor said he was the man. The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"You cannot swear to me." He said he could not. He then talked of giving charge of the prosecutor. I let go of him, he said</p>
               <p>"You had better go to your duty." My brother watchman gave him a shove, and told him to go home to bed. I noticed that he did not stir his legs when he was shoved, he then stooped, as if to tie his shoe, and the watch was found, whether it was taken out of his hand or not, I cannot say.

We took him to the top of Baker's-row, the prosecutor came up and could not swear to him, but thought he was the man. I felt outside his coat, felt nothing, and told him to go about his business.

I heard a noise, went out, and saw the prosecutor and his friends going to fight, and saw Owen come across the road, I kept my eye on him. He went up to Mott, whose coat was off, and begged him not to fight, then put his elbows against his stomach, drew the watch out of his fob with the other hand, and walked about two yards, when Mott's friends told him his watch was gone. The prisoner immediately ran, a man collared and charged him with it. He strongly denied it. I stood behind him, and saw him throw it away. I picked it up, collared him, and told Mott it was his watch, and that the prisoner robbed him of it. He said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake forgive me, for the sake of my wife and family." I gave him in charge.</p>

            . I am a stationer, and live in Chapel-court, Swallow-street. On the 15th of August, about half-past one o'clock in the afternoon, I was at Hyde-park Corner, a procession was going to Brandenburgh-house, it had passed about a quarter of an hour, when the prisoners with another, ran by me down the road.

I went up, they separated on seeing me. Rowles got behind a cart, and put the handkerchief in his coat-pocket. I secured him, took it out, and took him to the gentleman, who refused to attend the office. Malcolm was apprehended that night. I am certain he is the person.</p>

            . I was with Ewer, and saw the prisoners and a larger boy, they were acting under his direction. I saw them try several gentlemens' pockets; they did it awkwardly, and the other seemed to reprimand them. I saw Land put his hand into a gentleman's pocket, then the big one interfered. I saw the handkerchief come from somewhere, and they ran into the crowd. I called to the gentleman, but lost him. I followed them round the square, and secured them. I found another handkerchief on Eden.</p>

There was a vast crowd of persons. I was holding my head down, not wishing to see the flames. I felt a something at my side, and saw a person's hand having hold of my chain; the watch was immediately snatched from my fob - I immediately collared the person who took it. He held up his hands, but had not got it then, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have not got it." He was taken from me by a constable before I could observe him. I do not think the prisoner is the person. Immediately as he said he had not got it a person picked it off the pavement.</p>

            . I am labourer to Mr. Parker, of Argyle-street. I was getting the things out of Mr. Thompson's house during the fire; my master had hold of Mr. Wakeley's arm, and told me to take hold of the other, as seemed much distressed. When I came to the door Mr. Wakeley said he had lost his watch, and I picked it off the pavement. My master's door was about five or six yards from the prosecutor's. I did not see him lay hold of any one. Some person kicked my arm to prevent my picking it up.</p>

He said two girls had robbed him, but he did not know they were women of the town - it is a very bad house.

I shewed him one, and said it was 5 s. - he returned it. I gave him the other into his hand, and asked 10 s. for it - he told me to brush another seal up. I went to get the leather and brush, and saw him put his hand behind him, and the other man put his hand into the prisoner's hand - he had not delivered me the other seal; my master came into the shop, then the prisoner's companion asked him what a dozen seals would be - he went out immediately - the prisoner then said,</p>

               <p>"What can you do these seals at a dozen?" My master told him, and, I believe, he grumbled. I went to get another seal, and recollected what I had seen, and told my master, that he had not returned the seal I shewed him; he stopped the prisoner - he said he had given me the seal, which was false - the officer took him. I should know the other man again. I am sure they were companions.</p>

I said 3 l. 16 s.; he said very well, he would call again on Monday, and immediately left the shop. The prisoner looked at a seal, and asked me the lowest price - I said 5 s. I asked the boy to reach a seal from the window, at 10 s. 6 d., he said he had shewn the prisoner that seal, and told me what he had seen.

            . I am a broker, and live in Old-street. On the 8th of July, between ten and eleven o'clock, the prisoner brought this floorcloth for sale, and asked 6 s. for it-it is worth 21 s., which made me suspect him. I asked him where he got it? he said a man sent him to sell it; I told him to send the man. He left the shop, went a step or two up the road, and loitered about for ten minutes. I kept my eye upon him. He returned and said the man was not at home, and demanded the floorcloth, or if I would buy it, I should have it for 5 s. I detained him.</p>

            . I am butler to the Earl of Morton. On the 29th of August, I was in the pantry, and laid the spoon in the window, which looks into the area. Between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner come down the area, and as he did not ring the bell I went to watch him, and saw him earnestly looking in at the window. Before I got to the hall door, I heard the pantry window open - ran back and saw his hand reaching in and take the spoon; I ran out to seize him - he threw the spoon down under the window and escaped - he had moved it about two feet. I followed him calling Stop thief! he knocked a man down, who tried to stop him. He was secured before I lost sight of him. He dropped it into the sink.</p>

I had told her to put it under my bed to press - she said she put it under my bed - she seemed flurried, and I went to look and found a parcel containing five handkerchiefs, under her own bed. (the scarf was under mine) I had seen them in the shop the night before. I told her of it, and turned her away. She was apprehended two days after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How many of your daughters slept with the prisoner - A. One who is about fifteen years old, and a niece seventeen years old. I sent the prisoner away on Friday.</p>

            . On Friday, while the prisoner was in the house, my wife informed me of this. I told her to keep her till I was at leisure. I then told her that two bundles in the shop had been misplaced and rumpled in the night, and some cambric taken away. The handkerchiefs were mine. She said it was the first thing she ever took. I was called down to the shop. I said she must not go away without being searched. I saw her go out while I was busy. I sent for Levy on Saturday; as my father knew the girl to be a thief, and I missed other things. We found her at her sweetheart's apartments. She was searched and the coins found on her, which I swear to be mine. They were taken from my looking-glass drawer, they were marked in a particular manner by a stamp. It was done some years back. She was then taken into custody, but let go again, as her father said he knew where all the property was. She was apprehended again on Sunday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long were the handkerchiefs missed before you turned her out of doors - A. She was not turned out exactly. My wife said she should not sleep in the house. I had missed nothing but the handkerchiefs when she left. They were worth 3 s. each. I missed no more that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, how soon after did you write to Mrs. Gasheer to make you amends for the false character she gave her - A. About three-quarters of an hour, and before I missed any thing else. I said 200 l. or 300 l. would not compensate for what I had lost. I demanded no money of Mrs. Gasheer.</p>
               <p>Q. When the coins were found on her, they were in your possession a day and a half afterwards - A. No. I kept them a few hours after, they were found on her on Sunday. I pointed the marks out when they were found, and gave them to the Magistrate on Monday, as the officer would not take them of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say your niece took them - A. She said so on Sunday.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. When you missed more property and told her of it, what did she say - A. She mentioned the person who was the instigator of it. Mrs. Gasheer is her aunt. The marks were on the coins before they were lost. Mr. Isaacs, the prisoner's attorney, attended before the Magistrate in my name without my authority.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. At the time Mr. Isaacs attended, was not the prisoner examined as a witness - A. I charged her with the robbery. One Jacobs was charged as the receiver.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long before had you marked the money - A. Some years. They were all marked with the same punch. I cannot find the punch now. This is the letter I wrote to Gasheer - (looking at it.)</p>

Her father and Cohen searched her, two shillings, a sixpence, and two halfpence were found on her.

I sent them by Wood, and gave him 3 d. for change. He brought them back, and asked for change of a 2 l. note. I gave him 17 s. in addition to the 3 d.; he returned with two 1 l. notes of the Milston-street Bath Bank, made payable at No. 11, Crutched Friars.

While he was in my house this lad brought a hat, the man went to the door; Wood had knocked at the door between two and three o'clock, he said he had brought a hat for the man, the man went to the door to him - it was not the prisoner - he was a country-looking man. I left them at the door, and did not see the boy give him the hat.</p>

             re-examined. I did not go into the house. I found the prisoner at the door, and am certain I did not knock at the door at all. When I returned with the change he was at the corner of the court. I afterwards took the notes back to get them changed, I knocked at the door then, and Mrs. Phillimore let me in - I had parted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180091"/>with the hat before this. She said the gentleman only came to take a lodging. I had not been in the house before, but when he ordered the hat he said if he should be out his wife would pay me. When I saw the prisoner at the corner of the court he went to the door, stood with one foot on the step, and paid me. There was another man standing in the court, leaning against a post. I am positive the prisoner is the man - I never doubted it.</p>

On the 27th of July, about half-past five o'clock in the morning, I hung this watch by the fire-place and went next door, leaving my door open, but kept my eye on it, and saw the prisoner come along the street smoking his pipe. I came out in a minute and a half, and saw him about twenty yards off; I went in, missed my watch, and saw some tobacco on the boards smoking. I ran out, he saw me, and ran. I called Stop thief! a constable collared him, and I took the watch out of his right-hand pocket - the shawl was found on him.</p>

On the 23d of August I was at tea in my back-room, and heard a noise at the window, which had been broken, and a plate put against it. I perceived the plate had been knocked down, and a quantity of thimbles gone. Next morning a little boy came to sell me a thimble which I knew to be one of them. He said he lived at No. 9, Steward's-rents, I sent him home. A girl came in and said, a boy was there with a quantity of thimbles. I went there, and found the prisoner laying on the floor on a blanket, and charged him with it. He produced the thimbles and snuff-box.</p>

A person who is not apprehended, came up and hit me a blow in my neck; I should know him again - I felt it for some moments. At the same time he snatched at my watch; the chain<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180095"/>broke, and he got the seals and key; he then handed it either to Edwards or Wherry, which I cannot say - they were immediately behind him in his company. I seized the man who struck me, and called for assistance. I was beset by several of them, and had stones and other things thrown at me - I still held the man until I was knocked down by several - I saw Wolfe among them. When they had partly dispersed, I got up and found several more hustling me to get my pocket-book. I got away as quick as I could - I was obliged to escape through a gateway into a marble-yard for safety. In an hour or two, I saw Edwards and Wherry among a crowd near White Conduit-house - I pointed them out to Smith; they were then secured. I seized Edwards myself, and gave him to Smith - they both ran away as they saw me with Smith and other officers - they were secured near thirty yards off. When I was in Portland-road, I had a second scuffle with the man I at first seized, and who had been rescued from me. I was struck at several times, and saw Wherry about the crowd. While I was being hustled, I felt a hand in my coat-pocket; as soon as I could turn round, I saw Wolfe was nearest behind me, and several loose papers about his feet, which were taken from my pocket. I was very much beaten. He was apprehended the next day. The second attack was twenty or thirty yards from where the first was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Whether Wherry or Edwards took the seals from the man, you cannot say - A. No, he extended his hand towards them. They were among the crowd while I was being beat - they threw stones at me; one of the stones hit me in the neck. They were along with the man at the time he robbed me.</p>

Edwards turned round and looked, and the whole gang ran off different ways. I followed and secured Edwards - he made great resistance. I told him he was a pickpocket - he then fought very hard, and one of those behind me struck me. As soon as I got hold of him, he whipped his hand into his pocket. I took two seals and a broken ring out of his hand; they have not been owned; he was trying to throw them away. I took him to the watch-house, and the other two were delivered to me.</p>

I first caught sight of Wherry and Edwards about a quarter of a mile off, in company together with several others. I saw Smith searching Edwards, and assisted in taking some of the gang.</p>

They all ran off except one, who tried to hinder me from pursuing the prisoner, but I did, and saw him take his hat off. I ran about a hundred yards. He was not out of my sight while I followed. Stevenson pursued the same man and took him. I saw the prisoner full five minutes before he came up, remembered him, and can swear to him. Stevenson and others brought him back in a quarter of an hour. The watch was produced before that. Mr. Carr is eighty-seven years old, his sight is very bad, and he knows nothing about it.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live at Bethnal-green. I was in the shop, and heard Body call Stop thief! She was pursuing the prisoner. I ran by her and met a gentleman who said</p>
               <p>"There he goes." He had turned round by the Greyhound. I saw him before he turned the corner. He was still running alone. I followed her to Green-street. He turned up North-place. I went a shorter way round, and met him at the end of North-place. He was then walking but very much heated and out of breath. I am sure he is the man. He said,</p>
               <p>"Have you got him?" I laid hold of him and said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, I have got him now." I did not exactly know what he had been doing, and as nobody came to my assistance I let him go. He turned short round and came back into Green-street as hard as he could. Before he had got to the bottom of North-place a person came up and said he had stolen a watch. I instantly followed him, he crossed Green-street, and I found him in custody in about five minutes. Some brick-makers had detained him till I came. I am certain he is the man. He strongly denied every thing, and said he ran because the people called stop thief. Directly Mrs. Body saw him, she said he was the man, and gave him in charge.</p>

            . I am an officer in the army. I was passing on the green when I heard the cry of stop thief, and saw Mrs. Body and four young men; one ran off and she pursued him. I followed and saw him take his hat off and wipe his face, and in putting it on again he threw his hand over the fore-court as if he threw something away. I lost sight of him. I went to the spot, and on the railing I found the watch; it had opened in falling. Wild took it up and delivered it to Body.</p>

About half-past eleven o'clock at night I was going to my lodgings, the prisoners accosted me in Brydges-street, and solicited something to drink. I wished them to pursue a better course, Smith said she should be very happy to do so, but was afraid her friends would not take her back. I walked with them, conversing on that subject, and then went to their lodgings in a court near the Theatre, I might have remained there three or four hours. I sat on the bed, and being particularly tired, I fell asleep - Byrne had left me with Smith. I had taken my coat off, the notes were in the pocket. I awoke about four o'clock, and missed them, Smith was then gone. I got Gooding, and we found the prisoners together in Wych-street - I am certain they are the women - we secured them, and took them to a house. As Gooding was going up stairs with Smith, something fell from her; we called for a light, and found, a half handkerchief lying on the ground, containing my notes; they have my writing on them.

            . I am an officer. I went with Mr. Corfe, and took the prisoner in Wych-street. I took Smith, and he took Byrne. As I was taking Smith up stairs in a coffee-shop, something fell from her. I found the handkerchief, containing two 10 l., one 5 l., and one 1 l. note, with three half-crowns and one shilling. She said she was sorry for it, and hoped he would forgive her.</p>

I saw the other two get on each side of Jones, the prisoner stood in front, and drew his watch out; I seized him and took it from him as he was putting it into his pocket. About forty thieves surrounded us, and if it had not been for the Bow-street officers we could not have kept him. I found a handkerchief on him, which he said was marked, but it was not.</p>

Another customer was there. Only myself was serving. The other customer left the shop almost immediately, and another came in. M'Kenzie asked to see some common lace; I handed her some; none suited her; I shewed her several cards. The other customer being in a hurry, I reached her some satin which was behind me; I turned round to do so - she bought some. I then turned to the prisoner again; she said none of the lace suited her and left the shop; I had observed nothing, and had not seen Williams. About twenty minutes after the officer brought the prisoner in, and enquired if I had lost any lace. From the quantity we have I could not tell. He produced twenty-three yards which I knew by the shop-mark. M'Kenzie had bought none. The lowest value is 11 d. or 1 s. a yard.</p>

I watched them into five different shops; sometimes one went in, and at others the other. I followed them to Sawyer's. M'Kenzie went in and Williams stood at the corner of the window. I could not see what M'Kenzie was doing. She came out and joined Williams - they walked away. I apprehended them about two hundred yards off, and found the lace in M'Kenzie's apron. Miller claimed it.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live at Battle-bridge. On the day of the Westminster meeting I was at Covent Garden, and saw the prosecutor standing by a man who was selling a composition, and saw the prisoner with two more try several gentlemens' pockets. I saw him try Simpson's pocket, then go away and bring two more; then saw him take the handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket. I asked him if he had lost anything - he said he had. When they saw me touch the prosecutor, two went one way, and the other another. I seized the prisoner, but did not find the handkerchief.</p>

I asked what he was doing, he said nothing, but moved off. I immediately kicked against the dirt, and found the lead secreted under it. I followed and overtook him in Long-lane; he begged to be let go, and said he did it through distress. I found a knife on him, which had marks of lead on it. I fitted it to the roof.</p>

I saw a crowd in Ball-yard as I stood at my shop, the prisoner and Harris were there, they ran out of the crowd together, and came up towards me. I knew them both perfectly well. In five or ten minutes, I heard the prosecutor had lost his watch. As they came towards me, opposite the Crown and Sceptre door, I saw Harris give the prisoner something which appeared to be a watch. They were about ten yards from me. I informed the constable.</p>

Badman was with him, but I did not observe him do any thing. Just as the boats started there was a sudden rush. I observed four or five bad characters, and told a person to tell me if the prisoners left the crowd. In a few minutes I was informed they had left. I came up with them on the bridge which leads to the lawn. Barnett was nearest to me, I took him, and Lewis took the other two, who were further off. We took them to the Guard-house.

This property was all fixed, except the three keys. They did not return - I went next, day all was right then. On Saturday morning, in consequence of information, I went to the house, and missed all the fixtures and three keys.

            . I am a sail-maker, and live in Dog-row. I was going up Dog-row, between five and six o'clock in the morning, and saw a quantity of people round the door of Forbes's house. I stopped, saw the door open, and in a few minutes the prisoner came out; I caught her in my arms, and held her until the officer came - she struggled to get away. I went into the house, and found the stove unfixed. Twenty-five shillings and four screws were found upon her, but no keys.</p>

            . I live in Herod's-place, Well-street, Well-close-square. On the 21st of July, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, I was coming from a dancing-house next door to Mrs. Williams, in <placeName id="t18200918-298-crimeloc1709">Dock-street</placeName>

As I came out I saw her at her door, but did not see her son; she moved her hands towards me; I did not see anything; nobody but her was near me. I immediately felt a great pain at my ancle like burning; I went home took my stocking off, and found three or four holes burnt in it; my shawl was all over with the same sort of stuff, and had holes in it; my gown was the same, and my petticoat. In the morning I went to Lambeth-street and took out a warrant against her; the other prisoner came to me and said he would serve me ten times worse, and said he was behind her at the time.</p>

Berry had a basket with willow-shavings at the top. and Halsey had a bundle of wood in his hand. They passed me, and went down Southampton-street. As they passed me Halsey put the wood in his hat. I got Colton to assist me, we found them at the back of White Conduit-house together. Halsey then had a bundle under his arm, and Berry had the basket. Halsey stopped while Berry went to several gentlemen's houses. We searched them, and found a latchkey on Berry, and a bridle on Halsey. He said he picked it up in the field. The basket contained nothing but shavings in it, when I first saw him the basket was bulky, but when I apprehended him there were only a few shavings. Halsey told the Magistrate he was to have 1 s. to carry the basket to Old-street.</p>

I knew him, and helped him to secure two people, and take them to the watch-house. I lost my watch in the crowd - I did not perceive it taken from me, it was safe when I entered the crowd - I did not miss it until the witness informed me of it. I am confident that Gilman hustled me twice in the mob. I found him at the watch-house on the Friday night following, and was certain of him the moment his hat was put on.</p>

               <p>"Come on!" Davis followed him; they went up the passage, and got close to Harris; a third person was then with them, Davis was going on the right side, Gilman pushed him, and said</p>
               <p>"Go along." He then went to the left of Harris, Gilman was close behind, he pushed Harris behind, and the others pushed him on each side. Gilman put out his hand and took out the watch. He said</p>
               <p>"Come on!" All three pushed out of the crowd, and went away. I followed them, as I wished to see where they went to. Davis asked Gilman to go down Chequer-alley, he objected, and they went first up Cowheel-alley. I looked at both full in the face; Gilman turned round, and said</p>
               <p>"What are you nosing at." I went up the street, tucked my apron up, went to the watch-house, and told Harris. I described them to the watchman, and on Monday night pointed Davis out at the corner of Chequer-alley; the officer took him. On Wednesday I pointed Gilman out, and he was taken; he had a new hat on then, but when he committed the robbery he had a shabby one. When an old hat was put upon him, Harris swore to his being in the mob.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. I stopped by the pastrycook's window as the procession passed. The prisoner was running with four or five behind him. He stopped directly he came to the prosecutor, looked round, and they all stopped in the centre of the door, made a rush, and I saw the prisoner snatch the prosecutor's watch. I am certain of his person. I told the prosecutor of it. Jones and I ran, caught the prisoner in a public-house in Oxford-street, and gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Who do you work for - A. Mr. Ward, of Pimlico. I am going to the East Indies. I live at Peckham. I lost sight of him, but I am certain he is the man.</p>

On the 10th of August,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180110"/>about ten o'clock at night, I met the prisoner, she asked me to go home with her, I said I had no money. She said she could pawn my watch in the morning. I went, she put out the light, took my watch from under my head, and went away. A man and woman came up, and said if I did not leave the house he would give me in charge. I went out, saw her running, and told the watchman, who took her. I was sober.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I bought the axe of the prisoner. He said his brother sent it him out of the country, but it was too heavy for him. I gave him 3 s. for it.</p>
