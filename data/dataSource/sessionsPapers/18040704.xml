             sworn. - I am an officer: On the 7th of June I had a warrant to execute on this gentleman; the prisoner at the bar took out a warrant for an assault on her person; I went to Newington-green, and I informed the gentleman I had a warrant against him; he then asked where the servant was; I told Mr. Jones I believed she was somewhere about the Green, I would go and see for her; I found her, and brought her to Mr. Jones's house; Mr. Jones insisted upon her taking her boxes away, and begged of me to assist her in getting her boxes out of the room, which I did; I moved her boxes out of her room into the study; Mr. Jones then said, he would wish to look into the box before it was taken out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the box locked? - A. It was, and the prisoner had the key; we got the key from the prisoner, and unlocked the box, and there were two handkerchiefs, and a quantity of soap and candles; the prisoner seemed very much alarmed, and said somebody must have put them in when she left the house; as I was bringing the box down stairs, she seemed very desirous that her master might look into her box to see that every thing was right.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a lock was it on this box? - A. It was one of the crooked wards, not a common lock, and it was a crooked key.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Prosecutor.) Have you any other servant in the house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married man? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I unlocked the box up stairs before it was brought down; I had been ironing, I put some of my things into my box.</p>
               <p>Ray. You did look up some things that were about the room, but did not unlock the box.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Prosecutor.) Were the handkerchiefs marked? - A. They are marked in full length R. Jones, with ink, and there were some soap and candles in the middle of her box; they were exactly like what was in the house; I cannot swear to the candles and soap, the handkerchief had been rough-dried, and put by a month before in the wardrobe; I put them away myself, they are winter handkerchiefs; I put the key in the drawer underneath, and she must have got the key; I have exerted myself in enquiring her character, and never could find any thing to hurt her character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I quitted Mr. Jones's service by his ill-usage of throwing water over me, and he marked me in my arm with the pail; I left my things some ironed, and some not ironed; they were bundled up in a heap, and my box was not locked, I put some of my things in, in a hurry; I do not know that I have all my things, my double handkerchief I left on the chair, I folded it up, and put it in my box; I know nothing of the things coming into my box, without I put them in by mistake.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you accuse her of? - A. Of stealing eleven Bank-notes. On Thursday, the 17th of May, a little before one o'clock, as myself and family were sitting down to dinner, the prisoner came instantly down stairs, and entered the room where we were, and said there was a man in our chamber up stairs; I immediately got up, and secured the front and back door; I went up stairs, and when I entered the room, there was a sheet taken off the bed, and spread on the floor, upon which was all my wearing apparel taken out of the wardrobe, which were seven coats and seven waistcoats, and four pair of breeches, and a suit of clothes; besides on the table, which stood just against where the clothes were laid on the sheet, was laying my pocket-book, with a number of Bank-notes upon it, which were taken out of the book; I took the notes and book, and put them in my pocket; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040004"/>immediately sought the house all over to see if I could discover any person; I could not discover any person in the house but our own family; I concluded that if there was any person, as I then thought there had been, they might have slipped down stairs after the girl; I blamed the girl for not holding the door, and calling me; she said, she saw the person in the room in a light-coloured coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Were it possible that any person might have followed the girl, and have gone out? - A. It was possible; after we had given up the search, I took the book, and counted the notes, and found there were eleven missing out of the thirty-eight that were in the book; some hours after, I conceived it an awkward circumstance, and, ruminating in my mind, a thought struck me whether the girl could have any concern in the business; the day past over, we did not make any discovery; but, on the following day, my wife told me the prisoner had been at her box, and if I would satisfy myself, she would have me examine it; I went down stairs, and got Hawkins to bring the box down stairs; the prisoner was in the room, and said, that is my box, Sir; I replied, I knew it was, I wished to see the inside of it; I asked her to give me the key; she gave the key to Hawkins, and we opened the box; in undoing her things, in a piece of muslin, a caul of a cap, was pinned up ten one-pound notes out of the eleven, and nearly a pound was found in her pocket that had been changed; I desired Hawkins to put the notes in the box, and lock it, and keep the key in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know these notes to be your's? - A. I believe them to be mine; there is a witness or two present that can swear to them.</p>

             sworn. - I am a publican, I live at the corner of Wilderness-row, Goswell-street: On the 16th of May, I paid Mr. Wood thirty-eight pounds in Bank of England notes, all but one, which was a country one-pound note; I know them all again, (looks at them;) I endorse every note I take, I know them all to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Collins.) From whom did you receive these notes? - A. From my wife, and she received them from the prisoner; and when I received them, I counted them over, and put them in my pocketbook; I had not another note in my possession at that time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I should have replaced the notes, but the book was taken away; there was nineteen shillings and sixpence in my pocket left out of the one pound I changed; with the other sixpence I bought a pencil and some cakes for my master's children; I have received several sums of money for my master, and never robbed him before.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you compare it with any linen in your shop? - A. I went and compared it with the linen in my warehouse, and I have no doubt at all it was mine.</p>


               <p>Q. Had the prisoner the liberty to take any part of your linen on his own account? - A. By no means.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think is the value of this five yards and a half? - A. Six shillings; I went to the Office in Hatton-garden, and had a search-warrant; I attended the execution of that warrant to the prisoner's lodgings in Tash-street, where his children were, and there I found half a yard of linen, which was cut in what we call sleeve gussets, two yards and a quarter of brown Holland, two yards of jean, five yards and a half of coloured cotton, about a yard of mixed woollen cloth, and sundry remnants of cotton; I knew them to be mine, I have pieces to match in my house that were found in his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has this man been with you? - A. Some months, I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. What wages had he from you? - A. Twenty-nine shillings a week.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. You have said he had a wife and two children? - A. He has.</p>
               <p>Q. When he asked you to forgive him, did he say any thing more? - A. He only begged and prayed me to forgive him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he has only two children, perhaps he may have more? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How many children did you find in his lodgings? - A. There was a young child, and a girl, I suppose she might be eleven or twelve years old.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Q. The only reason that induces you to believe that the property found at the prisoner's house is your's, is that it matches with the property at your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So it would if you had sold it? - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. When this man, Coffey, took this linen from the prisoner, you were outside? - A. The moment Coffey took it, he held it up, and I went in immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. How many yards did this piece contain? - A. About twenty-five yards; I cannot say I measured it, it was linen I bought and had it dyed, and there is the man's stamp that dyed it.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. He and his wife lodged in my second floor for four or five years; I know nothing of this business.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. (To Prosecutor.) Look at the things produced, and tell us whether you know any of these things are your's? - A. These seven shirts belong to me, six are striped cotton sea-faring shirts, and one white soldier's shirt, with a frill; there is no mark upon them; I employ a man in the country who makes the whole of this cotton.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these seven shirts? - A. They are valued at one pound eight shillings and sixpence; I had only a remnant, a yard and a half, of swansdown in the house, and the piece of swans-down found in the prisoner's lodgings is not quite a yard; I have the other piece here, and the piece found at the prisoner's lodgings make up a yard and a half; it is the same pattern, I value that at two shillings; the buttons I cannot speak to myself, they are in this paper with the word middling upon it; it is the writing of my young man, they are valued at four shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. These shirts have no mark on them? - A. No, I know them by the pattern and quality.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not any person find in shops of the same description, shirts of the same quality and pattern? - A. I do not think they could for width, length, pattern, and quality; I know so well the particular patterns, and the cotton the man makes by contract, I know I am perfectly right.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he a patent to make that pattern? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many different shirts have you sold? - A. A great many.</p>
               <p>Q. And no mark on them at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, with respect to that piece of swans-down, you did not make that? - A. I did not; I only say that was in my possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to state, from your own knowledge, that it was in your possession before the 19th of May, or do you speak so because some of your servants knew that? -</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you yourself observed that individual thing in your stock? - A. Yes, a little while before, on the 30th of April I took stock.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. On the 30th of April you took stock, did you yourself notice that there was only a yard and a half of that swansdown? - A. Particularly so, and on the 19th of May I found but half the remnant.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, with respect to the shirt-buttons, there is your servant's mark upon the paper, and that piece of paper was in your warehouse - do you swear to the buttons? - A. I can give you a fellow-parcel of buttons to it.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to say they are not common buttons? - A. They are not common buttons.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (Shews the buttons to the Court.) They are common sugar-loaf buttons.</p>
               <p>Q. Persons, who are not slop-sellers, do make use of them? - A. They do.</p>

               <p>Q. You had many others marked in the same way, middling, and the same sort of buttons? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell me how many more persons, slop-sellers, might or might not have in their possession as many as there are persons dealing in the articles? - A. Yes, we do not sell them, we put them on shirts; in that paper is twelve gross.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not sell buttons - now, supposing the paper in which buttons is bound up that are to be used, when the paper is empty, what becomes of it - it is waste paper, is it not? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What state did Dixon appear to be in; was he in liquor? - A. He did not appear so at the time; his lips were a little cut; while I was in the watch-house there was another watchman went and searched, and found a ribbon; he is not here.</p>

I never saw the man before in my life; as I was coming down Charles-street, I saw this man, with two or three more about him, and then they set off a running; I passed that watchman, and he asked me what was the matter; I told him there were two or three about him, and he was lying in the middle of the road when I was coming down the street; the reason I did not run as well as the rest did, is that I was only going home.</p>

               <p>Q. Who were they? - A. The prisoner was one; they met me, and the prisoner accosted me; I had never seen him before; the prisoner tried to tear the locket from my neck; it was fastened by a ribbon; he tried to pull it off but he could not; then he struck me on the face and on the breast; he tore my handkerchief off my neck, knocked me down, and tore my locket from me; I called out watch, and kept hold of him; he said, if I insisted on holding him he would murder me; then the watch came up, and took him out of my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive the locket go from you? - A. Yes, entirely, and he threw it away at the watch-house door; a gentleman came up and said he saw him do it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of this locket? - A. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040008"/>gave 25 s. for it; I bought it of a pawnbroker; it was a gold locket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You say you do not carry on any business, what have you done for a livelihood? - A. I have lived with a gentleman these three months.</p>
               <p>Q. You describe the prisoner to be one of the men who came up to you without any assault? - A. They did, and then knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. In the way you describe you never had said a word to him; nor ever took hold of his hand at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not kiss you, I dare say; nor you him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live now? - A. No. 50, in Wardour-street, Soho; the other two men walked off; they both left me, and he was the only person that stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. You never said a word to him? - A. Upon my oath I never spoke a word to him, nor he to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Your name is Brown, is it not? - A. No; my name is

             sworn. - I am collecting-clerk to Messrs.

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. So, Bacon, they were both taken to the watch-house, both the young man and the woman? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to take the woman into custody? - A. The woman gave charge to me of the man, and likewise it was my duty to take them that gave the charge; I took them both together, at half-past eleven o'clock; I left my box, and went down the Strand from St. Clement's church; they were standing in Surry-street, and she was holding him by the neck; I asked her what was the matter, and she gave charge of this man to me.</p>
               <p>Q. When she came to the watch-house, how were her clothes? - A. They seemed to be very well; I heard her complain a little of the bruises on her breast, while I was there; I was soon sent out on my duty.</p>
               <p>Q. Was her handkerchief torn? - A. No; it was very well.</p>

About half-past eleven o'clock on Sunday night, as I was coming down the Strand, by Somerset-house, this woman came up to me, and asked me if I would give her something to drink; I said no and went on; there were three or four people coming on; I saw one cross the road, and run away; I came back; she told me she had lost her locket; I told her to call the watch, and she called the watch, and they found the locket in the road, and they took me to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner with you at the same time? - A. Yes; he was paid at the same time; he asked me if I would go as far as the Bell, and have a pot of beer; I told him I did not care if I did; it was scarcely above a quarter of a mile; we had a pound of mutton and two pots of beer for our supper, at the Bell; I told him, when we had had the two pots of beer, I should go to my lodgings; I said to him, I will not have any more, I have had plenty; then we had about a quarter of a mile to go; we came very steady.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out of the Bell together? - A. We did.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you go? - A. About a quarter of a mile; we lodged in a barn at Mr. Ives's; he was in one barn and I in another; he is an Irishman, and the Irishmen live in one barn and the English live in the other; there are two houses of Mr. Ives's, a dwelling-house, and a farm-house<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040009"/>besides, and between those two houses he knocked me down with his fist, and he flung his body on me; I asked him what he was going to do with me; he said, d - n your old blood, I'll have your life and your money both; he said, if you speak another word, I'll have your life this very moment; when he had abused me, and got my money, he ran away; I was five minutes before I could get up.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it he took? - A. My purse, a seven-shilling bit, two shillings in silver, and three shillings and a penny in penny bits and halfpence, in all twelve shillings and one penny; the seven-shilling bit was wrapped up in a bit of white paper, with a red binding round it; there was some reading on it, but I am no scholar; I cannot read, but it was wrapped up in that.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of purse was it? - A. I do not know; it was not canvas; it was made of some sort of linen cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of him after he took the money? - A. He ran away from me before I got up; where he went to I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Your purse and money were found the next day? - A. Yes.</p>

I neither struck you nor took your money in Hendon; my prosecutor had so much liquor the publican refused to draw us any more; said he, as you and I are going to London, here is my money, take care of it for me; I did not want his money; I said take your money.</p>

               <p>Q. What became of you that night, after you were robbed? - A. I went to my lodgings in the barn, and this man was taken in the morning before I went to London; I staid at my lodgings till six o'clock; he was in custody at Hampstead before that time, and the gentleman that stands behind me took him into custody himself.</p>

             sworn. - I live at Hampstead; I am beadle and constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet with the prisoner at the bar there any time on Sunday? - A. About seven o'clock, as I was coming out of my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. What time? - A. Just after seven o'clock on Sunday last, the prisoner at the bar passed me; I looked very hard at him, and when I went a little higher in town a countryman came and told me of a robbery; I went and stopped him at the King's Head, the corner of Church-lane, Hampstead; I searched him, and took all his money from him; I took from him 7 s. 6 d. in silver, and 2 s. and a penny farthing in penny-pieces and halfpence, and that purse.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in that purse? - A. A seven-shilling piece, wrapped up in that piece of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it tied up with any thing - he said it was tied up with a piece of red binding? - A. No binding at all; the border on the paper he calls a binding; there were more half-pence in his pocket, but I gave him five-pence halfpenny to pay for the liquor he had drank. (The money and purse produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. (To prosecutor.) Look at that purse? - A. (Looks at it.) I will take my oath to this purse; I have had it seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that paper? - A. That is the paper I wrapped it up with.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the binding? - A. This piece of red I call the binding.</p>
               <p>Court. That is the border.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been working for Mr. Cloud for a month; on Tuesday last week this man was <rs id="t18040704-7-viclabel37" type="occupation">employed at hay-making</rs>

I do not suppose this here gentleman is any acquaintance of my prosecutor's; I deny knocking him down or tumbling upon him; if I had threatened or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040010"/>tumbled upon him he would have some marks upon him; I had nothing on me but an old smock frock; there was a Jew with this old man; he said to him, if we can condemn him it will be the best hay-harvest we ever had; I have sailed all the last war in his Majesty's service with Captain Rodney, and I have sailed with Sir Hyde Parker, and I never came to disgrace, so much as the lash of a cat; if you wish to send to Mr. Cloud, you will find I never had a miss word from him.</p>

               <p>Halms. The old man never said any such thing.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. I believe you live at the Adelphi-terrace? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you intimately acquainted with Mr. John Brown? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. On Friday the 16th of March, did you accompany Mr. Brown to Baker's coffee-house? - A. I did, in Change-alley, Cornhill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and Mr. Brown then meet with the prisoner at the bar, Mr. Jackson? - A. We did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any bills at that time deposited in the hands of Mr. Jackson? - A. We met at the hour of twelve, and Mr. Brown then had a bill for two thousand five hundred pounds, accepted by Leerworth and Lindsey, which Mr. Brown said was not so cashable, and therefore requested it to be split into two bills, one of one thousand two hundred pounds, and the other of one thousand three hundred pounds, this was about the hour of twelve; Mr. Brown observed, that he supposed Leerworth and Lindsey, who were the accepters, and who were to be the accepters of the one thousand two hundred pounds, and the one thousand three hundred pounds, could have no objection, but he would inquire of them, and return again in the course of an hour or two; we then appointed Mr. Jackson to meet Mr. Brown at Baker's coffee-house, about two o'clock; we met at two, and Mr. Brown had then received the acceptances of twelve and thirteen hundred pounds, which he gave to me, and I delivered them to Mr. Jackson; it was handed from my hands to Jackson.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that, was that one of the two bills which you handed to Jackson? - A. I am confident it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a receipt for the two bills? - A. Yes; I wrote it, and Jackson signed it. (The receipt read.)</p>

               <p>Q. At that time, was this bill endorsed or unendorsed? - A. Most positively not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between Mr. Brown and Jackson respecting the endorsement? - A. Jackson<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040011"/>proposed that he should bring a person to Baker's coffee-house about the hour of five, with the money for these bills; I observed to him, that I could not be in the City at five, but that he had better bring the money to my house, with the person who was to give it, and then the bills should be endorsed, and Mr. Brown receive the money; I further observed not to bring banker's checks, but Bank-notes, or cash; Mr. Jackson then agreed to come to my house for that purpose, at a quarter after five o'clock; Mr. Brown, though engaged to dine, postponed that engagement, and dined with me at my house, for the purpose of meeting Jackson.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did Mr. Brown come to your house? - A. Mr. Brown came to my house a quarter before five.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did any person come to inquire for Jackson? - A. About six o'clock, or five minutes after; a person brought a note, but I did not see the person.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the note which was brought? (shewing it to him) - A. Yes; Mr. Brown shewed me the note; I have no doubt that that was the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Brown give a verbal answer to the messenger who brought that note? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that did Mr. Brown quit your house? - A. As soon as his servant could call a coach; I don't think it was ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw no more of Mr. Brown that night? - A. No; nor till half after twelve, or a quarter after twelve the next day.</p>

               <p>Q. After Mr. Brown had left you, did the prisoner, Jackson, come to your house? - A. He did, about half after seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Have the goodness to state what then passed? - A. I was in my front parlour, with some West-India friends who were going to embark, and writing some letters to send with them; I went into the back room with Mr. Jackson, and he told me he was disappointeed in getting the bills done, but if Mr. Brown would let him have them by nine o'clock the next morning, he might be certain of having the money at twelve; I observed to him, as I had an appointment in Windmill-street, at ten o'clock, it was impossible I could deliver the bills to him at nine, and therefore he had better keep them; and he appointed Mr. Brown and myself to meet him at Baker's coffee-house, at twelve o'clock, on Saturday the 17th.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, the next day, meet Mr. Brown at Baker's coffee-house? - A. I did, about a quarter after twelve, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate to Mr. Brown, that night, the appointment you had made? - A. Yes; I sent my servant to inform him, that we were to meet there at twelve o'clock; we remained there about ten minutes; I was backward and forward between Baker's and Lloyd's coffee-houses several times; I was not there when Mr. Combe came in first.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did you see Mr. Combe with Mr. Brown? - A. I rather imagine it was near three o'clock; it might be from half after two to three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any information which Combe gave you, what did Mr. Brown do? - A. Mr. Brown and myself went immediately from Baker's coffee-house to Messrs. Newnham, Everitt, and Co. bankers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find Mr. Jackson? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Brown do any thing else? - A. We were a little confused; Mr. Brown, at the recommendation of Mr. Combe, traced the notes so as to stop them at the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you endeavour to find Jackson? - A. No; we went to the Bank, and then we went to the City-Marshal, Mr. Nalder; we could not find Mr. Jackson, we went to the place he called his accompting-house, in Spread-eagle-court, with Mr. Nalder, but he was not there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. In what line of life are you? - A. A merchant.</p>
               <p>Q. Residing where? - A. In the Adelphi-terrace.</p>
               <p>Q. You are speaking of a transaction which took place as long ago as March last? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been long acquainted with Mr. Brown? - A. Upwards of twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been in the habit, with Mr. Brown, of assisting him in getting money for him? - A. Never at any other time, nor at this time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear of his applications to persons to borrow money? - A. Yes, from his own report.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Mr. Brown had been obliged to raise money in this sort of way? - A. No; he had applied to Messrs. Manning and Bosanquet, one of the first West-India houses in town, but not in this way.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing particular in this transaction more than any other transaction? - A. No; excepting from an advertising broker, and the exorbitant interest.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any memorandum at the time of the transaction taking place, so that you could resort to them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what you say depends upon your memory, at this distance of time? - A. Most undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Jackson was to have come at the time appointed, and he sent some excuse by letter? - A. Yes, to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. But in point of fact, he came very soon after Mr. Brown was gone? - A. About an hour and a half after.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the bills were not to be endorsed till the money was paid? - A. That was understood, both by Mr. Brown and Mr. Jackson.</p>
               <p>Q. What period of time was there from the first time Mr. Jackson had the bills, till you met at Baker's coffee-house, and saw Mr. Combe? - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040012"/>The bills were delivered to him on the Friday, and we met about three o'clock on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen much of Mr. Brown during that interval? - A. No, I had not seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner had the possession of these bills from the Friday to the Saturday? - A. I don't know to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know, of your own knowledge, whether Mr. Brown and he met between the middle of the day on Friday and the Saturday? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it at your request, or the prisoner's, that the bills were permitted to remain in his hands? - A. Neither one nor the other; but I observed that as it was impossible for me to deliver him the bills at nine o'clock, he had better keep them.</p>
               <p>Q. That you told him? - A. Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. When the bills were delivered to him, there was no difficulty at all on his part to give a receipt for them? - A. Not the least.</p>
               <p>Q. He made not the least hesitation? - A. None whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. From the nature of the transaction, did it occur to you to make any particular remark, excepting the exorbitance of the interest? - A. I knew nothing of Jackson, and advised my friend to have nothing to do with an advertising broker.</p>
               <p>Q. But excepting that, there was nothing extraordinary in the transaction? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any occasion, I don't mean from any necessity of your own, but have you ever had occasion to apply to an advertising person for yourself, or any of your friends? - A. Never, upon my oath, neither; I am merely in acts of friendship with Mr. Brown, and not in acts of business.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Be so good as to state what passed between you and Mr. Jackson on the Tuesday preceding? - A. Mr. Brown gave me a bill for 2500 l. and in consequence of what Mr. Brown told me, I met Mr. Jackson at the City coffee-house, Cheapside; Jackson wanted me to give him the bill for 2500 l. that he might shew it to a gentleman to discount; I told him I could not deliver it without Mr. Brown's desire; I met him again, I think, on the Wednesday, but it was either the Wednesday or Thursday, I cannot be positive to the day, at the City coffee-house, and with Mr. Brown's concurrence, I gave him the bill for 2500 l.; that bill was afterwards returned to Mr. Brown.</p>

               <p>(A letter read, addressed J. Brown, Esq. Buckingham-street, Strand, No. 10. Signed J. Jackson, Spread Eagle-court, 10th March, 1804.)</p>
               <p>"Dear Sir, - I am sorry to inform you a slight accident has prevented me from coming to you as I wished and promised. I have however taken the liberty of writing you a note to inform you I have seen the gentleman with whom I am arranging your business; he has informed me it will be absolutely necessary for him to have your bills unendorsed at least three hours in his possession, previous to his giving the cash, and then you endorse them, without which the bills are useless. He has made his arrangements for Tuesday, and wishes that day to compleat them, for reasons which I will tell you when I see you. If Messrs. Leerworth and Lindsey mean to accept the bills, it is of small consequence whether they accept them on Tuesday, or any other day; and as the gentleman with whom I am engaged will accept them with myself, there can be no objection to their being trusted three or four hours in our hands."</p>
               <p>(Another letter read, addressed J. Brown, Esq. Buckingham-street, Strand. Signed J. Jackson, dated 13 March, 1804.)</p>
               <p>"Dear Sir, - Inclosed is a letter I have just received from W. Combe and Co. Queen-street, Cheapside, the house that was to discount your bill. You will perceive from it the unfortunate delay which my caution occasioned, has produced a delay still more unfortunate. However, I have seen Mr. Combe, who informs me it is a matter of small consequence whether the bill is made into five, or whether it remains in one, and begs me to say, if Friday will be more convenient, their house can do it. I have written to prevent Mr. Akers an unnecessary journey, particularly as I am engaged at that hour: I appointed to meet a gentleman at Westminster. I hope these delays will not be attended with any unpleasant consequences, and I trust this letter and its inclosure will convince you of my incapability of performing my engagement."</p>
               <p>(Another letter read, addressed J. Brown, Esq. at Mr. Akers's, Adelphi Terrace. Signed J. Jackson, dated 16th March, 1804.)</p>

               <p>"Dear Sir, - Your bills are in that situation that they will certainly be done, but owing to the lateness of my friend seeing Mr. Leerworth, they cannot be done to night. If you will leave them with me to night, they shall be done in the morning, or if you have them back of me, and I can again have them at nine, they shall be done by twelve. Do send word by the bearer, which you will do. I wait your answer."</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. Q. Do you remember taking a note to Mr. Brown? - A. Yes, on Friday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive a message to carry back to your master? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. Where did you receive the message? - A. I received it from Mr. Brown.</p>

               <p>Q. What was that message? - A. To tell Mr. Jackson to bring the bills up to him that night, and he would see him to-morrow at twelve at the City coffee-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master was to bring the bills to Mr. Brown? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was with your master at the City coffee-house? - A. I did not go in; Mr. Jackson came out of a private room; a gentleman came out of the room after him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Akers? - A. I heard his voice, but did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a hackney-coach at that time at the door of Mr. Akers's house? - A. There was.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you receive a written answer, or a verbal one? - A. I received no written note.</p>
               <p>Q. You have sworn that, to the best of your belief, the letters shewn to you were the handwriting of the prisoner; did you ever see him write? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him write his name? - A. Yes; but not to take particular notice.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how are you able to swear to his handwriting? - A. I cannot swear to it; I believe it to be his hand-writing.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. In the month of March last you carried on the business of a warehouseman, in Queen-street, Cheapside? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you for some time before that been acquainted with the prisoner Jackson? - A. About three weeks before the 13th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any application to you upon the subject of-bills? - A. In the course of conversation he mentioned a bill of 2500 l. that was about a week before the bills were dated; he told me Mr. Brown was a very respectable man from the West-Indies, and had lately purchased a large estate in this country; he said Mr. Brown had an instalment to make by a certain day upon this estate, and that he wanted to raise the money, for which he would allow 15 per cent.; and he said Mr. Brown was in the habit of consigning his goods to the house of Leerworth and Lindsey, upon whom he was going to draw bills; he told me they were to the amount of 2500 l. nine months after date, from the 1st of March; I told him at first I could not do any thing with the bills at so long a date, however respectable they might be; upon his suggestion that the house was of the first respectability, and that if that house was not liked, he could draw upon any other, I told him there were a certain description of goods for a long credit, that he might buy and sell them again at a very small loss.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you mention to him what description of goods? - A. Irish linens.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Jackson say to that? - A. I don't immediately recollect, but he told me the house upon which they were drawn, who was to accept, and where I might enquire Mr. Brown's character; upon which I made application to the house of Webster and Corbett; I saw Jackson, and told him Messrs. Webster and Corbett were perfectly satisfied with the acceptors, and would sell Irish linens to the amount of one half.</p>
               <p>Q. One half of what? - A. Of the 2500 l.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Jackson say to that? - A. He desired me to get it done as soon as possible, because Mr. Brown was a man who very much respected him, and if he could transact this to his satisfaction, he would accommodate him, Mr. Jackson, with acceptances to the amount of 2 or 3000 l. upon the same house, which, if I would give him a share in my concern, he would throw into it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any agreement? - A. Yes, on the Friday, for the linens; one bill was to be 1300 l. and the other 1200 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in the course of that Friday receive from Jackson two bills? - A. About two o'clock on Friday, the 16th of March, Jackson called upon me, and said, as Mr. Brown was a man of high honour, he did not wish them to be shewn about the market; he gave me two bills, and desired me to take them to Messrs. Webster and Corbett's, to enquire into the acceptance: one was for 1200 l. and the other for 1300 l.; I took them to Webster and Corbett's in Friday-street, and gave them to Mr. Corbett.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time was this bill for 1300 l. indorsed, or not indorsed? - A. It was not indorsed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give them both to him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in the course of that afternoon, receive them back from Mr. Corbett? - A. Yes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040014"/>in about half an hour; about two o'clock young Mr. Corbett brought them back to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after Mr. Corbett brought them back to you, did you see Mr. Jackson? - A. In about an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you and Jackson then? - A. I gave him back the bills, informing him that Mr. Corbett had made enquiry, and was perfectly satisfied; I desired him also to get the bills indorsed, as they were to be paid over before the linens were delivered.</p>
               <p>Q. When were the linens to be delivered? - A. As soon as the bills were paid that evening, if the bills were paid in time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any appointment between Jackson and you to meet again? - A. Not particularly; he was in the habit of calling three or four times a day at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take the bills with him at that time? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see him? - A. About half past six, at my warehouse; I asked him if he had got the bills indorsed; he said he had sent them to the City coffee-house for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with him then to the City coffee-house? - A. No; in a short time after Jackson's lad returned, and called Mr. Jackson out; when Jackson came in to me, he said Mr. Brown had not indorsed the bills, and was rather angry at his having sent the lad up to him; I told him he must get the bills indorsed and paid before the goods would be delivered; he told me if I would go to the parties to see that the goods were getting ready, he would himself go to Mr. Brown and get them indorsed; he then left me; I went to Webster and Corbett's to see that the goods were getting ready.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Jackson come to you again? - A. I afterwards went to the City coffee-house; Jackson was not then there, but his wife and a gentleman were in a private room.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did he come to you? - A. About eight o'clock in the evening; his wife and a gentleman were present; when he came in, he said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, it is perfectly right; Mr. Brown was rather displeased at first at my having sent the lad, but he was pleased at my going up, and explaining the business; his friend said he dare say I was perfectly right, and indorsed the bills." I did not understand who Mr. Brown's friend was; in a short time after, I went with him to Webster and Corbett's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you there see him pay this bill of 1300 l. to Webster and Corbett? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the bill? - A. Yes, I looked at it in Corbett's hand; it was then indorsed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you looked at it before unindorsed? - A. Yes, it was the same bill.</p>
               <p>Q. And purported to be indorsed John Brown? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the linens amount to 1300 l. or something less? - A. 1338 l.</p>
               <p>Q. The next morning were the linens delivered by Webster and Corbett to your warehouse in Queen-street? - A. Yes, they were, early in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. At about what time was that delivery ready? - A. From six to seven o'clock in the morning, or rather before; I am not certain to the hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made an agreement with any other house for the sale of these linens? - A. Yes; Jackson was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What house was it? - A. The house of Rickaby and Company in Gracechurch-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after they were delivered to you, did you deliver them over to Rickaby and Company? - A. Immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you been with Rickaby and Co.? - A. I don't recollect whether he went with me on the Friday or not, but on the Saturday, Jackson and I went together, the moment after the goods were delivered at my warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any agreement made for these linens? - A. Yes, they were sold for money.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the amount? - A. Those which were bought for 2500 l. were sold for about 2000 l.; there is a balance in their hands now; I went soon after to the warehouse, and saw them delivering them; Mr. Jackson went with the carts to Rickaby's, and I followed; Jackson went for the purpose of receiving the money.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it? - A. I believe about half past twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did Jackson wait there? - A. A very short time; a gentleman said, as the goods could not be examined very quickly, he would let Mr. Jackson have 1800 l. on account, which he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Jackson did not wait the examination? - A. He did not; Jackson wanted me to receive the balance; I told him I had nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he receive 1800 l.? - A. Yes, he received a check upon the house of Newnham, Everett, and Co. at the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Q. At what hour was that? - A. Between twelve and one o'clock; he had told me in the morning that Mr. Brown was waiting for him at Baker's coffee-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning did he tell you that? - A. As early as ten o'clock; when we came out of Rickaby and Co's. accompting-house, Jackson turned down towards London-bridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the way or the opposite way to Newnham and Everett's banking-house? - A. It was from Newnham's banking-house; I asked him where he was going then, that he was not going to Mr. Brown; he said he was going to see his little woman off to Maidstone, meaning his wife;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040015"/>she was with him at the time; he said he would be with Mr. Brown very shortly; I told him, if he was only going into the Borough, I would walk with him; he did not seem to wish me to go, and I, thinking he might have something to say to his wife, did not press it; he wished me to wait for him in the neighbourhood, that he might inform me how Mr. Brown was pleased with his bargain; he appointed the Antigallican coffee-house, just by the 'Change; I then parted from him. I was not altogether pleased with his manner, and I turned and looked back to see which way he was going, and I observed, instead of going over London-bridge, he turned up Cannon-street; I did not like immediately to follow him, and I turned up Crooked-lane, which brought me into Cannon-street; I then lost sight of him, and did not see him again; I then went to the Antigallican coffee-house, but he did not come to me; I waited half an hour, or more; I then went to Baker's coffee-house to see if he was there, but he was not there; I saw Mr. Brown, but I did not then know him; he is a very remarkable gentleman; I was then going home, and in the Poultry I met Mr. Jackson's lad.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any thing that passed between you and him, what did you do? - A. I went back to Baker's coffee-house, and Mr. Brown was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you inform Mr. Brown what had taken place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you endeavour to find out Jackson? - A. I first of all endeavoured to stop the check; I went to Newnham's house, and then to the Bank; I endeavoured to find Jackson that day, but could not.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you were taken into custody for a day or two, and discharged upon giving your word to appear? - A. Yes, I was.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. In March last you were a warehouseman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Dealing in linen? - A. Manchester goods principally.</p>
               <p>Q. Linen was not an article you dealt in? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you now? - A. I am in an unfortunate situation; in consequence of this I became insolvent, and am a bankrupt; I have dealt in linens.</p>
               <p>Q. But it was not the particular article in which you dealt? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have probably raised money in the same way before? - A. No, I have sold goods of my own for bills before.</p>
               <p>Q. You were taken up for this yourself? - A. I was detained for two or three days.</p>
               <p>Q. Charged with uttering this forgery? - A. I believe there was no charge given; it was at the instigation of Mr. Nalder, the City Marshal.</p>
               <p>Q. You told my learned friend that the original cost of this was 2500 l.? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was 500 l. sunk in the article sold? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is quite an usual thing? - A. No; but under the circumstances of this case, Jackson told me Mr. Brown was willing to lose fifteen per cent. I told Jackson, as near as I could calculate, it was twenty per cent. lost; he said it was no matter, Mr. Brown must have the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the goods examined? - A. Yes; I was present when they were looked at; they were not examined; there were two or three rounds taken out of each box, that is as much as any tradesman does.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon looking at the articles, they would easily find out that they were worth more than Rickaby and Co. afterwards gave for them? - A. They could no doubt ascertain the value.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you being present agreed to this bargain, notwithstanding the loss? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>"Saturday, 1st of March, 1804, with a heart almost sinking under the weight of my miseries, I left London; the motive which led me to this conduct I may explain at another time, if I live; the present is a rough sketch of my wanderings; I took a hackney-coach to Kensington about five o'clock, then proceeded in a post-chaise to Bristol. Sunday, I got to Bristol about six o'clock. Poor F. was tired, and went to a cupboard to get some supper. Accidentally crossing a square, I believe Queen-square, I met an Irish gentleman who was going to Ireland; that very morning I hastened back to the inn, got away, and by eleven o'clock we set sail on board the Graces for Dublin; the sea sickness affected both dreadfully, however a good passage brought us to Dublin on Tuesday night; I never can forget the strange behaviour of the waiter at the hotel in Dawson-street, who would give me nothing to eat, but very kindly sent me to the Leinster hotel, Frederick-street, where we were well off; the waiter gave me a bottle of wine, and made me laugh.

               <p>Q. Mr. Brown, like other men, don't always write with the same freedom? - A. Generally; I have had his correspondence six or seven years. (The bill read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I did not know till this moment that the defence would have devolved upon me: I did not know that my Counsel could not speak for me: I had every reason to believe they could, and I had furnished my Solicitor with documents to substantiate my innocence; but though a great number of witnesses have been subpoenaed, no one is here. Under these circumstances it is impossible for me to make any defence. With regard to the thing itself, I have simply to say this: that I never did commit a forgery; that I took the money I confess, and in doing so, that I acted very wrong, I confess also; and if Mr. Brown had charged me with defrauding him of the money, I should have submitted to my fate, but I never dreamed of committing a forgery. I met Mr. Brown at the place of appointment; he there endorsed the bills. As I hope to see Heaven, that is the truth, Gentlemen. It is not a trifling thing for a person in my situation to appeal to the Almighty: I know not how soon your verdict may bring me into the presence of that Being to whom I am appealing; but as I hope for future felicity, I never did commit the forgery. I am confident, if the evidence had been gone into which might have been gone into, you would have been convinced of my innocence. Whether you pronounce me guilty or innocent, as far as regards myself, is a matter of very little consideration; my character is already ruined; no absolution whatever can wash me from the stain now thrown upon my character. But I have a thousand things on account of which I wish to continue in existence: I have an infant, who will be left an orphan; I have a wife who is very young, who will be a widow without support; I have a parent who will be miserable, and two houses will be defrauded of their property. It is impossible for me to make more than an asseveration, and though my Solicitor actually subpoenaed a number of witnesses, not one single one has come, or a single effort made to save me from destruction. Under these circumstances I submit myself to your decision; I have no kind of hesitation in believing you will act as your consciences dictate; but whether your verdict is for me, or against me, there is a higher tribunal to which I look with pleasure, where I am certain I shall receive my acquittal. You will observe from the evidence, that I did not wish to obtain possession of the bills in a clandestine manner. I offered to return them to Mr. Akers that very night, if I had committed a forgery, and wished that forgery to pass unnoticed. I should not have been thus open in my conduct, if Mr. Brown had been examined: he would have told you that he said to me, I have no doubt of your integrity, and would willingly trust them with you endorsed. Under these circumstances I submit to whatever decision you may please to come to, satisfied with my own innocence; and I again appeal to that Supreme Being, who knows I am innocent of the crime with which I am charged.</p>
               <p>Court. It must not be understood that there is any blame in Mr. Brown not being called by the prosecutor, because he has no power of giving evidence; the Counsel for the prosecution could not call Mr. Brown; it was not in their power to call him.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Charity called again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Look at that which I gave into your hands before - look at the signature, and tell me whether you believe that to be Mr. Brown's hand-writing? - A. I believe it is; it is more like it than the other.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Read it all through, and see if you think the whole of it is Mr. Brown's? - A. I don't know whose writing the body is. (It is read. Signed John Brown.)</p>

               <p>Q. How soon after that did Jackson come to your house? - A. Jackson was at the house at the time the linens were delivered; he was at the house before they were delivered, he left me several times; the first time he left me, he said he was going to put on a clean shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it between the time the linens were delivered, and your going to Rickaby and Co.? - A. About four or five hours; the linens were sold for money, and the goods were not sent to Rickaby and Co. till twelve o'clock; Jackson was with me all the while Starkey was looking at the linens.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Starkey come to your house? - A. Yes, he did; I cannot exactly say the time, I believe it was between eight and nine.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you looking over the linens? - A. He looked at the first goods some time, I cannot say how long, it might be an hour; he looked at each sort.</p>

               <p>Q. What became of Jackson? - A. He was at my warehouse most of the time looking at the linens, they were in large deal boxes; they were then repacking them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was Starkey there the second time? - A. It might be an hour; nearly as long as the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Jackson there while Starkey looked at the second parcel? - A. Yes; after that, they were sent to Rickaby and Co. Jackson and two ticket-porters, and my two porters, took them up.</p>

               <p>Q. What length of time was he absent from your house? - A. It might be a quarter of an hour, or half and hour; I was very busy with Mr. Starkey.</p>
               <p>Q. To the best of your judgement, was it half an hour? - A. It might be; he went several times out.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. When was that done? - A. On Saturday the 17th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that your hand-writing? (A paper shewn him.) - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. What is become of that paper that you witnessed? - A. Mr. Jackson took it, I have not seen it since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Brown called.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Witness.) Q. Do you know that gentleman, Mr. Brown? - A. I saw Mr. Brown at the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the gentleman that did any thing with respect to any instrument, that you saw at Baker's coffee-house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see any body do any thing with any instrument, at Baker's coffee-house? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time? - A. It might be about ten o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the instrument that you witnessed? (A paper handed to the witness.) - A. It is hard to tell; it is about the shape, and about the size.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Brown, whom you now see, was not the person? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. By what name was that person introduced to you? - A. By no name particular; I saw him sign, I think it was, John Brown.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did you go to the Mansion-house? - A. To see Mr. Brown.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner present at the time you saw Mr. Brown at the Mansion-house? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. That was in the month of April? - A. It was either April or May.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did the person you saw witness the receipt; did he write it in your presence? - A. He wrote it in my presence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did he write the whole body of the paper, or only the signature? - A. Only the signature; I was not at the table the whole time, I was near enough to see him write the signature.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that that person is not Mr. Brown you now see? - A. I am.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner Jackson, with respect to the paper you witnessed? - A. Yes, at the Poultry Compter; he told me he should call me up to prove the signature of a receipt I had signed, or witnessed, at Baker's coffee-house.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When did he say he would call you up? - A. He said, upon his trial.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you at that time seen Mr. Brown at the Mansion-house? - Q. I had.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you say any thing to Jackson upon that subject? - A. I told him, I was sure the person that I saw at Baker's coffee-house was not the John Brown I saw at the Mansion-House;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040021"/>he told me at the Poultry Compter, that the prosecutor was the person who had signed the receipt; I told him the person I had seen at the Mansion-house, who was said to be Mr. Brown, was not the person that had signed the receipt at Baker's coffee-house; he said it was; I told him I could not swear to the person of Mr. Brown that I saw at the Mansion-house as being the person that signed it, I refused to swear to that person; upon which, he threatened me with my life if I would not come forward and swear that was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him since? - A. Yes, frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him the next time? - A. At the Poultry Compter, again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing more pass? - A. Nothing, except my refusing, as he asserted, that Mr. Brown was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever tell you any thing about the receipt afterwards? - A. No; I always endeavoured to obtain the receipt from him, and destroy it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you ever see it in his hands at any time? - A. No; he would not let me ever see it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Has any thing ever passed, with respect to any other paper, between you and him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Just look at that; is it your hand-writing? (a paper handed to the witness.) - A. Yes; I got the receipt last Monday morning, from his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that receipt, that his wife gave you, the same receipt that you witnessed? - A. It was; it had my name upon it; I then took and tore it in several pieces, and threw it into the fire, and quite destroyed it.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had so done, did you ever see the prisoner again? - A. He sent for me; he wanted me to sign another receipt, and threatened me if I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at that, and see whether that is like the receipt? - A. (Looking at a paper.) This is it; he wanted me to sign that on Monday, this week, and likewise on Tuesday; he wanted me to witness it, and I refused it, at Newgate.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he tell you how he procured it, or how long it had been written? - A. He did not; I then went away, and would have nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You have told my Lord, and the Jury, that he had threatened you, frequently? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you to say, that you believed it to be the same receipt, and that it was signed by the name of John Brown? - A. I think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been backwards and forwards to this man? - A. Several times, and frequently been threatened by him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you come here by any subpoena from the prosecutor? - A. No, by the defendant.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never refused to attend, and give evidence in this case on the part of the prisoner? - A. No, never; I always said I would come and say the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you, that you were not at the same table that the man wrote at? - A. Not during the time of conversation, I was at another table.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw the person who signed the name of John Brown before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor that man that was at the Mansion-house before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not possible that you might be mistaken with respect to the person you saw? - A. No, because Mr. Brown is so particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Yes now, but he might not be then? - A. This one that I saw at the Mansion-house was not the person that signed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the same person that signed the name of John Brown? - A. I think I should; I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. (To Dickson.) What time was it your master went out on that day? - A. I think on that day it was about eleven o'clock; I do not remember positively.</p>

I lodged at the prosecutor's house on Monday in June last; being very intimate with the prosecutor, we having frequently conversed together, I requested him to accomodate me with the clothes, my own being out of repair, and they were livery; and being in company with the women above stated to you, I was apprehended in the one shilling gallery; the reason I had them, was only to appear gay in the eyes of these incorrect women, nothing but that induced me to behave so imprudently, and I hope you will believe me, that, though I acted as with the intention to rob the prosecutor of the property, I would not have kept the clothes so long, nor would I have took them, had I not the prosecutor's consent; I beg leave to state, that my box was at the lodgings at the time; I trust I am an object that will experience the lenity of your Lordship and the Gentlemen of the Jury. Be pleased to bestow mercy, for which I shall be bound in duty ever to pray,</p>

             walked by my side; I live at Deptford.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - A No; he did not walk a great way with me; he directed his discourse to me, saying it was a fine night; I answered him, yes, I thought it was; he then told me I was walking very fast; I told him I had need, I had a long way to go; he asked me if he should accompany me home; I told him, no, I was going to my husband and family; with that I perceived a piece of paper kick against my foot; I picked it up, and saw it was a song I had had in my pocket; I then put my hand in my pocket to see if any thing else was taken out; I missed a pocket-book and a little snuff-box; I turned round to look for the man, and he was gone; I ran as far as the corner of Water-lane, and could see nothing of him; I returned back to my mother's.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your mother's? - A. She keeps house for Mr. Bilson, in the Strand; the next morning I went to the corner of Bedford-street, in the Strand, to stop eight yards of silk lace I had pledged for 8 s. the duplicates were in my pocket-book; I lost a great many duplicates in my pocket-book; some of gowns and other things; when I went for the silk lace it was taken out; then, on Tuesday, I went to Mr. Burn's, in East-Smithfield, a pawnbroker, and told him of my misfortune, and if any person came to take them out, to be so good as to stop them; I had pawned there a great many things of different descriptions.</p>
               <p>Q. What money was in your pocket-book? - A. A 2 l. note, a 1 l. note, and three 7 s. pieces; I went home to Deptford, and on Wednesday, the prisoner came to Mr. Burn's.</p>
               <p>Q. All that you know is, that you had your pocket-book taken from you in Fleet-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure to the person who took it? - A. Yes; I took particular notice of him.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did he walk with you? - A. Not past twenty doors.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was it? - A. About half-past ten at night; it was rather dark.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you take notice of him? - A. I thought he was a very decent man, and I had no occasion to be afraid of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe his countenance or his clothes? - A. His countenance and his clothes both.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the prisoner; is that the man? - A. (Looks at the man.) Yes, that is the man.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Had he the same clothes on then? - A. No; he had a kind of plaided waistcoat on then.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How soon after did you see him? - A. On Wednesday Mr. Burn sent for me, and then I went and saw him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. On Wednesday were you sure he was the person? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you any conversation with him then? - A. Yes, at Lambeth-street office; I am positive he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Has any of your property been found since? - A. Yes, on the prisoner; the duplicates and the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You were coming to town that night? - A. No; going to Deptford.</p>
               <p>Q. You are really a married woman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You made no difficulty of speaking to him? - A. I looked at him first.</p>
               <p>Q. You looked at his face, to see if you liked him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw him before that night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of hat was it he wore? - A. A round hat.</p>
               <p>Q. You said it was very dark? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw the man before, and yet you mean to say the prisoner at the bar is the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the prisoner after that time, you saw him in the street; he was then in custody? - A. Yes; the pawnbroker sent a man to Deptford for me to come up.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you directions to come to the Police-office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you came up to the Police-office with that impression on your mind that you might see the man that had robbed you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever discovered any of your notes since? - A. No, nor the money.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you pawned eight yards of silk lace for 8 s.? - A. That was in September last.</p>
               <p>Q. This was a good deal of money for you to have about you? - A. It was money we had saved up to pay our rent.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040025"/>Q. You mean to swear that was the man? - A. I can, with a clear conscience.</p>

             sworn. - I am a pawnbroker; I live in East Smithfield: on the 18th of June, at night, the prosecutrix left word to request that I would stop any body that came for her things; I was out; on the 19th, about two o'clock, the prisoner accompanied by another man, came and presented two tickets.</p>
               <p>Q. Who presented two tickets? - A. The prisoner; which were mine; I asked him many questions, to which he gave me such evasive answers that I had no doubt he was the person; he walked out of the shop with the other man; I followed and collared him; he begged me not to collar him; he said he would come back, which he did; I sent for a parish-officer; he had many doubts whether I had any right to keep him; I took him to the Police-office; there was no Magistrate sitting; I caused him to be locked up in the parish watch-house; I sent a man to Deptford for the woman, and she appeared; Griffiths has the duplicates; the other man was a Jew dealer; he had brought him to buy the things; I had a young lad that ran after him, and he gave him a blow.</p>

             sworn. - Q. What do you know of this? - A. On the 20th, this man was brought up to our office, about five o'clock in the evening; our office shuts up at six; he was taken before the Magistrate by the Headborough, and the Magistrate asked if he had been searched; the Headborough said, no; I took him out and searched him, by order of the Magistrate, and out of his pocket I took this pocket-book, with a large quantity of duplicates in it, which were shewed to the prosecutrix; she said it was her's, and the pocket-book likewise; I asked him how he came by it; he said he picked it up. (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Q. (To prosecutrix.) Look at that pocket-book - is that your pocket-book? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these duplicates your's? - A. If you will have the goodness to look, you will find them all in my own name.</p>
               <p>Griffiths. They are all in her own name.</p>
               <p>Q. (To prosecutrix.) Did you not feel any thing taken out of your pocket? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the first alarm, when you saw the song at your foot? - A. It was the appearance of paper kicked against my foot; when I took it up, I saw it was a song I had had in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not he laid hold of you at all? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. By the arm or by the side? - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was walking down Fleet-street, on the 18th of last month, and just by Water-lane I kicked the old pocket-book before my feet; I looked at it, and saw the contents of it; I called at that gentleman's house to see the articles were these duplicates were; as for money, there was none; there was not a penny in it; I tendered two of these tickets, to see what these goods were; I made no resistance; I told him I found them; I was taken into custody, and confined in the watch-house, and at the time when the lady came in she said a tall man accosted her in Fleet-street; she did not know me at first; she said afterwards that I was the man that did rob her; she said she lost three articles out of her pocket, a snuff-box, a screw box, and the book; I think it is not likely any person could take these three things at once; if there had been money in the book, I should have advertised it, and consequently I knew I had come fairly by it; I did not think it wrong; now farther, she never felt her pocket from the time she came from home till she saw the song, and picked it up.</p>
               <p>Court. Duplicates are as valuable as money to the owners of them.</p>
               <p>Q. (To prosecutrix.) Did any person accost you besides? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Jury. Was the duplicate of the silk lace in that pocket-book? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you loose a mare at any time, and when? - A. In February, 1803, between the 21st and 26th, I lost her out of the yard of Mr. Thompson, a farmer.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a mare was it? - A. A bright bay mare, about fifteen hands high; there was an accidental blemish on the near hind foot (she had got her foot in the halter), by which means the hair rather grew upwards; I was informed when I bought her of the accident; I bought her at a sale of Mr. Crane's; she had four black legs, and a small common star on her forehead; I was informed the next morning after she was taken out of the straw-yard, that she was taken with another; I had had her about a year and a half; she might be about eight years old; she had a black mane.</p>
               <p>Q. This was in February, 1803; when did you see her afterwards? - A. The latter end of April or the beginning of May, in this year; then I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040026"/>her in Mr. Preston's stables, near Battle-bridge; I did not tell him I knew her the first time; I called a second time, then she was not there; I called again, and while I was there the mare came into the yard; she had been out on hire; he called her his blood mare; I will swear to her at any time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You took up Preston, and brought him to Hatton-Garden; Preston came to Hatton-Garden, and stated that he bought it of Mr. Shackleford.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The horse was found in Preston's possession; you took Preston up, and the prisoner came, and said he was the man that sold it to Preston? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I am a stable-keeper.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know of this mare? - A. I never saw her before I saw her at Mr. Marsden's livery-stables; Mr. Shackleford was upon her back.</p>
               <p>Q. The mare was found in your possession, which you had in April last, and which Mr. Brown claimed as his mare, and for which you were taken up to Hatton-garden - how long had you had that mare? - A. Near a twelvemonth, to the best of my knowledge; I bought her of Mr. Shackleford at Mr. Marsden's livery-stables, Tottenham-court-road, at the gateway.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any particular marks on her? - A. Blind on the near eye, with a broken knee, the off knee.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she the least shew that she had been hurt with a halter? - A. Not the least; her legs are as clean as any mare's in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. A horse may have a clean leg, and yet she may be hurt with the halter? - A. There is not the least appearance in the world of her leg being hurt with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she hurt herself with a halter while in your possession? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any marks about that one you bought of Shackleford? - A. There are many particular marks about that mare; in the first place, near the hip, there is a kind of a hole you may put your finger in it when she walks forward; she has four black legs, and on the off side of the body there are three or four white marks; a small white mark on her forehead, and one foot less than the other before, and was always a little tender-footed; I bought her as such.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you take any receipt of Mr. Shackleford? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you cannot speak to the time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When Shackleford came to the office, he went and surrendered himself, that was on Tuesday last Sessions? - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. He then went down to Leiceistershire with an officer to bring the person whom he had bought the mare of - did he not return as fast as a mail-coach could take him with the person? - A. To the best of my knowledge, he did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. He was in Court on Friday last Sessions.</p>

               <p>Q. You have heard two descriptions of this mare, which is the right? - A. I very well remember the star was on one side of her forehead, she was between fourteen and fifteen hands high; her eyes were perfectly good.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took her in the straw-yard, did you observe whether she had hurt herself with the halter? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing about her feet, or whether she had any white spots on her side? - A. No, neither.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say, whether that is the same mare you had in your straw-yard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. By what? - A. By her gift of going, and by her size it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pace her? - A. I used to see Mr. Brown ride her three or four times a day before I had her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe her only to have one eye? - A. No, I cannot say I looked over her particularly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You seem to be a man of some courage to swear that this mare was lost out of your straw-yard - you had not noticed these spots? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she not here? - A. No, the parties on both sides saw her yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether this mare has one eye or two? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to her having four legs, you seem not to have looked over her? -</p>


               <p>- CRANE sworn. - Q. This was your mare once? - A. Yes, I saw her on the 8th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you had her before you sold her? - A. Between four and five years, I sold her to Mr. Brown; I saw her when she was brought to the Office, I believe her to be the same mare.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the white marks on her then? - A. Only the star on her forehead.</p>
               <p>Q. None of the side? - A. I did not take particular notice.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to identify, one would have thought that you would have took particular notice of every hair in her body almost - how old is she? - A. She is eleven years old; I bought her at a year old, and kept her five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she hurt herself with the halter? - A. A servant of mine informed me she had three years before I sold her; I have seen the mark, it continued when I parted with her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You do not know that she has any marks on the side? - A. No.</p>

I did not know what to think; she got out of bed, and sat on the bed; I heard a noise, like the cry of a child; I asked her what was that? she said, it did not concern me, I was in bed; immediately she asked me for a light, I got out of bed, and struck a light; then she asked me for a towel, I gave her a towel.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had given her a towel, what then? - A. I saw it was full of blood; then she went down stairs, and when I thought she had got down stairs, I went slyly down, and walked after her, to see where she went to; I saw her take a stick, and go into the vault.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she stay there? - A. I believe it was about ten minutes; when I thought she was coming up stairs, I came up slyly, and went into bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did she come to you? - A. In about ten minutes from going down; she came to me immediately after I got into bed again.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say to you when she came to you then? - A. She asked me whether her belly had sunk down; I told her I did not know, and when it was about ten o'clock, she went out to her sister's, she said.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she seem, well or ill, when she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040028"/>came to bed? - A. She seemed better than she was before.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did she get up? - A. I believe about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after she went did you see her again? - A. About eight or nine o'clock that night; she was then a great deal better; she was taken in Mr. Gibbons's house that night.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me this happened between four and five in the morning - how do you know that? - A. I thought it was by the day-light.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she get up more than once that night? - A. No, only once.</p>

               <p>Q. Then she went to bed, and went to sleep, and slept some time? - A. She did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You know you are bound to tell the truth, and nothing else? - A. Yes,</p>
               <p>Q. You say you are twelve years old - is your father and mother alive? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in the parish-school? - A. Almost a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you bound apprentice when you left the parish-school? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. They generally bind the children apprentice when they leave the school? - A. I do not know; I was turned out of the school, and I got in again.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you turned out of school for? - A. I do not know I am sure.</p>

               <p>Q. Has it ever happened that you had the misfortune of tumbling in the water any where? - A. Yes, in Hare-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How did that happen? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the water deep or shallow? - A. It was deep enough to drown me.</p>

               <p>Q. How did it happen - tell the truth and nothing else? - A. I took a few shillings from my mother.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you accuse of doing that? - A.

I did; I looked down the privy, and first took up two large pieces of bread that were laying on the soil; I did not discover the dead body till I had stirred the soil, then I saw either the leg or the foot; I took the child up, and washed it; it was in a narrow passage where the child went down; I found it rather difficult to get it out; she was taken to my house in the course of the evening; I said several words to her; she said, what shall I be done to; I think, to the best of my recollection, she asked whether she should be hung; Mr. Ray, the officer, asked her if she had done any thing; she did not seem to speak; there were no marks of violence on the child.</p>

I shall be hanged; she immediately fainted again; we got some harts-horn, and she recovered herself; she then said she should be hung; I then said, I do not know that you have done any thing that you deserve to be hanged for; O yes, she said, I have, and then fainted again. When she came to, she said, it was dead before I threw it down; she then fainted away, and was in a very bad state; we searched her box at Mr. Longhead's, and found some saffron; there was a bit of a child's blanket; I believe there were one or two children's caps in the box; there might be two.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Mrs. Gibbons.) Q. You are the wife of that gentleman who has been examined before - you have had children? - A. I have been the mother of ten children.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see this infant after your husband took it out of the privy - had it any caul? - A. It had not then; the caul was left in the prisoner's shift; I examined the child, and from the child's head to its feet there were no marks of violence on it; she had not gone above seven months; there were no toe-nails, and the lower parts were not perfect.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Bosanquet. Q. What are you? - A. I am a publican, living at Brentford.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the prisoner at Brentford? - A. On the 17th of May I saw him at Mr. Nunn's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in Mr. Nunn's shop before the prisoner? - A. No; he was in there before I was; the prisoner was in the shop buying some dressed ham; Mrs. Nunn put the ham in some paper; the prisoner tossed a 1 l. note on the counter, to pay for the ham.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the note? - A. I observed the note particularly; I made an observation to Mr. Nunn that it was a bad note in the prisoner's presence; the prisoner immediately stepped to the counter, close to me, and asked me how I knew it was a bad one; and I asked him (and looked at him very sternly), how he knew it was a good one; I meant to take him by the collar; I took the note nearer to the candle, and examined it more minutely, and found it was a bad one.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take hold of him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the evening was it? - A. Between nine and ten in the evening, on the 17th of May; the candles were lit, and the prisoner said he had it of a man at the door, and he would call him in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any answer to him? - A. Not at that time; on my looking at the note more particularly (I was behind the counter). I immediately said I would take the prisoner; the prisoner was making to the door, as I then supposed, in order to bring the man; I followed him, and could not find him; I did not go outside of the door at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come in, and bring in any body with him? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. What did you do with the note? - A. I came back and marked the note in two places, sealed it up in a paper directed to Mr. Nunn, and ordered him, if any one called, to detain them.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the note? (A note shewn him.) - A. That is the same note.</p>

Yes; that is the note the prisoner brought; I know it by Mr. White's mark; I saw him make the mark; Mr. White was in the shop at the time the note was paid; I took the note and looked at it, and shewed it to Mrs. Nunn; she said it was very greasy; I said, never mind, if it is greasy, if it is a good one; Mr. White said it was a bad one; the prisoner asked Mr. White how he knew it was a bad one; Mr. White said, how do you know it is a good one; Mr. White was behind the counter, and said he would take him; I do not know the words exactly; the prisoner said the man was at the door he received it of; he would bring him in.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that you received on the 18th of May from Stone a counterfeit note? - A. Yes, they are both counterfeits, and from the same plate with those I have received before; they are all from the same plate with that I saw of Kimbell and Nunn.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am not guilty of what is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040032"/>Alledged against me; I was never at Brentford fair in my life, I am in the plated way by trade, the lady is here where I work at; we were short of work at our shop, and I bought things of my mistress to get a shilling or two, because I had not employment, and a young man, of the name of Booth, had got his watch in pledge; he gave me the ticket of it, and in the course of three or four days, I pawned some of my things to release the watch, because he told me it was worth four pounds, and I thought to get something by it; it was not worth fifteen shillings, I kept it for two or three days, the case was very much bruised and broke; I mended the case, then it was much better than it was before; I wore it for three or four days, then I saw a man that gave an order for three or four plated spoons and cups, and when I had taken them to the man that had ordered them, they were too small and too light, I had them returned on my hands, I kept them for three or four days; I then thought I had better get a fresh place of work; I went down to Hoxton, to a friend, at the Royal Oak, he was not at home, then I went to the White Horse in Pitfield-street; I called for a pint of beer, and there was a gentleman there whom I had never seen before, I supposed he was a countryman; seeing him play at skittles, I went up to him, and I said to him, I beg your pardon, an't you a traveller? Why, says he; by your appearance and your dress, said I. I then said to him, I have an article to dispose of in my pocket; he asked me what they were, I told him; he says, come and go into the parlour, we will agree if we can; we went into the parlour, and there were three or four gentlemen there; I shewed him the articles, he liked them very much; I asked him fifteen shillings for the two cups, and seven shillings for the spoons, or seven shillings and sixpence, I will not be sure which; he bated me down to twelve shillings for the cups, and six shillings for the spoons, that was eighteen shillings; I told him there was another article to sell, and that was the watch that I had fetched out of pledge; I gave it into his hands, and he set the price, and I took it, that was twenty-eight shillings, I was to spend a shilling out of it, which I agreed to do; in the mean time, I asked him if he dealt in such goods as them; he said, he generally dealt in a smaller way, in knives, &amp;c. I said, if you do, I will give you my master's residence, I knew the manufactory of such goods, I could get them cheaper of my master and mistress than he could get them himself, and get something myself by them; in the mean time, he did not want the residence of my master and mistress, he said he would sooner deal with me; I then required of him where he lodged, when in town, which he gave me; he could not write himself, nor read in his life; he said, he always kept his accounts by his head, and a gentleman in company wrote his residence, that was in Charlton-street; he gave me the direction to the Brill-house, which I have lost; he travelled to Norfolk he said, and to Newmarket; he authorised me to sign it in his name. I was never in the house above three times, in the White Horse, Pitfield-street, and I saw him there twice.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

We were all sober together; the gown and aprons hung over my head while they were in the room, this was on Monday, I wore them on Sunday, and the two handkerchiefs hung over a chair in the room; they staid with me about an hour, Holland went out with the gown and apron; I called to my husband for assistance, he was at work at the back part of the house underneath, he did not hear, nor did he come; this young woman, when I was going to run out of the room-door, gave me a very hard blow, and I lay all in agore of blood on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. What was taken away? - A. The gown and handkerchief; I cannot say they took them, there was nobody else in the place to take them.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Clifton. Q. Did you happen to be in the Whitechapel-road? - A. Yes; on the 26th of May, about eleven o'clock at night; I saw the prosecutor fall; I saw the prisoner take his foot in his hand, and he said, he has broke my foot, or toe; and while he was hopping off, another man sat him against the wall.</p>

               <p>Q. When the man fell, are you sure the prisoner at the bar is one of the men? - A. Yes; it was not very light then, but it was light enough for me to see the man; I took notice of his features; he was very well dressed, but the colour of his coat I cannot tell; when he hopped round me he looked me full in the face, and went off towards Bow: my wife was with me, we had been at Bow Fair, she looked more at the man on the ground that she did at this man; there was another man taken up on suspicion, and they were both together in the lock-up house, and when she saw this man, this, said she, is him; and when she looked at the other, she said, that is not him.</p>

               <p>Q. When had you seen these clothes last? - A. On Wednesday the 16th of May, to the best of my recollection.</p>

               <p>Q. What were the clothes? - A. Five shirts, three neck-handkerchiefs, four pair of stockings, two waistcoats, and two pair of small clothes; there was a hat also, they belonged to

            , he is at the West Indies. I suspected the prisoner had taken them by his absconding; he had taken the sheets, I did not think he had gone to the chest.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the chest, how did you find the chest? - A. It was locked the same as I left it; I left it locked, and when I unlocked it Taylor's things were all gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see the prisoner? - A. On Saturday evening; he was taken at a public-house in the neighbourhood, to the best of my knowledge; the small clothes and stockings he had on were Taylor's property.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of breeches were these? - A. Velveteen, of an olive colour.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason had you to think they were Taylor's? - A. I had them so long in my care, I was positive they were his.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any marks about them; you know olive velveteens are very common? - A. The pockets were flung back the same as when Taylor wore them, and they had pearl buttons at the knees; the stockings, to the best of my knowledge, are his.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else sleep in the room? - A. No; we had no other lodgers in the house, not at that time; the prisoner had only one dress.</p>
               <p>- DEYKIN sworn. - Q. Did you apprehend the prisoner? - A. Yes, at the Maidenhead, in Dyot-street, St. Giles's; he had a pair of velveteen breeches, and a pair of white ribbed stockings on, and a bundle in his hand; we took him to Mr. Calloy's house, and Mrs. Calloy said they were Taylor's breeches and stockings; we opened his bundle, and there were an old pair of black velveteen breeches, which were his own, and a dark pair of stockings; when the watch set, Mr. Calloy sent for the watchman, and we took him to the watch-house; the constable of the night took care of the breeches, and the next day he was taken to Marlborough-street office. (The breeches and stockings produced and identified by Mrs. Calloy.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. They are my own property, I brought them from Birmingham; I was in the Staffordshire Militia, I never was before a Magistrate for any misdemeanour in my life; what I am brought here for now I am innocent of; one of the witnesses has kept my mother-in-law away.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mrs. Calloy.) You say he absconded from his lodgings? - A. Yes; he came generally home<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040038"/>to his meals; he is a locksmith; he had picklocks and keys found upon him when he was at the watch-house; they were found in his breeches pocket. (The picklock keys produced.)</p>

            : On Thursday, the 21st of June, the prisoner came to my daughter's house, (I have seen her once before); she came there in the forenoon about eleven o'clock, and went away, and came back about two o'clock; then she asked me to go round the corner, and bring a quartern of liquor, to see whether her husband was there; she said he had a blue coat on; I was gone about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her husband before? - A. No; it was only four doors from my place; I brought the liquor, and looked for her husband, and when I came to my door, I found it a-jar, and she was gone; I left her sitting; she was to stop till I came back; then I missed the best of the cloaths out of the drawer belonging to my son-in-law; I missed a gown, a coat and waistcoat, a piece of linen, a pair of breeches, a handkerchief, and a muslin petticoat; I should know them again.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You had drank at many public-houses in the course of that day - were you sober? - A. I was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married man? - A. I am not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen her before? - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in company with any other girl before? - A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to swear that you were not in company with any other girl? - A. The girls will come in company of men, whether they like it or no.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a stout fellow, you are able to put a girl away if you like - did you drink with her? - A. I don't know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you were sober? - A. I had drank two pints of beer in the course of the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. When you stopped in the street, do you mean to say that you were only talking to her? - A. Nothing further passed than conversation.</p>
               <p>- DONALDSON sworn. - I was constable of the night; the prisoner was brought to me at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the man - did he seem intoxicated? - A. He seemed as if he had been drinking, but was quite sensible of what he was about; the note was not found upon the girl, it was found in the street, as I understood.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am an unfortunate girl; I happened to go into a public-house, the corner of Panton-street, and that gentleman was drinking a pint of ale with a young woman; I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the prosecutor.) What sort of a purse was it? - A. (Shews the purse.) This is the purse, and the note was dropped in the scuffle.</p>

               <p>Q. When had you seen it last? - A. I do not know that I had seen it for a week before; it was laying there with five more; the prisoner lives at Walton on Thames, about a mile and a half off; I got a search-warrant on the 25th of June; the constable went to the prisoner's house, and in less than five minutes it was taken out of his shop; I saw the plank, and knew it was mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Where you live is in Middlesex? - A. Yes; and Walton is in Surry.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not attend the search-warrant yourself? - A. I attended it myself, but I was a little distance off.</p>
               <p>Q. It very often happens that planks are carried away by the tide - the tide very often overflows the banks entirely? - A. They were all fastened together; I had ten more.</p>
               <p>Court. If there had been any flood, it must have carried away the other planks.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable; I went to the prisoner's premises on the 25th of June with a search-warrant; I found the plank in his work-shop; he was not at home; it had been cut since it had been taken from the water-side.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there much more plank in the workshop? - A. None at all, only pieces of chips; soon after I took the prisoner before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him what was the cause of your apprehending him? - A. Yes; he said he wished me to read the warrant; he acknowledged that he had used some of it where he had been at work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any account how he got it? - A. He said he had been hauling some grigs in still water, between three and four o'clock in the morning, and two men followed him in the Thames, and asked him if he would buy the plank; he went and looked at it; they asked him two guineas for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040040"/>the whole plank, upon which he gave them two pounds in Bank-notes, and two shillings; to the best of my remembrance that is the account he gave the Magistrate; he said they called him by name, but he did not know them, and did not ask where they lived; it was taken down in writing, and it was read over to him before the Magistrate, and he said it was right.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The account which I gave before the Magistrate is true.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner's deposition before the Magistrate read in Court, which is the same as stated by the witness.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. (To Harley.) Q. You say you found this timber in his work-shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other pieces of timber in the shop? - A. What do you call timber.</p>
               <p>Q. I am no carpenter, you are not to expect technical words from me - was there any other wood in the place? - A. There might be chips and shavings; it had the appearance of a work-shop.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the prosecutor.) You have no mark upon it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You have no doubt of it's being your property? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it? - A. I have valued it at thirty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What could you buy a plank of that size for? - A. Five pounds.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Are you aware of the value of that sort of timber - you surely could buy it at four or five shillings a foot? - A. The value of it is about forty shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you think it could be got for forty shillings? - A. Yes, it might.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say it could not be got for less than five pounds? - A. It is stuff that I do not understand so much.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. You say that he called upon you for a quarter's wages, and you told him that he had taken the cloths - what did he say? - A. He admitted of it very reluctantly; I never saw him after that, I received an attorney's letter from him, but I never paid him; I never took him up at all.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, did not you know where he lived? - A. I thought I knew where he lived, but my coachman told me he saw him in the Strand driving a hackney-coach; it was no use going to where I thought he lodged, I heard he was in custody.</p>

The next morning I perceived a contusion on the side of the head; when the scull was removed, there was a pound of extravasated blood on the brain; I was told he had been fighting; I believe he did not live half a minute after I got in.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether it was done by a blow or by a fall, you cannot say? - A. No, there were several blows on the back part of his head.</p>
               <p>Mr. EVANS sworn. - I am a surgeon; I attended the next morning, there was a violent contusion behind the right ear, and by removing the scull there was a quantity of extravasated blood from blows or falls, I cannot ascertain which; there were several blows on the back part of his head.</p>

I said, I had bought them, I did not like to be cheated of the shilling; Teddy said, you b - r, what makes you make these words with this man, I will knock your head off; I said, I will not be knocked about, I will stand in my own defence; we then came out of the public-house, and went to Playhouse-yard, he began to square at me; he said, will you fight? I said, I will not fight here at all, we shall have all the jack-ass people about us; we went to the top of Brick-lane along those gardens that takes you up to the City-road, and there he said to me, I shall knock your bl - y head off; I said, I should leave off when I had got enough, and there Teddy pulled off his clothes; I did not pull off my clothes, and this pork butcher, that lives in Grub-street, said to me, I will second you, and then the seconds laid hold of one another's hands, and we fought; he struck at me, and I closed him and I fell down, and he upon me; he throwed himself over me, and said, I will fight no more; we got up, and when we came to the turnpike, d - n me, he said, we will not go further without some drink; I said, I will put two-pence towards a pot of porter, and this butcher said, we will go backwards in the left box of the skittle-ground; Teddy took his hand, and reached the pot, and drank some porter, and laid his head on the table, and presently one of the men lifted him up, and said, I think he is dying; one of the men said to me, you had better bolt; I said, no, I will not run away, if I have done it, I am sorry for it; when the landlord came, he took me into custody; I lived with Mr. Butcher, in Red-Lion-market, but a young lad put me in getting a piece of bread much better, in selling scouring-paper and black lead to the coffee-houses; I can earn three or four shillings a day, so I left Mr. Butcher, I thought I could better myself.</p>

            . The first that I saw, I discovered that the garden-gate had been broke open, and then the summer-house broke open, which I was surprised at, knowing I had the keys; my brother had discovered that the room was broke open before I did; I was on the premises from five in the morning till I went home to breakfast, about nine o'clock; the stables adjoin the house; I was in the stables till near seven; there were a number of men on the premises at work, and women too; we found a rug tucked in at one corner of the window, which looks to where my brother slept.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The two prisoners worked for me a week before the robbery was committed; they had worked for me, I cannot say how long; it might be two or three months; Needs came to me at Hackney, on the Saturday night, about an hour or two hours before the robbery was discovered, to ask if I would take him into my employ again on Monday; they had left me on the Saturday night before, under pretence of going into the country for two or three days; I told Needs I would give him an answer at my accompting-house, at Hoxton, that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Dorset with him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you found out the robbery then? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him about it? - A. Not more than to the rest of the men.</p>
               <p>Q. He knew that you were aware of the robbery then? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did you give him? - A. I was in want of hands, but he being, as I then thought, a worthless character, I wished to consult my foreman, whether I should take him on or not; and after I found out the robbery, I forbid him to come.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing then? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your partner's name? - A. George Gregory; we found some baskets belonging to us at the Magistrates, and a tub.</p>

               <p>Q. Both of them? - A. Yes; They both lodged at my house; they came upon the 17th of November; I had a shop and parlour to let; Dorset took the lodgings; he asked me what I charged a week for the shop and parlour; I said 4 s. 6 d. a week; Needs told me he was a poor man, and was just married; could not I take 4 s. I said if I did, I must have my money every week, and I agreed to take 4 s. Dorset paid me 1 s. I think it was earnest; Needs also took a lodging of me; he came on the Friday, and gave me 6 d. earnest, and he came in on the Saturday; he paid me 20 d. a week.</p>

               <p>Q. Dorset only, or both of them? - A. Dorset only; the shop did not very well answer; after he had been there a month or two, he told me he did not like to go to gardening again, for the wages were very low, and if they lost an hour, through rain or any thing of that sort, it was stopped; I recommended him to a Mr. Kinman, where I worked; he worked there some time, I cannot say how long, and one day coming home, as we lived<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040045"/>near together, we got into a conversation about servitude, and one thing or other, and he said he wished I had not let Mr. Needs lodge in the house; I asked him why, and he told me that the last place where they worked in they committed a robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where they worked? - A. I asked him where it was, and he told me it was at Mr. Grange's, at Hoxton; he then said, he had taken a pair of sheets and blankets, and some clothes; he said they took every thing there was, and he wished to get rid of Needs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what became of the things? - A. No; he said he let Needs have the water-tub that was in the yard, and the sheets, and he had not paid him for them, but he did not say that they were the sheets that they took.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do upon this? - A. One day I thought it was not right such people should lodge in my place; I thought my other lodgers were not safe, and I went to Mr. Grange and informed him of it; I saw

               <p>Q. Your principles of honesty and notions of it, were always the same? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, though he told you he had committed a robbery, it did not strike you till some time after that he was a man unfit to remain in your house; how long was it after? - A. After Dorset had left the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Dorset left the house voluntarily? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not desire him to go? - A. Yes, one day when he was taken up for an affray in Lincoln's inn fields; he said he did not think my lodgings would suit him, and I said I did not think they would.</p>
               <p>Q. You were always upon good terms with Dorset? - A. I never had a quarrel with either of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not Dorset told you he thought you a very bad man, and he did not think it fit to stay in your house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He never said you had done things for which you ought to be hanged? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this confession was it that you saw Mr. Grange? - A. I saw Mr. Grange at the office.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not think it right that they should be punished? - A. Yes, but Needs's wife lay very dangerously ill in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Dorset has left your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know there is such a thing as a reward of 40 l. upon conviction of a burglary? - A. I did not know it till lately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never learn it till you came to give evidence here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hear it from the officers? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember Needs bringing any clock to your house? - A. Yes; I think it was on the 7th of November, Dorset came with him; Needs brought it in an apron, and asked me to let him leave it there, because it was so far to take it to Hoxton that night; he lived at that time in Hoxton market-place; the clock had weights but no pendulum; it was broke, the face of it was broke in two.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the baskets come? - A. Dorset brought the baskets about a week after; he said they were going to remove, and wished them to be put in Mr. Lowe's yard; they were taken away, and Needs afterwards brought them again; Needs said they were his.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought the water-tub? - A. Needs brought it in the morning that he was taken up, before I was up, and he came again afterwards and asked me if I would ask Mr. Lowe to buy it; he told me himself that he had brought it that morning; he said, as my sister was dead, it was of no use to him; Mr. Chapman came with Mr. Grange, and asked me if I had any thing belonging to Needs; I told him there was a water-tub he had brought in that morning, and I gave the clock up to old Mr. Grange; I told him Needs had brought it to me.</p>

               <p>Q. In what parish is it? - A. St. Giles's: On Saturday the 26th of May, about three o'clock in the afternoon, in consequence of a lodger coming to me, and saying she saw a man go up stairs; I went up with the key of the servant's room, and the key of our bed-room; I saw a key in the door of the two pair of stairs bed-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the room you slept in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How had that room been left? - A. Locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that? - A. Yes; we are always very particular in locking the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock it yourself? - A. No; but the key was down stairs, I took it up with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you taken that key from? - A. Out of the kitchen; I opened the bed-room door, and saw the prisoner, the cupboard-door was open, which he was standing by; I took him by the collar.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any hat on? - A. Yes, this hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose hat is that? - A. My own.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you left it? - A. In a hat-box, in the cupboard; I took him by the collar, he asked me what I did that for; and I said he was come to rob the house; he said he was come to some person, whose name I forget; I told him he should go along with me; he told me not to tear his clothes; he stooped down in the cupboard, and got shuffling about with the hat-boxes, I thought he might be feeling for something, I took him by the back part of his coat, and pulled him out of the cupboard; I told him he had no business there; upon which he took off my hat and put on his own, which was lying upon the floor, upon that I said, you have got my hat have you; I then brought him down to the bottom of the stairs, in the passage, I was giving the keys to the servant with my other hand; he gave himself a sudden twist, and ran off, upon which I immediately ran after him, and cried stop<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040048"/>thief; he ran up Princes-court, up Turnstile, into Holborn, into Kingsgate-street, and Eagle-street; he fell down in Dean-street, he got up, and was laid hold of by another person; I took him myself into Holborn, he twisted to get out of my hands again, he ran about as far as two yards, I caught hold of his coat, and pulled him over; a man came over and offered his assistance, and as we were going along he offered me any thing to let him go; I told him I would have no satisfaction, but he should have justice; I took him into the kitchen, where I met with the beadle, he searched him, and found upon him some keys, and some Bank-notes; upon seeing the notes, I went up stairs to see if he had been at the drawers, and when I got up stairs I found this cloak, and these handkerchiefs, upon the landing outside the room-door.</p>
               <p>Q. How high was this? - A. Two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had the cloak and handkerchiefs been before? - A. On the drawers in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them there? - A. No; I only knew from what Mrs. Crook said; I took the key out of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that your key? - A. No, it is not; it is a key of his, which he owned and asked for.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been at home? - A. I suppose I had been at home about an hour, I had just done my dinner.</p>

               <p>Q. What does your family consist of besides? - A. Two children, and a servant.</p>

             sworn. - I was standing in Holborn, near Kingsgate-street, I heard the alarm of stop thief; I went after the prisoner, but I did not come up till he got into Dean-street, I then took charge of him; I found upon him two pounds thirteen shillings, and these keys, (Producing them.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q. They are common keys? - A. One of them the Magistrate desired me to shew in Court; I have been told by several people it will open almost any lock. As I was going along the top of Long-acre, he offered me five guineas to let him go; I told him if he offered an hundred I should not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. One of these keys belong to my own room, and the other to my mother's; I went to this house for my master, for an extra man of my master's, of the name of Wilson; I knocked at the door up one pair of stairs, and the woman told me there was no such name there, I might go up stairs; I went up, and this gentleman came up, and said I wanted to rob the house; I told him I wanted Mr. Wilson, and then he pushed me about, and used me very ill; I did not run away.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you do upon missing your money? - A. I called in an officer of the parish, and had the prisoner apprehended; she was locked up all night; I told her I had missed my money, and she said she had never had it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen any alteration in her dress? - A. Yes, that was what I went by; she had a very mean dress before.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find her dressed when you came back? - A. She was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you don't know any thing about it? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner in your shop? - A. Not before Saturday, the 26th of May, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon; she came into the shop, and requested me to shew her some light printed cottons for a gown; in consequence of which, I took some printed cottons down, and the second that I took down was the piece I now hold in my hand; I shewed her four others afterwards, making in the whole six pieces; she offered me two shillings and nine-pence for one of them, which I could not take; having occasion to turn my back, she had an opportunity of secreting one of them under her cloak, she had a large red cloak on which hung down to her heels.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her do it? - A. No; she had a singular manner, which created a suspicion in my mind that she had some evil intention; she told me she should not take the gown away with her if she had bought it, but should leave sixpence in part till the evening; I told her I could not put a gown by for her, or any one else, upon such terms, that it was not customary for us so to do; she turned upon her heels, and, in a kind of shuffling ran towards the door, said there were plenty of people that would do it; I then looked among the pieces upon the counter, and missed this piece; she turned round the corner of Stanhope-street, I followed her into White-horse-yard; I desired her to come back with me, and she came back very willingly to the shop; she immediately put her arm under her cloak, and threw the piece of print on the counter before my face, I was close to her, and therefore there could be no mistake; she then went upon her knees, and said, for God Almighty's sake, or for the love of God, pray forgive me, I will never do so again; for the sake of my two children, for I am fatherless and motherless, and have nothing to depend upon but my labour.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it? - A. Thirty-five shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went in with intent to buy a gown, I never looked at more than one print, we did not agree, and I went away, and the gentleman came after me; I went back with him immediately, I am perfectly innocent.</p>

               <p>- LEWIS sworn. - I went to see the failing-match; my coat was buttoned; I felt a hand against my pocket; I turned round, and saw some suspicious persons near me; I saw the last witness near, and the prisoner was wanting to push in between me and the stone work; I watched him; he found he could not get before me, and he went behind him, put his hand in his pocket gently, and drew out the handkerchief and put it under his coat; some Police-officers were on the bridge, and I gave him in charge.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was standing reading a paper against the watch-box; I know nothing of the handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you suspect him? - A. I did, by seeing him put his head up the hold two or three times, to look; he had staid behind the rest of the men; he then came up the ladder; I laid hold of him, and asked him what he had about him, and he said he had got some victuals in his coat pocket, which was for his dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it? - A. About one o'clock, the time they go to their dinner; upon that I told him I should see into his pocket and put my hand into his pocket and pulled out a piece of opium; I put my hand into his pocket again and found another piece; I then called Corry, who searched him in my presence; he found between his shirt and his flesh another piece of opium; he then said, pray let me go, it is my first offence, and I will do so no more; the captain was then called from on board.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that vessel laden with opium among other things? - A. Yes.</p>

Yes; I employed the prisoner as a labourer, and I employed him a quarter of a day on Monday, all day on Tuesday, and half a day on Wednesday, when this happened; in consequence of information, that I received from Mr. Nichols, I went down and discovered that one of the cases, out of five near the hatchway, had been broke open by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040052"/>some iron instrument, a chisel, or a small iron crow.</p>

            , a pocket-book, containing two notes, one of 20 l. and the other of 10 l. the pocket-book unfortunately has been given to the constable, who is not here, and it is necessary, as the pocket-book is in existence, and can be produced, that it should be produced before you. There are certain rules of law which we can never deviate from, one of which is, that the best evidence which the case can admit of must be given to a Court and Jury, and therefore we must not indulge in fanciful ideas; the best evidence of the pocket book being the property of this gentleman is the production of it, and then he would say, that is the identical pocket-book which he lost, and that it is his property. Now, as it can be produced, it ought to be produced, and it is much better a guilty man should escape than either you or I deviate from the rules of law; for if we deviate from them, neither you or I can be safe, and though there can be little doubt of the guilt of the prisoner, yet, as the case is not made out, by the regular and best evidence, he must have the benefit of it. Whether it has happened from the negligence of the constable, or from any wicked design, or from having received a bribe, we have no evidence before us, and the only thing I can do at present is to estreat his recognizance, and you may be assured that that recognizance shall not be taken off; he is bound in a recognizance of 40 l. which shall be forfeited; but the prisoner, I am afraid, must, for this time, escape<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040053"/>justice; the prosecutor will have his remedy against the constable for the money, he will therefore get back the money he has lost; and I say, thus publicly, that the recognizance shall be forfeited, unless it appears that it was occasioned by some act of the Almighty, or by something that will satisfy every one, that it was not the fault of the witness. Therefore, let the prisoner be acquitted, and I trust the hazard of his life which he has run this day, will be such a warning to him, that we shall never see his face again; I would have him recollect this circumstance will not be forgotten.</p>
               <p>(The Jury deliberated a considerable time, when the learned Recorder again called up the Prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>Q. You had the pocket-book returned by a gentleman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you keep it? - A. Two or three minutes, and then I gave it my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that was your pocket-book? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you open it before you gave it your wife? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the contents of it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine it before you delivered it? - A. Yes, and saw the notes in it; they were both in the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Q. When did your wife deliver it to you to the constable? - A. As near as I can recollect it was a quarter of an hour afterwards, at a public-house on this side of London-bridge; we could not at first find a constable, except a poor old man, who was not able to take him into custody; my wife gave the constable the book to look at, and he kept it; he attended before the Lord Mayor, and was bound over.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Did you know the number of the notes before you lost them? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. And, as between the prisoner and the constable, you had not observed any intimacy, or any communication, at the time you delivered your pocket-book to the constable? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Worton called again. Q. Did you know the pocket-book? - A. Yes, it was my husband's; I saw him look to see if the notes were safe, it contained a twenty-pound note and a ten pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you keep the pocket-book? - A. As well as I can recollect, pretty near a quarter of an hour; the constable asked to look at it, I gave it him, and he said, he should put it in his pocket, he was going to take the prisoner before the Lord-Mayor; we went, but the Lord-Mayor was not there; then he said he should keep the book till Monday; we went before the Lord-Mayor on the Monday, and he produced the same book.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the same? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the contents the same? - A. Yes; the Lord-Mayor allowed me to take the notes, and the constable kept the book.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Then your husband has paid the notes away? - A. Yes; the Lord-Mayor said he might.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I changed them at the Bank at Portsmouth, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, I will tell you how I will put this case. The prisoner is accused of having stolen this pocket-book, the contents of which were two Bank notes; now the regular and the strict evidence would be, either to produce the book itself, in which the Bank notes were contained, or to produce one of the Bank notes, to prove that that was the property lost, for if a man loses a box of things, he is not bound to preserve the whole contents of that box; if the box itself is produced, and proved to have been stolen, that is proving the whole contents of the box, but the deficiency here is, that we have neither the notes or the pocket-book. The Chief Magistrate, before whom this came, could have no idea but that the constable, whom he took care to bind over, would appear, and produce to the Court and Jury the book in which the notes were contained, and that was sufficient; therefore the Magistrate says, you keep the book, and you take the notes and dispose of them; but it now unfortunately becomes somewhat material, because you have neither of them here, but if you are satisfied upon the evidence you have heard, that the prisoner was the person who stole this book, you will pronounce him guilty by your verdict, acquitting him of the capital part of the charge, for that is quite out of your consideration, and I will reserve the case so far as to have some conversation with the Judges upon it; on the other hand, if you have a doubt as to the facts, you will let him have the benefit of that doubt, by an acquittal. If the evidence satisfies you, that the prisoner's was the hand who stole the book, with the contents or without the contents is a matter of very little consequence, I shall certainly state the case to the Judges for their opinion, whether you are warranted on giving your verdict upon such evidence; if they should be of opinion that the evidence, in point of law, is not strictly such as to authorise the verdict, the prisoner will have the benefit of it; if, on the other hand, they are satisfied that the facts will warrant your verdict in point of law, it will then stand.</p>

               <p>Of stealing, but not privily from the person.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the defendant? - A. I do not believe he is any thing; he told me he was a captain in full pay.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever apply to you to lend him a sum of money? - A. Yes, for the payment of twenty-five men he was recruiting for; he had got twenty-one of Captain Reynolds, and he had only four to raise; for this purpose, he wanted to borrow a little money.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did he want to borrow of you? - A. We had not agreed on the sum; he told me he was to pay thirteen guineas a man, and I never intended to lend him more than to pay for these men; I sold out stock, and received 600 l. of Mr. Thompson, the stock-broker.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did you receive it of Mr. Thompson? - A. Part in cash and part in checks; he sent the checks to Messrs. Fullers, and got cash for the same; I received altogether 613 l. after I received it, I went home; it was dinner time; the prisoner came between five and six o'clock; when he came I had my sister with me; when my sister went we walked part of the way with her and returned; when I got up stairs, it was beginning to be dusk; I then took the Bank notes from my pocket, and sat down at the table, and put them on the table, and holding my hand on them at the same time, I was beginning to discourse with him what I meant to do; I told him I expected I had lost money by selling out stock; he said he must be answerable for that, but as part was only for him, I meant to distinguish that part that was left for myself, and the part for him; I concluded that he was prepared with security, but I did not tell him so; we sat down at the table for the purpose of discussing this point, and then there came a knock at the door; he just cast his eye on them; they were laying before him; he started up and opened the sash; we were up one pair of stairs, and Mr. Meene, who was on the outside of the door, said, here is Reynolds and some other person, waiting for you, whose name I do not recollect; he said he must come down directly; Foley said, I will be with you in five minutes; the prisoner seemed agitated, and took up one of the notes and surveyed it, and I believe did not see what it was, for he held it wrong end upwards; he was about to speak; he stopped short, and hustled them all up together, and went out of the room, and down stairs; he ran out very fast, and shut the street-door after him, and joined Meene, the man that knocked, and they walked off arm in arm together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call out? - A. No; my consternation was so great, I did not know how to act.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you consent to his taking away all these Bank notes? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever promised to lend him so large a sum as 613 l.? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that one of the letters you received from him - (a paper shewn to the witness) - after you had received that letter, had you any conversation with him, so as to know that it came from him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Do you know his hand writing - have you ever seen him write? - A. I have seen him write; I have heard people say that it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that it is? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever acknowledge to you that this letter was sent from him to you? - A. Oh yes. - (The letter read.)</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he made an offer to you; how long has your husband been dead? - A. Twenty years; I have known Mr. Foley about seven months; I had a very good opinion of him; I knew where he lodged.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a great regard for him? - A. I never professed any regard to him; you may be able to prove it, but I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know your own hand-writing? - A. I do; I acknowledge that I had friendship for him, and would serve him in this affair.</p>
               <p>Q. You wrote to him very frequently? - A. No; it occurs to me that I wrote to him once to refuse him the money; and I wrote a note to him once or twice, but I cannot even recollect the purport of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was it your intimacy first began? - A. At Mr. Gardner's, at Chelsea; I boarded there.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner has been there with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said before that you did not know what he was? - A. I have heard that he was an ensign; I never heard it disputed but that he was an officer in the army.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you have known him at the lodging-house before he visited you at your apartments? - A. Sometimes he spent his hours with the family, and sometimes with me alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not made a promise to him; and that you should wish to alter your condition? - A. No; quite the reverse.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Miss Dance and Mrs. Moiney? - A. She is one of the conspiracy.</p>
               <p>Q. She is a wife of one of the captains in the army? - A. It is said so, but I do not know it; I dined once at his house with them; he told me,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040055"/>and they confirmed him, that his father is a man of 700 l. a year, and that he could not leave it from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never conversed on the subject of intimacy and attachment to the person of the prisoner at the bar? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. My question is this; have you never talked with Miss Dance and Mrs. Moiney upon the subject of your attachment to the person of the prisoner? - A. What made me say never, I never spoke to them together; I never spoke to Mrs. Dance, only as a person that he lodged with; he always considered them as good kind of people, but I never considered them as acquaintances.</p>
               <p>Q. He went away quite in a hurry? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Somebody knocked at the door, and he went away in a hurry; you begged him to sit down; and did you not say, my dear Foley, I have done so and so for you, and I hope to make you a happy man? - A. I did not expect to be treated so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, on the same evening, or on the next day, tell Mrs. Moiney in these words, I have made my dear Foley happy; I have lent him this 600 l. - A. By heavens, I never said so in my life; you alarm me.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the Miss Dalsiers? - A. These are people he lives with.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you, either on the evening of that day, or the next day, or any time, in which the defendant got your money, and was taken up, say that you had lent him that money? - A. I told the transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. The question is not whether you told the transaction, but whether you told any person that you had lent him the 600 l.? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Do you know Captain 
               <persName id="t18040704-48-person496">Fitzgerald</persName>
            ? - A. I am sorry I do; I have heard a bad character of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Meene was before the Magistrate, and was examined as a witness? - A. He was; his name was on the warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Mr. Meene was discharged, and was at liberty; and has been at liberty ever since? - A. He has.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not hear it said, and do you not believe it, that that man was to be a principal witness on behalf of that gentleman to-day? - A. I supposed he would if he could, because I knew there was a conspiracy.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you this question solemnly upon the oath you have taken, was he or was he not indicted in order to be kept from giving his testimony today; I desire a plain answer? - A. I cannot tell; I am not a lawyer; I represented him as a person that was an accomplice in carrying on a swindling scheme to defraud me of my money.</p>
               <p>Court. You do not represent him to us as a swindler; you represent him to us as a thief.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Did not you swear before the Grand Jury so as to induce them to find the bill? - A. I did; I am not used to be examined, therefore I may be too quick.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not direct your attorney or the clerk of the indictments to put Mr. Meene in the indictment? - A. I consented.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Whether you did not desire the attorney or the clerk of the indictments to insert Mr. Meene in the indictment? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Upon your oath, did not you know by so doing I could not have him as a witness to-day? - A. I did know it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, did not you desire him to be indicted for the express purpose of preventing him? - A. I did, because I knew he was a dangerous person and an enemy.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the principal adviser to take this gentleman up? - A. The attorney I employed, considering my loss was so great.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you were not directed by another person? - A. It was my own inclination, it was my own act.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Captain Kenner? - A. Yes; I never heard him called Captain Kenner, but Mr. Kenner; I saw him and several other people, and Mr. Fitzgerald, at the Sessions-house yesterday; Mr. Kenner gave me information that the money was lodged in Gooch's Bank; I went early on Monday, this transaction was on Friday, and I did not hear before Sunday of its being lodged there.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not give him permission to take the money away; that you are positive of? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that you were to advance 13 guineas for 25 men? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is just 325 guineas; you had a good deal of other property, and though you had many annuities you were only to lend the gentleman at the bar the sum I have stated that was necessary? - A. I wanted to change my stock.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. To fell off all the money you had in that stock? - A. Yes; there were 150 l. in the 3 per cent. I wanted to put it in the 4 per cent. when I got my money in four days.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Did not you say before the Magistrate that you wanted some of it for your own private use? - A. So I did; I did not say I should keep every shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. You have now said; that you wished to transfer it to another stock; how do you reconcile that? - A. I had a quantity of stock to sell, and if I wanted pocket-money, should I not be a great fool not to keep it out of so large a sum as 600 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made any agreement with Mr. Foley, before you sold out any stock, that he should return it at any given time? - A. He told me he would return it in four days.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the day after the money was taken seeing Mr. Meene at your lodgings with excuses for Mr. Foley, that he was gone to London?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040056"/>- A. Mr. Meene called the next day, and the day after, on Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that Mr. Meene called to know whether you wished to have a bond or a note for your money, and you refused having a bond or a note; and that you would rely on the honour of Mr. Foley? - A. He did mention the note or bond, but I did not want to make a debt of it; what could I think when I heard the money was in Gooch's Bank, and he had told me it was to raise 25 men, but that it was in the hands of swindlers?</p>
               <p>Q. It was late on Friday when this happened; had you taken any steps before they offered a bond or a note? - A. None at all; I certainly should have given him a day's time for security.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You were afraid, if you made a debt of it, you would lose your money? - A. Yes, because I knew he had been false; he got the money fraudulently to give the men, and there were no men.</p>
               <p>- BROUGHTON sworn. - The prisoner brought notes to the amount of 610 l. he had 10 l. and in consequence left 600 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any of the notes here? - A. No; Bankers generally, when they receive notes, pay them away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. We admit the notes belong to herself.</p>
               <p>Court. It is a very dishonourable thing; it is not a felony; it may be a trick; they are her notes, and it is right she should have them.</p>

             picked me up, and afterwards there were two more women came; I turned angry with them, and asked them what they wanted; the last two went away and left me with the first; we went on a little farther, and there was a man that used me ill; he wanted to fight me; the prisoner had some conversation with him, what I cannot tell; the prisoner came to me again, and, as I was going along the street to St. Martin's lane, I missed the canvas bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you keep your canvas bag? - A. In my breeches pocket; going along I heard something fall; it happened to be my own canvas purse, I took it up, and missed a note out of it; I told her, if she would give it me honourably I would give her 5 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your note again? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found your purse, what did you find in it? - A. All the money was left in it, and nothing gone but the note; I had felt her hand about that pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Not directly in it? - A. No, only about the pocket; I immediately put my hand there, and found the purse was gone.</p>

             sworn. - I was constable of the night; she was brought in about eleven o'clock, the purse was delivered to me by Pocock; it contained two seven-shilling-pieces, five shillings, half-a-crown, and three sixpences, in silver; it was agreed by the Magistrate, at Marlborough-street, for the man to have some of the money, and three of the pieces of silver were marked. (The bag, and the three shillings marked, were produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was in Long-acre, that man picked me up, and asked me to go and drink something; there were two or three more girls, they ill-used me, I went away from them; this man came up to me, and said he had been robbed; the girls knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you see the bag drop from her? - A. I heard it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were you sure that your purse was in your possession when the two women went away? - A. I cannot particularly say; when I missed it, the man wanted to fight me; I searched my pocket, and found the bag was gone.</p>

               <p>Q. On the morning of the 30th of May, were you at the stables where the artillery horses are kept? - A. Yes; at about twenty minutes past six in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any of them lost their tails, or manes? - A. A lad called to me to look at the horses' tails, there was one horse with the blood running from his tail, that gave me suspicion; and on looking further, I found thirty or forty of their tails maimed and shaved.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen these horses' tails before; were they perfect, had they lost their tails<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040057"/>the over night? - A. No; I saw them safe about six o'clock the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at that time in Mr. Willan's service? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>- FISHER sworn. - I am one of the drivers.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning of the 30th of May, what time did you go to the stables where these horses are kept? - A. About a quarter before six o'clock; I found this man cutting the tail of a black horse with his knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he cut the tail as well as the hair off? - A. He cut the tail and it bled; he had the hair in his left-hand, and his knife in his right-hand; and when I came up he put the horse's hair in his hat, and put his hat on his head, and said, I am so ill I must go home.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else in the stables besides? - A. Not that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Had these horses long tails? - A. Very long tails; in about two or three days after we found a little bunch of grey horse hair, when we were cleaning.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Dirden.) When you found the horses' tails were cut, did you search the stables? - A. No; I do not know what became of the hair, we could not find out any body but this man, we had no suspicions before of any man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. It was half past five when I went into the stable, I was very ill and shut up the stable; I came out of the Infirmary three or four days before; I went home to my lodgings, and when I came up again I was stopped at the accompting-house, I know nothing about it; I have been with Mr. Willan these two years, and never was charged with any thing in my life.</p>

I did not go with the prisoner, I went with the other girl; it was in Old Pye-street, they wanted something to eat; I sent for some ham and some porter, and after that I sat down on a chair, and laid my arm on the table, and dropped into a bit of a dose, and the while I was in a dose, they undid the wrapper where the goods were in, and took all the goods out; when I awakened, I found all these goods gone, and they had left the wrapper behind; I had bought a pound of sugar and a quarter of a pound of tea for my wife; I had in my pocket twelve shillings and sixpence and a pocket handkerchief; they took that, and afterwards they locked me in the room.</p>

             above stairs, the house is over the accompting-house, there is no communication from the dwelling-house to the accompting-house, the door is fastened up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. The brewer cannot go to the accompting-house without going to the outward door? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know of this property being stole till ten o'clock? - A. I stopped there till six o'clock, then I went away, I cannot say what time I returned, nor whether the accompting-house was left or not that morning.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is this accompting-house surrounded by any gates? - A. There is a gate to it both ways, no person can come to the accompting-house unless they come through the gates, or climb the wall; the gates are opened about eight o'clock in the morning, the watchman continues on the premises till six or seven o'clock; the gates had been opened by a key, there was no appearance of force on the premises; no person could come in or out without picking the lock of the gate; the watchman might let a person in; the clerks have not a key of the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the servants doing their duty, no person could come in there without climbing the wall, or forcing the gates, or picking the lock? - A. Not that I know off; it was not discovered it was broken open till past ten o'clock in the morning.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am an officer of Lambeth-street; I produce the notes I received from Hillingsworth and Parsley.</p>
               <p>Q. Hillingsworth and Parsley were employed by you to go to Moore's to see whether they could discover any thing of these notes? - A. From Hillingsworth I received six one-pound Bank-notes, and four from Parsley.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe you know Moore very well? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. From information, you had no difficulty in resorting to Moore to find out these notes, and get the notes back again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You remember Mr. Moore was committed for this burglary, and afterwards acquitted partly upon the ground my learned friend has admitted - Mrs. Moore was not here? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor the maid servant? - A. I do not recollect that.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was it that the prisoner at the bar was taken up for this charge, or was he taken up? - A. He was taken up about a fortnight after Moore had been committed; I met him at the Flying Horse door, his brother and him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any difficulty in coming? - A. Surely not: he lived in Somerset-street, Whitechapel, No. 19.</p>
               <p>Q. The present prisoner was charged before the Magistrate at that time? - A. Yes, and after a long examination set at liberty; it was not till after Moore was acquitted, that the prisoner was indicted.</p>
               <p>Q. Moore was tried in April Sessions, and Barrow was indicted the same Sessions - did you do all that was in your power to apprehend him? - A. Certainly; I went to his house, and could not find<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040061"/>him; I received information from the brewhouse, and went to different places in town, and could not find him.</p>

            ? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him in the month of January? - A. I did, I think on the 24th, on Tuesday, he said he had got some small Bank-notes to the amount of one hundred pounds, or upwards; he said he had got them, or should have, I am not certain which; he said he would call again; I did not make any particular answer to him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Then you did not tell him whether you would, or not? - A. I did not; he called again in the evening, and handed me a roll of paper, and said, there was a hundred and twenty-nine pounds; he described the notes, and said, there were eleven fives, a small bundle of twos, and the others all ones; I asked him respecting the notes, and he said they were notes that had been found; he said he would allow me eight pounds, if I would take them; he said he would leave them, and call in the morning for me to consider of it, and he did leave them; I looked over the notes, and found there was not the number; he said there were eleven fives, six or seven twos, and the rest ones; he called the next morning, I think, about nine o'clock; he asked me if I had considered about the notes; I asked him if there was any danger; he said none, they had been found; I asked him if they had been advertised; he said, not that he knew of; he said he would allow me the odd nine pounds; he had said the over night there were a hundred and twenty-nine pounds, and I said no; he took them in his hand, and counted them in my back warehouse, and he came forward, and said there were only a hundred and twenty-seven; he agreed that I should have them for a hundred and twenty pounds; I then asked him if he could give me change for a two hundred pound note; he said, yes; he gave me two fiftys, and I gave him eighteen pounds in small notes, and gave him the two hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. It was nine pounds he was to give you? - A. Give me leave to correct that error; it was a hundred and eighteen pounds I was to have them for.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Then, in point of fact, you took nine pounds instead of seven? - A. I did; that was all that passed. In the course of three days afterwards I saw an advertisement or bill stuck up, I cannot say which; the names were erased on the notes I had, which gave me suspicions that they were some of the notes; I did not observe the erasure on the notes till after I saw the advertisement; he called on me the next day, after I had seen this hand-bill, or advertisement; I mentioned to him what I had seen; I told him I had seen an advertisement about a robbery that had been committed at Limehouse, and I was doubtful that these notes were part of them; he said he did not believe they were; before he left me, he said that they might be part of them, but there was no danger; there were no numbers, and the names were all altered, and therefore they might be paid away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him any more before you were taken up? - A. I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember Mr. Parsley coming to your house for change of a ten-pound note? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the notes that you gave Mr. Parsley part of the notes you had received from him - look at these four, and see whether these four were part of the notes you had received from the prisoner? - A. I cannot tell. (Looks at them.)</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these six one-pound notes that Mr. Lillywhite had from your wife, whether they are any part of the notes that you had from the prisoner? - A. I cannot swear that they are.</p>
               <p>Q. See whether these four, which are cancelled by the Bank, are the same that you paid Mr. Thomas? - A. I cannot speak to any of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any of the notes that you had received from the prisoner? - A. No, they are paid away.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you pay the last of them away? - A. Near two months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose possession, when you were tried in April, was the remainder of the notes? - A. I cannot say; I believe they were not all paid away.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you were taken up, how many were in your possession? - A. To the best of my recollection about fifty pounds; they were paid away with other notes.</p>

I think you have said, that at the time you were tried here, you had fifty pounds of these notes that had not been discovered, and which you have paid away since; I am really very much surprised your countenance did not change, when you told us that; there is much more cogent proof of your being concerned in that burglary as receiver of stolen property; against the prisoner there is no proof but what depends upon the man in whose possession the stolen property was found.</p>

On Monday morning when I arose, I looked for my things, and they were gone; the prisoner lodged in the house, but not in my room; I had a room to myself, but I had not locked my door when I went out; I went up to the stable on Monday morning, and between nine and ten o'clock I went to Somers Town, where I heard the prisoner had such things to sell, and witnesses which I have here bought the things of him, which I know to be mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He now says the things were dirty, and at the Magistrate's he swore they were clean linen, and that he put them there to put on.</p>
               <p>Witness. No such thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I came after I heard of it, and surrendered myself up to the house when I came from Mr. Field's.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is it true that he surrendered himself? - A. The landlord of the house charged him with it; his servant boy lost a pair of breeches, and he heard that he had the boy's breeches.</p>

No; I was out of place at that time; they brought the coat to me, and wanted me to go with them to pawn it, and I did; it was night when we went to pawn it; it was pawned in Drury-lane, just before you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040063"/>come to Long-acre; I do not know the pawnbroker's name.</p>

               <p>Q. (To the prosecutor.) Did not the prisoners say, as soon as they had got the money, they would take it out? - A. They denied it; I went to Barnsley afterwards, and he owned that they had took the coat from the coach-office; he told me I should have the coat after a while; this was five weeks afterwards; I had offered five shillings the next morning to drink, if any body would come forward, and I think I offered very fair.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. All that for your 8 s.? - A. Yes.</p>

Yes; after he had given it me in blue paper, I put it in my right-hand breeches pocket; I had no other money about me; after I had put it into my pocket, he said he could not stop any longer; he then drank and went out of the parlour door; it was rum and water we had on the table; directly after that he went out, and I gave a signal to

            's custody.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Harris.) You secured him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Hyde. I immediately went down to the officers, and Mr. Limerick and the other officers came up, and then we were all taken together to a public-house, the next but one, and there we were searched, and Limerick took out of my pocket the metal I had bought of the prisoner; and after they had searched me they searched the prisoner in my presence, and on him they found a vast quantity of silver and gold and Bank notes, and amongst the silver they found one of the shillings I had given him for the metal; we were taken from there and brought to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. First of all are you quite sure you had no more money when you went to the public-house than that they gave you? - A. I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. And after you had given the prisoner that money, you had only that metal? - A. I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have been some time acquainted with the prisoner? - A. Not some time, I have seen him once before.</p>
               <p>Q. With your friend? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So you were searched by the officer before you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040066"/>went into the public-house? - A. Yes; and one of the officers gave me the 8 s. which I gave the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How were you searched, by rubbing down your small clothes? - A. Yes; they searched the pockets, and that was all.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the same hat that you have now, it has a draw-in lining? - A. Mr. Limerick searched that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell me this moment they only searched your pockets, they did not search the sleeve of your coat; there are strange things done in the sleeve of a coat; where was it you went for the officers? - A. Close by.</p>
               <p>Q. What, were they within sight; what distance might they be; were there many people in the street? - A. Not far, I did not meet many people.</p>
               <p>Q. It was noon day? - A. It was; I met the officers directly I got out of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were there in the public-house; it was a busy day there I am told? - A. There were a good many people there, as far as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. You were drinking rum and water there; the landlord and other people came in occasionally? - A. Nobody came in but the landlord.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave the door open? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a glass door; is it not? - A. I did not take particular notice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. The door came into the tap-room? - A. No, the door is out from the tap; it is a private parlour; it joins the bar in which the wife of the landlord sits.</p>
               <p>Q. So then the officers searched you before you went into the public-house - do you know the reason why they searched you? - A. To find the coin I had bought of the Jew.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose, before you went into the house, did they search you - they searched you at Bow-street -</p>
               <p>Court. I will give you the reason why they searched him: because they supposed it necessary for your examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you a slight character? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Had not you a misfortune befall you in the country? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what that misfortune was? - A. I suppose you know as well as I do; I would wish you to tell the gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you taken up for passing bad money? - A. I gave information of a person who passed bad money there.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they so uncivil as to take you up for giving information of a person passing bad money - you were taken into custody yourself - do you mean to say that you were taken into custody for giving information of another person? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand you that you were not taken up for passing bad money? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the officer to take you up? - A. I came forward to the Magistrate at High Wickham; he was an acquaintance of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. So then one of your acquaintances had the misfortune to fall in a bad thing of this kind - after you came from High Wickham, you came to Bow-street? - A. I was taken to Bow-street; they kept me in custody, perhaps, because I could not give security.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of your friend at High Wickham? - A. He was sent on board a man of war.</p>
               <p>Q. This Harris, where did he sit, he was in the parlour all the time? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not he go to the window? - A. Not all the time; the prisoner, when he came, asked me if my friend wanted to buy a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that your acquaintance was looking on all the time? - A. He was looking on some of the time, when the prisoner was in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the prisoner was searched afterwards, and no bad money found on him? - A. I do not know whether it was good or bad.</p>
               <p>Q. You deal in these articles, you ought to know? - A. One of the officers had it.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you nineteen shillings of what you call capital good? - A. I do not call it capital good.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the nineteen shillings? - A. The officers have got it.</p>
               <p>Q. You never examined the silver you got from him? - A. I counted it over in the room before my friend.</p>
               <p>Q. This was transacted all before his face, and he quite a stranger? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say one of the marked shillings was found in the prisoner's possession - what became of the others? - A. I do not know; he was not immediately taken into custody, because he pulled the door after him; he then was out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. You never told him you were going to inform? - A. I have reason to believe that he had suspicions, by seeing

               <p>Q. Where you acquainted with Hyde before? - A. No acquaintance at all of Hyde's; I went by the desire of the officers, we got out of a coach before we went there; Hyde and me went into the public-house, the officers were on the outside waiting; we went into a back room behind the bar, we did not go through the bar; after we got into the room, the prisoner came in about ten minutes, and Hyde told him he wanted to speak to him; the prisoner took him out, and what they said I cannot say; Hyde came in again, and he said, he is gone to fetch it; the prisoner went out of the house, he returned, and went the opposite side of the room, the prisoner's back was towards me, I heard the money pass; the prisoner seemed rather shy.</p>
               <p>Q. On his appearing rather shy, do you recollect Hyde saying any thing to him? - A. He said, you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040067"/>need not be afraid of him, he is a friend of mine, he wants readers.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are the person that is usually called upon these occasions, look at this money, and tell us what it is? (The money handed to the witness.) - A. The whole of it is counterfeit; two half-crowns, a seven-shilling piece, and seven shillings, they are all bad.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at these three seven-shilling pieces that were found in the pot? (Looks at them.) - A. They are all three counterfeits.</p>
               <p>Q. Compare that parcel with the other, these three seven-shilling pieces found in the pot, and the seven-shilling piece found on Hyde? - A. They are all four like one another, I believe they are all struck with the same dye; these four seven-shilling pieces are all counterfeits.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never knew Hyde at all; he asked me to sell him a watch, I fetched him one, and told him the price; he said, it was too dear, he had not money enough about him; if I had done any thing that was evil, I should have made my escape, and run away; the only dealings that I had with him was the watch.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he afterwards call to pay you? - A He came according to promise that same evening that I sent the goods, and brought me a draft at three months, which I returned to him the next day; I said to him, Mr. Howes, the agreement was cash, or I would not have hurried the goods; he said, he should have plenty of cash in a fortnight, and he would bring it me; I gave him four pounds one shilling change out of thirty pounds ten shillings; he promised to bring me the cash in a fortnight. When he was gone, I looked at the bill, and found it was not accepted; I went and shewed the draft to Mr. Bird; in consequence of a conversation with him, I went to Westminster-road the next morning, and got the goods again; I saw Mr. Howes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040069"/>and he promised to call upon me in the afternoon with the four pounds one shilling. A woman, of the name of Williams, called about eleven o'clock, and brought me this bill, (producing it.) After she was gone, the prisoner Thody came, and said he was the person to accept that bill which Mrs. Williams had brought.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he accept it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he write this acceptance in your presence? - A. He did; I asked him if he knew Howes; he said, yes, he thought very highly of him as a professional gentleman, he had got a cause for him twelve years ago; I asked him how I was to get my four pounds one shilling. While we were talking, Howes came in, and wrote upon the back of this bill a memorandum, to which Thody put his name.</p>
               <p>"Memorandum. - Mr. Thody is to pay 30 l. 10 s. besides 25 l.</p>

               <p>I was to take that bill, and the box was put into the coach; that bill was to pay for the goods and the four pounds one shilling. I sent for Mr. Bird, my neighbour, and then Howes got out of the wrong side of the coach; Mr. Bird came directly, and asked to see the bill; I shewed it him; Howes had run away, Thody was in the house; I was confused, and Mr. Bird can tell you more of it than I can.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either Howes or Thody tell you any thing about No. 4, Temple-lane, London? - A. No, that was in the bill.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a perfumer, No. 10, New Round-court, Strand.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have seen the defendant Howes write? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that letter, and tell me if you believe that to be his hand-writing? - A. It resembles a writing that has been in my possession before; I rather think it is his hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, do you believe it to be his hand writing or not? - A. I rather believe it; not but it is larger than his usual hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at that endorsement; do you believe that to be his hand writing? - A. I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You say you could not swear to his hand writing because it is larger than his usual writing? - A. I go by the H. I have seen him write very often.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him write? - A. I am not obliged to answer that.</p>
               <p>Q. Yes, you are; upon your oath tell me one single thing you ever saw him write? - A. If my Lord requires me I will.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you where you have seen him write? - A. I saw him write a letter to-day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a perfumer? - A. Twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never been a waiter? - A. Yes, at the watering-places, of course.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I suppose you are an itinerant perfumer? - A. I have the run of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What house? - A. At Thurpark's, in Yorkshire.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been getting a livelihood for twenty years past in the trade of a perfumer; have you never been an informer? - A. To be sure I have, for the good of the Crown.</p>
               <p>Q. And for the good of your own pocket too? - A. I do not say that; I never was but once in my life in a Court, and that was in the Court of Exchequer.</p>
               <p>Q. I know that is the Court in which informations are brought; where do you keep a shop? - A. I do not keep a shop at all; I sell my goods by wholesale; my warehouse is at Pentonville.</p>
               <p>Q. How often do you go into Yorkshire? - A. I have not been there these eleven years.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you again do you mean to swear from the comparison of some writing you may have seen, or from the knowledge of having seen him write, that this is the defendant's hand-writing, or from both? - A. From what I have seen, and from having seen writing that I believe to be his, I think this is his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. When you talk of the run of the house, have you ever been in the capacity of an officer of any sort; I do not mean a military or naval officer? - A. Mr. Phillips, the Sheriff, employed me as a hair-dresser.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you been over the way lately? - A. Many times.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you been bail? - A. I am bail for the sheriff.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find Howes? - A. No; I asked Mrs. White, in Thody's presence, if she had got the bill; she said she had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she shew you that bill? - A. That is the bill she produced to me; and I asked Thody if he had accepted that bill; he said he had; I asked him if he lived at No. 4, Temple-lane; he said he did; I said you may be a respectable gentleman for any thing I know, but it is very proper I should go and see if you live there, Mrs. White being a widow woman; but I should be more satisfied if I could see Mr. Howes, as he represented him to be a respectable gentleman; I said, I shall not suffer these goods to go till I see Mr. Howes, to know who he is, the goods were in a coach at the door; says he I can fetch Howes; he went out of the shop to fetch Howes, down Wych-street, and the coachman ran after him; in about three or four minutes he came back, and brought Howes with him; I asked him if his name was Howes, he said it was; I asked who drew this bill, and he pointed to Thody; I said, that cannot be, for Thody has accepted it. I said to Mrs. White's porter, get the goods out of the coach, it is an infernal piece of business, they are a set of swindlers.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you afraid of these merchants bringing an action against you for destroying their credit? - A. I was threatened by Howes with a prosecution, Howes said he was an attorney; I said his actions were not like one, and I shut the door with intention to secure him; after many threats from Howes, I thought it best to let them out, for fear of a prosecution, not knowing the length that such gentlemen might go; the goods were delivered back safe into Mrs. White's shop, I kept the bill; I went to No. 4, Temple-lane, with the bill; I found it a respectable house in the profession of the law, the name of Lloyd was on the door, but I found no person of the name of Thody; there was another No. 4. I went there, but no such person was to be found there; I then got information of another Temple-lane, I went there, to No. 4, but no such person was to be found there, one Mr. Masters lived there. Some time afterwards, eight or nine days, I was coming through Scotland-yard, and saw Howes and Thody, I had a gentleman with me; I went up to them, and asked them for the balance that was due to Mrs. White; and Howes said, he had done business, to arrest one Wallis, for Mrs. White, and she owed him that money.</p>

            , and keeps a masquerade warehouse: On the 9th of February, the defendant Ronalds came to our house; he ordered four hats, four dominos, four masks, and four tickets, for the masquerade, to be sent to No. 28, Duke-street, West-Smithfield; he desired I would take change for a 10 l. note or bill; it was about eight o'clock, and about nine I went with the things; I went up into the first floor, and saw Mr. Ronalds and a lady; I unpacked the things, and then he asked me for the change; I told him to give me the note; he said he had not a 10 l. note, and gave me a bill for 25 l. 10 s. 6 d (Produces it. The note read, dated Slough, 26 January, 1804, at two months after date.) I looked at the bill, and suspected it not to be a good one; Hoxton was spelt wrong; I put the bill in my pocket, and told him I would bring him the change in an hour; he said he had come from Slough that day, and wanted cash to go to the masquerade; I went home, and mentioned my suspicions; I did not leave the masquerade tickets, I brought them back; my mistress desired me to go back, and leave the tickets; I went back, and

Yes, a woman; I afterwards went to No. 28, Duke-street, I think it was the 11th of February; I went up stairs, and saw Mr. Howes; Mrs. Howes told him I had called concerning the masquerade tickets; he said, oh, he had not seen Mr. Ronalds, he supposed he had been in bad company, and lost the things; I said the things were brought here, and I should expect them returned from here; he then asked if I had got the note, and I said, no; he said, if I would give it him, he would try and get it changed for me; I did not deliver it to him; he then said he would get the things if possible for me, if I would call the next day; I called the next morning, and saw him at breakfast with Mrs. Howes; he asked me whether I had not been to Hoxton, and seen a lady there; I told him, yes, I had; I told him I would call again; he said, very well, if I would call again, he would do the utmost of his endeavours to get the things for me; he said first, he believed Mr. Ronalds a very good sort of a man, and there was no fear of my having them again; in about five minutes after he said Mr. Ronalds was a very indifferent sort of a man, and he thought he should never see either the things or the note again; I then went to Bow-street, and he was taken into custody about two o'clock that day.</p>

Mr. Justice Le Blanc reported to the Judges that it was satisfactorily proved that you were in the habit of putting off bad notes, and that you employed Sarah Hudson in putting them off; that on Saturday, the 21st of January, you had so employed her, you being in or about the Old-Bailey while you so employed her; that on that day she went to the shop of

            , in Newgate-street, and purchased some muslin handkerchiefs, for which she offered in payment a forty shilling Bank-note; he suspected it was a forged one; he stopped the note, and sent it to the Bank; it turned out to be a forged note. The same evening Sarah Hudson returned to the shop in company with you. You said,</p>
               <p>"this woman has been here today, and offered a 2 l. note, which you have stopped." You asked the reason why it was stopped, and said,</p>
               <p>"it is my note, and I must have either the note or the change." You were told it was sent to the Bank, and in consequence of that it could not be returned; you repeatedly insisted upon having the note or the change; the Jury found you guilty, and the judgment was respited for the opinion of the Judges to decide whether the evidence supported the conviction of yourself upon either of the Counts. In this case two questions have been proposed for the consideration of the Judges: one was whether the evidence supported the conviction upon the Count for uttering and publishing as true, knowing it to be forged; and the other was whether the evidence supported the conviction upon the second Count, for disposing of and putting away. As to the first Count, it seemed to be the general opinion of the Judges, that if the woman, 
               <persName id="o18040704-1-person699">

            , had been innocent, and had not known the note to be forged, you would have been rightly convicted upon the first Count, for uttering and publishing it as true, knowing it to be forged, according to the doctrine laid down by Mr. Justice Foster, chap. 1. sect. 3. that where an innocent person is employed for a criminal purpose, the employer must be answerable; but Mr. Justice Le Blanc stated to us, that it appeared at the trial that Sarah Hudson knew the note to be a forged one. Upon that being reported, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040072"/>Judges have formed no opinion upon the evidence, as applying to the first Count, for uttering and publishing as true knowing it to be forged, thinking it sufficient to consider the case upon the second Count. The question with respect to which is, whether the facts here stated amount to a disposing or a putting away within the meaning of the 15th Geo. II. chap. 13. sect. 11. Upon this point there has been a difference of opinion among the Judges. Some have held that this is not an offence within the statute, because, till she had uttered the note, it ought to be considered as in your possession; and when she did utter it, you were only an accessary before the fact, and should have been so indicted; but the majority of the Judges, of whom I am one, are of opinion that the conviction is right. As to the constructive possession, it is by fiction of law only, that, when the actual possession is in one person, the constructive possession shall be considered in another, and these fictions are for the purpose of obtaining the ends of justice, and ought not to be defeated when that is their object. In this case you delivered the note to 
               <persName id="o18040704-1-person700">
                  Sarah

             for a fraudulent purpose; you could not have recovered it back by any action at law, it was out of your legal power; and when it was actually uttered by her, she had effected the purpose for which it was delivered to her, and the note was disposed of and put away. The question then was, which offence did the Legislature intend to prevent by the 11th sect. of the 13th chap. of 15th Geo. II. if their intention is clear the consideration of a constructive possession in you does not appear, if sufficient weight to restrain the ordinary construction of the words of the statute. The words of the statute are,</p>
               <p>"if any person shall offer, or dispose of, or put away, any forged, counterfeit, or uttered note." Now, uttering was a capital offence by a former statute, and as delivering an instrument to another, is a step towards uttering it, seems most consonant to the intention of the Legislature, to hold that a delivery to another with a fraudulent purpose, is an offence within the words, dispose of or put away. For these reasons the majority of the Judges, and a very considerable majority, are of opinion that the conviction is right upon the Count for disposing of and putting away.</p>
