I laid hold on him, and asked what he was doing, and called the Watch. I asked him what he did it for; he said she was his Wife and was drunk, and it was no Business of mine. The Watchman took Charge of him, the Woman lying on the Ground. She was without her Shoes, Hat, Cloak, or Apron; a Watchman carried her to the Watchouse along with the Prisoner, and I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175312050003"/> there with them.

The Prisoner's Wife said she was as good as he, or any there; he damned her for a Bitch. Then the Prisoner and the Deceased laid hold of each other, I can't tell which struck first; they had two Falls, and the third the Deceased's Head fell against the Fender. Then he was taken up and carried to the Hospital, where he lived three Weeks and two Days after this. I saw him about four or five Days after this happened, and asked him how he did: He said he thank'd God he was a great deal better than he had been, and that (only for his Head) he should be well in a Week or ten Days. Have you, said I, any Animosity against the Man that hurt you? No, said he, I have not, I'll assure you; had I not been in Liquor I should not have meddled with any Body whatsoever.</p>

When I was got up he was missing; then I missed my money from out of my box, three guineas, one half guinea, and 9 s. 6 d. I inform'd his father at Hampstead, who came and went with my brother after him towards Stratford-upon-Avon. My brother did not go quite there; the father return'd and brought me a guinea and half, and 1 s. 6 d. from the prisoner, as part of what he had taken from me. About a month after this the prisoner came to London again and was taken and had before the justice. There he denied it, but own'd it to me and the justice's clerk.</p>
               <p>Thomas Bingham was call'd and did not appear, and his recognisance order'd to be estreated.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in his defence said he did not break open any lock.</p>

            . On the first of December I had been at a merry-making at the sign of St. Andrew's Cross, facing St. Andrew's Church, Holbourn; and coming home I overtook two women at the Royal Bed, the corner of <placeName id="t17531205-22-crimeloc106">Fleet Market</placeName>

I pass'd them about fifty yards, and stopping to make water the prisoner came up to me, and asked me whether I would give her any thing to drink. I asked her for what? she said it was very cold. I put my hand into my pocket; I had but three pence, and gave her three halfpence. She then went up to a publick house in Poplin's Alley, and asked me to go in with her; I did not go in. She came out again and went from me a little while, a minute or thereabouts. I was then going about my business, but presently after heard somebody cry halloo. I stopt and the prisoner came up to me again, and said. What have you got to say to me? Have you a mind to have a touch or no? I said I had got no more than three pence. She said, D - n you, what is that! I said I had got no more. Well come, says she, I'll give you a toss off for that; so I gave it to her; she came fumbling up against me, and with that I directly miss'd my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know you had the watch at that time ?</p>
               <p>Cross. I am sure I had; for just as I came out of the publick house in Holbourn, I look'd to see what it was o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel the prisoner put her hand in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Cross. No, I did not feel her take it.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you miss it?</p>
               <p>Cross. I miss'd it before I parted with her, and charged her with having it. I search'd her and rumbled her about as much as I could, but did not find it; here is a witness that found it. She said she was big with child, and desired I would let her alone. I was going to leave the watch with her, thinking not to be exposed; but the next witness came up and said, Young man, what is the matter? I told him I had lost my watch, and desir'd he would search her. I saw him search her, and saw the watch drop from between her legs, and the glass was broke in the fall.</p>

On Monday night last a little before eight o'clock I went out, and coming in again a little before ten found the padlock taken off from my door, and the stock lock broke; my house was fast before I went out. I found a strong chissel in the house, with which I suppose it was broke open; I miss'd the things mention'd. One Mrs. Jones that keeps a broker's shop in Broker's Alley, sent to me the next day, and told me she had the things; I went there and received them. The prisoner was taken and carried before Justice St. Lawrence, who ask'd him how he came by the things. He said he was at the house with some other company, that he held the bag while they put them in, and that it was the first fact. I took the buckles from him; they were wrapt up in his apron.</p>

            . I live in Broker's Alley by Drury Lane. The prisoner and another person with him came on Monday last, about four o'clock in the afternoon, to my house, and asked me if I would buy some things. I asked where they were, and they said they would bring them presently; they went away, and coming again at nine o'clock brought the things. I told them I could not look at them that night, for it was too late; they came to me the next day for the money or the goods. I bid them go to some place and stay a little; they went to a publick house by Long Acre, where I went to have them stopt. When I stopt the prisoner the other ran away, and the prisoner then said he brought the things from a house on Little Saffron Hill. I said, How did you come into the house? He said there was a fellow that broke open the door, and that he went in afterwards and put them in the bag, and brought them away. I then sent a man to Saffron Hill to inquire what house was broke open. He found the prosecutor talking that his house was broke open; he brought him with him, and they took the prisoner to Justice St. Lawrence's.</p>

               <p>Q. Was this money to be spent?</p>
               <p>Clarage. I heard nothing of that, not being at the first agreement, but heard of it at the time of their fighting. The deceased died in about nine hours after the battle. They fought at nine, and he died about six in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they sober when they fought ?</p>
               <p>Clarage. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the deceased's death owing to any bruises he received?</p>
               <p>Clarage. I can't say any thing to that. He was bruised very much about his breast, which I believe the prisoner gave him; the prisoner was bruised very much.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they near of an age?</p>
               <p>Clarage. Yes, two strong young fellows; the deceased was very well before he began to fight.</p>

               <p>Q. When was the agreement made to fight ?</p>
               <p>Clarage. The same morning about eight o'clock.</p>

            . I saw the beginning of the battle. The deceased was very hearty and well before they fought; they said it was a fix'd battle. They shook hands before they sought. As soon as it was over the deceased lay on the ground; they neither of them spoke a word. I saw no appearance of malice any farther than striving to beat each other. I carried the deceased out of the field.</p>

            . I saw the deceased on the Friday before they fought, which was on a Monday. Willet said the first time he saw the prisoner he'd give him a punch on the head if he would not fight him, and he'd throw him behind the fire and burn him. I saw the battle, and the deceased about an hour or two after the battle; but never heard him speak, and believe he died of his bruises then received.</p>

            . I saw the battle, and believe the deceased died in consequence of that battle. I saw them in Cheapside the Saturday before; they had words, and I saw the deceased turn and shake his hand at the prisoner; the prisoner said, Do you threaten me? The deceased was a very quarrelsome man; had it been on the stones he must have kill'd the prisoner, I believe he threw him fifty times.</p>

            . On the tenth of November last I went into Great Warner-street, Cold Bath Fields. I went in at the Red Lion and call'd for a pint of beer; the two prisoners were there, and ask'd me to give them some beer, which I did. I wanted to know my way to <placeName id="t17531205-35-crimeloc159">Mount Pleasant</placeName>

               <p>Q. What time did you go into that house?</p>
               <p>Nash. Between ten and eleven they went to shew me my way; but they took me just the contrary way, and went towards Sir John Oldcastle's. I said, Sure this is the wrong way, upon which Keyes tripp'd up my heels, and took my money out of my pocket, which was one guinea, two half guineas, a 4 s. 6 d. piece, and three half crowns. They both had their hands in my pockets. She said, his buckles are silver, take them; he pull'd off one of my shoes, and she the other. They took my hat and wig, which I begg'd for again; but Keyes said, I'll knock you on the head if you make a noise.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them before?</p>
               <p>Nash. I never saw them before that night to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Nash. Yes, I was. Then they ran away, and I after the woman as far as Black Mary's Hole, and took her; she never was out of my sight. I could see him also running when at some distance, and he was taken the next day by her directions. She confess'd before Justice Chamberlaine that he and she went out together while I was sitting in the alehouse, and she said to him, The man has got money in his pocket, let's rob him.</p>

She said he wanted to have been rude with her, and so she had robb'd him. She said, His hat is in the ditch; I sent the watchmen out to see for it, going along they found a shoe without a buckle. Produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor. And on the bridge near the dead wall they found his hat. When these things were brought back I ask'd her what she had to say then? Then she said the man in company with her his name was Bob, but she did not know his other name, having been but a fortnight with him. We carried her to Bridewell, and the next day we found Keyes at St. Giles's, where she directed us; we carried them to Justice Chamberlaine, where they both confessed the fact, and sign'd it. He produced two half guineas and three half crowns sealed up by the justice, which were taken out of a tobacco box which Keyes confessed he took from the prosecutor.</p>

            's family; we were out of town, and these spoons of mine mentioned in the indictment, were left in a chest of drawers, they were all in a paper rolled up together; the shoes mentioned were in one of the drawers, I cannot say whether it was the same drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go out of town?</p>
               <p>Decima Davis. I went out in May and returned in October. I left the drawers locked when I went out, and found them so when I came home. Upon missing a petticoat, in searching about I missed several other things, and amongst them the spoons, a pair of shoes, and a gauze handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose drawers were the spoons in?</p>
               <p>Decima Davis. They were in Sir James's drawers, but I had the use of them. The spoons produced in court and deposed to.</p>

               <p>Humphrys. I did not. I collared him and threw him down on his back: while I was tussling with him there came up another man and struck me over the head, I believe with a stick; he followed his blows after that I imagined with a hanger, and cut me in four places on my head; then he that attacked me first took me by my middle and threw me into the ditch; there I was stunned, and they rifled me; they took my hat and wig from my head, then my watch from my fob, a guinea, three farthings, a tobacco-box, spectacles and case, out of my pocket, and a dead pig which I had got for my Sunday's dinner. There I lay some considerable time in a gore of blood, feeling it come out of the knee of my breeches into my shoe. I got up upon the causeway very faint, and scrambled along, and in about five or six hundred yards met three men coming towards London, and begged their assistance, who saw me to my habitation though they were strangers to me. I cannot be certain to any of the persons that abused me; I believe the evidence here is the man that first demanded my money.</p>

Mason met Humphrys the prosecutor, and wished him a hearty good night, and spoke with a chearful voice that we might hear; the prosecutor came up, and I laid hold on him, but had a lame hand, having had it run through with a sword, so could not do much, and he got me down upon the causeway; I got him on his back in the ditch, and got his silver watch out in the struggle; but he would not give up his money to the prisoner; Welch took a hanger and pushed it at his mouth, which took him in the chin; I called out to him to let him alone, then Welch bid me cut his throat; I said there is no occasion, he is easy enough; then Welch junior said, two old women could have done the business sooner than you have.</p>

               <p>Kirby. No, he stood in his place; then Welch senior gave the prosecutor a stroke on the head first with a hanger, and after that with a stick; and he broke the stick and left part of it in the ditch; Welch took his money from him, but at that time he did not acknowledge it to us, but said he had no money. I staid a little while to search, and found he had a pig tied up in two cloths, which I took; after the next robbery Welch acknowledged he had a guinea and some halfpence from the prosecutor, and paid us.</p>

               <p>On the twenty-second of September I went over to the Two Brewers in Maynard-street, and wanted that woman to ask the landlady to lend me fourteen shillings to take out some things which I intended to pledge in some other place for more money; this money was in halfpence, and they sent the soldier with me to see what I wanted it for. I went for the things in West-street, Seven Dials, and carried them to Mr. Bibby's, a pawnbroker; they lay for thirteen shillings, and Mr. Bibby lent me a guinea on them, after which we went into Clare Market, and got a breast of mutton, and some pork steaks; then we came to Mr. Reding's at the Two Brewers, and had the steaks dress'd. At that time I believe it might be about nine o'clock, and I borrowed the money about seven.</p>
               <p>Q. to S. Harvey. Are you certain as to the time you mention?</p>
               <p>S. Harvey. The child was sick at Mr. Reding's, and a man took out his watch to see about its time to take physick, and I know it was near ten when the money was lent Mason.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Stanhope-street. The prisoner Mason was at our house on the twenty-second of September, and left some things for a guinea. I know it was about two or three hours after we had lighted candles, but will not pretend to be exact to an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you light candles then?</p>
               <p>Bibby. I believe about five, and look upon it to be about eight when he came.</p>
               <p>Court. At that time the fun does not go down till about six; do you light candles before the sun goes down?</p>
               <p>Bibby. I cannot be exact as to the time.</p>

               <p>What I say will have no great weight, therefore I'll say nothing at all. I thought Clark was a very honest young fellow, and if he had brought a hundred pounds worth of things and desired me to have pawn'd them for him, I should. I always gave him the money they were pawn'd for. Once he said Mr. Fraizer had given him some silver lace which he wanted to pawn for him; having seen them in company several times, I thought Mr. Fraizer had ordered him to pawn them.</p>

            . On the 16th of November between 11 and 12 at night, I had set the silver pint mug in the bar, the prisoner came in and called for a quartern of anniseed. I had not enough above, so went down into the cellar to fill a bottle, then came up and served him, and he went away. Missing the mug in about three minutes after he was gone, I told my mistress of it; as he lived hard by she desired me to go to him. I went and sent for the watchman, who came with other assistance, and we found the prisoner up a chimney. After they had pull'd him down he was desired to produce the mug, he went to a closet and took it out, and gave it to Mr. Harding, who deliver'd it to Mr. Madding the constable.</p>

I charged him with taking it, he denied it and said I could not detain him without a constable, and used very bad words.

On the 29th of November I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner, the prosecutrix told me he had stole half a guinea from her, which I desired him to return; he said he'd give her half a guinea in silver, but denied the taking it. As we were going to the justice's he said if the woman would not hurt him, he'd give her the half-guinea, saying, it was in his shoe. He pull'd off his shoe, and taking out a half-guinea gave it to me, and said that is the piece that I took from off the bureau. We went to Justice Fielding, and there he own'd the same.

            . On the 22d of November, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I had carried a pot of beer to my lord Harrington's stable yard; but coming back again, the prisoner stopped me and took my cloak, and I cried out murder.</p>

            . On the 22d of November I was centinel at the stable yard, and heard the girl cry out; I ran; she said she had been robbed by that man (meaning the prisoner) of her cloak. Then I laid hold on him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the cloak in his possession?</p>
               <p>J. Copping. I saw it fall to the ground, but cannot say whether it was from her shoulder or his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say for himself?</p>

               <p>Q. How far is that from Bloody-bridge ?</p>
               <p>C. Rider. It is half a mile nearer London: on the 17th of September between seven and eight o'clock, came the deceased into my house; his coat and shirt were torn, and he in a vey bloody condition; I said what is the matter with you? he said I am my lord Harrington's cook; I have been robbed within two hundred yards of this house by two men in brownish cloaths; that he had wounded one of them in four or five places, but did not mention what parts of the body; that he had fired one pistol, and they two; that they got his knife away from him, and he got it again; he did not talk much.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he when he said this?</p>
               <p>C. Rider. It was either as we were going to the hospital, or in my house; he said also that he lost seven guineas or seven and a half, and his watch. There were five men drinking a bottle of wine in the house; I said, gentlemen turn out.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175312050019"/> I helped them to some pistols, a blunderbuss and a highland durk, and they went out; the deceased wanted a surgeon to dress his wounds. I went with him to the Duke's hospital, and the first we saw was Mr. West.</p>
               <p>Council for the crown. He is a quaker, and we cannot call him in,</p>
               <p>Rider. A small time after in came Mr. Cleator, another surgeon, then I left them together, and went out to see after the five men, and had four more joined me; we went up the road with two candles, the other five had a lanthorn and candle, at about 445 yards from my house, towards Bloody Bridge, (I measured it) we found three pistols, a whip and two keys, two pieces of a sheaf of a knife, each piece about six inches long, about as broad as two fingers, and a long needle.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you there when he was removed from the hospital to his own house?</p>
               <p>Rider. I was, his house was in Brown's Court, near Grosvenor-Square. He was carried in a coach, and he cried out as the coach sway'd, I was in it, and hollowed out to the coachman to drive gently. He was taken out of the coach at Grosvenor's Gate, and carried home in a chair. He was show'd the things that were found, and owned one of the pistols, the whip and the keys; and he said he had a needle in his sheaf, but I do not know whether he was shewn that and the pieces of the sheaf. I went the next morning as soon as it was light, and called the surgeon's man up, and he call'd one of the surgeons. We went up the road, and found blood; a man that joined us there, had found the deceased's hat in a gravel pit.</p>

I live at the Coach and Horses in Dover-street, I was at a house called the King's Arms, in the King's Road, a little after seven of the clock, on the 17th of September, when the wounded person came in with both his hands holding his belly, his coat torn off one shoulder, and his shirt torn from the other, in a bloody condition, and no hat on. Mr. Rider said, what is the matter with you? he said he had been robbed by two men, about 200 yards up the road. Said Rider, gentlemen, turn out, and see if you can find the highwaymen, he reached me down a gun. The man said to Mr. Rider, for God's sake let me go to some surgeon, for I am very much wounded, and I believe I have wounded one of the men as much as they have done me. I went out first up the road, and lay down, imagining I should hear the man groan that was wounded, but heard nothing. I saw a horse standing with a bridle and saddle, and holsters, but no pistols. I brought him back, and met the others with a lanthorn, with which they were going to look for the thief or pistols, or what they could find in the road. I carried the horse to the deceased, he bid me take him to the Catherine-Wheel Yard, which I did.</p>

            . I am one of the surgeons belonging to the Duke's Hospital, on Monday the 17th of September, between seven and eight o'clock, the deceased came into our hospital wounded and very bloody. I asked him pretty fully about the affair as I was dressing him, when he gave me this account: He said, he was riding pretty briskly, and coming to the gate, a man immediately whipped out and catched hold on the bridle of his horse, on this he saw another man get out of the ditch, who came and took him by his left arm; then he took a pistol from his holster, and fired at one of them, but missed him. Immediately each returned the fire with small pocket pistols; they cried, down with him; they pulled him to the ground, just as he had seized the second pistol, but had not time to fire it; one of them forced it from his hand, and began to beat him with the thick end of it, (he had received a violent blow on the mouth, and four of his teeth were beat so that they stood inclining into his mouth; he had likewise a contus'd wound on his head, both which I thought might be done with the pistol) then he said, he thought of his cooking knife as he lay on his back, drew it out, and stabbed one of them, and made the best defence he could, saying, he was sure he had stabbed him, the blood immediately came flowing upon him; but they soon took the knife from him, that he catched fast hold on the blade of the knife, and regained it again, and stabbed him in another place, (he had received a cut in the joint of one finger very deep) but said, before he could make a third stab, it was catched<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175312050020"/> from him again; then he catched it again with both hands, and also regained it, (his fingers were cut on both hands) then he stabbed him the third time; after which it was taken from him, and he regained it no more. Thus by his account he had given one of the men three stabs, I think he named the breast and belly, where he had given two of the wounds, and that there would be no difficulty in knowing them again by their marks; he said the man he wounded retired at a distance, and the other staid jumping on him; the other called to him and said, d - n him, I believe he has done for me, stamp his guts out, d - n him, a dog, murder him; and as he was lying on his back, the other man got on him, and jumped on him; and after they had continued that scene of cruelty some time, they left him, and he recovered himself, and got to Mr. Rider's. The deceased asked me in what condition I took him to be. At that time I could not discover that wound in the belly to be mortal. I told him I hoped he might do well: his principal complaint was of his bowels, occasioned by the jumping on him. When I went to see him the next morning, I then saw he was past all hopes of recovery: At that time I asked him some questions relating to his being hurt : He answered as before; and also told me over night, and in the morning, there is one of them I have not wounded with my knife, but I got his hand at my mouth, and bit either his finger or thumb.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he die?</p>
               <p>Cleator. He died that day, being the Tuesday, about two in the afternoon : I opened his body before the coroner, and found the wound on the left side the stomach had penetrated the abdomen, and penetrated one of the small guts through and through.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about what sort of cloaths the two men had on?</p>
               <p>Cleator. He said they had on darkish brown-coloured cloaths.</p>
               <p>Edrop again. After we came home from Petersham; my lord desired somebody would go to the cook to see how he did, I went, this was on Tuesday about twelve o'clock, at which time he was bathing in a warm tub of water. I asked him how he did; he said, very poorly indeed. I said, I hear you drew your knife; he answered, I did, and wounded one of them with it in several places, (naming the thigh, the side of the belly and breast) and that he had bit one of them by the thumb or finger. When I came home I gave my lord an account of what he said to me. Soon after which one of the surgeons came and acquainted my lord that he was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner's wounds?</p>
               <p>Edrop. I did after he was taken, which was on the 19th, the day after the cook died. He was carried before Justice Fielding, and when there would own to no other wound than one on his breast. A surgeon examined it. The Justice said, Have you no other wounds about you? He said, No, I said, you have one on the side of your belly: He said, I have a scratch there; that was looked into, and found to be a wound. I saw it, but did not much observe it. I asked him again, Have you any other wounds about you? He said, No, I said, you have, either on your thigh or groin. He had his regimental breeches on, almost new, but had no cut or place made through them by which to receive a wound. The Justice ordered him to be searched, and a wound was found upon his groin. The Justice asked him, if he had his regimentals on when he was wounded; He said, he had. The Justice asked him where he was when he was wounded; He said, in Broad St. Giles's: one time he said it was in a sort of a fray, at another time he said there were some russians fell upon him. Lattey (who died since in Newgate) was examined by the said Justice before the prisoner was brought in; there was a bite on the thumb, but the surgeon was very careful in saying whether it was a bite or not: I took it to be from a bite.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My words were about the wounds. I had no wound mortal but one on my breast.</p>
               <p>Edrop. Justice Fielding asked him how he came to deny all the wounds but that on his breast. He said, the others did not pain him so much.</p>
               <p>Cha. Krause. I am turned of fourteen years of age, and am son to the deceased. My father set out from Petersham the 17th of September for London: He always goes the king's road, and rode with his great knife in his pocket, and a brace of pistols before him.</p>

               <p>Court. DEscribe that long knife.</p>
               <p>Krause. [He produced one the fellow to it, the blade strait, with a sharp point, and about ten inches long. He is shewn the sheath in two pieces.] This was my father's sheath. On Monday night my mother told me my father had been robbed, and almost murdered; I went up to see him. He said he was very bad, and wounded in several places of his body, that he was coming galloping along by Bloody Bridge, but for fear of any accident there had stopt galloping and was coming a gentle pace; that two men came from each side the way, like devils, upon him, who seized him and pull'd him from his horse; that he fired and they fired; that they got him down and stamp'd upon him; that he wounded one of them in several places with his knife, and felt his blood come upon him as he lay. He mention'd one wound in the breast, and another in the groin, or thereabouts; that he bit one of them in the hand and thumb, but whether it was the same he could not tell; and that the men were both in dark-coloured cloaths.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Krause. I am widow to the deceased. I was sent for to the infirmary; he was there lying upon a bed, and they said he had been robb'd and wounded, but not dangerously. He told me he was very bad, and he believed a dead man; he cried out much of his bowels being in pain, and said he had wounded one of the men that robbed him very much, and if they searched after him he believed he could not get away, for he found his blood come very hot upon him; he named the places where he had wounded him, by the breast, belly, groin and thigh, which he did with his knife; that the man forced it from him, that he got it again, and the other got it again two or three times. He said it was dark, but they appeared to him to be both in dark-colour'd cloaths, and for ought he knew they were about of a size; he also said, about an hour before he died, if the men are taken, remember the bite about the thumb, and the hand. He never ceased vomiting from the time he was brought in till a little before he died, and often said in the night before, I am a dead man, my pain is so great I cannot bear it.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Great Wild-street. On a Tuesday about the middle of September I attended the prisoner, but know not the day of the month, though I know he was taken up the next day. His wife, as she call'd herself, came to me and said, he was mortally wounded, and begg'd I'd come and dress him. I went with her about seven in the evening to a house in Parker's-lane; he was up, sitting in a chair, with a pair of blue breeches on, in a very low condition, with three very large wounds, which I supposed to have been mortal; one was under his right breast, another at the bottom of his belly,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175312050023"/> another on the back part of that. He did not shew me any more; he only shew'd me one on his breast, but accidentally by turning up his shirt, I saw that large wound on the lower part of his belly. By his behaviour I judged he had received them in some bad works.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you apprehend they were made with?</p>
               <p>Wright. I apprehended they were made with a knife. [Then he is shewn a knife fellow to that of the deceased.] I verily believe them to have been done with the same sort of a blade as this. I asked him which way he got them, but he prevaricated in his story; he said he had been in a bad sray with some comrades, and some of them had wounded him with a scimitar. I told him they were more likely to have been done with a knife, and dressing his wounds told him they seemed to be mortal, bidding him (as he was a soldier) get into the hospital provided for such; but his wife cried, and said, No, don't let him go to the hospital, for I will very honestly pay you, and if he goes in there his pay will cease, and I shall be destitute of necessaries.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you where he got these wounds?</p>
               <p>Wright. No, he did not; but at another time he said he was assassinated privately by a person, but did not say where. Upon asking him how I should be paid, he said, he'd send to a neighbour, who would be security for him. When I went the next morning he and his wife also were gone.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and being desired by the Duke of Newcastle, on the nineteenth of September, to go to New Prison, to look at a soldier there that was wounded, and take what care I could of him, that he might be brought to justice, I went to him, (the prisoner) and found one wound about three inches under his right arm-pit, which had penetrated the breast and wounded the lungs; it seemed to have been made by a cutting instrument about an inch and a half in breadth. He is shewn the fellow to the knife shewn before. This would make just such a wound. There was another wound about four inches above the left hip bone, which came out again, being about five inches in length, by the loins; it went quite through him, and seemed to have been made by the very same instrument. I asked him, if he had any other wounds, and he shewed me a sore on his right leg, saying, he had no other. Being asked the next morning, if I had seen any wound on his thigh, I said, no; returning to him, I desired him to pull down his breeches, and there saw a small wound on the upper part of the thigh near the groin; that also was made by the point of such an instrument as has been now shewn me. I attended him till he was cured.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you how he came by them wounds?</p>
               <p>Adare. He said they were done in a fray at St. Gyles's, with a cuttoe.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think the wounds could be given with such an instrument?</p>
               <p>Adare. It must be 5 inches from the point, not broader than an inch and a half, I am sure this knife would make directly the wounds I saw upon him; cuttoes are generally broader than this knife, and I should think in passing through him must have made a broader wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Lattey?</p>
               <p>Adare. I did at the same time, he had two wounds, one a little above the joint of the thumb, and another a little below, they seem'd to be a little jagged, there was a black contus'd spot on the inward part of the thumb, seemed likely to have been made with a tooth; they might be done by a bruise against a post, but I am rather inclinable to think them done by a bite.</p>

            . The prisoner sent for me on the 18th of September between 8 and 9 at night, to dress his wounds; I did so, there were four of them, one on his breast, one on his loins, one on his groin, and one on his shin.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this knife?</p>
               <p>Crosby. The wounds might have been given with such a streight tool as this, but it did not seem to be by an instrument quite so broad as this; the prisoner told me he got them in a fray in the street; he had been dress'd before he came to me.</p>

We went to the house of Kennedy, and there found him up two pair of stairs in a closet in an empty room, with his shoes in his hand; he was charg'd with this fact, but he said he knew nothing of it.</p>

            . On Wednesday I believe the 19th of September, I with others went to search after the prisoner, Lattey had brought word down that the prisoner had lain twelve hours in his blood, and desired he might be brought to the hospital; we found him in the house of Kennedy near Brooks-market, he then had a light colour'd coat on, and we found his regimentals at the house of O Neal in Parker's-Lane, where Lattey had left them. They were produced in court, but could not be sworn to as the identical cloaths of the prisoner, the regimentals being all of a sort. We went to justice Fielding's, and ask'd him what cloaths he had on on Monday night, he said his regimentals.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his wounds?</p>
               <p>Haston. I saw two wounds he had.</p>

            . On Tuesday evening, the 18th of September, I met Lattey, who was a particular acquaintance of mine in the street, he desired me to come to the sign of the Mogul and he'd treat me, I went and did my business and return'd there to him; he told me, that his friend Hambleton was wounded, and I went to see him at the house of O Neal, in Parkers-lane along with Lattey, where I saw his wounds dress'd at which I was shock'd. I ask'd him how he got them, he said, he being got in liquor, had been in bad company fighting with two or three men, and that a woman was the cause of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he say it was?</p>
               <p>Kennedy. I think he said it was about St. Gyles's.</p>
               <p>Q. Who dress'd his wounds then?</p>
               <p>Kennedy. Crosby did; and after he was dress'd, Crosby said that that bed was not proper for him to lie in, and offer'd him a bed at his house, which he accepted off; I saw him there. After that he came to my house and was taken there, but I was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any intimacy between Lattey and the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Kennedy. Lattey I knew from a boy, and I ask'd him to come and dine with me, he said, if he did, he should bring a friend with him, which he did, and it was the prisoner; this was on the Sunday before the prisoner was taken; I also that same afternoon drank with them at a house in St. Gyles's.</p>

Some where I cannot tell where a woman pickt me up in the street; as I staid talking to her, there came up three men, one of them said, what do you do with my wife? he struck at me, and I at him, I not being able to knock a man down, but some how or other he fell, and one of the others drew a cuttoe and made several passes at me, this was about eleven o'clock at night, please to examine my corporal as to my character.</p>

               <p>What they have said is all false. I was cook in that house; the silver never came into the kitchen, except to be cleaned; it happened to be pawned in my name; the gentleman said the woman that pawned it had on a check gown, but I never had one in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. to Slayter. Are you certain as to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>T. Slayter. I am, my lord; I lent her a great price, upon condition that she gave me a bill of sale, to which she set her mark. I never knew her before, but described her to Mrs. Price before seeing her there.</p>
               <p>To her Character.</p>
               <p>Tomasin Arrington. I have known the prisoner about a year and a half, and never heard any ill of her before this.</p>

Then I said pray give me my keys again, they will be of but little use to you; then he that stopped me said to the other, give him them again; they gave me them again as I thought, but when I came to look at them, there was one wanting; then they went away, but I do not know who they were.</p>

            . I was with the prisoner at the bar and Job Horniblow on the 17th of September; we went out with an intent to go upon the highway.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you your first acquaintance with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>J. Randolph. I had seen him before in the New-gaol, Surry, and there became acquainted with him; he was there to be an evidence at Croydon-assize.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet that night?</p>
               <p>J. Randolph. I met him by accident in Chick-lane; Horniblow was with him, who was executed last Monday; we went together, and were going down Red-lion-street Holborn, about eight in the evening, the prisoner went first, Horniblow second, and I last; Horniblow put my hand to his pocket as we were going, where I felt a pistol; when we came to the Foundling-hospital, the prisoner said here is somebody coming, which was the prosecutor; the prisoner asked him what it was o'clock; the prosecutor said he could not tell; then he took hold on his collar, and said, d - n you deliver your money; the prosecutor delivered 4 s. 6 d. and some halfpence; then the prisoner said there is money in the other pocket. He also demanded his watch, but the prosecutor said he had never a one; then I put my hand into the pocket where he said something jingled, and took out some keys and a penknife, and delivered the keys into the prisoner's hand; then he searched his pockets<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175312050027"/> and found a tobacco-box, and after that bid him go about his business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a spectacle-case?</p>
               <p>J. Randolph. I cannot tell whether there was one taken or no; the person executed and myself were taken up together for this very robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. How came I acquainted with you?</p>

               <p>J. Randolph. Horniblow was in custody in the New-gaol, Southwark; I went to see him there, and there came acquainted with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You went there to carry him some money.</p>
               <p>J. Randolph. I at that time asked the prisoner to drink a glass of wine; but this was my very first robbery in company with the prisoner or Horniblow either.</p>

            . After Randolph was admitted an evidence, a magistrate, I think, named Woodrose, sent Mr. Fielding a letter, and an information of the prisoners; the name to the letter was Clark; Mr. Fielding asked me if I knew any person of that name. After having heard the description of him, I said it certainly must be Neal; the justice said he would have me go down to Winchester. I knew Neal when he was evidence on the other side the water; I went down in order to detain him for a murder. Horniblow had mentioned a robbery and murder he and Neal had done near Edger turnpike. I went to Winchester and found it to be the prisoner; I asked him to drink a glass of wine, and shewed him this steel tobacco-box; said he, that is the very tobacco-box that I took from a gentleman near the Foundling-hospital, and I have put it in my information.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you that box?</p>
               <p>W. Norden. I took it from Randolph the evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this confession made?</p>
               <p>W. Norden. It was in the gaol; there was a justice of peace and several others heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. Do you know that box?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my tobacco-box, which I lost the night I was robbed.</p>

               <p>I have seen Randolph several times, but was never in his company, nor with him at that time when that man says he shew me the tobacco-box. There were two or three prisoners came together, he did not know me, he told me he came to bring me up to be an evidence, but they could not let me go with him.</p>

I was sitting by my fire, when I observed my hatch to have been opened; upon which I searched, and missed a piece of printed Rus linen cloth, containing 17 yards. I ran to the door, called out, and one Mr. Kent pursued. and took the prisoners.</p>

            . I heard the woman call out on the 1st of November, about ten o'clock in the forenoon; I had seen Sharrard open the hatch before, as I was in my house facing her shop. He went in, and took a piece of printed linen and went away, joining in company with others, I followed them, he gave the linen to the other prisoner, and he put it into a bag Presently I lost sight of them; then others of the neighbours came, and said, Abbey's shop had been robbed. I told them which way I thought they were gone; upon which we went and searched some houses, and found Hearne<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175312050028"/> under a bed, and Sharrard up the chimney, and we taxed them with stealing a piece of cloth. Sharrard told us, that a woman and Jack Hall were gone to sell it, and that they were gone round by Stepney fields, because they would not be catched. We whent out to see for them, but could not find them; but when we returned, we found the woman, and took her into custody. She confessed where the cloth was, and we went and found it accordingly.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first see Hearne?</p>
               <p>Kent. When I first saw him he was about a hundred yards from the prosecutor's shop.</p>
               <p>John Hall. I was with the two prisoners when this cloth was taken near new Rag Fair. We stood at the door about six minutes, and then Sharrard went into the shop, Hearne and I being then up a turning just by, and he brought out the linen, and gave it to Hearn, and he put it into a bag, and went off with it, he walking first.</p>

When they had got her below the Camel, I went to them, and asked what they would do with her, and called them thieves, and said, she was my property; at which they answered, what is that to you.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way was they driving her?</p>
               <p>Boston. They were driving her towards Tower-hill; I took hold of one of them, and said he should go along with me; I took him to the Plume of Feathers and Coach and Horses. He went very willingly with me, and the other followed. I got an officer and charged him with them.</p>

They were 300 yards from it, if not more; the prosecutor came after them, and took hold of one of the prisoners, and charged him with stealing the sow; they then left the sow, and drew up to the houses on each side of the way. Mr. Boston said, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175312050029"/> had lost several hogs before this, and he believed they had stole them. They said, they had no design of stealing her. He took one of them, and the other followed him. I saw nothing more of them till before the sitting alderman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they confess any thing there?</p>
               <p>Summerhays. No, they did not, but equivocated about it.</p>

            . The prisoner has applied to me since on several occasions to prove the marriage, and I gave evidence of it at the court of King's Bench, on the prisoner's request; they were always concluded to be man and wife. I was not intimate enough in the family to know whether they cohabited together, but am very positive they were married.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form any certain judgment of their cohabiting together as man and wife?</p>
               <p>Greason. I cannot say whether they did or no.</p>
               <p>James Drummond. I was clerk to this chapel at that time. I gave away Mary Reith so the prisoner at the bar, and remember him very well, having heard Mrs. Keith ask Mrs. Reith the morning they came to be married, if she was going to be married to that man; they were married at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What ceremony was said?</p>
               <p>Drummond. The ceremony of the church of England; the prisoner made a very handsome appearance, and was exceedingly well dress'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of their living together?</p>
               <p>Drummond. No, I do not, but have heard they lived together down in Essex.</p>
               <p>Court. Look upon the prisoner, and see whether he is the man that was married or no.</p>
               <p>Drummond. I am positive he is the man, having seen him several times since.</p>

Some time after this he plundered me of every thing, plate, money, and jewels, caused me to mortgage my estate, and took the money from me; he carried me from place to place, then over to Holland, then to other places; he plundered me of every thing, to the destruction of me and my family.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. On the 8th of November, between twelve and one o'clock, the prosecutor brought the prisoner to me, and charg'd him. I ask'd him of what, he said the prisoner had found means to get into his room, and steal his things: I ask'd him if there was any thing about the prisoner that was his, he said there was a pair of stockings on his legs; I had him search'd, and we found these stockings upon him (producing them) which he owned to be the prosecutors. I carried him then from the watch-house to the round-house; he there said, he hoped I would be merciful to him: He would not confess he had any accomplices.</p>

               <p>Q. Where are the goods, mentioned at the time the prosecutor charged you with him?</p>
               <p>Cornelia. He told me he had found means to get at the key of his room, and had robb'd him of every thing he had but what he had on his back, but did not mention any particular thing; but the next day before the justice he mentioned most part of them, there was a search warrant granted, and I went by the prisoner's directions and found these goods (producing them.)</p>

I went and told him, as he had robb'd his master of a great many goods, his only way to make his master as favourable as possible, was to let him know of them that he might get them again, and said, I'd call again the next day, that he might have time to recollect. I called accordingly, and he said he had recollected, and gave me a list of things he had taken away; part of which are in the indictment.</p>

Her maid miss'd the gowns mentioned in the indictment, and knowing I had had no body else in the house but the prisoner, we suspected her, and I went to her and taxed her with taking them; she confessed she had, and had pawned one and sold the rest; we took her before a justice, there she confessed the same.</p>

            , my mistress had been in the country in June. I believe she left four gowns in the house of the last evidence. At our return we missed them, and we examined the prisoner about them. She told us she had sold two of them, and where the others were. [The two gowns were produced in court, and deposed to as her Mistress's property].</p>

               <p>L. Goff. They are valued at 15 s. I think.</p>

               <p>John Sandall. I am porter of the mint, and have been about nineteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you often see the coiners at work?</p>
               <p>Sandall. I do often. On the 26th of July last I found some tools for coining at the house of Mrs. Bilson in Winchester-street. I had taken Mr. Bell the day before at one Mr. Elgar's, who was engraving a pair of dyes for him to make Lewidores; in searching the cellar which they told me was Mr. Bell's property, there I found a press fixed upon a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175312050035"/> block, as ours are in the mint, for coining. Every thing was fixed, but two springs, that lay ready to fix; it is of the very same kind as ours are, and to be pull'd in the same manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Could it be used for coining?</p>
               <p>Sandall. As I take it, it could; it only wanted the dyes to be fixed; they are made fast by four skrews. They are to be done in a very little time, the w orkmen shifting them as they see occasion; so that in the same manner sixpences, shillings, or a guinea, may be struck with that press. We have larger for crown pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else?</p>
               <p>Sandall. There stood by the press what is called a stake, to flat or beat any thing upon; there were also a hammer and a ladle to melt rosin with, but what the use of that was I don't know. Up in the garret, which they said was the prisoner's garret, I found a stove new built to a chimney with brick work, that would run down gold or silver without any blowing; there was likewise a table fix'd, with a wheel to turn with a foot, and a pair of sheers, with some tongs to take the crucibles out of the fire; there were two windows to the room. There was another table with some drawers on the other side the room, where I found a little long ladle to cast gold or silver in; in one of the drawers, or upon the table, was a file, and a touchstone, as I suppose, with two pair of tongs to grasp the crucibles two small crucibles to melt any thing in, either gold or silver, and a brass instrument, the use unknown to me then, (the workmen who made it will tell the use of it) with an iron flask, or case, to cast in. In his escrutore, or bureau, which was in his bedchamber, as they called it, I found about 38 pieces of coin of different metals, and a pair of dyes to strike them with in a beaufet, or corner cupboard.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they called?</p>
               <p>Sandall. They are called deux-sols pieces; it is a French two-pence. Some of them were brass, some copper, whitened, and all representing the same French money. On the 28th I went with Mr. Cook, the solicitor of the mint, to look over the prisoner's writings; in the drawers there was a piece of metal weighing about six-pennyweight, which, upon the trial of it, proved gold, worse than standard five carats two grains; I had it tried by our assay-master, and was worth about 2 l. 18 s. by the shape of it it was cast in that little ladle which I found in the room where the fire-place was; it seemed to be part of a larger piece cut or broke off. I went with Mr. Bell before Justice Fielding, and he was committed, on the 26th; the 27th he was sent for to be re-examined, when he owned that all these things I have mention'd belonged to him. This was before Mr.

               <p>Q. Did he say all?</p>
               <p>Sandall. I can't say he said the word all; but the press and things which were found in that house were mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he own the press?</p>
               <p>Sandall. He said the press was his press, and the other were his things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say the place where they were found was his lodgings?</p>
               <p>Sandall. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether at the mint the same press is made use of both for shillings and guineas?</p>
               <p>Sandall. Yes, it is; it is only shifting the dye.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What are those two springs that were not put in?</p>
               <p>Sandall. I know not the name; they are iron or steel springs.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the use of them?</p>
               <p>Sandall. As the fly is pull'd round, they are to help the fly to play up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see a press used in the mint for coinage without those springs?</p>
               <p>Sandall. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. If a press is unfinished, do you call that a press?</p>
               <p>Sandall. I should take this to be a press; there were the springs ready to fix; it was finished, and they might be put in as soon as the question might be asked.</p>
               <p>Q. Can the skrew of the press be taken out and soon put in again?</p>
               <p>Sandall. No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Q. Suppose you see a watch without the pendulum, would you call that a watch?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175312050036"/>Sandall. I never saw a pendulum.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you work the press in the condition you saw it?</p>
               <p>Sandall. No, because the springs were not fixed; but the moniers know better than I do.</p>
               <p>Q. How many presses did you ever see beside those in the mint and this?</p>
               <p>Sandall. I have seen one in the hands of a tradesman, who engraves dyes, and makes buttons and such things.</p>
               <p>Q. Are those presses that are made for watch keys, cane heads, and such things, made in the same method as those in the tower?</p>
               <p>Sandall. I never saw any of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Could this be made use of in making metal buttons?</p>
               <p>Sandall. It might.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you do halfpence and farthings in the same press?</p>
               <p>Sandall. We do; it is only changing the dye; it does not require so strong a weight to coin a shilling, or sixpence, as it does to coin a halfpenny, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Could this press be made to coin a shilling?</p>
               <p>Sandall. I am sure it would coin a shilling, or deux sols piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the head of a cane taken off?</p>
               <p>Sandall. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there not rosin in it?</p>
               <p>Sandall. There is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say what use he made of these things?</p>
               <p>Sandall. He told the justice they were to make medals and coin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he express what coin?</p>
               <p>Sandall. No, he did not; he used the word coin.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the word deux-sols-piece mention'd?</p>
               <p>Sandall. I don't remember that it was. I believe he said it was not intended to make any coin of this kingdom; he said they were to go to Canada, and that he was employed by a certain gentleman, whom he refused to name, and he was to have forty pounds every month.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention any thing else beside medals and coin?</p>
               <p>Sandall. I believe he mention'd buttons, medals and coin.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did not I tell you where you might find the press?</p>
               <p>Sandall. He did; he said he had a press in his house.</p>

            . I am one of the moniers in the mint.</p>
               <p>Q. What is a monier?</p>
               <p>W. Hankins. That is one that makes the money. I saw the press that Mr. Sandall found in Winchester-street, it is a proper press for coinage.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the springs in it?</p>
               <p>W. Hankins. No, they were not when brought to the Tower.</p>
               <p>Q. How long time does it take to fix them in?</p>
               <p>W. Hankins. They are put in in a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it like those you use in the Tower?</p>
               <p>W. Hankins. It is just such a one as we use for sixpences, shillings, half-guineas and guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you make use of this in coining money the same as with those at the Tower ?</p>
               <p>W. Hankins. We could, but not so expeditiously as with our own.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the use of the springs?</p>
               <p>W. Hankins. The use is to lift up the box after the piece is struck.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How many other presses have you ever seen besides those in the Tower?</p>
               <p>W. Hankins. I never saw any in my life besides this and those in the Mint.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you have coined guineas with this press if the springs were not in?</p>
               <p>W. Hankins. We could, may be one in an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any leather on the fly of this press ?</p>
               <p>W. Hankins. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there not leathers on the fly of your presses when they are worked?</p>
               <p>W. Hankins. There are.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this as big a press as yours in the Mint?</p>
               <p>W. Hankins. No, it is not as some are; it is about the middle size.</p>
               <p>Q. Could this be used to coin any base mettle, either halfpence, farthings, or deux sols pieces?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175312050037"/>W. Hankins. Yes, it might.</p>
               <p>Q. Would this coin a medal?</p>
               <p>W. Hankins. It would.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the press be worked without the leather?</p>
               <p>W. Hankins. We could strike a single piece.</p>
               <p>Council for Crown.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Sandall. Did you see any leather when you found the press?</p>
               <p>Sandall. I believe I saw none; there was the iron fixed to the press to pull with, there was a piece of cord fixed to one end, and a cord will do as well as leather.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hankins. Is it necessary to have the leathers on when it is not working?</p>
               <p>Hankins. When it is not worked neither cord nor leather is necessary, but when they work it they put them on; we can strike some money with only the push of it without a man standing to pull it.</p>
               <p>Q. What money is that?</p>
               <p>Hankins. Pennies.</p>
               <p>Q. Is a press the same without the leathers?</p>
               <p>Hankins. The press is the same without them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the fly fixed?</p>
               <p>Hankins. It was, ready for work.</p>

            . I am one of the moniers.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the press Mr. Sandall found in Winchester-street?</p>
               <p>W. Vanderesck. I have; it appears to me to be a proper press for coinage; I cannot say I examined it thoroughly, but it is proper for any piece not bigger than a shilling or a guinea, it is not big enough for crowns or half-crowns.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the springs on when you saw it?</p>
               <p>W. Vanderesck. No they were not.</p>
               <p>Q. Can it be used without the springs?</p>
               <p>W. Vanderesck. It may be one piece or so, without the springs.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see such a press in tradesmen's hands?</p>
               <p>W. Vanderesck. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Robert M' Gill. I know the prisoner Mr. Bell; I live at Woolwich; he came to me there, and asked me if I could help him to a smith that could make a press for striking of medals; this was in June last; I said I could; so we went so a tavern; he asked me when I should be at London; I said the next day, to see the review in Hide-park.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your business?</p>
               <p>R. M' Gill. I am a smith; he desired me to come to his house, which I did; then I took him to Puddle-dock-hill, to a man I think named Wood; Mr. Bell told him that he wanted a press to strike some pieces of the same size with some that he shewed him.</p>
               <p>What sort of pieces?</p>
               <p>R. M' Gill. They were copper pieces whitened, and a yellow piece about the bigness of a guinea; it had an impression on both sides; two round O's on one side, and the head of a man on the other. He is shewed a yellow piece. They are such as this; the man said he could make one of that size for about twenty pounds; but they could not agree; so I asked him if he could direct us to see one any where; he said he had made one for forty pounds for one Mr. Yeo in Covent-garden, and he believed he would shew it me.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that Mr. Yeo?</p>
               <p>M' Gill. I have heard he is an engraver for the Mint in the Tower. Mr. Yeo strikes large medals, such as they make presents of at the universities, bigger than a crown piece. I went and told my brother, that if Mr. Bell had one made, I would get him the job; so took my brother to Mr. Yeo's, and told him that a gentleman wanted a press made, and desired he would let him look at it; he showed us the press and all about it; then I went and carried Mr. Bell there, and he saw it; Mr. Yeo shewed him a great many pieces he had struck with it. Mr. Bell pulled his piece out of his pocket, and told him he would have some such cut; Mr. Yeo said he could not do it without acquainting the master of the Mint. Mr. Bell said he did not care who knew of it; so we parted; I went and saw the presses in the Tower after this. My brother and Mr. Bell met next day, and bargained to make a press; I think he was to give my brother twenty-five pounds.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Bell come to you in a publick manner?</p>
               <p>M' Gill. He did; he did not whisper, or in-join<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175312050038"/> me to keep it a secret. We went in at a publick house, and talked about it the next day; he made no secret of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say he wanted it for?</p>
               <p>M' Gill. He said he would do buttons, cane-heads, nails, and watches.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think there was any harm in what you were about?</p>
               <p>M' Gill. No, I did not think there was.</p>
               <p>Council for Crown.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see any cane heads of his striking?</p>
               <p>M' Gill. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Or metal buttons?</p>
               <p>M' Gill. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Bell say he wanted a press for striking small coin as well as medals?</p>
               <p>M' Gill. I cannot say that; I think he said he wanted a press to strike those things he shewed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you take that yellow piece to be gold or brass?</p>
               <p>M' Gill. It appears to me to be gold. He told me there was a settlement at Canada, near Nova-Scotia; and he was to make some medals for that place.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he mean by medals?</p>
               <p>M' Gill. I think he said medals.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner's council. Are you sure that this piece you have been shewn is the very same piece he shewed to Yeo?</p>
               <p>M' Gill. It is like it; but I never read the inscription round it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mr. Bell's trade?</p>
               <p>M' Gill. He was brought up a gentleman as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Council for Crown.</p>
               <p>Had you ever been in his company before he came to you at Woolwich ?</p>
               <p>M' Gill. I had; but we were not very much acquainted.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a button-maker?</p>
               <p>M' Gill. No, not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a cane-head maker?</p>
               <p>M' Gill. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a dealer in brass?</p>
               <p>M' Gill. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Nenien M' Gill. My brother the left witness</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>N. M' Gill. It was in June, on the same day that the review was in Hide-park; he shewed me a piece of coin, and a pair of dyes made to it; I did not then know what it was; they call it a Louis-d'or. He is shewn the yellow piece of coin. It was such a piece as this.</p>
               <p>Q. to Sandall. Look at that piece; where had you it?</p>
               <p>Sandall. This is the same piece that the dyes were to have been engraven by, and I have the dyes here.</p>
               <p>N. M' Gill. Bell said it was to make such pieces as those. I went to Mr. Yeo's in Covent-garden to see that press; after that I went to the Tower two or three times to see them. When the press was made I carried it home; I was to have ten guineas advance, and have got about 7. Afterwards Mr. Bell said that as soon as it was ready he was to work it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who advised you to go to the Tower?</p>
               <p>N. M' Gill. My brother; he had seen them before.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you carry it home ?</p>
               <p>N. M' Gill. I cannot tell the day. I forged a pair of dyes by his direction, and carried them to the engraver; but they were never made.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sandall produced a pair of dyes not finished.</p>
               <p>N. M' Gill. These are them which I forged by Mr. Bell's orders; the Louis-d'ors were given to me by him, in order for the size of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any gold being melted?</p>
               <p>N. M' Gill. Yes, there was some gold melted by order of Mr. Bell, to be struck by those dyes; but we made no trial, they not being finished.</p>
               <p>Q. What gold did you melt?</p>
               <p>N. M' Gill. Mr. Bell and I together melted thirty-six shilling pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any order given to work this secretly?</p>
               <p>N. M' Gill. There was none; he said he did not care who saw it; only in case any body should see it and take the trade out of his hands, then he should he a loser by it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mean the Louis-d'or? that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175312050039"/> found out one Mr. Elgar an engraver; Mr. Bell ordered me to get the dyes engraved as the other. I went with my fellow-servant to Mr. Elgar, and we agreed for a guinea and a half; then my fellow-servant took me to a flatter's, where the gold was to be rolled; I took it there by Mr. Bell's order.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that to make?</p>
               <p>N. M' Gill. It was to make such pieces as these, meaning the yellow pieces produced.</p>
               <p>Q. to Sandall. Describe the nature of making guineas, and from what.</p>
               <p>Sandall. It is necessary we should have the gold flatted out of the bar, to be worked to the size that the piece of money is to be of.</p>
               <p>Council for Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see a press like this in the custody of a tradesman?</p>
               <p>Sandall. I saw a press something like this in the hands of an engraver, who engraves dyes to strike buttons with; but I did not examine it.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner.</p>

            . I work in watch chains and buttons.</p>
               <p>Q. How are they made?</p>
               <p>Phillips. In different kinds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any press used for that purpose ?</p>
               <p>Phillips. Yes, I have, but I never had one.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they used for?</p>
               <p>Phillips. In the jewelling way, and for buttons.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of presses are they?</p>
               <p>Phillips. They seem to be the same as those in the Tower, to the best of my knowledge, though I have not seen them in the Tower for 20 years.</p>
               <p>Calverley Pinkney. I have seen all the various presses that are used in the mint; and have also seen several in tradesmen's shops they are the same sort with those in the mint.</p>
               <p>Q. What trades are they commonly used for?</p>
               <p>Pinkney. They are us'd for striking the bows for watch keys, and for watch chains, and for the metal pieces for the dial plates of watches, for cane heads, buttons, and divers other things.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the press make only a flat impression?</p>
               <p>Pinkney. There are dyes prepared of divers forts, there is two of them, the one concave and the other convex, and the swiftness of the to the impression,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175312050040"/> and the spring gives the rebound; the quicker the blow the neater the impression; and it requires a press of the same force with those in the Tower to make the work neat.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Will the presses you have seen coin money?</p>
               <p>Pinkney. According to their size they will coin all sorts of money.</p>

I was apprehensive he was stray'd away, but we could hear nothing of him. On the 1st of November I lost another, named Jolly, out of my stable. I heard the prisoner was in Wood-street Compter, and going to him he told me he had sold one the week before, but could not tell where he was; he said, he would come by and by, and tell me where I might meet with him. I asked him where my jolly horse was; he said, at the Black Horse in Bartholomew Close, near Smithfield, where I went, and saw the buyer of the horse, whose name is Stevens. The owner of the stables his name is Lewis.</p>
