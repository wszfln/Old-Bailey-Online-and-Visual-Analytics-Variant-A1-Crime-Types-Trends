The prisoner and her husband came to lodge with me about the beginning of June last, in the first floor; she staid with me about two or three months; they paid half-a-crown a week; it was a furnished lodging; her husband was constantly with her till they went away.</p>
               <p>Court. It is unnecessary to go any farther; because if the husband was constantly with the wife, up to the time of the felony being committed, the presumption of the law is, that it was either done by the husband, or by the wife, under the coercion and command of the husband.</p>

               <p>I live in Jeffry-square, St. Mary Axe. I was returning from Colney-hatch, on Sunday, the 17th of October, in Mr. Paisley's carriage; we set out from Mr. Paisley's house; at Colney-hatch, about a quarter after six; we got a little way on <placeName id="t17901027-4-crimeloc13">Finchley Common</placeName>

                        targets="t17901027-4-off11 t17901027-4-crimeloc13"/>, when the carriage was stopped by a man holding the bridle of one of the horses, with a pistol in his hand; it was Mr. Paisley's chariot; it was a clear moonlight night; it was not more than ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, from our setting out: I observed a man come to Mr. Paisley's side, and endeavoured to force open the door; Mr. Paisley held it tight; that man had a pistol; the prisoner then came to my side with a cutlass, and opened the door, and demanded our watches and money; he used very violent threats; and after being some time at the door, he called out to the man at the opposite side to fire; I had not then delivered any part of the property; the prisoner had a cutlass; Mr. Paisley caught hold of the cutlass, and had his finger violently cut; the prisoner at the same time drew out my watch from out of my fob; then Mr. Paisley leaped out of the carriage, and caught hold of the man with the pistol, when a scuffle insued; the prisoner immediately quitted my side of the carriage, and went round to Mr. Paisley, upon which I leaped out, and went round immediately after, when I saw Mr. Paisley on the ground, by several violent blows, which he received from the prisoner; this is the hat which Mr. Paisley had on; I saw one blow given, the last blow, upon which Mr. Paisley fell; that blow was given by the same cutlass he had when he opened the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270004"/>door, upon which I ran up towards Mr. Paisley, seeing the man's arm raised, and received a back-handed blow on my neck with the cutlass; Mr. Paisley then called out that there were horsemen coming up, and they would all be seized, for we expected friends, upon which they went off; the prisoner at the bar took my watch, and I saw no more of it.</p>
               <p>What time do you think this transaction took up? - I think they could not be less than five minutes, from the time they came up, to the time they went away.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of observing the person of the man whom you suppose to be the prisoner? - Yes, I had; he had his face some time in the carriage.</p>
               <p>Was you under any alarm at the time? - Yes, I was; but not under so great an alarm as when I got out.</p>
               <p>Were you under considerable alarm when they first came? - No, Sir, not so as to prevent my observing any man's face; he had a round hat on.</p>
               <p>From the opportunity you had of observing him, from the light there was, and the length of time, can you conscientiously take upon yourself to say that he was present at the commission of that robbery? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt of it? - I have not the smallest doubt in my own mind.</p>
               <p>Did you afterwards give any alarm of this matter? - Yes; but there is one circumstance I mentioned when the prisoner was going off; I called out loudly that I should know the man with the cutlass, upon which he turned round, and threatened with oaths to murder me, or words to the same meaning.</p>
               <p>Had you any opportunity of seeing him? - No, Sir, not enough to swear to him.</p>
               <p>How long was it before they were taken? - On Monday, the 25th; that was the Monday week following.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of observing the other? - There was another man taken with the prisoner, whom I believe to be the man, from the appearance; but I could not observe enough to swear to him; I had not the same opportunity of observing the other as this man; I have no doubt of the prisoner: mine was a metal watch, with double metal cases.</p>
               <p>Court. When the man's face was in the chariot, was the moon then shining upon him, or was the moon on his back? - The carriage was perfectly clear: I could see the man's face: the moon shone into the carriage.</p>
               <p>Did it shine in the man's face? - I really cannot say that: it was perfectly light in the carriage, enough to observe the man's face; he had his hair about his ears, and was dressed in dark clothes: I gave a description to Dawson, the officer; I said with respect to the man with the cutlass; I said, I should have it in my power to swear to him, and described him as a thin man, shorter than myself, with a thin face, and a large nose, rather bent, and dressed in dark clothes, a round hat, with his hair about his ears, and I described the cutlass as a large one, with a cut and thrust. Mr. Paisley will not be able to get out for some time, from the wounds he has received.</p>

               <p>I am related by marriage to the husband, Cooper; I married his sister: during the seven years preceding May, 1787, Cooper was sometimes in town, and sometimes in Leicestershire, and used frequently to go to Aldridge's stables, in St. Martin's-lane, who is a brother to the prisoner: I maintained the son of the first marriage for nine years: he very often visited his mother, and continued doing so till May, 1787; he went frequently to the mother and grandmother; the mother lived then at Burrows's, at Plumsted, in Kent: the son knew the father was living; because when the father came to London, he came first to our chambers, in Lincoln's-inn: he knew all the seven years his father was alive; they corresponded together by letter: I never heard of the father's death till after this marriage.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Upon your oath can Cooper write? - He used to get a person to write for him; and he used to write to me, to know how his son Cooper was; Cooper himself cannot write.</p>
               <p>Have you any letter now in your possession that ever came from Cooper to his son? - I have none now; but I could produce a great many.</p>
               <p>Where was the father? - With Colonel

            , at Skeffington-hall: I believe he went from Mr. Tattersa's; he lived there about two years: on the twelvemonth before this marriage he lived with Mr. Emmerson, in Piccadilly; he has lived there now about three years.</p>
               <p>When did you first hear of this second marriage? - I will tell you, if I know.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself? - I think it was the boy himself informed some of my family; and I believe it was my wife.</p>
               <p>When was that? - I suppose about two years ago, or two years and a half; I could not believe it.</p>
               <p>Do not you carry on this prosecution, upon your oath? - I do not, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>You are not the person that carry on this prosecution? - I am not.</p>
               <p>Did you communicate it to Cooper? - He knew of it before I did.</p>
               <p>Why did this Mr. Cooper remain silent for two years and a half? - I fancy he was not silent; I fancy some business was done in it about a twelvemonth ago.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath was it the first active step that was taken, finding a bill the next sessions? - I was out of town.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that was the first step that was taken? - I do not know; I took no step.</p>
               <p>Do you know now of any step that was taken? - No further than I saw the indictment: I remember Mr. Barker of Gray's-inn sent his clerk to me, to know whether any thing could be done for the child, by the first husband, for she had children enough by the second.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath was any steps taken before? - Yes; I believe there was.</p>
               <p>What step before the last session? - Upon my word I cannot tell you any step.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270007"/>How many children has this woman had by this unfortunate second husband? - She had one by Mr. Burrows.</p>
               <p>I ask you, Sir, by Mr. Prior? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do not you know she has had two children while the first husband has been laying by? - I do not know that, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Cooper and she ever meet to your knowledge? - Not to my knowledge, only hearsay.</p>

               <p>You have had nothing to do with this prosecution? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Did not you go with the constable to take the woman up? - Yes; I went to identify her.</p>
               <p>You knew where she was to be found? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So you did the last two years. - Upon my oath I could not believe, as I told you before, that she was really married.</p>
               <p>Did not you know for two years where she was? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do not you know that a good deal of time was consumed in finding out where the second marriage was had? - Yes; there was.</p>
               <p>You concluded that the connection was the same sort with Prior as with Burrows? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. If you suspected that she was married a second time, and meant to take any steps, why did not you go and give the second husband notice? - I could not believe she was married.</p>
               <p>Did not you employ Mr. Barker? - I sent to the house, and to Mr. Barker, and went there myself, to know if any thing could be done for the child; that was two years next November.</p>
               <p>Now did you ever take any steps on the subject of a second marriage at all, till after the woman had said, she could not maintain the child? - I went there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. I have a great many witnesses to call, to shew that she had the strongest reason to believe that the husband was dead; and she is stated as a widow in the second marriage.</p>
               <p>JANE ALDRIDGE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am mother to the prisoner: I remember the circumstance of her being married perfectly well with Cooper: I think the child was but a quarter old when she went away: they did not live above a year and a half together.</p>
               <p>Did they live together after she went to Ireland? - No, Sir; nor she never saw his face, that I know of, but once; that is about eleven years ago; he came into my house; but he did not demand his wife, nor did not say any thing to her, any further than how do you do, and how do you do: she was just come from Ireland; she was there great part of three years; she was there in several families: I can take a safe oath that she never saw him after that time; she has heard of him after she was married to Mr. Prior; she asked my consent; she was in Kent; and he went into Kent: she lived in Kent about three years, with Mr. Burrows: Prior courted her about a twelvemonth; I knew of it.</p>
               <p>What reason had that woman to believe that Cooper, her husband, was dead? - By nothing but her own child; I was present about three years before she married Prior; I cannot; justly say; but it was a considerable time before; the child said, he was dead; says I to him, Jemmy, where is your father, I have not heard nor seen any thing of him a great while? why, says he, my father is dead; says I, do not say that, it is impossible; you are not in mourning; oh, says the child, such a father as I have is not worth mourning for; but my aunt and my uncle are in mourning.</p>
               <p>What did the child say when he communicated his father's death? - He said nothing more than that to me; that his father had been dead some time in the country; and he said, he had his buckles, and his watch, and some things from the country.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether the father had supported this child or not? - That I cannot say; I believe it was not in his power.</p>
               <p>After the child had said that to you, have you any reason to know whether the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270008"/>prisoner ever did hear from her husband? - She never did, I am very confident of it; she never heard from him; nor never saw him but that one time.</p>
               <p>Was it among those who knew her, or knew any thing of Cooper, reported among them that he was dead? - Yes; Sir; it became a common talk that he was dead; by that that the child said so.</p>
               <p>Did you believe so? - Why, yes; or else I would not have given my consent to the second marriage.</p>
               <p>How long has she and Prior lived together? - Three years.</p>
               <p>How many children have they? - Two children.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did she ask your consent to live with Mr. Burrows? - That was her father's doing at first; when she went she went as a visitor, and Mr. Burrows wanted a housekeeper, and my husband said, you may as well keep my daughter.</p>
               <p>What age was this boy that was the messenger of his father's death? - He was about fourteen.</p>
               <p>He accompanied the news of the death of your son-in-law, and of his mother's husband, with the observation that he was so worthless that he was not worth going into mourning for? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now was there ever the least pretence for supposing or stating the father to be dead, but that conversation? - I had no other grounds for it.</p>
               <p>You do not know who instructed him to say so: who was this uncle and aunt that were in mourning? - Mr. and Mrs. Williams.</p>
               <p>Did you ever go to enquire where he was buried? - No.</p>
               <p>How far off was it? - In St. Martin's-lane.</p>
               <p>Did not you frequently see Cooper at your son's repository? - No; never since this happened, nor before.</p>
               <p>How lately before this woman married a second time had you seen Cooper? - Never for eleven years.</p>
               <p>What makes you remember it was eleven years? - Because it is true.</p>
               <p>Did you know that Mr. Cooper was an hostler at Skeffington park? - No.</p>
               <p>Did your daughter, or you, or those that advised her to this second marriage, ever make the least enquiry?</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Was there any other means of communication at any time between this man and this woman, except by means of the son? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Then he, who had been the only go-between the husband and the wife, was the person that informed you that the husband was dead? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you believed it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you consent that this woman should live with Mr. Burrows on improper terms, or did you understand that she went as a housekeeper? - I understood that she went as a housekeeper.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you take the pains to go to Mr. Williams, to enquire the truth of it? - No; because they behaved very abruptly.</p>
               <p>Did you live at Mr. Alderidge's repository during any part of the seven years, preceeding May, 1787? - Yes; I think I did.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, during this seven years, how often did you see Cooper bringing horses to your brother's repository? - Upon my oath I did not see him, nor I do not know when I have seen him; I do not recollect seeing him since he came to see the child, when my sister was in Ireland; I have never seen him since to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>My friend has asked you whether it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270009"/>not generally believed in the family that Cooper was dead; upon your oath was not it stated to you by Alderidge, that he frequently came there? - No, Sir; it was not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Shepherd. I believe you are a friend of Prior's? - In some measure; I am an acquaintance of his.</p>
               <p>Did you so much believe this report, as to give your consent to the marriage? - I did; I was consulted as a friend; I am a trustee to Mrs. Cooper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How do you mean you was consulted? - How it might suit, he having a family before; I had not the least doubt of the death of the husband: I was an acquaintance of Mr. Burrows, and by that means I became acquainted with Mrs. Cooper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burrows wished to protect his housekeeper, when she was going to change her state? - Yes, and lawfully protect her: Mr. Prior is a tenant of mine, and bears an undeniable character, as any man in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270010"/>world, and has it of several people; if he had known she had a husband, he would not have married her.</p>

I said, no, I have no eyes to read; so then the prisoner gave the bill to one Mr. Morgan, as he calls himself; he pretended to belong to the Prince of Wales, and looked after his horses; there was the account of the ring, and how much the diamond was worth: Morgan asked the prisoner what he was, and he said, he was a jobber in Smith-field; then Mr. Morgan said to the prisoner, do you go and fetch this gentlewoman some money; Morgan stayed with me: the prisoner returned in half an hour, and said, he went to a gentleman, who was not at home, but at four o'clock he told me I should have the money, and Mr. Morgan would go with me to put it into the Bank: Mr. Morgan asked me what I had? I said, a watch and half-a-crown in my pocket; but I had no more; so I left them in a coach, and went home, and fetched all the money I had, which was six guineas; and here is his brother-in-law; he has been dodging me all day, and offered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270015"/>to give me three guineas; and the watch is in pawn.</p>
               <p>What was you to have for the six guineas? - Upwards of fifty guineas from the prisoner and Mr. Morgan, when he fetched the money: I saw nothing of the prisoner, nor for seven weeks; then I saw him in the Bird Cage Walk? and he threw this paper away; a soldier that is here saw the prisoner throw it away.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you to have your watch back again? - No, Sir; they did not say so.</p>
               <p>At the time you delivered your watch to them did they say you was to have it again? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>What was to become of the watch? - I do not know; I did not ask them.</p>
               <p>Was it proposed you should have your watch again? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you mean to part with your watch finally? - No, Sir: my son gave it me that was abroad.</p>
               <p>Then you expected to have it back again? - To be sure, when they came from the Bank.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. On what day did this happen? - On a Thursday, quarter day.</p>
               <p>Upon what day of the month? - I told you before.</p>
               <p>To whom did you deliver your watch and half-crown? - To Morgan, while you was gone for the money.</p>
               <p>To whom did you deliver the six guineas? - To Morgan.</p>
               <p>Where? - Why, you went with us in the coach, and when I came up I did not see you.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the prisoner present when you delivered the watch and half-crown to Morgan? - No, Sir; he was gone to fetch the money.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner present when you gave Morgan the six guineas? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>While the prisoner was present, was there any talk about delivering the watch or money? - No, Sir; none at all.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the jury. There is nothing to affect the prisoner in this case; because, though very probably they both set out with intent to commit a fraud, which might be a larceny, yet you see the prisoner was not present.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. On Wednesday, the 13th of October, about half past one, the two prisoners were coming through Checquer-yard, Dowgate-hill; I watched them; and at the corner of Elbow-lane, I missed sight of them in an instant, and did not see them till about ten minutes after two; they came back again; they were conversing together; they went by my door, and went to Hand-court; they stopped there, and I took hold of the biggest, Patrick, and asked him what he had got there; he gave me a blow across the nose; he asked what it was to me? he dropped the handkerchief out of his hand, and one of the goblets fell; he got away from me, and proceeded into Checquer-yard; he fell down there; I never lost sight of him; he ran into Thames-street, and I cried stop thief! he fell down, and I took him in Thames-street; when I laid hold of Patrick, the other ran away; and I missed him and the handkerchief, and the other goblet; I kept the goblet that I picked up myself; the other goblet was brought to me by a gentleman; he is not here; I was in Hand-court, and had Patrick in my custody at the time; I have kept the goblets ever since: (produces them): they were advertised; and I found out Mr. Armiger, and carried them to him; he knew them to be his.</p>

             then proposed this hay-loft as a proper place to be set on fire, as it would soon communicate to Mr. Gilding's dwelling-house and warehouses, as he said, the clover not being bound so tight as hay, would catch fire sooner, and blaze up; then Barnard and me returned to the Sun ale-house, Cow-cross; it might be about two o'clock; Lowe and Jobbins were there; we then told them that we had been to the place, and that Barnard had pitched on the hay-loft as fit to be set on fire; Barnard proposed to get some turpentine wood at the corner of the court where he lived, which being put in among the clover would soon blaze up; it was then agreed to meet Barnard at ten that evening, at his house in Pear-tree-court, Clerkenwell; and we went away about five o'clock: we accordingly met there at that time; in the mean time I directed Mrs. Lowe to get a pennyworth or two of spirits of turpentine, for the two prisoners and me went to Lowe's house, and Barnard went home; we then went out to get some money; we went out a thieving; but we did not get any; then we went to Barnard's at ten o'clock: before we went out a thieving, the turpentine which Mrs. Lowe bought, was mixed up by me, and Lowe, and Jobbins, and his wife, with some rags and paper, and put into a glove with some matches: when we went to Barnard's he was at home, in company with his wife; when we went in he said, he had some very good turpentine wood, and me and him put some into each of our pockets; it is old turpentine barrels cut up: we all four went from Barnard's house to Shoe-lane, with an intent to set fire to Mr. Miller's, a printer's joiner's shop, which was in the back part of his house; that did not have the desired effect; we went from there to Mr. Nash's, a coach-maker's, in Worship-street, Moorfields; I gave Lowe and Jobbins some wood out of my pocket, and they went to set fire to the stables, which soon went out; then we come away, and Barnard and Jobbins went separately; I lodged with Lowe, and Lowe and me went to Lowe's house to bed, about eight or nine in the morning; we staid there till between two and three in the afternoon of Friday; then me and Lowe went to the Sun, in Cow-cross; Jobbins was there; we then proposed to Jobbins and another man that was there, one

On Saturday morning I got up at eleven, and went to the Sun ale-house, Cow-cross; Barnard was there; I then proposed to Barnard to go that night to set Mr. Gilding's house on fire; at that time the prisoners were not there; Barnard left me, and I continued at the Sun ale-house till five o'clock, when Jobbins came in; me and Jobbins continued till eight o'clock, when Lowe came; Lowe said, he had been at work at his father's all day; Lowe and Jobbins went out in company with me a thieving; we had no success, and returned to Lowe's house about ten in the evening; Mrs. Lowe went out and brought some spirits of turpentine in a phial; I cannot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270024"/>say whether she brought them in that night, or the night before; then, with the assistance of Mrs. Lowe, Lowe, Jobbins, and me, mixed some rags with spirits of turpentine, and got some matches and turpentine-wood, which Mrs. Lowe bought a pennyworth of; it was not barrels, but the best we could get; and we put them all together into a glove; and the wood was put some into my pocket and some in Jobbins's; it was eleven o'clock by that time, and we three went to the Nag's-head, in Aldersgate-street; we left Mrs. Lowe at home, but ordered her not to go to bed; for if she should be called, to come and assist us in taking away the plunder. We had three or four pots of beer, and two half pints of gin, and a paper of tobacco. We staid there till half past twelve, and the landlord refused to draw us any more liquor; that was one of the houses that was burned down that night. We three went out of the house with each of us a pipe in our mouths alight, in order to light the matches and set fire to Mr. Gilding's premises. A stranger to us, a customer, came out at the same time we did. We four went to Carthusian-street, down that street; and by that time two of our pipes were broken: we went to the back gates of the Red-lion inn yard, which are in that street. The prisoner Jobbins got over the gates with a pipe in his mouth, which was the only remaining one; and, in getting over, the pipe was knocked out: I got over directly after Jobbins, and he gave me the pipe: the gate is an old wooden gate, with holes in it; I gave

I then went down the yard with Jobbins to the stable; then Jobbins went up the ladder with the pipe in his mouth, and the matches in his hand, into the clover-loft; when he lighted the matches, and set fire to the combustibles, which he had laid before, in my absence, among the clover hay. When I went for the pipe, I saw him go up the ladder: the combustibles soon blazed up. Jobbins and me came back, and got over the gates of the Red-lion yard into Carthusian-street: Lowe was then waiting at the gates, and desired me to go to his house for his wife: the fire then blazed. I went to Lowe's house, and found Mrs. Lowe laying down in her clothes; she returned back with me to the fire, which was then burning very rapidly: Mrs. Lowe and me returned in about twenty minutes. I left Lowe and Jobbins at the fire. We then went down the Red-lion yard, where Lowe was in a house bringing out boxes and things; the alarm of fire had been given, and people assisting: I then assisted, with Jobbins and Lowe, and Mrs. Lowe, to carry away the things that came out of the houses; I carried several things away into Aldersgate-street Buildings, in company with Lowe and Jobbins; they were left in the Buildings, in the care of a watchman. I then went back again to Mr. Gilding's, which was on fire; this was about an hour and an half after the first blaze. I went up into Mr. Gilding's dining-room, and brought down a vase case, containing about two dozen silver table-spoons; there was one gravy-spoon, and about a dozen desert-spoons. I went through the mob with it under my arm, to an inn yard, took out the spoons and put them in an handkerchief, and threw the case under the gateway. I then went home with the spoons and the handkerchief to Lowe's house, in Hartshorn-court, Golden-lane, Old-street, about five or ten minutes walk from the fire; I put them in a cupboard under the stairs, on the right-hand side. I then returned back to the fire; and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270025"/>the prisoners had brought a great many things, from different houses, into Aldersgate-street Buildings: I met Lowe coming with two drawers, which he carried to the Buildings; I proposed to call Barnard then, and left Lowe and Jobbins at the fire, and went to

Then Lowe came, and Lowe and me desired Barnard to fetch a cart; and I left Lowe to mind the things, whilst I went with Barnard to fetch a cart: we could not get one, and came back to Lowe; then Barnard proposed to us, to get what things away we could, without a cart; and Lowe brought the two drawers I met him with before, which were the property of Mr. Gilding, on his head, to the bottom of the Buildings, and took them towards Sutton-street, in the way to Barnard's house; and he desired Barnard and me to follow him, which we accordingly did: he then carried them into St. John-street, near Sutton-street, and Barnard then lifted them off Lowe's head on to mine; and Barnard then desired me to follow him to his house. I followed Barnard till I came to New-prison Walk, which is near his house; Lowe and Barnard accompanied me; where I was stopped by an officer, named Mr. Lucy, with the two drawers on my head: Barnard walked off directly, and Lowe stood still by me, and was brought in afterwards by Lucy to the New-prison. There was a blanket over the drawers, to prevent people seeing what they were. Lowe and me were committed for trial. On the Sunday, Mrs. Lowe came to the prisoner Lowe and me, and brought us fourteen shillings, which in the presence of Lowe she said was part of the price of four spoons, which she said she had received of Jobbins as part of a guinea which the four spoons fetched; that was our two thirds of the guinea; the other seven shillings belonged to Jobbins. She said Jobbins told her he had sold them in Chancery-lane, but would not tell where. Jobbins was usually called by us the Little Doctor. I then told her to go home, and she would find in the cupboard under the stairs some silver spoons, which these four were a part of. The next day she returned to me and Lowe, and brought us three pounds fifteen shillings, which she said was the money she had received for the spoons, of Mr. Samuel, a Jew, whom we knew; and she never gave me any of the money, but took out a pair of stockings for me from pawn, that was two shillings. Then we were committed to Newgate, and I had at different times a few shillings; and some victuals that I had, she paid for it. The bill was not found against Lowe. I was tried, convicted, and have received my pardon.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. That is material; he was not tried for stealing the plate, he was indicted for stealing the goods of Mrs. Woodley in the dwelling-house of Mr. Gilding; the jury found him guilty of stealing, but not in the dwelling house.</p>
               <p>I was ordered for transportation: I discovered this about six weeks after I was sentenced; I made no discovery of it before. I wrote a letter to Mr. Alderman Skinner: in the ward I was in, there was a person I thought I could depend on as a friend, not to hurt myself more than I was, and I got him to write a letter to Alderman Skinner; I told him the whole circumstance: his name is Wilkins.</p>
               <p>Is the story you have been relating to the court and jury the truth? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are these the two persons that had the share in the transaction you have been describing? - They are.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Knowlys.</p>
               <p>Now, Mr. Flindall, on Wednesday, which was three entire days before the fire happened, was the first time this scheme was concerted? - For that place.</p>
               <p>You say it was the Thursday before you communicated it to Barnard? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Barnard then alone went with you to view the premises? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was not Barnard's original scheme? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor do you say that Barnard was present at the commission of the offence? - No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270026"/>I should think it then a little odd that Barnard was the person that was with you to view the premises and to concert that scheme? - It was so.</p>
               <p>During this interval you certainly amused yourselves in going to search after the execution of plans of robbery? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time did you leave the Sun on Thursday? - Between four and five.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? look at the jury. - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is the Sun a house much frequented? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At the times you were there, there were a great many more persons? - There might be three or four people more than we.</p>
               <p>Then you do not know whether the house was full of customers or thin? - There might be two or three besides us; the taproom never was over and above thick of company; but the business was settled how it was to be conducted, as we were going to view the place; Barnard and me concerted the scheme, and communicated it to the two prisoners.</p>
               <p>How long at any one time on the Thursday were you all together at the Sun? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>How long do you guess? - Half an hour.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that you were not more than half an hour together at the Sun? - I cannot positively say, because we were some time together before Barnard and me went to view the premises, and some time afterwards; we might be an hour together the first time.</p>
               <p>Might you be two hours together? - Not together.</p>
               <p>Were you an hour and an half together? - I will not positively say; we might be an hour and an half, not more.</p>
               <p>Did you drink much together? - No.</p>
               <p>What did you drink? - Beer.</p>
               <p>How much? - Not above a pot, or a couple of pots.</p>
               <p>Was this the first time Barnard and you had been at the Sun? - The first time on this business; Barnard has been in company with me there before.</p>
               <p>What hour was the first meeting at the Sun when you were all together? - About eleven or twelve.</p>
               <p>Was the room thin or full then? - There were not many people there; there might be three besides us.</p>
               <p>At what time were you all four there again? - About two o'clock; we were there about half an hour, or more; there were not above two or three people there then, and we had not more then than a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>On the Friday, after Barnard left you, how long did you and the two prisoners remain there? - Till five o'clock: we were not all the time in that room; we went backwards in the skittle-ground.</p>
               <p>Was the room thin or full during that time? - There were two or three, or four, people going in and out; the room got full and empty again in the time that we continued there.</p>
               <p>You say, when you was taken by Lucy, Lowe stood still? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was found immediately on Lucy's going out again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You were in the same gaol together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How have you maintained yourself before that Wednesday? - By different other robberies, in company with the prisoners.</p>
               <p>For what length of time had you maintained yourself by a course of robberies and plunder on the public? - About eight weeks.</p>
               <p>What way of life was you in before? - I followed the sea for some time.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to confine your course of robberies to seven or eight weeks? - With these people: I have been out before.</p>
               <p>What has been the course of your life for these last three years, has it not been a course of robbery and plunder? - No, not three years.</p>
               <p>How much of the three years? - About two years.</p>
               <p>How often have you been in custody, during that time, on various accusations? - Once before within the two years.</p>
               <p>Did not you fear that the plan of burning houses might be fatal to the lives of many people in the night? - Without a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270027"/>doubt I did; but the plan was not proposed by me: when I saw the fire, I cannot say but it shocked me very much, but not before, not the idea of burning people.</p>
               <p>You planned it, I suppose, to be in the night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you wrote to the worthy alderman, you thought you could not be the worse for it? - I did not think so: I applied to this person that was in the same ward, thinking him a friend of mine, and asked his advice; I thought if I could make it appear to the public without hurting myself I would, and therefore I caused this letter to be written.</p>
               <p>I believe you proposed to get a pardon by this discovery? - I proposed to get nothing.</p>
               <p>Did not you hope to get a pardon for this discovery? - I had an hope that mercy should be shewn me if I should petition for it, but nothing further.</p>
               <p>That mercy was a pardon, was not it? - My expectation was, if I wrote a petition to his Majesty, or the Secretary, that, after I had done public justice, I thought I might receive some favour.</p>
               <p>Did not you expect a pardon? - No, I cannot say I did; I had a thought that I should receive some favour, I had a hope of receiving some favour, I cannot say a pardon, a free pardon, or any thing of that kind; I expected to go to sea.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did either of the prisoners ever observe to you, that this would be attended with murder, and that you had better desist? - Never.</p>
               <p>So they were as bad as you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You thought, by making a disclosure, you should not make your situation worse, and that, after you had done justice to the public, his Majesty might shew you some clemency? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What that was you could not guess? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you, as far as depends on you today, been doing justice to the public? - I have.</p>
               <p>Have you been telling the truth? - I have.</p>
               <p>Have you been making a false accusation against any man? - I have not.</p>

I cannot say that Mr. Edwards was there, nor whether the prisoner Jobbins was there. I was in bed in five minutes after they went away.

               <p>How near are you to the gates of the Red-lion? - I cannot say: there is a gate to the square; I do not go beyond those gates: it is a wooden railed gate, an open gate; you may see through it: the Red-lion gate is about six yards from my box.</p>
               <p>When you went your rounds, did you carry your lanthorn with you, or leave it in your box? - Leave it in my box.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the night that the fire happened at Mr. Gilding's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you remember your calling the hour of twelve in that night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you leave your lanthorn then in the box? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In the course of that night, and before the fire, did you hear any thing that caused your attention? - No, Sir, nothing, till I had done calling half after twelve; then I thought I heard a foot-step in Carthusian-street; I went to look through the gate, but I could see nobody; but I directly saw the fire.</p>
               <p>How long does it take you to go round and return to your box? - Sometimes more, sometimes less; sometimes ten or twelve minutes. When I saw the reflection of the fire, I look upon it to be three quarters after twelve, it was beyond the half hour, but could not tell exactly, as we have no chimes to the Charter-house clock; it was before one.</p>
               <p>Where did the reflection of the fire come from? - From the Red-lion yard, from some stables; it had just got a little above the tiles; I suppose it had been some time before it could get through the tiles.</p>
               <p>What sort of a gate was there to the inn yard, at that time, in Carthusian-street? - A wooden gate.</p>
               <p>Could a man easily get over it? - Yes, very easily.</p>
               <p>How so? - Because there was a part of the wall broken down by people getting over, some that belonged to the yard, such as coachmen and others; it was easy enough to get over there.</p>
               <p>The Charter-house gate was as easy to get over? - Yes, either over or under.</p>
               <p>So that if I had wanted to have come to your box for a light, I could have done it easily. - Very easily.</p>

               <p>I kept the Red-lion inn: I went to bed about a quarter after twelve: in the morning, about a quarter before one, I was alarmed with fire, by the watchman; I saw a very bad fire in a hay-loft, over a flour warehouse of mine, adjoining to Mr. Gilding's premises; there was clover-hay chiefly in the loft, and some straw and meadow-hay; there was clover brought in three successive days before the fire happened, on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday: there was a ladder locked to the side, that nobody should take it away to any other place; it was to go into the loft.</p>
               <p>Was it easy to place the ladder so as to get into the loft? - Oh, yes, very easy; it was for that express purpose. I secured my property in my iron chest, in my bed-room: I went down to fetch a candle; and in about a quarter of an hour after I was alarmed, and I left two or three of my doors open; and very soon after I returned, which was a little after one, this Lowe and Flindall came into my bed-room; I asked them what they wanted, and they said they come to assist me: I told them they were two thieves, I said they were nothing but thieves, and I told them I supposed they came to rob me: then they said they were no such thing as that, they came to serve me, and they would assist me; and I wanted somebody to remove my iron chest further from the fire, and they did assist in that: then they wanted to help me to take my beds and other things away; I told them they should not touch them, I wanted no further assistance from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270030"/>them, for I suspected them to be nothing but thieves, and they should not meddle with any thing, then they went off, and I had nothing to say to them.</p>

               <p>I am a peace-officer; I was in Aldersgate-street after the fire happened; I know Flindall and Lowe. In the morning of the 16th of May, about five o'clock, in St. James's Walk, Clerkenwell, at the end of which is Short's Buildings, I observed two men coming after me with some property on their head, and there was a third person looking into Mr. Rhode's, our vestry clerk's garden; I waited till they came up to me in Short's Buildings; I went up to Flindall, who had on his head two drawers, with wearing apparel, covered with a blanket; having heard of the fire, I suspected them: I asked the person, which was Flindall, what he had there? he said some property from the Red Lion Inn Yard, Aldersgate-street, and was going to No. 12, Pear-tree-court, Clerkenwell-close; I laid hold of him, and took him and the property into New Prison; I was then close to the gate; I came out of the prison, and found Lowe near where I had left him; he was without his hat, and his coat wet; I secured him; he said he had been at the fire to assist the sufferers; I took him into custody; Flindall was afterwards tried and convicted for stealing the goods; the bill was not found against Lowe.</p>

               <p>I live in Still-alley, Houndsditch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What business do you follow? - Clothes dealing.</p>
               <p>A general dealer? - A general dealer, if I can find nothing else.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the circumstance of a fire in Aldersgate-street? - Yes, Sir, I remember hearing of it after I had bought some silver of Mrs. Lowe.</p>
               <p>What did you buy? - Some silver spoons of Mrs. Lowe, the wife of the prisoner Lowe, as far as ever I understood. I know the prisoner Lowe; I came to his house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270032"/>and asked for him; his wife said he was not at home.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time buy any thing of Mrs. Lowe? - Yes, ten or eleven desert and table silver spoons, and among them one long narrow spoon, which I believe is called a marrow spoon.</p>
               <p>From what place did Mrs. Lowe take those things? - Why, she went out of the room that she and I was in, and took them out of a bit of a closet joining to the staircase on the right-hand; I cannot tell whether she had more, but I bought all she shewed me: I paid her 3 l. 15 s. they were at 4 s. 10 d. an ounce. I sold them afterwards to a man that deals abroad, for 5 s. 2 d. an ounce. The first time I saw Lowe after, was the day he was discharged: he had no hat on, and his coat under his arm. I was going out: says I, how do you do, Lowe, will you walk in? and he said, yes, I am come on purpose to speak to you. I took him in doors, and he then said, Mr. Samuel, if you have got any of those spoons that you bought of my wife, that came from the fire in Aldersgate-street, I beg of you. for God's sake, to make away with them, for I think Jem Flindall will be a rogue: for, says he, the day that Jem Flindall was arraigned at the bar of the Old-Bailey, he sent me down a letter, and required eight or nine shillings of me, that he then wanted: and, in case I did not send it to him, he threatened to tell the Judge the whole affair; and in case Flindall was hanged, he said I (meaning Lowe) should be hanged along with him. I then said, it is something amazing to me that you should be afraid of Flindall's being a rogue, there is nothing to affect you: you are discharged, and at your liberty, in what can he hurt you? and he then said, there are other circumstances in the way. I then begged of him to tell me what he was afraid of: he was a long time hesitating, but at last he said, I may tell you, that I, Flindall, and the others, set them houses in Aldersgate-street on fire, and I now intend to go on board of ship. He then said to me, I think Mr. Samuel, you have used me rather ill. In what? says I. Why, says he, concerning the money you gave my wife for the silver: for, says he, I think that twenty spoons, certainly come to more than three pound fifteen shillings, for says he, the little doctor, (by which name we called Jobbins) had sold some of the desert spoons, which were the smallest, to a person in Chancery-lane, for seven shillings a piece, and had sent Flindall and him fourteen shillings, and kept seven shillings to himself. I then told him, says I, I tell you what, Mr. Lowe, your wife will never tell me to my face that I bought twenty spoons, for if there had been twenty they would have come to more money. He then said to me, I think, Mr. Samuel, I have been very lucky in this business; I said, how lucky? He said, I may say I have saved my life twice; I asked how? Why, says he, I may say, I have saved my life now, by being acquitted; and, the first time, when the fire was in the house of Mr. Gilding, I entered the house and ran up stairs, and I had scarcely been a minute in the room, before it was all in a blaze, and I was forced to make my escape out of one of the windows, and I was catched by the mob. I gave him half-a-crown, and declined going with him.</p>
               <p>Did you see Lowe again after that? - Yes; some days afterwards, I was coming from the Borough across London-bridge, I met Lowe coming towards me; I hardly knew him; he had on a canvas jacket, and a pair of nankeen breeches; he said he was going down that evening. Down, says I, where? Says he, to the Nore, on board of ship; and he asked me if I had heard any thing concerning Flindall, about the business, (which I understood to mean the business he had been talking of)? I told him no, I had not troubled myself about it; he asked me to give him something to drink; and I took him to the dram shop in Thames-street, and we had a glass a-piece; and from that time I have not seen him, till I saw him in Guildhall. My wife was present only a short part of the time, for she was very ill.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270033"/>You knew these people before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I take it for granted, you suspected these things were not come honestly by? - I knew they were not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How long have you known Flindall? - Five or six months.</p>
               <p>How often has he been at your house? - Pretty often.</p>
               <p>On business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You know very well what I mean by business? - Yes, I suppose I do.</p>
               <p>That is to say, bringing you the result of his plunder - that you mean? - You mean that I suppose.</p>
               <p>Is that true? - Yes, I suppose it might.</p>
               <p>For what course of time have you been in this known character: a general merchant we will call it? - Sir!</p>
               <p>How long has your house been a house for this purpose? - I do not know that my house has been resorted to but by these people. I have been a general dealer in an honest livelihood, which I can prove, though I have been under the lash of the Court.</p>
               <p>How long in the honest way? - Many years.</p>
               <p>How long in the dishonest line? - Not long.</p>
               <p>You know very well, that by giving evidence, you save yourself from prosecution? - Certainly; but I came voluntarily several hundred miles; I was not sent for; and my wife came up voluntarily too.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The gentleman has asked you whether Flindall came to your house to sell stolen goods? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who came with him? - Jobbins and Lowe.</p>
               <p>This is the commencement of your atonement to the public? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The property was disposed of? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Therefore nothing could come against you? - No.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>(Examined by Mr. Knowlys.)</p>
               <p>I am a journeyman watch-finisher; I have known the prisoner Jobbins ten years, from his first going to St. Paul's School; I never heard his character impeached; he was employed in the medical line, as a surgeon and man-midwife; his father gave seventy guineas with him.</p>
               <p>Did you ever apply to him in that character? - I did once, on the Saturday, at his father's house, previous to the fire; the fire happened on the Sunday morning; he was not at home in the evening; I waited for him; I saw him.</p>
               <p>What time did he come home, that you had the opportunity of seeing him? - It was past twelve o'clock; I went to the west end of the town.</p>
               <p>Where had you come from? - From Westminster.</p>
               <p>How long had you waited at the house for him? - Very near two hours.</p>
               <p>Whose house was this? - Mr. Jobbins, the father's.</p>
               <p>Did the son reside at the father's? - He did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270035"/>Where is the house situated? - Opposite Charter-house-wall, Goswell-street; it looks into the gardens.</p>
               <p>How long after twelve was it when he came home? - About a quarter; it was just turned twelve when he came in; or it might be ten minutes past twelve when he came in.</p>
               <p>How long did he continue with you? - I suppose about twenty minutes, or there-away.</p>
               <p>What did he do for you? - He made me up some pills.</p>
               <p>Did he go away with you when you went away, or did he remain at home? - He remained at home.</p>
               <p>Was the father at home? - He was.</p>
               <p>Did you see him? - Yes, I certainly saw him, for nobody lives in that part of the house, but the father and son.</p>
               <p>(Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding.)</p>
               <p>Whereabouts is this house of the father's? - It is a coal-shop, the corner of Rotten-row; it is a double house; the father has all the upper part of the house; he belongs to the Keys, some department under government.</p>
               <p>Did you know the master with whom this boy served his time? - No.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with him? - Between nine and ten years.</p>
               <p>How did you know he served his time to a surgeon? - By his father coming to me, and borrowing my indenture to copy from.</p>
               <p>You never heard him mention the name of the man? - No; I never heard any conversation relative to that business.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In Golden-lane, with my mother.</p>
               <p>Are you out of your time? - Between eight and nine years.</p>
               <p>Who did you serve your time with? - One Wiltshire, in Bloomsbury.</p>
               <p>Who do you work for now? - Mr. Delasont, at the Change.</p>
               <p>Have you any family? - No.</p>
               <p>How did your acquaintance begin? - By the father, who came to my father's house.</p>
               <p>Then you tell me you never had any conversation with Jobbins about his skill in the business? - I never wanted any thing of the kind before.</p>
               <p>What hour did you go at? - About half after eight.</p>
               <p>Do you know the neighbourhood? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far is this place from the place where the fire happened? - I never was there in company with him; I have been there since.</p>
               <p>How far is it from the father's? - Near half a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Is it so far even as that? - I suppose it might be.</p>
               <p>Now, young man, you went to this house you say, at ten? - On my return I called upon him.</p>
               <p>You went at half past eight, and he was not at home? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>What time did he come in? - Past twelve.</p>
               <p>Was he smoking his pipe at that time? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Was any body with him? - Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>How long did he stay then? - About twenty minutes after twelve I left him, or rather more.</p>

               <p>Did he smoke there the time he came to his father's? - No; his father was always against his smoking.</p>
               <p>What! were your habits of intimacy such as to know that? - I have heard his father say so.</p>
               <p>Upon what occasion, or why; take care young man? - I have heard him say so; he had always an objection to company.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect any one time now, when you heard the father say so; is the father here? - Yes, I fancy he is.</p>
               <p>When was it you heard the father object to his smoking? - Half a year or a year ago; my mother used to wash for the father.</p>
               <p>Then not later, you have heard that objection? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you remember that half a year ago? - He did, somewhere thereabouts.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270036"/>How many visits did you pay this young man at his father's house, after that Saturday? - I never had occasion to pay any more visits, because his father came to our house for some linen.</p>
               <p>Have you ever been there since? - No; I had no occasion; I had a sufficient quantity, and I satisfied him on the Saturday night.</p>
               <p>When did the father come to your house after this Saturday? - The week following, I think he came for some linen; he frequently visits my mother.</p>
               <p>Did he hold any conversation with you or your mother, more than to require the linen that he wanted? - No more.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen the father since? - Yes, several times, at my own house; he frequently calls on account of his linen.</p>
               <p>Was that the only occasion that brought him to your mother's house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you had any conversation relating to his son? - He certainly informed me of the unfortunate situation of his son.</p>
               <p>When was that? - About three weeks ago.</p>
               <p>In what manner did he inform you? - He told me that his son was gone on board a ship, and that he was taken up for being concerned in this fire; that was the very first I ever heard any thing about this young man, from the Saturday night, till I saw the father, about three weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Court. Upon what occasion did you apply to him for the pills? - From a violent fall I had from a chair, which hurt my loins.</p>
               <p>When did this accident happen to you? - On the Wednesday before, at my own house.</p>
               <p>How came you to go at so late a time of night, on an accident that happened on the Wednesday before? - I went first at half past eight; then I went to Westminster, and called in Fleet-street on my business; the father was at home; I took a book out of the library.</p>
               <p>What did you want the book for? - It is common to take a book when one is in a room.</p>
               <p>What was the book? - I do not recollect rightly; it was something about medicine; he came in about a quarter after twelve; I staid about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the father of the young man at the bar: I live in Goswell-street, in a house of Mr. Brown's; his door fronts one way, and mine the other; there is no communication; it is a separate house; I have lived there about six years. I have only one son; I keep no servant; my income is but small; I am a king's locker at the Custom-house.</p>
               <p>Did your son live at home with you at the time of the fire? - He did.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know in what way he disposed of his time for several days preceding the fire, during the week? - He was at home always when I came home, at three o'clock; the former part of the day, I can give no. more account of him than you; I go to my duty at nine o'clock, sometimes not till ten or eleven; he was at home when I was there; sometimes I came home at half after two.</p>
               <p>On Saturday, when you returned home, and from three o'clock the day of the fire, was your son at home? - He was at home, writing, and had been writing for the week before; he was writing a chronicle; he continued at home till between seven and eight; I was at home all that time, when I desired him to go to the White-horse Cellar, to see for something that I expected from Gloucestershire, which was to lay there till called for; he did not find any thing; and he did not return till a little past twelve; in the mean time a Mr. Watson came about nine o'clock that evening; he asked me if my son was at home? I told told him no, but he would be in presently, I dare say; he said he was going farther, he would call as he came back; he returned about eleven; he waited till it was a little past twelve, when my son came home.</p>
               <p>Do you know the nature of his business with your son? - He asked him if he could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270037"/>make him up something for a strain? my son told him if he would wait about a quarter of an hour, he could; accordingly he made some pills in a box, and he paid him; I saw him.</p>
               <p>Has your son any books? - He has a little library.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Watson went away, what became of your son? - He went to bed with me; he had not been in bed half an hour, before the alarm of fire was.</p>
               <p>How long was it before he got up? - Half an hour, I believe; and he got up and said, there was a fire; says he, I will run and see it; I said, do not go, for you may be hurt; he said he would take care not to be hurt, and he would not stay long.</p>
               <p>Do you know the time he returned? - No, I cannot say I do, for I had been asleep, for I had no light.</p>
               <p>Did he return to bed? - He did.</p>
               <p>Was he in bed with you when you awoke? - He was.</p>
               <p>What became of him on the Sunday? - He was at home all day on Sunday, and until Monday, past nine, till I went to my office.</p>
               <p>Who was your son apprentice to? - Mr. Cowley; he is dead; since then he has lived with me; Mr. Cowley was a surgeon and apothecary; I gave fifty guineas with him, and all expences.</p>
               <p>Was your son a studious and attentive young man? - Oh, very; he understood Latin very well, and the anatomical science; sometimes for three weeks together he was studying in his profession, and composing things.</p>
               <p>(Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Jobbins, in the course of my life, I never had so painful a duty as at present. How far do you live from the Nag's-head, in Aldersgate-street? - I do not know where it is; I never go to a public house.</p>
               <p>Did you know the premises that were burnt down? - I do not know the situation, nor who lives there.</p>
               <p>Am I to understand, that knowing for two months past your son has been in custody upon a charge that was to affect his life, you have never had the curiosity to see the place where he was supposed to be? - Oh, Sir! I see it every day.</p>
               <p>So I thought. How far is that place from your dwelling house? - About one hundred yards, or one hundred and twenty, one hundred and thirty, one hundred and forty, or one hundred and fifty.</p>
               <p>Did you get up, when your son got up, and look out of the window? - I did, and saw the fire very plain; I thought it was nearer than it was; I thought it was within fifty, sixty, or one hundred yards.</p>
               <p>So that I am to understand, you being awoke out of your sleep by a fire within fifty, sixty, or one hundred yards, you reposed yourself into such a sleep, that your son came to bed to you without waking you. Was you awake when he came home? - I do not know that I was awake, for I fell asleep, and he came home; at what time he came home I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did you compose yourself at a distance of fifty, sixty, or one hundred yards off such a fire as that in Aldersgate-street, so that you got at last into such a sleep, that a man came to bed to you without waking you? - I do not say but I might awake; I say, what time it was I could not tell, because I had not light enough to see my watch; whether I had or not, I did not look.</p>
               <p>Was you, or was you not awake when your son came home? - He awaked me when he came to bed.</p>
               <p>He did? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then he undressed himself in your presence? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>You remember the fact of his coming to bed? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>What time was it? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Did you enter into any conversation with him? - Why yes; I asked him where was the fire? he said, in Aldersgate-street.</p>
               <p>Then you now perfectly recollect your son's coming to bed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then the reason you did not look at your watch was, because you had not light enough to see it? - I do not know that was the reason; I did not look; there might be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270038"/>light enough; I paid no attention to the time.</p>
               <p>What age is your son? - Nineteen.</p>
               <p>How long did he serve Mr. Cowley? - Two years and an half.</p>
               <p>And continued with him till his death? - Yes, within a very little.</p>
               <p>Then it was not the death of his master that occasioned him to leave Mr. Cowley? - No, Sir, it was not; I thought his master used him ill, and had not practice sufficient for him, therefore I took him away. I went to St. Bartholomew's hospital to treat with a gentlemen: surgeon Sharp said he would give me an answer, to take my son, if he did not take another.</p>
               <p>How long, in truth, after he left Mr. Cowley, did he continue to live with you? - Two years.</p>
               <p>Did you, in truth, take this young man from his service at the age of seventeen, and continue him in your house as his own master, for two years? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had he any body to controul him there? - I was his father.</p>
               <p>You was pretty much from home? - I went out at eight or nine, sometimes ten or eleven, to my duty, and had done by two, or half an hour after three.</p>
               <p>Did you hold no other conversation with on his coming to bed, but where the fire was? - I did not ask him many questions; I asked him when I got up.</p>
               <p>You did not ask even whether it was a large fire? - He told me it was.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him if any lives had been lost? - He told me he had heard of none.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to have been very active? - No, Sir, not to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Had you the curiosity to ask him what time it was? - I did not ask him, nor I did not know.</p>
               <p>Did your son practise much for himself? - He did practise what he could get, and chiefly a few pills for the disorder.</p>
               <p>Where did he keep the ingredients for his medicines? - He went and bought them as he wanted them.</p>

               <p>No stock? - Yes, he did, sometimes, two or three pounds of things.</p>
               <p>He had the things for Mr. Watson's medicines? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where did he compose them? - In my presence, before the fire; I believe I have some now of the very same that he made.</p>
               <p>Did he make them in the presence of the patient? - He did: I never knew what house he used; but I knew he went to public-houses to get his money, a guinea, half a guinea, or fifteen shillings.</p>
               <p>He was a very studious young man? - Very studious as to learning.</p>
               <p>He was not addicted to drinking or smoking? - I never heard him swear, nor ever saw him drunk.</p>
               <p>Did he smoke? - He did smoke sometimes.</p>
               <p>What at home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You and he used to smoke together? - I never smoked or chewed.</p>
               <p>You never made any objection to his smoking? - Never; he took it for the toothach.</p>
               <p>Did he smoke a pipe most nights when he went to bed? - No, Sir, not most nights, only now and then; but if there was strong beer and small together, he used to drink small.</p>
               <p>He drank small beer with his pipe to chuse? - Yes; when he wanted any beer, he used to fetch it from the chandler's shop.</p>
               <p>Of course, as you never objected to his smoking, you never could have told any body that you did not like his smoking? - Not I; I said to nobody but himself; I said to him, you are a young man, why do you smoke? Oh, says he, it does my teeth good.</p>
               <p>That was all the objection you made? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You never told any body else? - I might say, that is a silly boy to smoke so young.</p>
               <p>You never said that to Mr. Watson, did you? - Not that I know of.</p>

               <p>Then this young man was not driven to go out, because you did not like he should smoke at home? - That he was not.</p>
               <p>Did not you think that he staid at this White-horse cellar? - He staid too long, I thought.</p>
               <p>Did you know much of his patients, or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270039"/>the company he kept? - I knew little of them, I never troubled myself with them; I never saw Flindall, nor Lowe, nor Barnard, till this affair.</p>
               <p>Do you know a person of the name of Towse? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>What is he? - He is a buckle-maker: I know his father; he is beadle of Joiners-hall; the father is a man of some property.</p>
               <p>Have you ever had any conversation with Towse, the father, as to the time your son came home on the morning of the fire? - I never have, since this was talked of.</p>
               <p>But before this was talked of, and before your son was accused, upon your oath, have not you mentioned to Mr. Towse the time your son came home that morning? - Upon my oath, I never did.</p>
               <p>Then you never said to Mr. Towse, that your son did not come home that morning till four o'clock? - I never told him so to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>You swear that positively? - Yes, Sir, I will; I only told him, since this accident happened, that I was sorry to hear that he was accused of any such thing.</p>
               <p>That you swear positively? - Positively.</p>
               <p>You mean to stand by that? - I never told him in my life.</p>
               <p>Neither before your son was accused, nor since? - I do not know what I might have told him since; it might be four in the morning.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell him that your son was not at home when you went to bed, and that you was sorry to say he did not return till four in the morning? - I never did, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Now I tell you, Mr. Towse is here. - Why I may talk about something or other, and I might say I cannot tell what time it was.</p>
               <p>Upon a subject where your son's life was at stake, might you be holding idle conversations; did you not say so, upon your oath? - I cannot remember any such thing.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you did not say so; upon your oath, is it true that this young man had been to bed that night? - Yes, Sir, he certainly had.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did you tell Towse he had not been to bed? - I did not tell him he had, or had not, to the best of my knowledge; I cannot swear I did, or did not.</p>
               <p>Which way shall I take it? - You may take it which way you please.</p>
               <p>Then, in conversation with Towse, you may have said that your son was not at home when you went to bed, and that you was sorry to say he did not come home till four in the morning? - When I went to bed, we went to bed together.</p>
               <p>Will you swear positively you never said so to Towse? - I cannot swear positively to any such thing.</p>
               <p>What liquor did you and Mr. Watson drink together, while you were waiting the return of your son? - Not one spoonful of any thing that I know of, never drank a drop, neither spirits nor liquors, of any sort; that I can swear.</p>
               <p>Do you know a man of the name of Samuel? - I do not know him any farther than this: when the woman declared that my son was innocent, and said she did not know him, before Alderman Skinner, Mr. Towse was standing by me; I said, I am very glad of it, I should be sorry she should know any thing of him; he is not in their list, however: so afterwards he said, there is a husband of her's; if you please, I will go with you, and hear what he says; for fear that he should have something to say to disturb my mind; so he and I went to an indifferent house in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Was not that Mr. Farmer's house? - I do not know whose house it was.</p>
               <p>Did you send for Samuel to come to you? - Samuel did come, by the wife's desire.</p>
               <p>Did not you send for Samuel? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did not you go there on purpose to see him? - I went to see his wife.</p>
               <p>What did you say to the wife? - I asked if her husband was at home, and she said he was; and, if I pleased to come along with her, she would bring me to him: Mr. Towse offered to go; she refused; and when he came in, I said, is your name so and so? he said, yes, what would I have; I said, do you know any thing of one Jobbins; Jobbins,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270040"/>says he to his wife; yes, says she, before Alderman Skinner; no, says he, I do not know him; says she, neither do I know him: I am very glad of it, says I; I would not have him guilty of any such thing for 100 l.: they have since forged a lie, and said I offered 100 l.: this is all that passed.</p>
               <p>Did not you say, I am the father of Jobbins, and I shall be very happy if the next time you go up you will be as partial as your wife, to say you do not know any thing of him; no money shall be wanting, any money you please shall be ready? - No, I did not say any such thing; I never said any such thing in the hearing of Towse.</p>
               <p>Nor in the hearing of Farmer? - I do not know Farmer.</p>
               <p>Did you never say so in the hearing of Towse, Samuel, or Farmer? - I never did; I was very glad they did not know him; for I went to satisfy my mind.</p>
               <p>Was your son's library in the same room he compounded his medicines in; where did he keep his books? - In a book-case that cost me sixteen guineas; he had a key of it.</p>
               <p>Had he other books in that library besides medical books? - He had his school books; he was six years at St. Paul's school.</p>
               <p>Did you hand Mr.

             the book, or did he help himself? - The book! the pills.</p>
               <p>No, the book? - I never handed him a book in my life.</p>
               <p>Did he ever take a book? - He never did.</p>
               <p>He had no book the night he was waiting for your son? - If he had, he had it from my son.</p>
               <p>If he had, you must have seen it? - I must.</p>
               <p>How did you and he while away the time while he was waiting for your son? - Spent our time as any body else would do; sat by the fire-side, and talked: I was reading, I believe, in Quincy's Dispensatory, or some other book; I cannot tell what I was reading.</p>
               <p>If any body has said that Watson took a medical book out of the library, that is not true? - I never said so; I don't know what I said; suppose a book laid here, he might take it up and look at it.</p>
               <p>He is but an illiterate man? - He is not a conjuror.</p>
               <p>He can read, can he? - Yes, he can, and write too; you read law, I read physic; I read what suits me.</p>
               <p>How soon after this did your son go to go abroad? - I do not know that.</p>
               <p>How long after the fire? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Try now, and recollect. - It might be three or four months.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that it was? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was it three months? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was it two months? will you swear it was two months? upon your oath, did he not go away? - What signifies whether he did or not; I have no remark of it; God zounds, I cannot keep such things in my mind, I cannot recollect if I was all day about it; I never charge my mind with such things, it was not a thing of such a subject to think of; I cannot tell within a month; I believe, about two months. Swear it! I would not swear any such thing; what occasion is there to swear to that.</p>
               <p>I desire to have an answer. - I cannot do it; I believe it was upwards of two months; and it might be three.</p>
               <p>Had he any intention of going abroad? - None at all that I know of, except when the war broke out, he said he wished he was able to pass his examination, he would go as surgeon's mate; he was gone as an assistant surgeon; so he told me; I do not mean to swear that it was so.</p>

               <p>Do not you know that he went as a common foremast-man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>By what name? -

            ; and his reason was, because I should not know he had entered into any regular list; he told me he was going.</p>
               <p>Did you find him any medicine-chest to take with him? - I found him a bottle of six or seven pounds worth of antiscorbutic drops, and a few instruments, and a bed and bedding, and shirts and trowsers, and such things, of the best sort.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that you knew he had entered by the name of Burne? - I did not know it till he wrote to me, by the name of Burne, for money.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270041"/>Do you know any relations of Watson's? - He has a mother: she has lived very well in her time.</p>
               <p>Had you any dealings with her? - No, Sir; none of any sort: she made me shirts.</p>
               <p>How lately? - Never but once.</p>
               <p>How many years was that ago? - I believe it is four or five years ago; and sometimes she has mended a trifle; very trifling.</p>
               <p>How lately is it she has done any thing to your linen? - She has not earned half-a-crown for these three or four years: I have not given her any thing to do.</p>
               <p>She never was a washer woman? - Never: she never took in washing that I know of: I do not know much of her: she might take in washing and I not know it.</p>
               <p>If she had washed for you, you would have known it? - Yes, and have told you too: she has washed me a shirt when she has mended it, within these six or eight months; but Watson's wife has washed me two within this week, and mended them; the old woman should have done it, but she was ill; they have not earned five shillings of my money in the whole course of my life, excepting making.</p>
               <p>Who is your regular washer woman? - If I can think of the woman's name, I am not here alive; God bless the woman! now you will think that very odd; and I cannot think of her name.</p>
               <p>Where does she live? - I cannot tell you that neither; not the name of the street.</p>
               <p>What part of the town? - Why, in Goswell-street; just down a court.</p>
               <p>Just in your own neighbourhood? - Yes.</p>
               <p>During the last four or five years you have not very much visited the Watsons, have you? - I have not been there, I suppose, three times in a twelvemonth, nor three times in three years.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - I am sure.</p>
               <p>That in the course of the last twelve months you have not been there three times? - Yes; I have been there more than that; six times within the last six months: I had three watches.</p>
               <p>The business you went upon was your watch? - Yes; no other occasion: he has not earned of me above half-a-crown, or three or four shillings for years past: only cleaning one, and just doing another.</p>
               <p>You had no other business there but about your watch? - No other business of any kind: I am no gossiper or visitor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lawes. You was present, I believe, at the first and present examinations? - I was.</p>
               <p>Did Mrs. Samuel or not say she knew your son? - At the first she said, she did not know him, and the next time, I believe, she did say, she knew him; for she was asked the question by Mr. Skinner.</p>

               <p>Upon your oath did you ever offer them any money on any occasion? - I never offered them a shilling in my life.</p>
               <p>And what you have said about a hundred pounds, was as you have stated it? - Because I would not for a hundred pounds, or ten thousand pounds, that he should have been guilty of such a thing as that.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live No. 2, Lombard-street: a buckle-maker. I have known young Jobbins four years and upwards.</p>
               <p>During that time what has been his character for honesty? - All that I knew in the different times he has been at our house, was always good, and like a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Was his character that of an honest lad? - I believe so.</p>
               <p>Was you present at the examination before the magistrate? - I was at the first and second time.</p>
               <p>At the first examination did you hear Mrs. Joseph examined.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I must take your lordship's opinion, whether examinations taken before a magistrate can be got at this way, which are taken in writing?</p>
               <p>Court. It is clearly settled, that what<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270042"/>passes before a magistrate is evidence, unless it is formally taken down, and made an examination, then if you object to the parol evidence, ask the question, whether it was taken in writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. Alderman Skinner. Is this the examination taken before you? (Shewing him an examination - If it is signed by me it is; I signed them as they were taken.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Do you mean to be accurate in your memory, to say, that was all that passed. How many examinations were there of Mrs. Samuel? - Four.</p>
               <p>Was there any written examination signed by you, of what passed at the first time? - Not any; but what has been since I have.</p>
               <p>Did you sign any examination on the first time she was brought before you? - No, I did not: my lord, it will be necessary to state, that every examination that was on oath was reduced into writing, and signed by me.</p>
               <p>Court. What she said I think may be received.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Mr. Towse. When Alderman Skinner asked her whether she knew that young man, she said, she did not; he asked her again, and a third time, with this addition to her, refresh your memory, do not you know the Little Doctor? she said, I do not; then Alderman Skinner said, then you mean to say, that you do not know him in any thing? and she said, she did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long did you know this lad? - About three or four years.</p>
               <p>Did you know him in the life time of Mr. Cowley? - I do not know Mr. Cowley.</p>
               <p>The man that he was apprentice to? - I had a very slight knowledge of him; only from hearsay.</p>
               <p>Did this young man continue with him till his death? - I cannot tell that; I did not know Mr. Cowley.</p>
               <p>In what way has the young man been employed these last four years? - I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>How did he support himself? - I cannot tell that: he has frequently been at our house; him and his father; to see my father; to spend the evenings, and some parts of the day: he was an acquaintance of my brothers.</p>
               <p>And yet you did not know how he supported himself, or whether he had any employment or not? - Of my own knowledge I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you go to Mr. Farmer? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you go with Jobbins any where? - To a many places: I never saw Mrs. Samuel in his presence: my father is beadle to the joiners company; my brother is nineteen, an apprentice to Mr. Davenport, nearly opposite Whitechapel church; the prisoner never came in company with any body but his father and my sister; I am pretty sure.</p>
               <p>You do not know Flindall? - I never saw him before; I only know him by seeing him at the examinations.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Have you any reason in the world to believe that he has been at his father's house for the last six months? - I cannot say either one way or the other, for we have no communication: I have not seen him to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the night of the fire in Aldersgate-street? - I recollect the fire exceedingly well; I was at it: I was considerably alarmed.</p>

               <p>"As to you, Jobbins and Lowe, the two prisoners who have been convicted of arson, I hardly know how to address myself to you; I hardly know how to find words to express the abhorrence that I entertain, or that the publick entertain, of the crime of which you stand convicted. The felting fire to houses, in the dead of the night, for the purpose of plunder, at the risk of the lives of the inhabitants of a great city, is a crime not yet to be met with in the records of villainy that have been brought forward in this Court; and as the crime is singular, so the punishment must be marked, and I trust and hope it will be so marked as to make the example such, that if there should be left any persons of the same bad intentions, they will take warning from your fate; and as your crime has been singularly novel, I hope it will be the only one that will ever appear in a Court of Justice of the same description. You therefore must prepare to die, and consider yourselves as men without hope in this world; and give me leave to assure you, as my decided opinion, that for an offence so heinous as yours is, you never can expect salvation in the world to come, unless you make some reparation to your injured country and the God you have offended, by sincerely confessing all the offences of which you have been guilty, and by making the most open and declared exposition of the names of all persons, who either have engaged, or are about to engage, in crimes so detestable, as those of which you stand convicted."</p>

On the 11th of October, about a quarter past three in the afternoon, the prisoner came into the shop; I had seen her several times before; she said she wanted to look at some printed cotton for a gown; we suspected her; I fixed myself in such a situation in the shop, as to observe the whole of her transactions; she had a gown cut off, and paid for it; then she said she wanted a muslin handkerchief; and while the young man's back was turned to look for the handkerchiefs, the prisoner threw down the piece of muslin in the indictment, on the floor, from the counter, ten yards of worked muslin; and she brought it under her petticoat with one of her feet; she was sitting down; then she put her hand through her pocket-hole, as though feeling for her money; and with that hand she drew it under her petticoats; she then said the muslin handkerchief was of no consequence, she would pay for the gown; which she paid fifteen shillings for, and went out of the shop; the muslin cost Mr. Schooley eight pounds ten shillings, as near as I can judge; I was on the stairs that lead into the warehouse, at the back of the shop; her face was towards me; she could not see me; I was almost at the top of the stairs, and looked over a corner of the bannisters; she went out of the shop; I followed her, and brought her back; and she attempted to go to the place where she had stolen it from, which I prevented, and made her sit down in a part of the shop that was perfectly clear; I sent for a constable; she was much agitated, fainted away, and said it was her first offence; she got up five or six times; I set her down as often; at last she got up again, and making a stride or two, she dropped the muslin from under her petticoats, at the distance of about a yard; and I took up the muslin immediately, and it felt very warm; this is the muslin; I know it to be the prosecutor's, by the mark which I put on.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I will only ask you, after the last observation that you made with a smile, whether you know that this case affects the life of the prisoner? - That is not material; I have told nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>You mean to state to the jury that it is immaterial. I ask you, at the time that you made not a very decent nor a very pertinent observation, you knew that this case affects the life of the prisoner? - I do not know; I am not sure that I do.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that this is an indictment calculated to affect her life? - It may be.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that it is? - I do not understand that it is so.</p>
               <p>Do you expect a jury more likely to credit you, when you declare that it is immaterial to you, whether the woman is to be executed in consequence of your evidence, or not? - I understood it was transportation.</p>
               <p>You understood so? - Yes.</p>

               <p>To whose house did you convey those things? - They were strangers to me.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear their names? - Not to my recollection.</p>

               <p>You have occasionally bought several things not honestly come by? - Yes, for seven or eight months.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lawes. I think you say, on Friday evening, when somebody knocked at your door, the answer was, Flindall? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now, from thence I collect, that you knew him very well before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had you known him before? - I cannot recollect; no great while before.</p>
               <p>How often had you dealt with him before? - I have bought things of him before.</p>
               <p>Have you not, upon your oath, bought goods frequently of him before? - I have, but not frequently.</p>
               <p>Now, you are serious in that answer, are you? - If he had any thing, I bought it.</p>
               <p>Whenever you did buy things of him, did not you know they were dishonestly come by? - Yes, Sir, I must know that they were not come honestly by.</p>
               <p>What led you to this person of the name of Moses? - Because it was a light night; I was afraid of carrying them to my own place, and therefore I carried them to that place.</p>
               <p>What is his real name? - His name is Moses; that is all I know of him.</p>
               <p>Moses what? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>How long have you known him? - About a twelvemonth; he lives in an alley, but I do not know the name of it; I know the way to it; it is an alley in Bishopsgate-street.</p>
               <p>Is there any number on the houses? - I never looked for the number.</p>
               <p>Had he lived there all the time you knew him? - I knew him by crying old clothes about the streets; and he is a dealer; that is the way I knew him.</p>
               <p>Was he not the same sort of dealer that you and your husband were? - No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys, one of the Prisoners Counsel. The street door was opened to you on your knocking? - It was.</p>
               <p>You was the person who had the opportunity of looking through the chinks of the door? - Yes; I being first; with old Macmanus and another witness, looked through the crack of the door.</p>
               <p>Ivory clapped his back against the door? - He did.</p>
               <p>Is the door narrow or broad? - It is not very narrow or very broad; it is a common door.</p>
               <p>Court. Who looked through the chink of the door besides Mr. Macmanus and you? - Mr. Allingham did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What business are you now? - I am a cordwainer by trade.</p>
               <p>Do you pursue that trade? - I do.</p>
               <p>Who do you work with? - For myself.</p>
               <p>When did you make shoes last? - For Mr. Bond, on Snow-hill.</p>
               <p>How long ago? - About two months ago.</p>
               <p>Then for the last two months you have not made shoes? - I have got to be a common thief-taker now.</p>
               <p>I have not seen you much here? - I have been here, but have given no evidence: within this last two months trade has been very dead.</p>
               <p>You mean the trade you stated to me? - Yes; that of being a common thief-taker.</p>
               <p>How long is it since you have been a patrol? - Two years last Christmas.</p>
               <p>What parish? - Of this parish; Saint Sepulchre's.</p>
               <p>How long was you a patrol of St. Sepulchre's? - Between six and seven years.</p>
               <p>How came you to leave the business of a patrol for this parish? - Because me and my fellow servant used to go to the Brewhouse together, the side of the Fleet-market, and drink strong beer instead of small.</p>
               <p>Then I believe the people there were illnatured<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270059"/>enough to say that you have taken the strong beer wrongfully? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe they said, you stole it? - To be sure: I was discharged from the office of patrol for that: there might have been other common reports for aught I know.</p>
               <p>Have not you been charged with stealing the oil from the lamps? - Yes; but I deny that: I was dismissed for taking the beer from Mr. Watlington's brewhouse.</p>
               <p>What did you do when you was turned away from being patrol? - Work at my business.</p>
               <p>Did you work for any master? - I did not use to do any work at all then.</p>
               <p>Have you never made any application on the subject of this business, that you could put an end to it? - Never in my life.</p>

               <p>I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 14th of September me, and Ryland, Jealous, Townsend, and Allingham went to Royer's house, in the City-gardens; I understood it was a back room: Ryland went up; and I stopped on the second step from the bottom some time; when I got up stairs Ryland and Allingham were stooping; I touched Ryland, and said, what are you doing? he said, I see them at work; I desired him to stand away; he moved his head away, and I looked over him, and I saw three people moving and stirring, doing something; but what I cannot say; they were the three prisoners; their backs were then to me: I kicked the door a little open, and the two prisoners, Ivory and Smith set their shoulders against it, to prevent its being opened; it was opened in less than a minute; and I went in, and pushed in Ryland and Allingham: the first thing I observed was a man getting out of the window; I saw him very plainly getting out.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of seeing him, so as to know him again? - No, Sir: Townsend came in, and I said, there is a man got out of the window; he got out, and said, I see him: I do not know more than what Townsend said: some of the glass was broke; and when the man was brought back again his hand was very much cut: he was brought back by Jealous and by Townsend, I believe, in less than five minutes; that was Royer, the landlord: here is the cloth he wiped his hand with when he came back (produces a cloth bloody); we secured the men that were left, and made them sit down; they were all stripped, and their shirt sleeves tucked up; their hands were nearly the colour of this glove, which they use some times (produces a green old glove): on the board, in the front of the window, was this six-pence, not finished.</p>
               <p>Court. They are pieces of metal? - Yes. Upon that board lay a parcel of pieces of cork, more than three, and these three pair of pliers, and a great quantity of scowering paper, such as this; I said to Jealous, there is a strange smell of fire, and there is none; and there was a pail near half full, and the colour of the liquor was green; and there was the smell of a slow ugly fire; the pail was as near the end of the bench as it could be: I turned round to my left hand; there was a little stove, made of bricks, that could be made and pulled down directly; I put my hand on it; the bricks were so hot that I could not bear to keep my hand there; and there was a parcel of column, (what they dry malt with) which I understand these people use instead of charcoal: there were also several little barrels of sand, with several bags of this sort; something made out of rotten stone, very offensive smelling things; the sand was white sand, such as is used in casting; and several parcels of this sort of paper, and things, such as they black them with, to make them look like those in circulation; there is blacking in those pipkins now, and here are the dies, and here are two things that Mr. Clarke can describe to you better than I can; but he says, they are the things that they turn the money in the lathe with; these were in the pocket of Smith: these clothes were all out of the room, on the bannisters of the stairs; and when they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270060"/>begged for their cloaths these were in the pocket of the cloaths that Smith owned.</p>
               <p>When Royer returned did he claim any part of the cloathing as his? - Yes; and said it was his house repeatedly.</p>
               <p>(Produces several things, which he said Clarke would describe.)</p>
               <p>What became of the pickle in the pan? - Jealous brought away a pan full of it.</p>
               <p>How long was it before Royer was brought back into the house? - A very little time.</p>
               <p>How many of you were in the room during the time of making this search? - We were all in the room at times: there was another Macmanus besides me; he was in the room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Macmanus, among the things that you found, you did not find any lathe? - There was part of a lathe in the room.</p>
               <p>Not a compleat one? - Not a compleat one.</p>
               <p>I believe you have not produced any files? - I believe there are some; I am positive I saw one or two; but whether they were brought away or not I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did you find any flasks? - No.</p>
               <p>No moulds? - No.</p>
               <p>Then the sand could have been of no use for casting, without the flasks or moulds? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you find any crucible? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did you find any jet? - I took this out of Royer's pocket, and he said it was physick; this I took out of Royer's pocket; there is good money in it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I admit that no casting could be carried on there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then I shall not pursue this examination.</p>

I know No. 10: it is directly facing our garden; there is just room for a carriage between: there is a very high pale to our garden: on the 14th of September I found a cloth with some six-pences in it; I cannot say how many; I gave them to this man (Townsend) immediately; I was about forty yards from the house, at work: I found this about three yards lower down than over against the window, not one yard from the garden pales: I picked it up about half past twelve.</p>

               <p>I live next door to the prisoner Royer, at No. 11. I remember this bustle the 14th of September: I saw a cloth come from the house, and it alighted in Mr. Fuller's garden; I cannot speak to its appearance: I understood it to be Royer's house: I have seen one of them.</p>

               <p>I am a carpenter and joiner. I received information that the prisoners were carrying on this illegal practice: I went to the house, and I went up stairs, and looked through the crevice of the door; the door was very wide on the box of the lock, and I could have shoved my hand edgeways; they were all three standing with their shirt sleeves up, found a board; we directly made a rush at the door, and Royer snatches up a cloth with some silver, and threw it into the garden opposite, and made his escape out of the window, that I saw; I directly ran down stairs after him, and Jealous with me; we fetched him out of the two pair of stairs, No. 12: we brought him back; I saw all of them round the board, rubbing; and when we forced the door, Royer took up the cloth with some silver in it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How long have you been acquainted with Ryland? - Not long.</p>
               <p>How long? - Not above three or four months.</p>
               <p>Have you been out with him often? - No, Sir, never; this was the first time.</p>
               <p>What business are you? - A carpenter and joiner.</p>
               <p>Who do you work for? - For one Mr. Rice; he keeps an iron foundry, on Clerkenwell-Green; I have been at work there this morning, and about three weeks.</p>
               <p>Who did you work for before? - One Mr. Butler, in Silver-street, near Wood-street; that was directly; as soon as I left him, I went to Mr. Rice's.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. I believe, for the space of twenty years, you have had much experience of this kind of offence? - Yes; I have been called upon different times to report the different progress.</p>
               <p>First of all, you was at Bow-street, I believe, when Jealous produced this pan, with some thing in it? - I was there, when he produced a pan with some thing in it, but whether that is the pan, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Jealous. That is the pan.</p>
               <p>Clarke. It appeared from the look and the taste, to be aqua fortis and water.</p>
               <p>Why is that necessary? - In the first instance, after the six-pences are prepared making ready to put into aqua fortis, it is put into aqua fortis; after that they throw it into water, and from the silver, and the strength of the aqua fortis, it makes it into a green pickle; then afterwards, by rubbing it with sand and water, the white is left on the surface, drawn by the aqua fortis; it is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270062"/>impossible for me to tell what the metal is, but I suppose there is silver amongst it; if there is any silver the effect will be to expand the silver appearance over the surface.</p>
               <p>Then aqua fortis and water is the necessary ingredient to produce that effect? - Aqua fortis itself; but it is reduced by water, and every bit of metal which is put into aqua fortis, it immediately turns it green; and so, by constant putting it into aqua fortis and water, it turns it green.</p>
               <p>Then what was produced to you by Jealous, was what was necessary to produce this appearance? - It wanted the aqua fortis; it has been used, and put into this.</p>
               <p>What is the use of that cork? - After they are cast, they are rubbed with a file, and then they are smoothed with scowering-paper from the casting; them pliers may be used for several things, but they are put into them pliers in order to rub; that glove they may use for twenty things; it is not immediately necessary; the backing is in order, after they are made bright from this colouring, they put it in, in order to deaden the bright white, that they may have a better colour.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you looked at those pieces of metal which have been produced? - I have looked at some.</p>
               <p>Are they the genuine current coin of the kingdom, or are they base metal? - They are base metal; these are ready for circulation, and they are base coin, no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>From the view of these things, are they what is necessary to carry on that part of the process for colouring? - No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If I understand you, the liquor that was produced to you by Jealous, was not aqua fortis? - It was not.</p>
               <p>And you said, this appeared to be a pickle, produced by throwing some metal that had been put into aqua fortis into water? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This pickle, of itself, is not strong enough to throw the whiteness to the surface? - I should not suppose it would; whoever coloured this must have had aqua fortis.</p>
               <p>Therefore, the produce of this room, does not afford all that was necessary for the purpose of colouring? - Aqua fortis was necessary to be superadded, not a doubt of it: it would not do in that situation.</p>

               <p>I am one of the moniers of the mint; (Looks at the six-pences.) In my judgment, there were not coined at the Tower.</p>
               <p>Are they like the current coin of the kingdom? - Exactly the same colour and shape.</p>

He said, that Allingham and he were the only persons that could do any prejudice, and Allingham he could wind round his finger; and as they had not been sworn at Bow-street, he could keep Allingham out of the way, and he pitied Mrs. Royer, having a family of his own.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I will not ask you any questions.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Ryland. Did you go to Mrs. Royer's house on the 23d of September? - I am not sure it was so late as that; I did go there; Mr. Macmanus desired me to give a call, to see whether I could find the flasks or not; upon which, the very day before I went, I saw the person that gave us the information; I went there in order to look for the flasks.</p>

               <p>Then you will not venture to swear positively that you did not say so? - I will not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. What did you say to Mrs. Royer about the reward? - I said, I heard there was one hundred and fifty pounds offered, and I told her; says I, Mrs. Royer, if it was in my power to do you any service, it would be a pleasure.</p>
               <p>Did not you appoint to meet Mrs. Royer that evening? - I did.</p>

               <p>Did not you offer yourself to this poor fellow's wife, as a person that would stay out of the way? - No; I said, I had a job of goods to move, and it was a chance of a thousand, if I could be in the way.</p>
               <p>Did not you give her to understand, that if she could make it worth your while, you would stay out of the way? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Macmanus. I do not know that I desired him to go; but I talked to him the day before, the 23d, and I said, I am very sure their flasks must be in the house somewhere; says he, I shall go there soon; very well, says I.</p>

               <p>(The Case opened by Mr. Garrow.)</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordships. Gentlemen of the Jury. I am instructed, on the part of the parishioners of Enfield, to state the circumstances by which it is intended, on their part, to submit the case of the prisoner to your consideration, whether the finding of the Coroner's Jury is warranted by evidence; you will agree, that those who come forward with this prosecution, have but done their duty; the King has lost a subject, and we all of us have lost a fellow citizen; and whenever that case occurs, the most solemn and full investigation of the facts certainly ought to take place; besides the example that such a prosecution will afford, in a neighbourhood, in which I am sorry to say, such an example is wanted, will conduce to good order and government: on the part of those that prosecute, I am directed to state to you, that they have not, as they ought not to have, any wish that any thing but justice should take place; if you are of opinion that the unfortunate woman, whose death forms the subject of this enquiry, came to that death by the brutality of her husband, undoubtedly fit it is that he should suffer some punishment. Gentlemen, the present prosecution does not impute to the prisoner the crime of wilful murder; it only charges him with having unlawfully and feloniously killed his wife; and it is fit I should explain to you, subject to the correction I may receive,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270067"/>what the distinction is that has led to this prosecution. Gentlemen, in order to constitute the offence of murder, you know very well that it is necessary, not only that a death should have taken place, but that it should be occasioned by a malice operating by the hand that gave the blow, either express or implied, either an actual malice against the deceased, or a general malice against all mankind; the general malice the law has defined to be, the unlawful killing of another without particular malice, which may happen in more ways than one; which may happen by a sudden provocation from heat, or involuntarily, without intending death, in the perpetration of an unlawful act: now, the sort of case to be imputed to the prisoner, to come within that definition, is this, that in the act of a brutal, inhuman, and unmanly attack on his wife, not intending to kill her, he has given her an unlucky blow, which has caused her death. Gentlemen, the prisoner, you will collect from his appearance, was one of the lower orders of society, and he and his wife lived alone, and therefore you will not expect that there should be any positive evidence of the blow that was given; it is to be collected from circumstances; and those are principally from the declarations of the deceased. Gentlemen, I ought not to conceal from you, that I feel considerable difficulty on that subject; because, the rule of law, on admission of evidence of that sort, I take to be this, that the declarations of the deceased can only be received, if they were made under the impression, at the time of making them, that the party was near her end; if the declarations should turn out to your satisfaction, under the impression, that she was shortly to turn her back on this world and all its prospects, and come to an account before a more awful tribunal than any this world affords, then the declarations may be received; if, on the other hand, they should turn out to be only the casual conversation of a person in ill health, or the hasty expressions of anger, on the part of the wife, undoubtedly it would be unsafe to receive them: there is another difficulty, that is, among the declarations that I see scattered up and down in the depositions taken before the Coroner; there is a great deal of contradiction; I observe, that a very careful, very attentive, and very honourable member of society, to whom the publick are on this occasion much indebted, a clergyman in the neighbourhood, seemed to be aware of the difficulty, and he very sensibly, as it was his duty, put the question to her, whether, at that time, she apprehended that she was in a state that she should not live; and the account that he gave before the Coroner of her answer, was this, that she spoke in so low and so weak a state, that he was unable to ascertain what her opinion was; that all he could collect from her was, the repetition of the word peppermint, the poor creature being very much addicted to that liquor; that was the only thing he could make out: but I observe, that she said to several other witnesses, who may be called to you, that the report was not true; at other times she desired it might not be mentioned; and once she said, in the presence of her husband, that it was not true; she said it was a false report, and she desired no more might be said on the subject. Gentlemen, it does not occur to my recollection, that on the fact of this man having given her any blow and kick, which could have occasioned her death, there is any other evidence; she was taken violently ill, and the neighbours knowing the terms upon which they lived, suspected some thing of that sort; she to some of them complained he had kicked her; the woman had had a former husband, and had had a son by him, who, meeting the prisoner, and asking him to go some where, the prisoner said he had business enough at home, for his wife and he had had some words, and he had given her kick, and he supposed she would die; but, supposing that to be true, did that, or did it not, occasion her death, because of that too you must be satisfied. Now, gentlemen, on that subject, the evidence appears to me to stand in this way: the woman was certainly ill, the persons who attended her were not very skilful, I mean the neighbours and people of the same condition, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270068"/>they supposed that she had, by retching, brought up a great quantity of blood, and that the complaint she made of her belly and side, was occasioned by the kick; there was, however, medical assistance called in; two very respectable and eminent men in the neighbourhood attended her, and one of the gentlemen, I think, saw that, which the neighbours supposed was blood, and it appeared at the time to be bile and not blood; he treated her as having a bilious complaint, and in the end, the woman died. To be sure, here one cannot but lament, that after death, in a case where there had been a suspicion, some more care, some further observation, had not been made on the body after her death, because it does seem to me, that it might have been ascertained, with some tolerable degree of certainty, whether violence, or a bilious complaint, was the occasion of her death, and every body would have been satisfied, and the purposes of publick justice would have been best conducted; therefore, whether this woman came to her death by any violence on the part of her husband, will depend on the testimony of these gentlemen. I am bound to state to you, that their evidence seems to negative it; they (I understand it is a perfect apology for them) they meant right, but they were not informed of any dispute. Gentlemen, the demands of publick justice have brought this case before you: those who prosecute, ask nothing but justice at your hands: if the examinations satisfy you, that this man killed his wife, you will confirm the finding of the Coroner's Jury, by saying so; he knows best whether he was guilty or not; and it will be an awful example to him, and others in his neighbourhood, if he is conscious of having so treated her, he had better employ the remainder of his days in making the only atonement he can to society, and to his God, for the ferocity of his temper. Gentlemen, I will proceed to call the witnesses, and I am sure you will determine the case in such a manner as to give universal satisfaction.</p>

            , a sawyer; I knew the prisoner and his wife; I saw her before she died, about a week; she sent for me; I thought her in a very dangerous state; she said, Cooper had murdered her, that he had killed her, that he had done for her now! I cannot say how long she lived after that; it was some days; she died in my arms; the prisoner continued there till he was taken into custody, which was two days after.</p>
               <p>The Rev. Mr. COTTRELL sworn.</p>
               <p>I am Rector of Hadleigh; on the Friday, under the impression of a report, that she was ill treated by her husband, I went to see her, in the way of my profession, as a clergyman, and also to enquire into the facts of this rumour; I found her in a very languishing state, that I thought she could not live; I sat down by her bed side, and told her what I had heard, that her husband had stamped upon her and kicked her; her reply was, it was not true that he had stamped upon her, for he had only kicked her in the side; at the same time she put down the bedcloaths, and put her hand as if she wished me to examine the side, which I had no desire to do, and declined it; I then asked her, whether she thought the present state in which she lay, was in consequence of her ill treatment; she spoke in so low voice that I could not make out any thing but some thing about peppermint, and a pain in her bowels; I asked her, if she was in a good<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270069"/>state of heath? her reply was, she never was in a better state of health for a long time past, nor better able to do a day's work; I then asked her, respecting another circumstance, of the brutal treatment from her husband, which I had heard, which was, that the night but one after this first affray, that she had escaped from his bed, from an idea that he had a stick there, with which he had intended to murder her, and had lain under the stairs all night; she said, that was not true that she had lain there all night, she had lain there only part of the night; a gentlemen present asked her, if her husband had his shoes on, when he kicked her? she said, she could not tell, he was partly dressed and partly undressed; in the course of my conversation with her, on the dangerous state she was in, and the short time she had to live, and that she ought to make her peace with God, and her own conscience, she said, she was sure her husband did not intend to murder her, and she forgave him with all her heart; I had no doubt, from the state of her pulse, that she was dying.</p>
               <p>And you impressed that idea upon her? - I did.</p>
               <p>So that you have no doubt but her conversation was with that impression? - Certainly, Sir; it was one object of my attendance upon her, that the fact might be ascertained; I beg leave to mention a circumstance, with respect to the body not being opened; I had it much at heart, not only with respect to the prisoner, but with respect to the community; I thought the best means to ascertain it, would be to have the body opened, and the two medical gentlemen who attended her, were so obliging as to promise to come at an early hour to open the body, and we went to the house, and when we got there, the prisoner put himself between us and the stairs, and vowed by all that was sacred, that nobody should touch her; I went to get a warrant for his apprehension, and it was extreme hot weather, and the nature of her disorder was such, as put the body in a state of putrefaction; but, I believe, the gentlemen I applied to, very properly thought that it would not give a sanction to opening the body.</p>

               <p>I am a son of the deceased; I saw the prisoner on Saturday, the 4th of September, and that day fortnight that she died, I met the prisoner; says I, Cooper, what are not you at work to day? he said, no, I have work enough on my hands, for your mother and I have had some words, and I have kicked her, I believe she will die; and he desired me to get Mr. Rumbold to go to her, for Mr. Wilson would not come; I went to Mr. Rumbold, and he was out; and I went to Mr. Wilson, and said, it was a pity; and he said, that the prisoner had never been with him about it; I never saw her down stairs after this; after she took to her bed, she considered herself as a dying woman; she said, Cooper had killed her, at last he had done for her he had killed her! As to her own sense of danger of going out of the world, I do not apprehend she took much account about.</p>
               <p>- WILSON sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon at Barnet; I was employed by Cater to attend his mother; accordingly I went immediately; I found her exceedingly ill; her complaint then was chiefly confined to her bowels; this was on the 4th of September; I sent her some medicines for it, and I visited her again the next day; I then found her better; I attended her three days after, and found her much better: I looked upon her disorder to be a bilious complaint, which was then very prevalent; I was there the day before she died; she made no different complaint; all her complaint then seemed to be in her bowels; the second day I visited her, her daughter produced me some thing, which they supposed was blood; I looked at that, and I looked upon it to be nothing but a bile, which she had brought up.</p>
               <p>Now, from the best information and judgment you have of this subject, what do you think occasioned her death? - I look upon entirely to be from a bilious disorder.</p>
               <p>Have you any reason to think that her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270070"/>death was occasioned either by force or a kick? - After the daughter told me her ribs were broke, I asked her such questions as would have enabled me to know; and I looked on the report entirely as a drunken piece of work, and paid no attention to it; I have no reason to think otherwise, but that the bowel complaint was the cause of her death.</p>

               <p>What appeared to you to be the nature of her complaint? - My evidence is nothing but a counterpart of my father's; I have no doubt but she died of a pain in her bowels; I was led to examine her side, on a report that she had been kicked; on examination I did not find the least appearance of violence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I have many more witnesses, but I do not think it necessary to call them.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury. The most we can say about this, is, that the parish have done very right; it is necessary that enquiries should be made, in order that Jurors might find a verdict; that being done, it is impossible to say that this woman received her death from any kick or blow, which that man gave her; he may have behaved to her very brutally, and very much unlike a husband and a man; but we are now trying, whether her death proceeded from such behaviour; the expression that she used, that he had murdered her and killed her! you all know that is an expression very common with low people; but, after the opinion of these two medical gentlemen, that she died in consequence of a bowel complaint, and that there was no appearance of a blow or symptoms of it, under such circumstances, I should think you would deem it improper to find a man guilty of this offence, and therefore, I presume you will acquit him; if you are not satisfied about it, we will enquire further.</p>

            , I am perfectly satisfied with the verdict the Jury have given; because, according to the rules of law, I think there was not evidence to reach you; at the same time, my conscience tells me, that your conduct has been by no means such as intitles you to stand well in the estimation of any man in this Court; I am afraid your conduct has been extremely brutal and violent to this poor woman; whether you have or have not been the cause of her death, is between God and your own conscience; but such has been your conduct, that it is fit I should tell you, you may think yourself extremely fortunate, and that you owe a great deal to the strict justice of your country, but you have not shewn her that tenderness or that justice; she is gone to another world; and I advise you now, before you meet her again in that world, that you prepare yourself, by a very serious examination of your own conduct, and by that contrition which can alone intitle you to pardon in another world, though you have been acquitted in this; I advise you very seriously to apply yourself to that, as the only reparation you can make to this unfortunate woman, as well as to the publick.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. These stuff shoes are mine; I made some part of them: I was teaching a young lad to work: I had not sold them: they were made for a servant in Gerrard-street: the three pair of leather shoes are mine; they were for sale in my shop; and I made some part of those leather shoes myself: these boots I can only tell by the man's work; I had not sold them: the man only made this one pair; that man is gone into the country: the lowest value of the boots is sixteen shillings, and the shoes, one pair, is two shillings and six-pence, and another pair two shillings and six-pence.</p>

               <p>Court to prosecutor. Is it true that this woman came at different times for shoes? - She came twice.</p>

I was alarmed, and went up to the garret with the landlady: I knocked several times; nobody answered; I broke open the door: the man was laying with his breeches on, pretending to be asleep: the prisoner had his breeches and stockings on; and the lead was in another bed in the next room.</p>

               <p>There was nothing else taken at that time? - No; the maid was in the cellar at the same time; the man did not go into the cellar; he leaned against the post, and reached round his arm; the maid must have been within two or three yards of him.</p>
               <p>Is she here? - No; I do not know what she was doing; she made no complaint.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner Carter's Counsel. You said very fairly and candidly, that the hay bands were the perquisite of this man? - They were so.</p>
               <p>I believe you are not very particular about their taking sweepings? - I never suffer any loose hay, only hay bands.</p>

               <p>Did you see the man, or any part of him. in the room? - I cannot justly say: I could not see him absolutely, because it was in the dark, and the window was open.</p>
               <p>It was so dark that you had no view of his person, then? - No, Sir, I could not swear to his person.</p>
               <p>Did you see the man, or any part of the man, within the room? - No, Sir, I can swear that the man gave the second jirk to the window.</p>

               <p>Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes; the night that this affair happened, it seems he brought the prosecutrix to my door; she was very much disguised in liquor; and the woman that was in my place led her in, and she said, she wanted a lodging, and her things dropped with wet, very wet she was; I looked at her, and saw she had no cap on nor handkerchief, nor nothing, and her head was very bare; I said to the two women that were in my house, mind and take notice what she has got on; one of the women I keep by the week; I give her a shilling a week, victuals, drink, washing, and lodging, to do about the place, because I am not able to do it myself; and the other woman lodges with me.</p>
               <p>Then that this first woman is a servant? - Yes, Sir; I said to the two women, look in what a condition she is in; and Mrs. Adams sat down, and swore very wickedly, in a very wicked manner, how she would have some gin; and I seeing her very much disguised, I said, you had better not have any more; with that she took out a few halfpence and a sixpence out of her pocket, and she said, I will have some gin, and I could not pacify her till she had had half a pint; I said, it is needless for you to have any, for none of us can drink any, for I never drink any; in a little while after she said she would lay there, and we were but just moved into the house; I had but two beds, because I keep a broker's shop, and a cloaths shop besides, and we put the two women to lay there for safety; so I said, we have never a bed for you here, but if you come to our other house I can let you lay there by yourself; and I and the other young woman took her down to the other house, to let her lay there: and I said, now will you go to bed? and she said, no, not till I please, and she swore very wickedly: says she, I will not go out till you have me in the scouts: says I, I do not know what you mean! says she, I have lost my tail and cap, and I will charge you, you have got it; and I said, I can bring witness that you had it not when you came to my place.</p>
               <p>When did she leave your house? - That same night, she was led out.</p>
               <p>At what hour? - Why, I believe, to the best of my knowledge, it might be about half past eleven.</p>
               <p>What time did she come? - She came, I believe, about ten: I think it was, to the best of my knowledge, but I cannot take upon me to say exactly the time, but I think it was to the best of my memory.</p>
               <p>Had she any think else, besides gin? - No, Sir, I would not let her.</p>
               <p>Did any body drink any of the gin with her? - No; Sir, we did not drink any, only the young woman that had helped her out of my place; she drank one glass, but I would not let her have any more: I knew the prisoner before, by seeing him about with sheeps heads.</p>
               <p>Are you any way related to the prisoner? - No, Sir, no more than you are.</p>

On Wednesday, the 22d of September, I was in the shop about four o'clock in the afternoon: the prisoner came into the shop, and desired to be shewn some plain muslins; she sat down in the front shop, near the partition that divides the front and the back shop:

            , our apprentice, shewed her some plain muslins; soon after she came in, came in two other women, desiring to be shewn some purple and white callico; I ordered a bell to be rang for some person to come down and shew them; a sister of mine came down, who is not used to the shop; I ordered her to shew them ladies some purple and white callicoes, and I would tell her the price; the women answered they were not in a hurry: our young man of the name of Bonum, desired them to walk into the back shop, and took them from my sister; very soon after I was going into the back shop to get change for a bank note, having done with the customers I had been engaged with; I went to a desk at the end of the back-shop, and I saw the prisoner walking gently up to the end of the back shop, on the left hand side; she turned up a wrapper in which there were several quantities of clear-starched muslins, and muslins not starched; she put her hand between the fold of one of them that was not starched; she then turned round and looked about her; I was about two yards from the counter and from the prisoner, and elevated about three feet from the ground; I passed her to the desk; she then turned round and

             the muslin with her right hand off the counter, which she had before looked at; she turned quickly round, and walked as fast as she could down the shop; I saw the muslin hang by her side at the distance of two yards from the place where she took it; I ran after her as quick as I could; but in getting down from the desk, I lost sight of her for a moment; I overtook her in the front shop, near the place where she first sat; I took her by the arm, and I said, give me the muslin that you have just now stolen; she said, muslin! I do not know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270103"/>what you mean, and immediately began unpinning her clothes in the shop; just at the time that she began to unpin her clothes, two women that were in the back shop, and the only persons that were in the back shop, attempted to get between me and her; I said, she could not be so indecent as to strip in the shop; when these women attempted to get between me and her, I took one of them by the arm, and said, these women belong to you; I did not hear the answer; and at that moment the prisoner got up to walk up stairs to be searched, for she had sat down on the stool she had before been sitting on; I ran down, and returned up stairs; I left her in the company of two ladies and my own servant; I left her a very few minutes; I returned, and nothing having been found, I searched her myself, and did not find any thing: the prisoner then desired to be left alone with me in the back shop, and she was; she then proposed paying for the muslins that were lost! for Mr. Champney had searched, and missed two pieces, which he said he had seen half an hour before; she then said, madam, I am willing to pay you for the muslins, which the gentleman says come to fourteen pounds, or any other recompence; I said, I wanted no recompence, I wanted my muslins; she said she did not know where they were; I said, then you are willing to deposit the value of the money, which appears to be fourteen pounds, which shall be returned to you tomorrow, if the muslins are returned, and no questions asked; she said, I will if I can, but I do not know; I then said, I must consult Mr. Champney; and in the presence of the prisoner, he positively refused accepting any compromise; Mr. Champney went out, and returned, and said there was no alternative, he must take her to the Compter; she then took out a watch which appeared like gold, and I think she said was gold, and said to us both, I will leave this also, if you will let me go.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. You will recollect this person at the bar is of the same sex with yourself, and her life is the consequence of this enquiry? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Besides that, she meets this charge boldly, and comes in to take her trial? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This was on the Wednesday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have already told me that your shop was full of customers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had brought down a sister not used to serve in the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your customers that you had served, were waiting for your change? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At that time, likewise, you had a great deal of business? - Mr. Champney had four customers, and I had three.</p>
               <p>You was willing to get this change as expeditiously as possible? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>You was in the back shop, and in a visible situation? - Not visible.</p>
               <p>This person might have seen you go there? - I do not know that; I passed on one side of the counter; she was on the other side, and was sitting; I passed by her side; I had a bill to make at the desk; I had been selling some articles; I had then to unlock a desk to take out some money, and to reckon the change.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the prisoner with a large handkerchief in her hand at that time? - I do not recollect; I am very sure she had not, because I saw both her hands; I saw one hand turn up the wrapper, and the other was under the muslin.</p>
               <p>Did not you see a cambrick handkerchief in her hand at that time? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You will not swear there was not? - I will not.</p>
               <p>You overtook this lady near the partition, when you came up to her? - Yes; she had not passed any other people, but the two women that were in the back shop.</p>
               <p>When you saw these two women, did you openly say, that any person might hear you, you must be concerned? - I said it as loud as I do now; there were a good many customers in the shop.</p>
               <p>These two persons were gone, though you had given your public intimation of your opinion? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The lady immediately expressed a great<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270104"/>deal of surprize at the charge? - She said, muslins! I do not know what you mean, and sat down on the stool.</p>
               <p>How many persons have you serving in your shop? - Mr. Champney, myself, a young man, a porter, and an apprentice; the porter never serves, but he was in the shop: it is probable all these people had been in the shop; I do not recollect whether I served or not.</p>
               <p>The lady was then taken up stairs, and thoroughly searched, and nothing found upon her? - She was.</p>
               <p>Did not the prisoner say, very possibly you have lost them, or have disposed of them, not knowing it; I will leave the value of the muslins with you, and if you do find them you shall return me the money? - No such words.</p>
               <p>Now I tell you that Mr. Dunn is here, who heard it, and I shall certainly call him? - You are very right to call any body; there was no creature in the back shop, nor did I at that time know that any creature was near.</p>
               <p>Your servant was listening, and heard every word? - What she said was said in the way I first stated it.</p>
               <p>Was it proposed that fourteen pounds should be left, supposing you had mislaid the muslins? - I did not hear it.</p>
               <p>Nay, this is a very important part of the conversation; will you swear that did not pass between you and the prisoner in any part of the conversation? - I will swear it.</p>
               <p>How came you to tell me that you said, then you are willing to deposit the value of the muslins? - I did, in answer to what she had before observed; it was merely repeating what she said; she said, I will give you the money; and the gentleman said, they cost fourteen pounds; in answer to that I said, then you are willing to deposit the value of the muslins, which shall be returned to you to-morrow, if the muslins are sent back, and no questions asked: there was never any idea of the muslins being mislaid, because I was positive as to their being seen.</p>
               <p>There was never any consent on your part to take this fourteen pounds? - Not on my part, any further than as she said; I said, then I must consult Mr. Champney.</p>
               <p>Now I ask you, whether fourteen guineas were not actually received from the prisoner, and fourteen shillings returned in change, as the residue above the fourteen pounds? - There was not: I will explain that: Mr. Hodson, a neighbour of ours, a wholesale linen draper, was sent for; Mr. Champney had about two days before bought these very muslins of him: he understood the loss was fourteen pounds; and he said, he thought there could be no harm in his taking the money, supposing she returned the muslins, or gave up the parties concerned; she took out her purse and laid down fourteen guineas; she said, the gentleman says the muslins come to only fourteen pounds, therefore I must have change; Mr. Hodson asked me to give her change; I said, no; I will not; I have nothing to do with this good lady; he gave me a guinea, and I gave him the full change; the whole of the money lay on the counter; it was never taken up by any person; then Mr. Champney returned immediately, and said, there was no alternative, he must take her to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Has not your husband told you, that he went out to ask advice on that business? - I do not recollect that he has told me.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell the magistrate so? - He returned and said, there was no alternative.</p>
               <p>What did he go out for? - I do not know; I suppose to ask advice: I asked him if he had seen any person on the business? he said, no; he, himself, said, he could do nothing; and, I believe, before the observation, he said, my dear, I can do nothing in the business, for it is compounding felony.</p>
               <p>How long after you had given the information before the magistrate was it that the person at the bar was bailed? - I believe it was that day week.</p>
               <p>You say, she came in before the other persons? - Yes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Wednesday, the 22d of September last, I lost two pieces of muslin, each piece containing twenty yards; one cost me six pounds, the other eight pounds; they were in a wrapper with some other muslins, laying in the left hand corner of the shop: about three in the afternoon I had occasion to take a piece from that wrapper, not having any of that sort of muslin in the cut wrapper, I took a piece from there, and that was the piece which cost me eight pounds; I left in the wrapper the piece cost six pounds, with the other muslins, and threw the wrapper over them; I looked at each piece at time; I took the piece of eight pounds out to the opposite counter; I shewed it to some ladies; it was not approved, and I left it on the opposite counter; the piece of six pounds I left in the wrapper covered over; every customer that was in the shop at the time we missed the muslin, except two, continued in the shop; except the two women that were in the back shop, that Mrs. Champney had suspicions of.</p>
               <p>Was you present at time Mrs. Robinson was examined at Guildhall? - I was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was that examination taken in writing? - I believe not.</p>
               <p>What passed? - On being charged in my shop with having taken a piece of muslin, she denied it: on being examined, no muslins were found upon her; when she came down stairs, she requested to be left alone with Mrs. Champney, which I objected to: the prisoner offered to pay me for the muslin in the back shop; I refused; she afterwards offered to give me the value of the muslins and a watch, to let her go; this I refused, and took her to the counter: at Guildhall she said, she walked up to the further end of shop, where we charged her with taking the muslins, and that she took a white handkerchief out of her pocket, in her hand, which she said, she supposed Mrs. Champney had mistaken for a piece of muslin: she said, she saw on the counter some pretty patterns of purple and white cotton.</p>
               <p>What stock had you on the counter at that time? - There was the wrapper containing the muslins, there was a large piece of printed cotton, and printed callicoes.</p>


               <p>Were those callicoes folded the right or wrong side outwards? - The wrong side outwards.</p>
               <p>Were there any patterns of purple and white on that counter? - No, there were not.</p>
               <p>At the time you took her did she give you her purse? - At the time she was charged, before I took her took her to the Compter, she did: she said, her name was Robinson, No. 5, Corporation-row.</p>
               <p>Did you hear her say any thing about her address afterwards, or her name? - As to her name, I did not; but at Guildhall, on her examination, when she was admitted to bail by Alderman Watson, she said, she was a married woman, and lived in Bowling-green-lane.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If I understand you right, the muslins contained in the wrapper had been brought into your stock a few days before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So recently that you had not had opportunity to put your shop mark on? - I had not done it.</p>
               <p>It was at the commencement of the mourning for the late Duke of Cumberland. One of the pieces that you lost, you had yourself removed from that wrapper to another counter? - I had.</p>
               <p>Therefore the piece which the present indictment supposes this woman to have stolen, must have been taken one from the wrapper and the other from some other part of the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you within hearing of what Mrs. Champney said to this woman at first? - I think I was: upon that this woman sat herself down on a seat where she was.</p>
               <p>She was proceeding to open her clothes in a way that your wife thought not so proper? - She was.</p>
               <p>While she was up stairs the two other persons went away? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You said,</p>
               <p>"she offered to pay me for the muslins that I had lost, which I refused,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270106"/>and took her to the Compter?" - No; she offered to pay me for the muslins that I had lost: she was some little time in the shop; during that period I wanted to find the two women that we thought were connected with her.</p>
               <p>Then you went out of the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long might you be gone? - Not ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Did you go to Mr. Hodson, your neighbour? - No; I had gone in there before.</p>
               <p>Did you desire him to come to your house? - I think I did: when I went out I went to Mr. Medcalfe, an attorney, on Dowgate-hill.</p>
               <p>We know him as a very respectable and a very able man. Did you mention to your lady when you returned, that you had been at Mr. Medcalfe's? - I do not think I did till afterwards.</p>
               <p>You mentioned that you had been, and the conversation that passed between you? - He was not at home.</p>
               <p>What did you go to Dowgate-hill for? - I had some time ago been unfortunate, and went to consult Mr. Medcalfe what was best to do in the circumstance.</p>
               <p>Did not you go to him to know whether you could safely accept the proposal of fourteen pounds? - No; I did not.</p>
               <p>That you swear positively? - Positively.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what you said when you came back? - I believe I said Mr. Medcalfe was not at home: I consulted nobody else.</p>
               <p>Did not you say, I am advised that there is no alternative; it must not be taken; you must go to the Compter? - I believe I might say to the prisoner, that there was no alternative, and that I was so advised.</p>
               <p>What was the other alternative that was expected? - Giving up the two women that were suspected.</p>
               <p>Was not it this, to take what perhaps there is no great moral guilt in doing, to take the price of your goods and let her go, or to take the money? - The object was to take the other two women; for had I been inclined to take the money I might.</p>
               <p>Did you expect to find the other two women were to be found at the office? - No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Did not you see fourteen guineas laying on the counter? - I was no nearer the counter than I am to you.</p>
               <p>Did you recollect how the guineas came there? - I understood that it was some money which the prisoner wanted to pay.</p>
               <p>Did not the prisoner say, that as to producing your muslin, that was a thing she could not undertake for, but the price of them you was welcome to take? - She wanted to pay for the muslins to go about her business.</p>
               <p>Was not it put to her, that if she sent back the muslins, she should have her money? - Not by me.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that it was stated to the prisoner, that if the next day she would bring the two pieces of muslin no question would be asked of the person bringing them, and she should have back the fourteen guineas? - I know it from information; I knew that when she offered to pay for the muslin: Mr. Hodson upon my refusing to take the money, had a great wish to retain the money till the muslins could be produced, or the other women given up; and in that sort of way I was informed that proposal had been made.</p>
               <p>Was not the answer of the prisoner to that proposition, that she could not undertake to bring back your muslins, but that the money you were welcome to, for she desired to go about her business? - She wished to give me the money and watch to lei her go; she said, she did not know that she could bring the muslins.</p>
               <p>The woman was since admitted to bail by a worthy magistrate, and here she comes to take her trial? - Yes, Sir.</p>

               <p>Court to Mr. Champney. What is the distance between the two counters where those two pieces of muslin were? - The width of the shop between the counters is about two yards, as I suppose, where I left the muslins, was four or five yards from each other.</p>
               <p>And they were on two counters? - Yes.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270123"/>Mr. HODGSON</p>
               <p>RESPECTFULLY returns his most grateful Thanks to his Employers and Pupils, for the Preference they have thought proper to give to his Mode of teaching and writing SHORT-HAND, which he flatters himself is at once as concise and correct as any other System; he continues teaching in four Hours, by four Lessons, the whole necessary instructions in this much approved Art. He also takes Trials and Arguments with the utmost Care, which are copied so expeditiously as to be sent home the same Evening, if required.</p>
               <p>A new Edition of his TREATISE ON SHORT-HAND, AND CONTRACTIONS adapted to every System, with Copper-plates, is just reprinted, Price 5 s. with considerable Improvements; and Sold by J. Walmsley, Chancery-lane, and also by Bladon, Brown, Clarke, Egerton, Fourdrinier, Butters, and all the Booksellers.</p>
               <p>Letters (post paid) from Purchasers of either of his Books, directed to Mr. Hodgson, No, 14, White-lion-street, Islington, will receive immediate Answers; and all Orders from Gentlemen in the Profession of the Law, and others, immediately attended to.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen who send in haste to Islington, are requested to send a Porter, and not trust to the Stage or Penny-post.</p>
               <p>N. B. As many Gentlemen who have taught themselves Systems of Short-hand, not formed on this Plan, and wishing to exchange them, have found the Attempt too embarrassing; Mr. Hodgson has recently succeeded in introducing the peculiar Brevities of his System into others, without altering the Alphabets, and has found the Practice (though novel) perfectly easy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hodgson has a compleat Set of Sessions Papers, for the last ten Years, to dispose of at the usual Price; or any person wanting any particular Trial, may have a Copy at Six-pence per Folio.</p>
