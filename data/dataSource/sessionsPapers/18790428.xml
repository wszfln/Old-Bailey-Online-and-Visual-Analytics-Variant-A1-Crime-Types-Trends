Williams in favour of Toovey and Sons, payable at the National Bank, Oxford Street branch, endorsed William Toovey—he said he came from Messrs. Toovey and Sons, and would I oblige them by changing the cheque—I said it was rather unusual for Messrs. Toovey to send for change, although they were in the habit of sending for goods—I pointed to the name of the drawer, and asked who Mr. Williams was—he said, "He is an old customer of ours"—I did not know the prisoner, before—I then gave him 10 sovereigns and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—about half an hour afterwards I made some discovery about the cheque, and I went round to Messrs. Toovey and Sons, and I saw the prisoner that same evening at his place of employ, 61, Chancery Lane—on the morning of the 29th I saw him there again and gave him into custody—as he turned to leave my office I saw two scars on the left side of his neck.</p>

I live at 79, Murray Street, New North Road, Islington, and am a metal-worker employed at the Sekforde Glass Works, in St. James's Walk, Clerkenwell—the prisoner was employed there as a foreman——the deceased, Maurice Thomas William Cole, was also employed there as a glass driller—on Wednesday morning, 9th April, I was at work there at 7 o'clock—I saw the prisoner and deceased there that morning—they did not work in the same shop—I saw the prisoner return to his work after breakfast at 9 o'clock—the deceased went into the farther shop—the prisoner was then at work at the vice in his own shop—the deceased would have to pass through the shop where the prisoner was in order to get to his work—the shops are separated by an archway in the wall—I was working in the same shop as the prisoner—about 10 o'clock something happened which attracted my attention, it was a dull, heavy thud—I turned my head round and saw the prisoner standing with his back against the bench he the other shop in a striking attitude—I had not seen him leave the shop where I was at work—he had this iron spanner raised in his right hand—I guessed there was something wrong, and I said to Mr. Pace, the prisoner's father, "For God's sake, be quick"—he was working at the next vice but one to me—I rushed into the other shop, but I made a falter just as I got into the shop—there was no one else in the shop besides the prisoner and deceased—the deceased was on the ground in a sitting position, with his back against the press—he was bleeding and appeared to be senseless—when I made a falter, Mr. Pace, senior, being more courageous than me, rushed forward and elasped his son round the shoulders—I had not made any noise as I Went in, only in running and scuffling along as quick as I could—at the time the father clasped the prisoner round the arms, he was raving as though he was out of his mind; he had his hands still raised, he did not seem to know what he was doing, he was raving and flourishing about—he said, "Let me go, let me go"—the father said "For Christ's sake, Harry, what are you doing of"—he still had this spanner in his hand—I said, "For God's sake, Harry, give me this, don't use this," and he let me take it out of his hand—he kept on raving, and said, "Let me go, let me go; I want to go, I shan't hurt him, I shan't hurt him"—I took the spanner downstairs, and put it on one side out of sight, and it was handed to the policeman—I saw Wm. Bates come up from below—a constable was sent for, and the prisoner was taken into custody, and the deceased was taken in a cab to the hospital—I have not seen the prisoner and deceased talking together before this, only in the way of business—the prisoner has said to me that he thought it was very wrong of the deceased to act as he had done towards him after he had been such a friend to him; he said he thought he was a very bad man, after he had treated him so well, and then to induce his daughter to go away with him and then not to marry her—he has said that many times—I cannot tell when it was that he said this, perhaps a week before this occurrence—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187904280022"/>
               <p>has not spoken lately, he has been so sullen—he had not spoken to anybody for three days, not since the Thursday, when he found out that his daughter had got a child—there was a great change in him from that time—he was sober at this time, he is a sober man, I never saw him otherwise—he had not been long from breakfast when this occurred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been at these works eighteen years—I have known the prisoner that time; for the past seven years he has been foreman of the works, he has always been very good to the men under him—he has not lately spoken to the deceased, except in the way of business—the de<lb/>ceased seemed to avoid him—he wished to be friends with the deceased—I heard nothing in the nature of a threat on Pace's part towards Cole—there was a very great change in his manner after the Thursday; it was generally remarked; I was asked what was the matter with him, and I said I did not know, I thought it was some family affair, something fresh had turned up—he did not talk to the men as he did before, only if you wanted a job you had to ask for it, he kept on with his work at his vice—Cole's place was about 37 or 38 feet from where I was at work—it would be about 40 feet from wall to wall—the second shop was the one Cole was working in; the work was drilling glass—Pace was making frames in my shop—the work causes a good deal of noise, there is a continual knocking when putting the frames together—I was at a vice screwing levers on a frame—that would not cause noise—if all the men were at work there should be eleven, but several were out that morning—there were four in the shop I worked in, and Pace and Cole in the other shop—the spanner is used for taking the metal out of winding, for bending bars—in the ordinary work the spanner was used by a man named Tull—Tull was away that day; he worked in the second shop, the spanner lay on his bench—Cole worked about 8 or 9 feet from him—in making frames the prisoner, in Tull's absence, would have to use the spanner; he would go into that shop and work with it there—I had been on friendly terms with Pace—he was talking to me as a friend when he spoke about his daughter, he seemed very much distressed about it—I have never been to his house—I saw him with his daughter Lucy on the previous Thursday, when he found out that his daughter Lizzie had gat the child.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> On this morning the prisoner was working in the shop where I was, making frames—if he wanted a frame, the man not being there to get it out, he would go and get it himself; and in doing so he would use the spanner in the shop where Cole was.</p>

I am the prisoner's father, and live at 80, St. James's Road, Holloway—I have worked at these glass works eighteen years—the prisoner has worked there twenty-five years and two months—I remember Cole coming to work there, about two years ago—I understood he came from the country—some time back the prisoner was living at Enfield—he is married and has eight children; Lizzie, the eldest, is twenty-one, Lucy is eighteen, and the next thirteen or fourteen; they lived at home with their father, their mother is living—Cole was in the habit of visiting the prisoner at Enfield—I have seen him there—he afterwards lodged in the same house—he left Enfield about last April, and went to live in Arlington Street, Clerkenwell—Lizzie left her home about the last week in June last year, I did not then know where she went—I afterwards learnt that she went to</p>

               <p>live with Cole—the prisoner was very much distressed at that—this matter occurred on Wednesday, 9th April—on Thursday, the 3rd, the prisoner beckoned to me in the shop and said, "Dad, they have made you a great grandfather"—I said, "Never mind, there is some old enough to do it, I know; and you are not the first the same thing has happened to, nor won't be the last"—he said, "I wish I could take it as you do, but I feel I shall go mad"—he told me that his daughter Lucy went to see Lizzie on the Thursday, and saw her with a baby three months old, which clearly proved that she must have been far advanced in the family way before she left her father's house—he said, "To think I should take a man home as a friend to make a whore of my child!"—he appeared to be very much distressed—on Wednesday morning, 9th April, I was at the works as usual—I was in the same shop with Ware—Ware called me, that first attracted my atten<lb/>tion, and I went from the shop where I worked, through the archway into the shop whore Cole worked; I there saw my son, Ware and Cole, no others—I caught my son by his arms and said, "My God, Harry, what are you doing?"—he was very frantic, very, very indeed, and wild—he made no reply to what I said—I did not notice anything in his hand, because I had him clapsed round—I took him away and took him round to the other side of the shop—I saw the spanner, I can't say positively where I saw it first, I saw it, I may say, at the same moment—I saw Cole on the floor bleeding, he was lying on the back of his head, on a block that supported the press that they do the stamping on; Cole said nothing—Bates came up from downstairs, a constable was sent for, the prisoner was given in charge and Cole was taken to the hospital.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My son is 43 years of age—he has been nearly 26 years at this one place—he went there as a lad at 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he worked steadily on till he rose to be foreman at 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week at this time—I have frequently been to see him at his home at Southgate or Enfield—I re<lb/>member Cole coming to the works as a stranger; my son was very kind to him, and invited him to go down to Southgate on the Sunday to spend the afternoon thrre—as time went on I heard that Cole was going to marry Lizzie—I have seen Cole at the house, but that was before I was aware they were engaged to be married—my son has always been a kind and affectionate father to his children, attentive in every respect—he has been very anxious and distressed ever since last June, when his daughter left home; that had increased during the few day's before the Thursday, but from the Thursday there was a very marked change in him—from Saturday, 29th March, until Tuesday, 1st April, he had been kept at home ill—I went to see him on the Monday (I live in town); he seemed very ill indeed then everything was entirely changed in his manner; he was sitting by the fire with a coat over his shoulders; he had only just got up—he said his head was that bad he did not know what to do; he could get no sleep—he never got off his chair while I was there—finding him so ill I asked him to come and sleep at my house, and he did so on the Tuesday and Wednesday evenings—he seemed very ill then; he complained about his bead, and wanting sleep and could not get it; he was in that condition on the Thursday morning, and on the Thursday he heard this about the child.</p>

In consequence of infor<lb/>mation received, I went to a common lodging-house at 3, Little Grove Street, Marylebone, at about 1.45 a.m. on the 3rd, about two hours after the female prisoner was charged—it is about half a mile from where this robbery took place—the prisoner Connell was in a large bedroom upstairs—there were about seventy others in bed in the same room—I said, "I want you"—he replied, "All right"—he was not undressed, but was sitting at the side of his bed with a white slop on, and stooping to untie his boot—a fellow-lodger who came in and heard me speak to him said, "Jack, where are you going to?"—I was in uniform—the prisoner replied, "I am going to the Marylebone Lane Police-station to be locked up; go and tell the old woman"—I had not told him the charge then—I said, "You seem to know where you are going"—he replied, "Yes"—I then said, "You will be charged with being concerned with another in custody with highway robbery with violence"—those are the exact words; I did not mention a man or a woman—he said, "All right; I'll tell you the truth, I was along with her; we were all together in the Globe public-house drinking, but I didn't take the watch and chain—I had not mentioned what was stolen—I took him to the station—the prosecutor was fetched to the station, and immediately he entered the charge-room he pointed the prisoner out and said, "That's the man"—the prisoner made no reply.</p>

He was sitting down when the prose<lb/>cutor identified him—he was not put with others—the Marylebone station would be the nearest police-station to the lodging-house—it would be one and a half miles distant, and about three-quarters of a mile from the station to where the offence occurred—York Place is about the same distance—when I went to the lodging-house I was in uniform, there was a light and he would see who I was—the prosecutor was perfectly sober when he was brought to charge the male prisoner, about 6.30 a.m.—that was the first I saw of him—he lived at Euston Road and was sent for—it was about 1.45 when I went to the common lodging-house, and it would be 2.30 when I got to the station; then the prosecutor was sent for and he came about 6.30 or 6.45—he did not come at two, because I had not got there with the prisoner then.</p>

I am running after my pal"—I said "Come back here and I'll tell you"—I then asked the prosecutor if he had lost anything, and he said "Yes"—I said to the prisoner, "I shall take you to the police-station, and you will be charged with robbing the prosecutor"—when at the station he said, "I was running to a coffee-shop to get some food"—the prosecutor was drunk, but knew what he was about—he was charged by me with being drunk, and it was entered on the charge sheet—between the time I saw the prisoner ill-using the prosecutor and the time when I caught him I had not lost sight of him at all—he was one of the men, there were four of them, the prisoner was the one who knocked him down—I could not see whether he rifled his pockets—they all got up then, and left the prosecutor lying on the ground—the prisoner did not try to escape—when I took him back the prosecutor said he had been knocked down and robbed, but did not know who had done it, and could not swear to the prisoner—the prisoner denied the charge at the station.</p>

I was to meet one of them at the Criterion at 5"—I examined the brown paper parcel, and it contained this brooch—I asked him to write his address, and he wrote this in my presence: "Alfred Clark, Boulton Lodge, Upper Church Street, Chelsea"—I have inquired there—I have received some letters from Mrs. Dunkley and Mrs. Bennett, which have been produced.</p>

Aldous told the Visiting Committee when they were taking depositions that the prisoner had threatened him—there was no reply given as to his reporting it; he convoyed to the Committee that he had not reported it—the records were referred to, and no report was found—he explained that the threat was used in a moment of excitement when being removed to the punishment cells, and it was not taken any notice of—I had him in charge when the governor was taking the depositions before the Visiting Committee—he accused the governor of putting words' into the officers' mouths, and the governor said, "I am not, I am asking straight and direct questions for the information of the Committee"—the officers had given an account of the transaction with<lb/>out mentioning any words, and the governor then put the question, "Was any expression made use of?"—I don't think that was put more than once.</p>

I live at Spitalfields—I knew the deceased George Buckley—I was with him at the Bluecoat Boy on 7th April—the prisoner and two others came in; one was a carroty-headed woman, and the other, I suppose, was her husband—as soon as they came in Buckley said to the prisoner, "I think I knocked you down last night; I am very sorry for it; I did not take any notice of it; if it is all over with you it is all over with me," and they shook hands and drank together—I do not think either of them were drunk; they were quite capable of knowing what they were doing—drinking ale and half-and-half went on from 6.15 till between 7 and 8—they both became quarrelsome about 8.15, and Buckley stood up and hit O'Connell with his open hand, but only one blow—O'Connell took no notice for five minutes, and then he said, "Do you think I will let it go as I let it go twice last night? I shall very well make you pay for it to-night," and he ran. two or three steps over to him and gave him a running kick in the bottom of Ins stomach as he was sitting on the seat—he made a jump and turned to me, and said "Bridget, that man has given me a kick that</p>

I am house surgeon at the London Hospital—Buckley was brought there on 8th April, and I saw him at 9 a.m.—he was suffering from inability to pass water and severe pain in the lower part of the abdomen, and his groin was swollen—peritonitis set in in twelve hours, which was the immediate cause of his death—no signs of external injury were apparent—if he had been kicked on his stomach one would rather expect to find some mark, but not necessarily, the wall of the stomach would yield to the kick—I found on a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination that an abscess had formed between the wall of the stomach and the muscles of the abdomen, and probably some vessel had been ruptured—I am led to suppose that violence caused the injury—I do not think the abscess could have been set up by internal causes.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector, Scotland Yard</hi>). I know Montgomery as Hitchiuan—this advertisement appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of 24th December, and the <hi rend="italic">Times, Telegraph</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi> of 4th January, 1879: "Dear H.,—I entreat you to help me in this my time of deepest trial. Ill and friendless, I can look to none but you for assistance. By the memory of the past I implore your aid or I know not what I shall do—my last shilling is expended on this advertisement. Remember me at this season of happiness and reunion. I have no home now, so please address E.V., "Barfoot's, 295, Strand, London." Barfoot's is a sort of library—I went to the advertisement offices of those newspapers, and there saw the drafts of the advertisements, which were in Montgomery's writing, which I knew well—I then communicated with the Charity Organisation Society, who inserted this' counter advertisement-: "To the Benevolent. Any persons who have responded to advertisements commencing "Dear H.,—I entreat you to help me in this my time of deepest trial," &amp;c., &amp;c., which have appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Times, Telegraph, and Standard</hi>, are requested to send their names and addresses to the Secretary, Charity Organisation Society, 15, Buckingham Street, Strand." The handwriting in the correspondence is Montgomery's, but it is signed "Ethel Vivian"—I communicated with the persons who had written to the Charity Organisation Society, and in con<lb/>sequence of information I received from one of them I went to 129, Stam<lb/>ford Street, Blackfriars, and in consequence of what I then heard I went to North Bank and saw Mr. Diosy, and arranged for him to meet Vivian at St. Pancras, where I saw them meet—they were in conversation for about a quarter of an hour and then parted, and I followed her to 21, Regent Square, where she went in—I went there at about 9 o'clock a.m. on 8th March, with a constable—I went into the front drawing-room, where the two prisoners were at breakfast—I said, "Montgomery, there is no occasion</p>

               <p>for me to tell you who I am"—he said, "No, I know you, Little child"—I said "I am going to arrest you on a charge of obtaining and endeavouring to obtain money by fraud from various people, in connection with the 'Dear H.' advertisement appearing in the newspapers"—he said, "I don't see how you can make that a fraud, I merely inserted the advertisements for my friend"—I told him that I was going to arrest her likewise, and told her who I was—she said, "Yes, Mr. Montgomery inserted some advertisements for me, that is all"—I took them to Bow Street—I found a letter in Montgomery's hat in his writing—the envelope also contained a small piece of hair (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>)—it is addressed, "Alexander Marsell, Esq., Poste Restaute, Brussels"—there were two stamps on it, but it had not been posted. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "My dear Alexander,—I enclose you what you ask for, a small bit of my hair," &amp;c. Signed Ethel Vivian.") In a desk-at Regent Square I found this letter, addressed "Miss Ethel Vivian"—I do not know the writing—it is the letter asking for the hair, and to which the last is a reply—I also found this photograph of Vivian (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and this bill for velvet and other things from Meeking and Co., for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.t dated 8th March, 1879, and this letter, the handwriting of which I do not know: "If it is fine on Thursday next, do you think you could meet me at a quarter to 4 o'clock at Grange's, Confectioner, Piccadilly, a few doors from Egyptian Hall," &amp;c Signed, "C. V. R. M.—To Miss Vivian, 21, Regent Square, King's Cross, London" (<hi rend="italic">Other letters found were also produced</hi>)—in consequence of some<lb/>thing I heard, I went to 6, Friars' Walk, Oxford, where I found an old blind gentleman and a woman named Hitchman—on the walls I found a photograph corresponding with one I had in my pocket of Hitchman (<hi rend="italic">Montgomery</hi>)—in consequence of what I then heard of Vivian, I went to Dublin where I found a lamp-repairer named Buman, and found her sister, whom I brought to London—at the police-court I saw three letters produced by Mr. Diosy, Mrs. Cooksley, Miss Cope, and Mr. Kreutzman (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which are all in Montgomery's writing—I have made inquiries, and have traced Vivian since she left Ireland to the present time.</p>

First of all I sent her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay her fare to come and see me, and secondly I sent her a sovereign, and that is in reply to it—I also received this letter: "Many thanks for your kind letter and the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had to pay 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. post-office fees for it, as the letter was not registered," &amp;c. Vivian called upon me and I was out—she subsequently came and saw me, and told me her name was Ethel Vivian—I also received this letter from her. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "From the depths of my heart I thank you for your truly welcome kindness. What I should have done without I know not," &amp;c. I parted with my money through my belief in the advertisement.</p>

               <p>between—she wrote to tell me that she was coming to return me the money—she called and offered it, and I told her to keep it—her first call was the day after I saw the advertisement of the Charity Organisation Society—I sent my name and address, and that is why I am subpœnaed—she did not offer to return the money before the advertisement—she then told me she had earned it, and that she had got some light employment.</p>

I did not see any sovereign when she offered to return it—I did not wish to take it, because I still thought her case was a deserving one, and seeing this advertisement of the Charity Organisation Society I wrote to her, and told her I should like much to see her, as I thought I had matters of importance to tell her—I believed what she stated in her letter of 20th February, that she had an enemy, causing her annoyance through the Charity Organisation Society.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the printing-office of William Dougharty, of Great Prescott Street, trading as Dougharty and Co., who have for many years done business for Brown, Gould, and Co., of Oxford Street—at the end of July the defendant called on me with this Mss. which he wished printed, and specimens of circulars we had printed for Brown and Co.—I do not recollect the conversation—afterwards he called again with this quarto circular MSS. and cancelled the other circular in my presence—he said he</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I heard Mr. Gunnell's evidence at the police-court—I am sure the defendant said he was recommended by Brown, Gould, and Co.—I said at the police-court in reference to the first interview, "I think he said he was recommended by Brown, Gould, and Co."—at the first interview he produced some printed circulars and said, "Were these executed by your firm?"—on the first order for the small circular we only sent a proof—I suppose I am responsible for the orders given, not Gunnell—I should enter the order in the book, and Gunnell would take it from there—I believe I gave the defendant an estimate for work—I said at the police-court, "He (lid not say anything; he answered my questions"—that was the second interview—I believe a letter was sent to the defendant asking for the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but that is the clerk's department—I never sent any one for it—I went with Mr. Abraham Gould and Gunnell to Messrs. Dod and Longstaffe respecting this matter, and gave my evidence—I do not know that an action was commenced by the defendant against Messrs. Gould and Co.; before these proceedings I heard it in the police-court—I believe Mr. Abraham Gould is paying for this prosecution—Gould's people, I believe, asked me what evidence I could give—it is the custom with printers to send a collector for the money as well as the invoice by post—Messrs.

Joseph Reynolds, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." He did not afterwards bring me the proceeds, or any part of the proceeds of the cheque—it ii en<lb/>tirely untrue to say that the cheque was given to him to change for me—I have frequently changed cheques at Mr. Rawlings's for my own use, drawn to "self," but have never drawn such cheques in Reynolds's name—I put the prisoner out of my house about the end of March—he never, previously the action in the county-court, alleged to me that the 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque had been given to him to change for me—the first time I heard the story was, I think, in Court, when he commenced proceedings at the county-court—I was pre<lb/>sent when he gave his evidence, and heard him swear that I gave him the cheque to change for me—he said Mr. Rawlings changed it for him, and had a conversation with him.</p>

You are a visitor, are you not?"—he used at last to kick up all sorts of rows and say it was the gout—it was his general drinking gave him the gout, not what he had of me—I said at the police-court, "I have given the prisoner several cheques, some few for stable rent"—I have lent him several sums, chiefly by cheque, and then it was eaten up by the stable rent—he came as a visitor, and charged as a servant—he left my house about the commencement of March last year—Worman came to see him, turned out because he was violent, and would not go—he stayed at my request—I was afraid of the prisoner—he said, "I have been clean off my chump three or four times with the gout"—I had a loaded revolver in my pocket at the police-court—I have not got it now—the solicitor or the Magistrate did not tell me to leave it at home—I told Mr. Watts that I put it in my pocket because his client was out—Mr. Worman told me that the prisoner said he would rip his (Worman's) bowels out—it is not my custom to carry loaded revolvers—my father was a wonderful shot, and I am the same, and I take an interest in firearms—my revolver is always either in my pocket or under lock and key—I am the inventor of one revolver, and have had a gunsmith's shop—it was loaded in the police-court in all five chambars—I do not often carry one—I have had two in my pocket sometimes, and have been to the gunsmith's, where there is a great number of them—I had only one at the county-court—the Judge said, "I think you had better hand it to the in<lb/>spector"—I was in Court a portion of the time when the case brought against me by the prisoner was tried, and I suppose I was sworn—I do not think I had one revolver then; I am certain I did not have two—I am not sure I did not have one—revolvers were spoken of because the pri<lb/>soner announced his intention of getting me in a lunatic asylum—I do not think I had a revolver on the second occasion, but I will not swear—I can<lb/>not remember—I paid the prisoner 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for the stable, but for some reason towards the end he reduced it to 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

He contended that there was no conspiracy between Barrett and himself, but that a conspiracy had been laid in another quarter, not very remote from the prosecu. tion. He stated that he had never obtained a shilling or any goods by false pretences; that he had now been in prison for two months, and had had to fight single-handed against the weight and power of the Treasury.

                  </hi>. I am a member of a firm of wine merchants called Fletcher, Vaughan, and Co., at 28, Leicester Square—Messrs. Riviera and Hawkes, music publishers, are the owners of the house, and have a place of business there—we rent the premises of them—in 1874, before I joined the firm, the second floor was sub-let to Messrs. Fisher and Co., and the name of "Fisher and Co.," with "E. Levy" underneath, was written up—I joined our firm in May, 1877—I found that previous to that Mr. Levy had been in the habit of collecting debts for the firm, and I myself employed him to do so—in December, 1877, I employed him to collect a debt from Captain Maxwell for wine supplied; I did not know that it was supplied to the mess; I supposed it was supplied to him—I thought it was in December, 1877, that I first put it into Mr. Levy's hands to collect, but I am not certain of the time—after doing so he said he had written to Captain Maxwell and could get no answer, and he had served him with a writ—I again asked him about the matter, I should think perhaps three weeks after; I asked if he had heard from Captain Maxwell, and he said Captain Maxwell was going to defend the action on the ground that the wine was supplied to the 92nd Highlanders and not to himself to use at his own residence—there was an affidavit brought down, which my partner, Mr. Fletcher, made; as far as I can remember that was about 15th April, 1878; that affidavit was brought down to me by Daniel Levy, the prisoner's son, who acted as Fisher's clerk—nothing was said to me at that time about Captain Maxwell having made an affidavit—I did not make the affidavit, because I was not sure whether the goods were supplied to Captain Maxwell; it was before I joined the firm—Mr. Fletcher made the affidavit; I was not present when he made it; it was presented to me first—I was told it was to show that we were quite right in what we said, that the goods were supplied—a little I time afterwards I saw the prisoner again, and asked him when he thought the money would be paid—he said that the Courts were sitting, but they would rise in about a week or a fortnight, and the action would wait—he said that Captain Maxwell had offered to pay 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into Court—after the Easter vacation I asked him how the action was going on—he said that we had won the case, and we should have the money shortly; I believe he said it required so many days before he could get the money out of the Court of Exchequer—I asked him which Court it was in, and he said in the Court of Exchequer—that was about the end of April or the beginning of May—on 28th May, as the prisoner was passing our office door, I called him in—Mr. Thompson, our clerk, and Mr. Fletcher were present—I said "Mr. Levy, don't you think it would be a good thing to write to Captain Robson?"—Captain Robson was Mr. Fletcher's old partner, and was in the same regiment as Captain Maxwell—the prisoner said "No, don't do that; I have taken out the writ in the name of Fletcher, Vaughan, and Co., instead of Fletcher and Co., and that may raise a new action, and we shall lose our costs"—I got Mr. Fletcher to write to Captain Robson, and we received a</p>

Levy "underneath—I believe that letter was sent by hand by our clerk, Mr. Thompson, up to the office, and Daniel Levy came down and said that these moneys had been paid—I believe we sent up the letter after Daniel Levy came down—I have a press copy of the letter we sent (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "12th June. Dear Sir,—We must request that you will at once let us have the number or letter, whichever it may be, to enable us to trace the affidavit said to be made by Captain Maxwell, and which we understand is filed in the Court of Exchequer." We never got any answer to that letter—the affidavit there referred to was the affidavit about the goods not being supplied—the prisoner told me about that affidavit—he told me that Captain Maxwell had made an affidavit that the goods were supplied to the 92nd mess—I never gave the prisoner any authority to sign our name on this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it purports to be drawn to order by A.

Maxwell on the Dumfries branch of the Bank of Scotland, and bears the endorsement of "Fletcher, Vaughan, and Co."—that is not the endorsement of our firm—I never gave the prisoner or any one else authority to put Our firm's name upon that cheque—sometimes I sign the name of the firm and sometimes Mr. Fletcher—the writing is not like either of ours—no one in our employment signs the name of the firm.</p>

I joined the firm in May, 1877—part of this wine was supplied before I joined, and I believe a small' part after; I think so; I cannot quite carry that in my mind—I have no document by which to refresh my memory as to when the affidavit intended to be made by myself or partner was talked of—I generally made all the affidavits since I joined—I cannot remember the dates—the 15th April was about the date Mr. Fletcher made one; it was certainly not in December, that I am certain of—I was in the habit of making affidavits from time to time with respect to debts due to our firm, and conversing on the subject of them with Mr. Levy—I think Mr. Levey only collected two accounts up to June, 1878; only two that I know of, two or three—there were a great number given him to collect, and from time to time I saw him on the subject of them—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the invoice supplied to Levy for the purpose of collecting this particular debt; I did not make it out; one of our clerks did; it is one of our invoices—if these dates are right I was wrong when I said that some of the wine was supplied by the new firm—Mr. Levy said it was a very strange slip that he had taken out the writ for Fletcher, Vaughan, and Co. instead of Fletcher and Co.—he did not say it was our own fault for giving him an invoice headed "Fletcher, Vaughan, and Co.," I am quite certain of that—I don't exactly know the date when this conversation took place, I saw him so often; I cannot carry the date in my mind—I am not prepared to swear that it was not in December—it was</p>

               <p>not till 11th June that I really began to remember the dates, when I was so certain of them—no charge was made of forging this cheque till March this year—there was a difference between us about not paying over the money as soon as he received it—there was a contest between us in June and July last year; there was a controversy as to the amount of his costs against us and the amount he had received on our behalf—that resulted in an offer by him to pay 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as the balance if we would give a receipt in full—he gave us that cheque for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and we agreed to give a receipt in full, without prejudice to ourselves in taxing his bill of costs—we had not agreed to give a receipt in full; we said we reserved our right to tax his bill; that is in the receipt—he did not say that he would not pay the 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. unless we gave a receipt in full; he sent us down the cheque for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and we sent him up a receipt the same evening—in consequence of the form of our receipt he stopped the cheque at the bank early in the morning—it was not in the first instance agreed that if he paid the 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that would settle the matter, not without reserving our right to tax his bill of costs—I never saw Mr. Levy in the arrangement at all; it was Daniel Levy who came down to us; there was nothing mentioned about reserving our right then; we gave him the receipt directly we got the cheque, the same evening; it was a crossed cheque—we sent it for payment the first thing in the morning—that was not with the object that it should be paid before Mr. Levy should have the opportunity of seeing the form of our receipt; we were afraid of our money—we got the receipt drawn by our lawyers, Messrs. Randall and Ainger; we doubted Mr. Levy so much that we thought it right to have that in about reserving our right to tax his bill of costs, because we thought the costs very exorbitant, and we wanted to reserve that right to ourselves—the bill was only a summary then—I don't think I saw Daniel Levy afterwards; I had no conversation with him—I don't remember seeing the prisoner afterwards—I remember stating before the Magistrate, "The defendant, to the best of my belief, said that in consequence of the wording of the receipt he had given orders not to pay the cheque: he also said that if we were to reserve our right to tax his accounts because they were only delivered in summary he must have the right to deliver a bill in detail, which might amount to more than the summary"—I had forgotten that—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the summary.

               <p>that was before my interview with Daniel Levy—when we agreed with him to receive the cheque, we had in our minds to give a form of receipt which reserved our rights to tax the costs; we did not tell him so; it was left to ourselves as an open question whether we should tax them or not—I believe we took proceedings to have his bill delivered and taxed, and we began an action against him in respect of this wine account of 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Messrs, Randall and Ainger are still our private solicitors—we have left the taxation of the costs entirely in their hands—I am not sure whether they are here—I was in Court in March when this case was twice postponed—I suppose it was for the purpose of having Mr. Levy's bill taxed—I understood the case was fixed peremptorily for 28th April—I was not aware that 8th April was fixed for the taxation—I know it now you have told me; I did not know it before—I was not aware that our attorney appeared before the Magistrate to object to the taxation going on on 8th April—I am not aware of it up to this moment—I never could understand why it was not taxed—I know nothing about it—if our present attorneys had signed our name on the back of a cheque we should certainly object to it; with our present attorneys or anybody else. (<hi rend="italic">The Solicitor-General read the following passage from the cross-examination of the witness before the Magistrate:</hi> "I would have allowed Messrs. Ainger to sign our name and receive the money; I should not consider they had done anything improper if they had done it")—I was not referring to the cheque then—I was not aware that the cheque had been forged then—I was referring to county-court money. (<hi rend="italic">The deposition so stated.</hi>) To the best of my knowledge and belief I did not sign any affidavit on this matter—to the best of my knowledge and belief there was not more than one occasion upon which the question of making an affidavit in Captain Maxwell's matter was the subject of dis<lb/>cussion—to the best of my knowledge and belief there was one affidavit made by Mr. Fletcher, and that was the only one, and that was some time after December—I am not sure about the date. (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Fitzroy Gardner was called to prodttce an affidavit of H. L. Vaughan, of the 28th December, 1877, but stated that no such affidavit had been filed. A draft affidavit was produced to the witness.</hi>) I cannot remember making that affidavit—that is not the one Mr. Fletcher made afterwards—I might have made that affidavit when the debt was first given to Mr. Levy for collection, but I don't remember it at all—I cannot call it to my mind; the only one I can remember is that one of Mr. Fletcher's—we did not swear the same affidavit—I have only just glanced over it—(<hi rend="italic">reading it over to himself</hi>)—well, I cannot recall it to my mind—I won't swear that I did not swear that affidavit—I have not the slightest recollection of it—I do not know whether Mr. Fletcher left town that Christmas—I may have been in town on 27th or 28th December, and I may not, I really cannot tell you—I do not remember that the affidavit being incom<lb/>plete the two last paragraphs were added, and that I then swore to it—I will not say one way or the other whether that did or did not take place, but that is not the affidavit that was before me on a later occasion—it is not the same affidavit that I read in our office which Mr. Fletcher made—there was another affidavit which was worded different from that which Daniel Levy brought down to our office, and I would not sign it—that is not the same—I don't remember whether I swore any affidavit—I know I would not swear the one that was brought down to me, because</p>

               <p>I could not swear whether the goods were supplied to Captain Maxwell at his own place, or to the 92nd mess, as I was not in firm at the time—I have not observed that the affidavit states that they were supplied to him in London by his own instructions—(<hi rend="italic">reading it again</hi>)—I do not remember this at all—I don't believe I ever did make it—the conversa<lb/>tion in which it was suggested I should swear an affidavit was some time after, when we understood the action had been defended—I am not misplacing the dates—I do not remember the prisoner or Daniel Levy telling me that an affidavit was necessary to serve the writ out of the jurisdiction; not to the best of my memory—I don't believe it ever took place with me—I only remember one occasion upon which I was requested to make an affidavit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examied.</hi> I think this debt was sent up to Mr. Levy by Mr. Thompson, our clerk—he bad other debts of ours to collect—they were smaller amounts—several of those were collected and paid into different county-courts in London—when money is paid into the county-court the plaiutiff has to give an order to get it out—this was the largest amount the prisoner had to collect for us—I say it was about the 15th April when the affidavit was brought to me—about that time I used to make all the affidavits, and there was an affidavit made about that time by Mr. Fletcher—Daniel Levy brought the affidavit down to me; that was after the prisoner had told me Captain Maxwell intended to defend the action—I am certain of that—I had signed affidavits in some of the cases the prisoner had to conduct for us—as a rule whenever he or Daniel Levy asked me to sign it I did so—I read the affidavit which Mr. Fletcher signed—I think it was to the effect that we heard Captain Maxwell was defending the action on the plea that the goods were not supplied to himself but to the 92nd mess, and that we had to state that they were supplied to his own house and not to the 92nd mess—that was the substance of it, and I said I could not make that affidavit, and Mr. Fletcher made it—the letter of Captain Bobson's is dated 10th June—I read it to Levy on the 11th—up to that time I had not heard a word from Levy about his having received this 121<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or the cheque in respect of it—I did not know that the money had been received—after that letter was shown, Daniel Levy came down and made a communication about this money—the prisoner was not present—there were other accounts which lie ought to have collected for us—then arose the question as to how much he owed us, and the summary was sent in showing a balance of 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not ask us not to tax the bill—I believe we applied to tax, we sought the advice of our solicitor—Daniel Levy brought the 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque after the summary had been delivered to us, and under our solicitor's advice we sent the form of receipt reserving our right to tax his bill—we were not paid for the wine which Levy owed us, and we subsequently sued him for it—he was taken into custody some time in September—there was an investigation before the Magistrate, which lasted a considerable time—this particular charge was not brought before the Magistrate—the cheque was mentioned—it was first mentioned when he was going to be tried and it was put off.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Fletcher and Vaughan—I was in the establishment at the time Mr. Levy was first employed to collect the debts; I should say it was at the end of 1875 or the beginning of 1876—I can't say with whom the arrangement was made, whether with Mr. Fletcher or me—I think Captain Maxwell's debt was given to him to collect at the beginning of December, 1877—we continually spoke to him about the account afterwards, and at one time in my presence he said that Captain Maxwell had paid 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into Court—I can't say whether that state<lb/>ment was made to Mr. Fletcher or to Mr. Vaughan, but I was present at the time—he said the debt was disputed on the ground that the wine was sup<lb/>plied to the mess of his regiment—an affidavit was made, I fancy, somewhere in the beginning of April—I did not hear any conversation about it between Mr. Levy and the partners—I saw the affidavit and read it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not the affidavit I read.

Fletcher and Vaughan about Captain Maxwell's debt—I only heard it from my principals afterwards.</p>

I know that the affidavit was sworn in April because Mr. Vaughan reminded me of it—I went to inquire of Mr. Thorpe about three weeks, or it may be a month ago—before that I had a memory as to April; I remembered going to make the affidavit perfectly; I knew it was before May, that it was in April—I believed it was in April, but I did not know the date, and I went to Mr. Thorpe to ascertain the date—I merely asked him to tell me the date, and he asked his clerk to look back and find an entry in his book of Fisher and Co.—I think I suggested to him to look at the month of April—I can't tell you exactly what I said, but I told him as near the date as I possibly could, and my impression is that I did say to him that it was during April—I gave him an idea as to the date, so that he might be able to turn back to it—I went twice to see him; I can't tell when the first time was, but it was a short time before; I can't tell you the date—the second time was some time after the 15th April, because Mr. Thorpe turned to his book and found that it was on the 15th April that an affidavit had been made in the name of Fisher and Co.—I am not confusing two different years—yes, you are right and I am wrong; it must have been this year; I was referring back to April of last year—I can only say that I went the second time to Mr. Thorpe not long ago; I should say it was before Easter because I went out of town before Easter—I did not go out of town at Christmas, 1877; it was the only Christmas that I have not gone out of town—oh, the Christmas before last I did go out of town—I did not go out of town last Christmas.</p>

               <p>writing—my father knew nothing whatever about it, he was in bed, he had a day or two before undergone an operation for stone—I was present at the interview when the authority was drafted and the terms of it arranged, and also when Mr. Fletcher signed it—Mr. Foulger, Mr. Levy, and myself, were also present—this is the first affidavit drawn up in the matter—it is in Mr. Whitehead's writing—he was a clerk at that time—it was made out at first for Mr. Vaughan, as he was the person who usually made the affidavits in various matters—I went down to him, and saw Mr. Thompson, who was called to-day—I said "Will you go and ask Mr. Vaughan if he will come out with me and swear an affidavit in the matter of Maxwell"—he went into Mr. Vaughan's room and came out and said that Mr. Vaughan did not see how he could swear it, but that Mr. Fletcher would do so—that was on the date that it was sworn, 20th Dec.—Mr. Fletcher is entirely mistaken about it taking place in reference to another matter, because it is the only affidavit he ever swore in any matter in which we were concerned—it was not sufficient, because some new rule came out at Chambers in con<lb/>sequence of some complaint that the business was brought from Scotland, and it was necessary to swear that there was no Court of local jurisdiction, and also to verify more completely that the cause of action occurred in London—I took the affidavit down to Chambers and the clerk pointed out to me that it was insufficient, and instead of filing it I brought it back on the 20th—I should not have gone on the 20th, but on the 21st, because it was sworn on the afternoon of the 20th—I was reading the bill at Mr. Thorpe's office, but the boy said that he was out, and we went down to Mr. Goatley to swear it—he is the gentleman we generally go to when Mr. Thorpe is out—I may say that Mr. Fletcher did not sign the affidavit till he got into Mr. Goatley's office—part of that affidavit is in my writing and part in Mr. Whitehead's—it was really drawn from an affidavit in another case, and when I had ascertained what was necessary, I put in the two paragraphs in the margin, and so altered the affidavit that the two paragraphs fitted, and it says, "See over, and take in No. 5," and then it says, "Over, other side, No. 6"—from that draft an affidavit was prepared—the words, "The cause of action occurred within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court, because the goods were delivered to Captain Maxwell by his instruc<lb/>tions," were put in because we were informed that the goods had been ordered by and delivered to Fletcher and Co. at some railway-station, and that there the contract ceased, and that the railway company were the agents of Maxwell, and therefore the cause of action occurred in London and not in Tor Eagles—Mr. Vaughan swore the affidavit of which that is a draft—it was first allotted to Fletcher, Vaughan, and Fletcher, but afterwards, when the two paragraphs were put in, Mr. Fletcher was out of town, and I altered it to Henry Vaughan; he swore it, and it was upon that that the order was obtained—I have not yet been able to verify what the affidavit was which Mr. Thorpe has sworn to from our office on 15th April—no exhibit was attached to Mr. Vaughan's affidavit, but I believe it referred to the matter of Kahn and Nicholson—I never had an affidavit with an exhibit to it sworn in this cause—Mr. Fisher died in July, 1878—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the summons to deliver the bill—it is dated 13th July, 1878, and on 16th July Baron Pollock made an order upon it—we took out a summons on 31st October to tax our own bill before Master Butler, but that was successfully resisted; it is endorsed, "No order, application premature"—we applied to</p>

               <p>Justice Lush, who made this special endorsement, "The application being opposed, I hold that I have no power to order bill to be taxed at this time"—we took out another summons on 3rd December, 1878—it was resisted by Fletcher and Vaughan, but notwithstanding that Master George Pollock made an order on 4th December that our bill should be taxed, and on the 5th they applied to the Judge and the order was postponed till after the trial of Keg. v. Levy—that did not refer to the case you are now trying—there was then an application to the Court of Exchequer, which made an order that the bill was to be taxed—this is a copy of the bill delivered (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—everything mentioned in it was then done, and upon the dates which they bear—I have compared the diaries and attendance books—a considerable amount is for disbursements, every halfpenny of which was disbursed by us, and a cash account was delivered with the bill of costs—my father keeps his own account at Ransom's—some time before Mr. Fisher's death a gentleman named Mickelthwaite joined the firm in August, 1877—here is a press copy in the letter book of a letter written to Mr. Carpmael on 4th January—it is signed by Mr. Fisher himself—when I said that he could not sign, I meant not sufficiently well to satisfy any banker—that letter was sent, here is the postage book to show it, and Mr. Whitehead is here who posted it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GORST</hi>. My father left the office on 31st January, and I think he was operated upon on the following day—he came back to the office on the afternoon of 3rd January to attend an appointment, which appears in his attendance book—he was not there again till the 7th or 8th, and then not so regularly as he had been—Mr. Carr Jackson operated upon him—I endorsed the cheque immediately it was handed to me on the 3rd, about 9.30 or 10 o'clock—it is in my natural ordinary writing, but it I was copying I should write roundhand—it is not feigned—if I was writing a letter I should write very differently to what I should in writing an affidavit—I never had the slightest intention to alter, and never tried to—as soon as the Rule was made in March, I looked up the affidavit of 15th January, 1877, for the purpose of going to the taxation of the bill of costs—I found it in the iron safe of Fisher and Co.: and Micklethwaite at that time—I knew that it existed when the proceedings were going on at the police-court, and Mr. Fletcher was asked as to a specific endorsement what authority he had given, and I think he said he would not swear it was not as I had suggested—Mr. Vaughan swore that Mr. Fletcher gave my father authority to sign his name, but Mr. Fletcher swore that he did not—I did not produce the document, because at that time we could not put our hands upon it—we found it in March, 1879, after the Rule was made for taxation; my second reason for not producing it, was that I had not the conduct of the case, I was simply there to give evidence—I mentioned that I knew there was such a document in existence—I think that was to Mr. Edward Lewis, who acted as solicitor; I cannot give the exact date, but I should say it was prior to the questions being asked of Fletcher—Mr. Levy and I occupied one room, and he and I and Fletcher were present when the discussion took place about drawing up the document, but no one else—(Foulger was Mr. Fisher's clerk)—prior to this Messrs. Fletcher had sent us up some small accounts for collection, but Mr. Fisher subsequently ascertained that we were getting the small accounts and Richardson and Sadler were getting the large ones; they proposed to hand us a batch of 30 or 40, some bad and some good, and we said we would not</p>

               <p>take them unless we were allowed the county-court scale; in consequence of that it was arranged that we should take a retainer on the terms that they should pay us costs over and above the county-court scale; it then became a question of taking money out of Court, and subsequently Mr. Fletcher discussed the question, he did not want us continually going down and charging attendances on him, and in consequence of that the authority to sign was given in order that we should not every time go down to him on small county-court matters and charge 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the order to sign refers to getting money in the county-court and to accounts generally, nothing specific is stated as to what should be signed—I cannot say whether any sufficient authority was given to sign my name on a cheque—I do not mean to say that Mr. Fisher was really taking part in this interview, we had previously obtained instructions from him—my father did not pay him so much a week, Mr. Fisher paid us so much a week—I cannot say hew mach—I know what he paid me—I mean to say that Mr. Fisher got the benefit of that and paid my father a salary—the only interest my father had in this business was his salary as managing clerk, he being allowed to carry on an agency in his own behalf—this document was copied by Foulger, but the draft was made by the defendant, and it was read over to Fletcher by Mr. Levy and handed to Fletcher, who signed it—it was put in the safe, but I could not lay my hands on it, because it got under the drawer; and I do not suppose it came out of the safe from the time it was put in till the time of my finding it for the purpose of taxation—I looked in the safe for it, but could not find it in the first instance, but in moving to Leicester Square the safe was turned over, and instead of staying at the back it came over the drawer—it had got under<lb/>neath in the constant opening and shutting of the drawer which fills up the bottom of the safe, and the back of it does not go to the top part of the lining of the drawer—it was impossible to carry the safe downstairs without turning it over;. that is the only way I can account for finding, it—I hack looked in the drawer for it over and over again, and it was not there—Mr. Vaughan must answer for himself why he did not make the first affidavit—he sent out word that he preferred Fleteher swearing it, because the wine was supplied before he became a partner, which was in May, 1877—I had very little conversation with Mr. Vaughan, and none as to the terms upon which we were to collect' accounts for him—I do not know whether he is bound by this document; I should say that he is, because he never revoked it—it is signed, "Fletcher and Co."—I thought I was authorised to sign "Fletcher, Vaughan, and Co.," just as much as Fletcher and Co.—it is an authorisation to sign the name of the firm—that is not at all an unusual thing if you ask a good many solicitors; if a cheque came to a client's order because they had not put the client's name on the back, he would not give it to the client to keep—I signed "Fletcher, Vaughan, and Co." on the cheque—I thought the document authorised me to do so, and I do so now—I signed the firm's name; if I had signed Mr. Vaughan's name he would have had a perfect right to complain—I do not think it strange that Mr. Vaughan made the second affidavit, having refused to make the first; they were identical, except that the second contained two additional passages—I do not know that he was unwilling to make the first, but Mr. Fletcher was out of the way, and as the holidays were intervening, he was asked to make it and acording to the terms of his partnership it was due to him, because he</p>

               <p>took over the duties—the goods were delivered at the station here, and con<lb/>sequently they were delivered to Captain Maxwell in London—I took this affidavit at Judge's Chambers—the Judge reads affidavits, but his clerk would look at it first to see that it is right, that the Judge might not be an<lb/>noyed by an abortive application—I went before Baron Huddleston, and took the affidavit with me—I gave it to Mr. Parkinson—I did not take it away with me; it is not likely, it was no use to me—I did not afterwards go and fetch it away—I do not know what has become of it; I am sur<lb/>prised to hear that it is missing—I have never seen it since—I told my father on the morning of the 7th or 8th that the wine had been received for Captain Maxwell, and he or I told Fletcher, Vaughan, and Co., I think, in June—I can't say whether my father told them before June, and it was not my duty between January and Jane to go down and tell them—they never asked about the action in my presence—they produced a letter to me on a subsequent occasion—I was present on December 31st, 1877, when they spoke about writing to Captain Robson—I heard Captain Robson's letter of June read months afterwards—I was not astonished—perhaps I may read the entry in the attendance-book—they did. not speak about it in May or June in my presence—two days before they read me Captain Robson's answer they asked me if Maxwell's money had been paid—I told them yes—that was the first time they had asked me about Captain Robson's letter, and I can only say that they have made a mistake in the date about my say<lb/>ing that the action had been defended—I did not talk to them about the action having been defended, because it was not commenced—something was said on 31st December about defending the action; it was commenced on 28th December—if you will read this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) it will save you a lot of trouble—when they asked me the question I told them that the bill was paid—I do not remember any conversation, except their saying "You, have received Maxwell's money," and I said "Yes"—from the time the money was received till then they never mentioned the matter to me person<lb/>ally, nor to my father in my hearing—I have got the books before and after<lb/>wards (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—we got the judgment of the Court of Exchequer in March. I think, but the rule speaks for itself, it is dated March 4th—the appoint<lb/>ment with the Master was on 20th March by the book, but I did not go—Randell and Angier were the solicitors on the other side—I had nothing to do with giving them notice—I attended when there was to have been a taxation—I do not remember hearing them say then that they had only received the notice late the night before.</p>

This is the defendant's writing.—I saw it the following day—Mr. Vaughan came up, and saw him, and said that he had been thinking, he ought not to have sworn the affidavit, as tile goods were supplied by Fletcher and Co. before he joined the firm, and he thought it was in their name the action should have been brought—Mr. Levy said "You must not blame us for that, you must blame Mr. Thomp<lb/>son for giving me an invoice with Fletcher Vaughan's name on it," and I think Mr. Levy told him that he could raise the defence that he said nothing about Fletcher Vaughan, but about Fletcher and Co., but he said "No, that will point out the mistake directly," that was the purport of it—Mr. Fletcher has never suggested that I had denied receiving the money from January to June—I have seen a rough draft of the affidavit of 15th April, and I imagine it was the affidavit of Kahn at the suit of Nicholson's Dis<lb/>count Company—I believe there was a letter attached to the affidavit.</p>

The partners in Fletcher and Co. on 15th January, 1877, were Fletcher, Robson, and Pickering, and so far as I can recollect Mr. Vaughan joined immediately on their going out, but I only speak from hear<lb/>say—Mr. Vaughan declined to swear the first, affidavit, Goatley's, which was drawn for him to swear, and then we changed "Vaughan "into "Fletcher," and he swore it, and some person in authority said that it would not do—we then made out a second, which is not produced in Mr. Fletcher's name, and then Mr. Vaughan, who had objected to sign an affidavit saying much less, swore one stating more—I did not hear what he said, but the result of what came from him was that I changed the name, and he signed a much stronger one without objection, but I put it that he did it to facilitate the sending down of the writ—we were losing days—there is only a Judge there on Tuesdays and Fridays—if you look at the attendance book you will see that we did not issue a writ till the 11th, when the instructions, are to write for payment, and then we wait till we get further instructions before we issue the writ—we are bound to get instructions before that to prepare the affidavit—I never troubled myself about the second affidavit after the writ went down to Scotland—I never had it back to look at—I cannot suggest anybody who would wish to look at it, but when I see the way affidavits are kept at Chambers I am not surprised that they are lost.</p>

This is my letter book—I find here a letter written by my father on the 1st January, and three letters written by him on January 3rd, and one signed by him re<lb/>ferring to the appointment which I stated he came up purposely to attend—on the 4th here is one letter written by him, and on the 5th one signed by him, on the 7th one written by some one else, and signed by him, and one written by him—on the 8th there are five letters all written by him—I believe the operation was that the stone was crushed, but I do not under<lb/>stand it—he had been attended some months ago for the same tiling, but he had never gone through an operation before.; they had tried some treatment for dissolving it I understand—the verbal authority I spoke of before the Magistrate was two occasions when my father had authority to do certain things; it was merely in conversation that it was stated—I said before the Magistrate that there was a request to pay something out of the county-court—the money had been paid in about April, 1878. (<hi rend="italic">Some extracts from the depositions were here read to the witness.</hi>) Mr. Gibbs was the gentleman that found the money—I got fresh verbal authority in respect to Messrs.

C. Fisher and Co., per E. Levy, was written by my father—Egan's letter is not entered in the postage book—the letter of January 1st was addressed to Farmiloe, I think—letters delivered should be in this book as well as letters posted—this one to Mr. Farmiloe was delivered at 6.10—a letter written at the house must be pent to the office to be copied, because the book is never away from the office, but when or where it was written would not appear—as to that letter, neither delivery or postage is referred to.</p>

               <p>impetuous, too irritable, but I have seen him genial—I refused to work under Levy, and I was compelled to leave the office in consequence—I never did work under him—I was Fisher's clerk—there were other clerks in the office—Levergerer was the foreign clerk, and there was an office boy, and Mr. Daniel Levy, and one of his younger brothers—Levergerer did a great deal of the work introduced—there was a great deal of foreign correspondence—he assisted Levy I believe in that work as his clerk—I sat in the outer office if Mr. Fisher was not there, and I usually waited for him—his office was at the back of the second floor of No. 28—it was a separate room from Levy's—I used not to see the clients when they came—I saw Mr. Fletcher many times going up and down stairs, and in the office on two or three occasions—I knew him perfectly well—I did not see him for the first time when I signed the paper—he must have known me, but I had no beard then, it has grown during my illness, which was from October to February—this letter purports to be from Fletcher to Fisher and Co. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it usual to attest letters in this way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was usual in this case, and I remember the father said to Mr. Daniel, "Have that stamped at once." I remember that distinctly—he said that the very moment Mr. Fletcher left the room—the prisoner and Daniel Levy and Fletcher and myself were there—I have a perfect recollection of it—I did not know Mr. Vaughan at that time—if the prisoner had brought out that draft I should have refused to copy it, but Mr. Daniel Levy brought it out—I was on very good terms with him, and would do anything to serve him—I do not think any solicitor knows his business better than E. L. Levy, he has plenty of intelligence—I do not know whether it is his habit to get agreements stamped be<lb/>cause that is the only one I had jo do with—the penalty for not getting a sixpenny agreement stamped would be 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but it is 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. above sixpence—I have attested several documents for Fisher and Co., but I never attested a letter for Mr. Levy before.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the office of Fisher and Co. from May, 1877, to April, 1878—in December, 1877, I was directed by Daniel Levy to prepare a draft form of affidavit intended to be sworn by Henry L. Vaughan—the body of the draft produced is in my writing, but the corrections are not—I afterwards engrossed the affidavit of which this is a draft, and Mr. Fletcher ultimately swore to it—the alterations are Mr. Vaughan's—I did not prepare an engrossment for Mr. Vaughan—on 3rd Jan. either Mr. Fisher or Mr. Daniel Levy, I should not like to swear which, handed me a cheque with the paying-in slip book, and I took it to the bank and brought the book back—whoever gave it to me it was in Fisher's presence—Mr. Lewis Levy was not there—it was between 11 and 12 o'clock, before dinner time—this is the cheque, and I believe this is the paying in slip (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the amount and date correspond—Mr. Levy came to the office that afternoon about 4 or 5, or 5.30—this is my letter to Mr. Carlisle—I wrote it partly from dictation and partly from Mr. Fisher's instructions—when I had writtten it I read it over to him, and he approved of it and signed it—this is his writing.</p>

I left Fisher and Co. of my own accord—I was not discharged—Mr. Levy made no complaint against me, but a disagreement took place between us—the only conclusion I can come to so far as the wording goes, is that the original affidavit was intended to be signed by Vaughan—this (<hi rend="italic">another</hi>) is the draft of an affidavit after<lb/>wards sworn by Fletcher before Mr. Goatley—here is a statement in the draft: "Captain Maxwell is jointly indebted to my co-partner and myself in 114<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for goods sold and delivered, &amp;c."—I do not know why Mr. Vaughan did not sign that affidavit, I was not brought up as a lawyer's clerk, I am simply a correspondent; my copying is mechanical—I do not know whether it was because he could not swear to it because the goods had not been delivered—at the top of the draft "Henry Lewis Vaughan "is struck out, and in the margin is inserted Henry Lewis Vaughan and Philip Shaw Fletcher, and then there is a paragraph—I should say that that is in Daniel Levy's writing—I go more particularly from the last paragraph—I should not like to say in whose writing this Henry Lewis Vaughan is; but this Philip Shaw Fletcher is Mr. Daniel Levy's to the best of my belief—this Philip Shaw Fletcher in the engrossment to the affidavit is decidedly Mr. Daniel Levy's—I have no hesitation about it, and this paying-in slip also—there is a counterfoil of it—the cheque would be given as usual inside the slip-book,</p>

               <p>and the bank clerk tears off the counterfoil and keeps it—they kept a paying-in book, and I should say it is in Daniel Levy's writing—I sit in the outer office; there are four rooms, all on one floor—the clerks sit behind a partition in the entry room—you can go through the clerks' room to the other three rooms, but there are two doors on the staircase besides—Mr. levy had one room, and Daniel sat there with him some part of the time—Pickering had a large room at the back, lighted by a skylight; that is where Mr. Daniel used to sit the few months I was there—I was frequently sent to the bank, but not generally—the London and County, Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, was the bank of the firm—I cannot say at what time the prisoner came on the afternoon of 20th December or on the 21st or on January 8 or on any day except 3rd January, and I have a reason, because there was an appointment with Mr. Hall to meet him which I had to write about, relative to a case which will come on in connection with Worth's affair—Mr. Levy was collecting debts for Worth—I do not know what Hall had to do with it—the only question I have been asked was whether Mr. Lewis took my evidence down—I don't think he asked me whether I could remember whether it was on the 3rd that Lewis Levy came to the office—I do not think I have been asked by anybody else whether I remembered at what time he came to the office—I do not think I have had the letter-book in my hand till now—this is my writing, and I see by the postage book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) that the letter was posted by me; it is initialled by me—all the letters which have W. G. W. were posted by me—Mr. Fisher engaged me—I took all the cheques for the firm to the London and County Bank, Henrietta Street—I know of no other bank, but I believe Mr. Fisher did have another account, which I know nothing about—I believe he was trustee for certain matters, and kept an account, but I never went to any other bank for him—I cannot say whether I ever saw a cheque drawn by him upon any other bank.</p>

                  </hi>. I have made handwriting a study for 30 years—I have looked at the genuine admitted signature of Mr. Fletcher to this affidavit, two letters signed "P. S. Fletcher" directed to E. Levy, Esq., and a letter of Fletcher and Co., which I have here—looking at the document of 15th January, 1877, and the signature of Fletcher, my judg<lb/>ment is that they are written by the same person—I find that the admitted signatures vary very much indeed, I can show you four which, when put in juxtaposition, are not at all like each other, and it would be a very hard matter to say that they were all written by the same hand; they vary very much indeed—I am able to detect what is the ruling character, so as to detect what is genuine and what is not—I believe this is a genuine signature; I should not like to say that it is not—I do not think this word "Fletcher" in the call book is written by the same person, the character is quite different—the habit generally is to form a perfect "T" and add a little dot, but there is no "F"—sometimes it is connected with the "I" in a very peculiar way, it does not pass through the downstroke at all—I cannot find in any of the admitted signatures anything like this "F" in the call book; the "Fletcher" in the call book is certainly not by the same person; I express that confidently.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. The signature to the guarantee agrees with all the genuine signatures.; I find the same characteristics, and I then go through them; one of them is making "Co." like "to," and "&amp;" for "and"; the "Co." anybody would take for "to" plainly—F and T are exactly alike till you cross the F, and instead of putting a dash in the middle he puts a dot—here is a genuine signature in which he does not touch the "T" at all; I call it "T" because it is a T until it is made into an F—sometimes he leaves a marked space; that is a very distinguishing feature in the guarantee—another feature is that his general inclination is to make the top of the final "o" go to the left; there is a horizontal dash, I mean, when he has finished the "o"; they all present that peculiarity—I have marked the cheque "7 A," and upon that I find one exactly like it, and it is so in the signature in question, only it is turned to the right, but they generally are to the left; that shows against it being a forgery because the forger would imitate the signature—the next peculiarity is the "c" in "Fletcher," and the other is like it—if any one is forging a name he ought to make it as like as he can; his eye should be fixed on the "F" and on the "Co."—in forgeries the peculiarities of the hand are always copied—there is no general resemblance between the "Fletcher" in the call book and the signature to the guarantee; the top of the "F" is different and the cross—if I were to ask two or three persons to write, you would find several of them as much like it—I write every hand; I have written the Lord's Prayer</p>

               <p>in 150 languages—I am a lithographer as well—I will write the word "Fletcher "if you wish it (doing so)—I am so much in the habit of imitating copperplate that I do not write a very free hand—I am in the habit of imitating writing—in my view this "Fletcher and Co." to the guarantee bears as much resemblance to the "Fletcher and Co." in the call book as to any other; it is as little like it as the writing of anybody—there is a decided peculiarity in Fletcher's "r "at the end of the word; sometimes he does not define the "r" at all, but this is a very nice one; here is one which has come to an untimely end, it is an "i"; he sometimes writes "i," and no "r"at all.</p>

I see the two words "County Court" here; the first "C "is different to the other, one has an open bow to it and the other has not—comparing that with the "c" and "o "in Fletcher and Co., there is not the slightest resemblance; but one is a final "o" and the other is not—there is not a faint resemblance; these are bows filled in in the act of writing—I should not say that there is the faintest resemblance, except that it is an "o"—I should say that they were not made by the same person.</p>

               <p>distinguishing letter "r" of Mr. Fletcher's signature—they are different from Mr. Fletcher's usual "r," and those in the signature in question are totally different, not at all like Mr. Fletcher's habitual "r"—in the disputed signature the "F," the "1," and the "e "in "Fletcher "are freely written—the "t" betrays hesitation of hand in the upstroke connecting the "c "with the "h"—it betrays nervousness of hand until We come to the second "e"—then comes the difficulty of the signature; it appears here that the person who has copied this signature has copied it from a signature which possesses the habitual and distinguishing "r "of Mr. Fletcher's signature, and naturally lifted his pen to consider—it is as clear as possible that the pen has been lifted after forming the "e;" then the distinctive "r" of the signature appears to have been misunderstood; in some of the signatures if seems like a little dash, but it is more than that; here is a strong distinct dash by a strong pressure of the pen, and there is no such thing in the ordinary signa<lb/>ture, and there is no tendency in Mr. Fltetcher's writing to that back<lb/>ward strong touch of the pen'; then there is a clumsiness in the "cher &amp; Co.;" the "Co." in particular in Mr. Fletcher's writing could be very easily imitated, but there is a great lack of freedom and a heavy pressure of the' pen in the upstrokes; it seems to be more plainly written; all Mr. Fletcher's signatures are carelessly written, and the worst of these signatures, and which I might be inclined to doubt, is that of 25th April, 1877, but that possesses the peculiarity of the final "r," seeing which I should accept that as a genuine signature—then the crossings of the "t" and the "h "are at the top of the letters; but they are not always on the top; they are sometimes nearly at the bottom, and sometimes a little higher, so that wherever "it is put it cannot assimilate to the genuine signature—then the Fletcher and Co." is not in the same ink as the "Witness W. E. Foulger"—I have looked at the final "r" through a magnifying glass, but it scarcely wants that; it only shows more distinctly that the pen has been lifted up and put down again suddenly to make the "r," which is a simple dash of the pen, nothing, more—Mr. Fletcher in his signature does not lift his pen when he comes to the "r;" he never forms the "r "in such a simple manner as this; nothing, could be more simple; it is merely a strong dash; there is no form at all—I have mentioned that in the signature of the disputed document there is a very heavy pressure of the pen on the upstrokes, and this word "Fletcher" in the call book on 15th January, 1877, is distinguished by that' peculiarity; the upstrokes are very fairly written, but beyond that I can say no more—I am not able to say that the person who wrote one wrote the other, but I do say this, that I should be quite as much inclined to think that the signature "Fletcher" in the call-book was a genuine signature; in the disputed signature the "r" in "Fletcher" in the call-book is something; like Mr. Fletcher's distinctive letter "r"—I have seen very little of Daniel Levy's writing—I have seen it on a credit slip, which he admits to be his writing, and a spurious signature to a county-court request; it is a signature of Fletcher, Vaughan, and Co., not written by them, and which is alleged to be a forgery—I mean that' I have seen a name, which is not Daniel Levy's name, written on a document, and it is admitted to have been written by Daniel Levy—the sig<lb/>nature to which I refer is not in his natural writing, but this endorsement "Vaughan &amp; Co."on the cheque has a resemblance to it—I do not con<lb/>sider it is his natural writing—it bears no resemblance to the signature of Flecher, Vaughan, and Co.</p>

Black and Gayford—I have seen his receipt, and will swear he received that sum—I have no charges here against any other clerks—I have clerks here as witnesses—Mr. Gillingham is not here—I know something about the prisoner having been sent by my bookkeeper to collect from Black and Gayford 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which had been some time before collected by another clerk, but I don't know of my own knowledge—I know from what the book-keeper has told me there were two amounts of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was a mistake—I do not know much about it—my business is mostly out of the office—I know there are amounts collected by the prisoner not accounted for—there were over 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and we might bring 20 indictments—we have brought several indictments—he came into our service in 1875—my book-keeper is very careful, but there is great detail in our business, and a mistake might occur here and there—the collecting was done only on Saturdays, but he would have to do his Custom House work too, if any, or another clerk might assist him—he had not much Custom House work when he had to collect—there is a general book in which the collecting, clerk should enter the particulars of what he has collected—there is no book kept at the office for all clerks to enter money collected—the prisoner had strictly to pay over the money to the cashier, and if the cashier were out he would have to wait till he returned—I do not know if he would take the money away with him, but he has to account first to the cashier—if he found that a sum of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was required for duties, he would go to the cashier and say, "I want 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—we always pay in to the Custom house either 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or sometimes 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this (rough diary) is the book in which he would enter all payments on prime entry—there is no<lb/>thing here but "Paid in, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—it is a record of what he receives and pays in—the book belongs to the office, and he has no right to carry it about with him—there would be nothing wrong in keeping it in his desk—his duty was to put down the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when he paid it in—it would be irregular to enter the payment directly he receives it, because this book is a record of amounts actually paid in—the book was kept to ascertaiu the balance every day at the Customs—When he received the money it was his duty to go at once to the Customs and pay it in—he might have sent it down, but it would be his duty to go himself, and the receipt for the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is in his own handwriting—other clerks have paid in deposit accounts, and they might do so in the absence of the prisoner—if he had a great deal of business to do I might have sent another clerk—it was his special duty to so down.</p>

The confidence which you have placed in me will, of course, cease, but I hope that some day I may be able to ask you if you will again rely on me, and that you will be able to answer Yes! The reason or cause of my taking the money was that at the time I entered your employ I had got into debt and did not get out of it, although I tried hard to do so. When I held the money in my hand I thought I would be able to repay it before you would press the Customs for it; but now you have said you were going to see Mr. Thorpe I must confess what I have done. If you would only allow me to remain in your employ and work to pay off the amount, you will save me from ruin in every way, body and soul. I could never look any one in the face at home.

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor at 30, Wellington Street, Strand, and was the solicitor for Mr. George Stevens, the present prosecutor, in the action of Stevens v. Claxton—I received instructions to take proceedings against, the prisoner, and served him with a copy writ with special endorse<lb/>ment—this is the original (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>)—he appeared in person to it, and I in due course took out summons under order 14 to sign judgment for want of a defence—I filed affidavit, issued summons, and obtained order at Chambers to show cause why judgment should not be signed—this is the summons, 4th March, 1878 (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>)—on the 6th March, the day the summons was returnable, the prisoner called on me at 77, Chancery Lane, and made a proposal that having sold the horses and not being able to get the money, and his position being precarious, he signed this memorandum: "I consent to an order for judgment for 123<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and costs to be taxed. John Claxton"—at Chambers, on attending summons, he repudiated it—I filed this affidavit by Mr. Stevens in support of the summons. (<hi rend="italic">This claimed</hi> 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">for four horses purchased by the prisoner for</hi> 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">less</hi> 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">deposit, and that by letter (Exhibit A) the prisoner had admitted a balance of</hi> 123<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; <hi rend="italic">to that affidavit this letter of the prisoner, dated October</hi> 27<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">was attached, marked A, stating that Stevens had brought to his (prisoner's) stables as livery, four horses, at</hi> 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">per week, and ultimately agreed to sell them to him for</hi> 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">each; that he paid him</hi> 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">deposit, the balance to he paid when the horses were sold, but on examination they were found to be unsound, that he sold the bay mare for</hi> 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">the black horse for</hi> 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and the pair of chestnuts for</hi> 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and deducting therefrom for keep of horses</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">shoeing, commission, &amp;c.</hi>, 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and deposit</hi> 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">left a balance of</hi> 122<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., <hi rend="italic">which the prisoner admitted to be due. The affidavit repudiated the plaintiff's claim of</hi> 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">on the ground that the horses were unsound and unfit for use.</hi>) The result was that the Master made an order giving leave to defend; and that is endorsed on the</p>

               <p>summons—I felt dissatisfied at the Master's decision and appealed against it to the Judge in Chambers—Mr. Parkes attended on the prisoner's behalf, and the Judge made an order that unless the prisoner paid the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into Court within a specified time judgment would go against him—he never paid in the money or any part of it and we signed judgment—I wrote him a letter for payment but had not been able to obtain anything.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, at 5, James Street, Oxford Street—in September, 1877, I had four horses for sale, and saw the prisoner at Dorset Mews, and he said "If they are good ones I can sell them," and it was agreed that he should keep the horses for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week, and have 5 per cent commission for selling them, the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week to include man for cleaning and everything—I fetched the horses up from the country a few days after, and took them to the prisoner's place in Dorset Mews—he had them there some ten weeks, but did not sell them, and at last he agreed to buy them for 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., including all expenses previously, and to charge nothing for keep and shoeing; it would have come altogether to about 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., including keep, &amp;c.—he agreed to pay me 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit on the following Saturday, and the balance, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., within a fortnight—he said he would either pay me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the Saturday after the deposit and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Saturday after that, or pay me the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. all together on the second Saturday—he paid me the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque, I left the horses with him, and have never received anything since—I called on the Saturday for the first 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he said he had not got it, but I do not recollect</p>

               <p>whether he said he had sold some of the horses—I called again for the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he said he could not pay it because he had not got it—I had seen Mr. Sutton several times, and had called a dozen or twenty times to get the money or a part of it—my horses were not always there; the pair of chest<lb/>nuts were the last I saw there—I came to know Sutton through driving round there with Claxton—I first saw my bay mare in Mr. Sutton's brougham, but do not think I spoke to the prisoner about it—that was before Christmas in the same year—I did not go to see if Sutton had the horses till after the prisoner had made the affidavit—he had previously told me and a cousin who was with me that he had sold Mr. Sutton two of the horses, and when he got the money from Sutton he would pay me part of the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he told me he was going to send the other two horses to a Mr. Cooke at Liverpool, and I sent a telegram for him about them—I have had no money except the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit—in February, 1878, I instructed my solicitor to take proceed<lb/>ings against him to recover the amount, and handed him the prisoner's better which I had received as the basis of the action—he admits there that he sold the bay mare for 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the black horse for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in consequence of what I heard about' the summons and the affidavit! the prisoner had sworn I went to Mr. Stevens and made these copies (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of the two receipts he produced to me—I? was particular in copying them, and my brother-in-law, who was with me, read the originals over to me after I had copied them—I have never had a farthing to this day—I afterwards lost sight of the prisoner, and in consequence of something I saw in the news<lb/>paper I preferred this charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Was paid after the horses had been some 10 weeks in his premises, and the balance was to be paid within a fortnight, but when I called he either said he had not sold them or had not got the money—after calling 20 or 30 times I received this letter in 1877 that he had sold the horses, and in 1878 I look civil proceedings against him for the' balance due, and got an order, but we found that the prisoner had nothing—I do not know if the horses Were sent to Mr. Cook, of Liverpool—Mr. John Curtis is not my partner and has no interest in the horses—he has been in America 18 months—I said before the Magistrate, "Mr. Curtis was part owner of the bay mare," but I think I said at the same time that I had settled up with him and he got his share of the money—he had an interest in the bay mare till he went to America—I introduced the prisoner to Curtis—I know nothing of Mr. Cook, of Liverpool, but have seen him; I only know from what I have heard from other witnesses that he has been sued for the price of two horses, but I know nothing about the proceedings against him.</p>

"B" was a report from Johnson and Payne, dated</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">th June, giving the total value of the premises in Lower Belgrave Street at</hi> 775<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">or</hi> 10 <hi rend="italic">years' purchase.</hi>) There is a blank in "A" forthe amount of the loan, but she applied for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked her if these particulars of letting were perfectly and sincerely accurate—she said "Yes," with a slight alteration which I made in pencil, but which made no difference in the rent; it was merely that one shop at 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and three rooms on the second floor at 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. were let to one tenant at 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told her of course I could not rely upon the report, it would be necessary for some one to verify it—we agreed, and I went to the premises in two or three days—she said there was about from 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year surplus which she made out of it—I found two shops, one a tobacconist's, was open—there was a note against the door of the other—I inquired of a man-servant for Mrs. Roberts, and Crighton came from the stairs—he said it was all right, he would show me over—he took me over the premises, as Mrs. Roberts was not at home—I mentioned the Cavendish Society—he weut into a little room at the back of the shop, and told me that he held that room and the shop at 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I said "That seems rather a heavy rent"—he said "Not considering the position of the premises; we do a very good busines"—as I was going along the passage again I saw Mrs. Roberts—I do not know where she came from—she took me into the back-room first floor, which was a much larger room, and said that it was 'let to a solicitor, with a room over it, at 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and that the front room was let to two officers of the Guards at 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; the upper part of the house she stated was in her own occupation—there were, I think, two upper rooms—there was a sitting-room and a bedroom to each of the officers' rooms, and the solicitor had two rooms—I went upstairs and said, "I understood you to say that this shop was let at 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year"—she said "Yes, it is let to a lady who is well known in the Berlin wool trade; she has not come in yet; I expect her in next week"—that was not the larger shop—the matter was brought before the directors in the usual manner, and they agreed to advance 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the property—I then wrote to Mrs. Roberts, and she came to see me—I told her we could not lend 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., only 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think I conveyed that information through Mr. Bouffler—she did not in any way alter the statement that she had made when I went over</p>

               <p>the house; I believed it, and the money was lent her on, I believe, the 21st December, 1877—here are four of the cheques—they are all endorsed by her—this one of 21st December was for the balance after paying off the mortgage—Messrs. Miller attended to the legal part—she said nothing about having granted an under-lease to any one; that was entirely concealed—the money was to be repaid by 60 monthly instalments, but we only got the first, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I heard nothing more till November, 1878, when I in<lb/>structed the solicitor to stay proceedings in the matter—I then for the first time knew that there was an under-lease to Crighton—we have never received a farthing more, except 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for ground rent, which was dis<lb/>trained for, having been paid to the ground landlord—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>). is a memorial signed by Roberts.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Roberts.</hi> You certainly did show me over the house, and you used the words I have stated—the first distress was in July, 1878—we paid the first quarter's ground rent out of the society's funds, and we were obliged to distrain for it to prevent ferfeiture—I bad not 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of yours in my hands, nor 40 farthings, except what I had at the time of the settle<lb/>ment, and I paid that over to the ground landlord, and this is his receipt—you answered everything that I asked you—I asked you particularly whether the house was let for 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and you distinctly said "Yes"—the solicitors may have sued you, I did not—I knew nothing about your being made a bankrupt—the society being a very old and respectable one, we allowed 10 months to go over without getting a farthing—I do not know what you mean by "your tenante"—the broker said there were no tenants—I am not aware that I am your trustee in-bankruptcy.</p>

I am accountant and manager to Henry Archer and Sons, 171, Strand, tobacco manufacturers—about the latter end of 1877 or early in 1878 I saw Mrs. Roberts several times in company with Crighton—she gave the name of Crighton; I believed them to be husband and wife—she bought goods, and for about two months paid cash, ultimately she got credit, and it ended in owing our firm over 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in about three months—the last goods were supplied on 27th April, 1878—I went several times to Belgrave Street and saw both the prisoners—I did what I could to get money, but never got one penny.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of records in the London Bankruptcy Court—I produce the file of proceedings in the case of Annie Roberts, of 23, Lower Belgrave Street, widow; she was adjudged bankrupt on 30th January, 1879—no accounts were filed—an order was made for the prosecution.</p>

As to the lease, they did not search in the Registry Office as they ought to have done; it was registered in the County of Middlesex, and if they had done their duty in a proper manner they would have seen it; but they have put it all on my shoulders. I borrowed 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of them, and I laid it out on the premises, they have had the benefit of the money. They kept my creditors from coming to the Bankruptcy Court to get their share in the profit, nearly 1260<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I have no lawyer or any one to protect me, and I leave myself entirely in your hands. They pocket all the money and my poor creditors are left without a penny. I think the fraud and conspiracy has been on their side; they have paid witnesses to come and swear falsely. I have been straight<lb/>forward in all my transactions.

                  <hi rend="italic">Crighton's Defence.</hi> With regard to the loan that was granted, I knew nothing of it till some time afterwards, and then Mrs. Roberts said she had obtained some money to pay the rent; that was all I knew. I never attempted to obtain tobacco or cigars with any idea of fraud. I paid cash as far as I possibly could, and I never asked Mr. Archer for credit.</p>

I live at 12, Essex Street, Great Guildford Street—on 5th April, at 3 p.m., I was standing outside the Queen's Head, Great Guildford Street, and saw a pony and cart—three people were in the cart sitting abreast—the prisoner was driving at the rate of 10 or 12 miles an hour—I knew him before—it was a very fast pony—I saw an old lady crossing the road—I won't be sure whether the pony hit her, or, the shaft of the cart, but it knocked her down and ran over her; she was then about two feet from the kerb; she was crossing—she had crossed the road all but two feet—I saw two people pick her up, put her in a cab, and take her to the hospital—one was named Jones, and the other was a woman—she was bleed<lb/>ing from some part of her head—I stopped the pony, and Strange, who was in the cart, said "Barrett, you know me well, you let go the pony, I am all behind with my chairs now, if there is anything wanting for evidence you know where to come to me"—the prisoner was present—lie said nothing to me—I did not hear him say that he was very sorry—I think he had been drinking—Strange said to him "I was a fool to let you have the reins"—he did not pull up at once, he drove on for 20 or 30 yards, and then I stopped him—there were no other vehicles in the road—the cart went on again, and the prisoner went after it.</p>

               <p>the Magistrate—I said before the Magistrate or Coroner that after she was knocked down Mr. Strange's son drove on at the rate of 10 or 12 miles an hour, not that the prisoner did—I ran after the cart and overtook it—I can't say the prisoner was properly drunk—when a man falls down in the road then he is drunk—the prisoner did not fall down in the road; he was too drunk to drive a horse—I do not know that I said any thing to the constable about his being drunk—I did not say to the constable "He was not driving fast as he was obliged to go in and out; there were other things in the road at the same time"—I knew the old woman, she was a lodger of mine once—I do not know her son who is here, but I know another—we went down to Mr. Strange's house to see the prisoner on the Monday, but he would not be seen—I saw him on Tuesday evening, but not in the presence of Thomas Patten—I also saw him on the Sunday—I did not say "The best thing you can do is to square this job at once, and if you will I will bring the son round to you," what had I to do with it?—I, know Mr. Strange, the owner of the cart, but have not spoken to him since the prisoner was com<lb/>mitted for trial—he came down to where I stand with my goods, but I would not speak to him—he wanted me to go and drink with him, but I would not—I do not know that the pony is 14 years' old—I never looked at its teeth—it is a light cart—it was filled with chairs, and there were three men in it—I can't give a notion of the pony's height—I don't know that it had been driven to Richmond and back that-morning and the West End afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer of 44, Great Guildford Street, Southwark—I am accustomed to horses, and have kept them for some years—on 3rd April, about 3 p.m., I was outside my confectioner's shop—I nave two shops—I saw a pony and cart coming with three men in a row and some chairs, and the cart driving on its proper side; the pony was going rather fast, I should say 8 or 10 miles an hour—my attention was drawn to it, and I did not see the woman till the accident occurred, as I kept my eye on the cart; either the horse's head or the shaft knocked her down; she seemed to reel and fall across the road with her head towards the kerb to which she was going to—she was very near the middle of the road, but more towards the other side—I understood that she came from my grocer's shop—there might have been other vehicles in the road, but I did not notice—the cart went right across her and jolted, by the wheel going over her—I went up to her and saw Barrett holding the trap from 30 to 35 yards off—I had seen the trap I dare say 50 or 60 yards before it passed me, and saw it for 60 or 100 yards after it passed me—I heard no noise or shout—the prisoner did not get out at first when it was stopped, but he came back in a little time and came up while I was seeing to the woman, and then the cry was raised "There goes the trap," which was being driven away, the prisoner being by the woman—several persons ran after the trap and the prisoner went after it as well, quietly—he returned with the con<lb/>stable a little time afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The street is about 7 yards wide—the woman was more than 2 feet from the kerb she was walking to—she was struck by the off side shaft—I should say, at all events, she fell towards the kerb, not away</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187904280114"/>
               <p>from it—I should think it was the off side struck her, but I cannot say, because the back of the cart was towards me, and the chairs in the cart obstructed my view to a great extent, but it was the wheel nearest the kerb which went over her—I think they were sitting much too forward in the cart; there was too much weight forward, which would make less leverage for the driver to control the pony—I did not hear any one in the cart call' out—I was about 50 yards from where the accident happened—the trap jerked, and then the pony started on again—I believe I said before the Magistrate, in answer to you, that I would not swear that the pony was going more than six miles an hour, and that if he had driven properly he could have stopped in time—I could have stopped, I believe—I believe he could have stopped it if the cart had been properly weighted—I did not hear the prisoner say that he was going for a constable, but I saw him with one afterwards—I saw Barrett and the constable and the prisoner talking together.</p>

I live at 1, Moss Alley, Bankside—I was in Great Guildford Street and saw an old woman crossing the road—she had half an ounce or an ounce of tea in her hand, and I saw the cart coming along and the prisoner driving very fast—it was three or four yards from her when I saw her—some one in the cart halloed—she looked up, and before she could get out of the road the young man drove over her—he might have gone the other way if he had pulled the reins; he would then have gone past her—I saw no other vehicle but Barrett's barrow—the road was free for the cart to have passed her without touching her—it is a straight road—the cart went over her twice, and her hand was cut almost to pieces—it was the left-hand wheel that went over her; if he had turned the other way he might have saved her—I saw Barrett run after his barrow and took hold of the horse's head—the prisoner jumped off the cart and came and looked at the old woman, and I said, "Oh, you brute, you ought to be ashamed of yourself"—he never answered, but ran away, saying that he was in a hurry—I did not see him afterwards, as I helped to get the woman into the cab—she never moved or spoke—she was taken to the hospital.</p>

I am a labourer, of 57, Great Guildford Street, South<lb/>wark—on this Saturday afternoon, about 3 p.m., I saw a pony cart coming. down the street at the rate of 10 or 12 miles an hour to the best of my judgment; I am not a judge of horses—I heard a shout of "Hie, hie!"—the pony was then about 10 yards off—there were no vehicles in the road but a costermonger's barrow standing outside a shop—I saw an old woman in the middle of the road; she seemed to look up and stagger; she was knocked down, and the wheel went over her—I picked her up and drew her to the kerb; she was insensible—the cart went on—I don't know who stopped it, but I saw Barrett holding the horse—the driver had, I think,</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> In my opinion he could have pulled either on one side or the other—he could have passed on either side—he could have driven between the near kerb and the woman—he was driving about three feet from the kerb—the horse was going more than as fast again as I could walk—I did not say before the Coroner that the horse was galloping very fast; more than 12 miles an hour—they asked me if the horse was galloping with four legs at once—I said, "No, it was not galloping, it was trotting about 10 or 12 miles an hour; the driver could have prevented the accident; if he had pulled up on one side or the other it would have saved the old woman"—I don't think I said before the Coroner that it was impossible for him to pull up between the shout and the accident—I said that he could not pull up in front of the old woman—I did not say, "Going at the rate he was he could not pull up at all"—the cart went on about 20 yards or 30 yards after the accident.</p>

I am the son of the owner of this cart, and was in it on 5th April—the pony is my father's, it is 15 years old—I have never trotted it from Gravel Lane to Epsom in an hour—I took it from Gravel Lane to Richmond a little after 7 o'clock on 5th April, and got back to Gravel Lane about 10 o'clock, then started to Leicester Square about 10.30, and got back about 2; then we started to Gravel Lane—the pony was only out of the cart for half an hour between the journey to Richmond and the journey to Leicester Square—the prisoner is a friend of mine—he is an iron worker, and has frequently driven the pony for me—he has had experience in driving—we went on both journeys to deliver chairs, and had loads—we started before 3, and when we got to Guildford Street the prisoner was driving at about five or six miles an hour; we were in the middle of the road—a van was coming along the road, and the old woman came from behind it and crossed the road in a slanting direction towards the kerb and then stopped, and I shouted "Heigh! Heigh!'"—if she had gone straight across, or if she had not stopped, the accident would not have happened—the prisoner tried to pull up, but the near shaft struck her and she fell with her head towards the kerb—the cart went on five or six yards and then the prisoner pulled up and jumped down, and went to where she was lying, and did not get into the cart again—it is not true that he tried to run away until he was stopped by Barrett—I did not say to Barrett that I was a tool for allowing him to drive—I said, "You know where I live?"—he "Yes"—I said "If there is anything the matter you come down to our place"—he said "Yes," and I went on—I have been with the prisoner and seen him drive before—the pony was at a standstill when Barrett came up.</p>

I live at 3; West Place, Bermondsey, and am a checker at Goodman's Yard—I produce a duplicate invoice—I checked into the warehouse on the 25th March 50, 110, 100, 88, 94, and 73, making 515 bags of onions—I was at the loophole as checker on the 26th, and saw two vans there, one Levy's and one a stranger's—Short was in charge of one—I did not see Berry—I loaded 50 bags on Short's van assisted by ten men—some wrong marks were brought up; and I left the loophole for about ten or fifteen minutes, and on my return, about 5.30, I saw Short larking with Collins—we were about to close, and I went to another warehouse upstairs, and when I came down there were two empty quart beer pots on the loop<lb/>hole—I said to Short, "You are b——free with your beer; you must have one or two over on this van"—he said, "I have not; jump down and count them"—I jumped down and counted 50, to the best of my knowledge, and got up to the loophole again—I could not say how many bags in a row there were—I have seen them packed in such a way that there might be more than 50—I did not unload them to count, because I felt satisfied that the number was correct—I do not know who loaded the other van—there was a van of Phillips's, of Long Lane—Collins was not in the van when I went away first, but he was when I came back—Bevan and a porter named Knott and myself were outside the police-court on the 4th April—Bevan</p>

               <p>said, "I think that is the man that was on the van when I loaded"—I said, "I am sure it is"—Collins came over and said, "What do you say?"—he van said, "You are the man that was loading at our place the other day—he said, "You are a b——liar.; if you recognise or identify me I'll make it warm for you"—I did not know he was in custody then—I have not the least doubt that Collins was the man on the van—I went away the second time to lock up the premises, and was away half an hour—they went on loading—there were others there when I left, and another van was going to load after that—I am certain I loaded 50 bags—they would not have to unload again to load more—I could have seen by the tail-board if they did so—I did not see the 50 put in—beer was sent for before I went away.</p>

I am a cab proprietor, of 37, Canonbury Road, Isling<lb/>ton, and have stables in Little Queen Street, Kennington, at the back of the Horns Tavern—on 31st March I received a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in the Horns at about 4 p.m., from a customer from Mitcham—I knew nothing of Risden then, and had never spoken to Green, but had seen him in the neighbourhood—I did not notice if other persons were in the bar when I received the money—soon afterwards, while I was drinking with four customers, I noticed the prisoners come in with others—we had four small 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. bottles of cha<lb/>pagne, and I stayed after my friends had left, but had not spoken to the prisoners; Risden said to me, "Is not your name Mr. Sheen?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Used not you to have a lot of numbers at the London and Brighton Railway?"—I said, "A few"—he said he had a quantity there—I said, "I had eighteen there this time three years"—he said, "Oh! I used to be in that business myself, but I am out of it now, I am a barman"—he had a double-breasted black frock coat on, and was dressed very respect<lb/>ably, not as he is now—he said, "I am cut of a situation, I have a friend or two here and we are not very <hi rend="italic">cashy</hi>, would you mind standing treat?"—I said, "Oh, with pleasure, anybody thirsty can have a drink," and they all drank and I paid for it—Green was standing by and had not spoken, he and Risden drank with the others—I should think there were seven or eight of them—I had had a little and might be a little fresh—I did notice what I paid—I pulled out a sovereign to pay for it—I had about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. loose in my pocket—they had what they liked to call for, and when they had drank it Risden tapped me on the shoulder and said "Well, we could do another one"—I said "Not with me me you won't"—he said "A pretty b——sort of a cabmaster I expect you are"—I said "I never said I was a cabmaster"—he said "Oh! a nice fellow, no doubt; I don't know how many of you I could not do"—I replied, "No doubt-; I am not a fighting man, but I should take my own part with the likes of you"—he then shoved me and I hit him back—this was in the front of the bar, and about seven or eight people were there—he said "Come outside"—I said "Yes, if you like," and we began to fight, and the police came up and Risden went away, and I went straight to my stables—about 20 minutes afterwards (about 7 o'clock), as I was washing my hands, Risden came rushing into the stable with his coat on his arm and said "Oh! this is your b——stable, is it?" and struck me with his fist just in front of the ear—nobody was there but my stable boy, a one-armed lad—Green and two others followed Risden in within a minute—Green took me by my trowsers leg, tearing it up, and another man caught me by my collar behind, tearing it from my shirt—they were all round me, and got me down, and kicked me when I was down—while I was on my back Green was kicking me and Risden punched me about the head—I managed to turn over and get up, and then Risden pinned me from behind and Green put his hand in my right-hand trowsers pocket, pulling it inside out, and the silver flew about the coach-house—I saw him pass the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note over to Risden—I said "So that's your game, is it?" and seized Green and put him on his back—they cried "Loose him, you s——," and commenced kicking me—I said "I'll never loose him unless you cut my hands off"—I heard a cry of "Police!" and Risden and two others jumped into a cab which they had at the gates waiting for them, and away they wentc—I stuck</p>

My first order at the Horns was for dour bottles of champagne, and after my friends left I had several small glasses of ale by myself—I was not noisy or intoxicated, and was not turned out—I had been to the Rifleman, near my stables at the back, earlier in the afternoon, and to the Alderman in the morning—Eisden struck me first when we fought—I swear he is the man—I had not been fighting before with another man, nor had Eisden been taking my part—I never invited him to finish the fight at a future time, or said anything about taking down the Kensington boys—I did not hold up my hands in a threatening manner to Eisden after we had been separated, or beckon him to the stables—I had my coat off washing my hands in the stable—I did not strip to my waist and put my braces round my waist—I did not say to him "I will pay you now"—Eisden's pals kept the gates shut so that he should not be seen; I did not order anybody to shut them, and nobody pushed a cart back to make room for fighting—I told the policeman I had lost a 51. note; I did not say 50?.—Eisden did not show any inclination to go away until he heard the cry of "Police I"—I received the 51. note at the Horns from a man from Mitcham—he bought a brown cob, van, and harness the previous week for 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he gave me ten 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., notes and I have him the change and a. receipt—he gave me two names, Thorn by and Gardner—I never knew him before and have not seen him since—I have not seen his name in connection with any legal document or proceedings—he came back the next week and said "I don't like this mare, I should rather have a smaller one, have you got one you can exchange with me?" and I exchanged a pony with him for the cob and 41. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the difference in price, and he took a set of harness for the 10«. and-gave me the 51 note at the Horns—it was not paid at the Alderman—I deal in horses and am a cab proprietor, and have been so for 18 years—I was tried for horse chanting once—it was a mare that was returned to me in exchange for a pony—the man did not say it was worthless, but that it was too big—I have never heard that the pony died four days afterwards of structural disease, and I do not know that it is dead, or that criminal proceedings have been instituted against me in respect of it—J have not heard of any dissatisfaction at all—I was tried at the Middlesex Sessions for selling a horse which died, but I was acquitted.</p>

I sent a sailor boy for a policeman—I got the broom-handle up, and they took it away and knocked me down—I have only one arm—the sailor boy is not here—he was called at the police-court—when I had sent for the police I came in again, and saw Green with his hand in my master's right-hand pocket; it was turned inside out—he had shown me a little hole in that pocket before, and he put the large money in it—the hole might have let half a sovereign through—I saw three half-crowns, several florins, and some coppers on the floor while ha was holding Green down, and we picked them up and gave them to my master—as soon as the policeman was coming Risden and somebody else jumped into a should cab and drove off—my master was not drunk, he was sensible—I did not hear him challenge Risden to fight, and heard nothing said about closing the gates so that they could have a fair fight—somebody pushed them to, but they were soon pushed open again—I did not push them to—there was a cart there, but I did not see it moved to make room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cab driver, of 277, Beresford Street—I saw Sheen outside the Horns—he seemed the worse for drink—I said, "What's the matter?"—he said, "Go to b——y"—I asked him why he spoke to me like that, as he had known me many years, and we were great pals and drank together, and I was surprised—he replied "Hallo! Cruet, is it you? I've been having a scrap"—I said, "Who with?"—he said, "Oh, there he is; I'll go and finish it; I'll give it him," and went towards his stable—I did not see Risden, and did not know who he meant, as I had not seen the beginning of it—I saw him again afterwards lower down, and asked him who he had been fighting—he said, "One of the Kennington lads; I can do him myself"—some minutes afterwards I saw a constable, and asked him who he had been fighting with, and who started it"—he said, "That man (<hi rend="italic">Sheen</hi>) started it, and I ought to have locked him up"—I then saw Sheen coming down the street, and Green standing by the public house door, and I went up to him and said, "Who's he been fighting with?"—he said, "Shiner"—I said to Risden, "Come down and see it out"—he said, "Don't you interfere, Crust"—I said, "Come and finish it not; he means to finish it," and we went down the street all together—the gates were shut—Green rushed across and got into the stable, and I attempted to open the gate, but Sheen said, "Shut them b——gates; I can do him by myself; I don't want no help," and the gates were shut and pinched my fingers—Sheen had neither coat nor waistcoat on, and his trousers were buckled round his waist with his braces—Risden, I think, had a waistcoat on, but I am not sure—they appeared to be both stripped for a fight, and I saw them fighting for about two minutes, when Sheen pulled himself together to rush at Risden and got a blow—he then turned round and called "Police!"and a sailor boy fetched a policeman—I saw them on the ground—I was looking through the crack of the door, and tried to open the gates, but the horsekeeper kept it shut—when the policeman came Green was trying to part them—Sheen knocked him aside and called out, "Policeman, hold him; I felt his hand in my pocket"—he said he had lost 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or that he had 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—</p>

               <p>Risden went out through the gate, and Green went with the policeman—I have known Sheen a great many years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Risden dashed by the policeman, and I lost sight of him—I did not see a cab; I was too much on the inner side in front of the crowd—I know Hay ward, but did not see him—he was fourth behind me on the rank, and I had not seen him come off—I left my cab on the rank to see what was the matter—it is about 100 yards from the stable—I saw Sheen outside the Horns after the policeman had parted them the first time—I did not see Risden, Green was there, and I asked him who Sheen had been fighting—he went with me as far as the turning, and then popped into the gates before I could, and I lost sight of him—I saw the one-armed man when the gates were opened—I never knew him till I saw him with the pitchfork uplifted trying to strike Shiner on the head.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Queen Street—on the 31st March I saw Sheen come out of his stable door and say "Where is the b——?"—Risden was coming along by the gate—Sheen said "Oh! here you are. Come on in here, and we'll have it out"—Risden followed him in, and I went down to the street door, but there were so many people I could see nothing—I live opposite in the same house as Miss Lowe.</p>

I am a cab-driver—I was at the Horns on 31st March, about 3 p.m.—I saw Sheen come out of the public-house, and spoke to him, and had a glass with him—Risden came in about 4.30, and called for something to drink—Sheen said "I'll pay for that; you may all have what you like"—this was without anybody asking him—he was friendly for a minute, and then he turned round, and wanted to fight Risden, and struck him twice, and then Risden retaliated, and the barman jumped over and turned them out, and they had a round or two outside till the policeman separated them—Sheen then rushed at Risden again, and struck him in the face, and the policeman (<hi rend="italic">L</hi> 136) threatened to take him if he did not go away—he still walked up and down, and wanted to fight—I was not at the stable—I know nothing more—the stable is about 60 yards from the rank.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). I saw Risden and Sheen come out of the Horns, and Mr. Cox, the landlord, came out afterwards and told Risden not to come into his house any more, as he had caused him a lot of trouble and was fighting everybody that came in, and he would give him in custody if he came into his house to annoy him in his business again—after I had separated Risden and Sheen the first time Risden went to a place near called Rifleman's Court, and came back to Sheen, who was still standing there, and they began fighting again, and I went up to them again and separated them—I did not say a word about giving Sheen in custody—I said I should take them both if they caused any more disturbance—they then separated and went quietly away, Sheen—towards his stables, and Risden and two other men towards Rifleman's Court—I was fixed on duty outside the Horns—it was about 6.30 when I got to the stables, and getting dusk—there is no truth in the statement that Sheen told me he had lost 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he said a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—he was holding Green down at the time, and had him lying across a tub of water—he said, "I give this man into custody; he has robbed me of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I booked the charge at 7 o'clock at the station.</p>
