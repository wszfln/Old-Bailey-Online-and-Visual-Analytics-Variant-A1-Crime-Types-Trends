The man I seized said I squeezed him too hard, and hurt his arm; I loosened my hold, and sung out Watch! - he gave a rush, and got out of my hold, but did not run twenty yards before he was taken - he was not out of my sight. The watchman came up the moment he was stopped, and took him to the watch-house; my pocket-book contained five sovereigns. Hubbard is the man who put his hand into my pocket, and Rowe received the book - I am certain of him; it happened very near a gas-lamp: I could see Rowe's face, and he was taken in five minutes. I had sung out, "Stewart, I am robbed" - he came up just as Hubbard got from me; the other four escaped. I had been spending the evening at a club, but drank very little.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS, JUN. Q. I suppose you were struggling with the man? A. Yes. It did not last five minutes; some of the men were between me and Stewart. I had drank very little. I said Rowe was the man, directly I saw him; I did not ask Stewart if he thought that man was one of the party.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long had you left your ship? A. About a fortnight; I was paid off at Plymouth, and had been in town three days. I had been at a baker's club with Stewart; I had not drank above half-a-pint of gin.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that Hubbard did not come up when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140004"/>you were struggling with another person? A. Yes - I struggled with nobody else. I had changed a sovereign, and spent 2s.; three of us drank together: I was not well, and drank very little.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Stewart was behind you, and you called out? A. Yes - he came up in two or three minutes. - After Hubbard got from me I felt in my pocket, thinking my handkerchief might be gone also.</p>

            . I am a sailor, and lodged at the Edinburgh Castle. I took Dixon to this club, between five and six o'clock, at a house in Swan-street; as we returned, he was rather before me in Lemon-street - three men came up to him and three were behind them; Dixon called out, "James, my pocket-book is gone," and called Watch! I went up, and saw Hubbard hand the pocket-book to Rowe; Hubbard said Dixon was pinching him too hard - he then got away, and was taken by a man who stood by; Dixon caught hold of him again, and then the watchman came up; Rowe and all the rest ran away when they had got the pocket-book: I saw him give it to the others; Rowe was brought into the watch-house, and I knew him by his white coat - it was a clear night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS, JUN. Q. What had you drank? A. We had a glass of beer together, and drank some gin - we were quite sober. All six men were round him when he called me - it took us about five minutes to go to the watch-house. Dixon did not ask me if Rowe was the man; I am certain he is the man - I could not describe his features.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Was there a sovereign changed at the public-house? A. Dixon changed one down stairs, and after that paid for a little ale. I do not suppose I was twenty yards from him when this occurred.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was in Lemon-street; Dixon called out and before I got to him Hubbard ran from him; Stewart stopped him: Dixon gave him into my charge for robbing him of five sovereigns and his pocket-book; as they were taking him along somebody said that was not the way to the watch-house; Hubbard said he would walk if they would let go of him - he let him go, and he ran up Lemon-street, towards the watch-house, for twenty yards, when Stewart and another man stopped him - we took him to the watch-house. I returned with one Mr. Scurr, to look for another man, and on my return found Rowe at the watch-house door; Scurr said he was one of the party - Rowe said nothing, and I took him into the watch-house; Dixon and Stewart said he was one of the men: they had both been drinking, but knew what they were about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS, JUN. Q. Did Dixon describe the man to whom the book had been passed? A. No. Stewart said there was a man there in a light coat; my meeting Rowe was quite accidental; he had a white coat on. Both the witnesses were rather in liquor, but knew what they were about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did not Hubbard say that was not the way to the watch-house? A. I was not near enough to hear - he ran towards the watch-house when he got away.</p>
               <p>HUBBARD'S Defence. As I was going home I saw seven or eight people in the road - I crossed over - the prosecutor laid hold of me, and said I had robbed him - I told him to go away, for he was drunk; he held my arm so tight I wished him to let me go, which he did - I said I would go to the watch-house, and was walking away - he came after me, and I was stopped.</p>
               <p>ROWE's Defence. I was going home, and saw the prosecutor, his friend, and two or three more, walking up Lemon-street; I went up to see what was the matter, and when I got into the watch-house Mr. Scurr said, "I think you are one of the party, as one of them had a white coat on," but he should not like to swear to me; Dixon and Stewart both said they had no recollection of me - the watch-house keeper discharged me; I was going out, when Scurr said, "If I was not to swear to you I think I should tell a lie" - I was then locked up.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live in Suffolk-street, Borough. I was coming down Lemon-street, and saw an altercation in the road; I crossed to see what was the matter - a sailor-looking young man collared Hubbard, and accused him of robbing him; he said he was willing to go to the watch-house. I gave him my direction, in case I was wanted. Hubbard had come up at the time the altercation began - it was half-past eleven o'clock; I dare say there were fifteen or sixteen people round. I did not know Hubbard before.</p>

            . I carry out beer from Lord's cricket-ground. On the 6th of July, a little before five o'clock, I was in Grosvenor-row, and saw Barlow and another young man coming down the road - I turned round to look at some pots I had left on a wall, and saw Roberts come over Mr. More's iron garden fence, into the road, Barlow and the lad then went down the road, and the lad took something over the fence where Roberts had come from - I could not see what it was; the fence is six or seven feet high: he got up and reached it over, and handed it into Barlow's hand; Roberts had then got some distance up the road - they followed him: I went down to Mr. Hall, who lived in Grove-end-row, and told him - I then went and rang the prosecutor's bell; the servant came to the door: I then went up the road, and saw Benns standing in Hall's-place; we went up the road together, and saw three men standing in a field together; I was some distance from them; Benns got up first - I went up, and found Barlow in his custody, and knew him - I took him to the house, and then to the office. Roberts was brought into Mr. More's; I knew him also - the third man was not taken.</p>

Cork came to me - I went up the Abbey-road, into Kilburn-fields, and saw the two prisoners and another at the corner of the field, together, and the timepiece laying between them, partly tied up in a handkerchief; on seeing me one of them took it up, and threw it into a ditch - I think it was Barlow; they set off running, and I after them; Barlow threw himself into a ditch - I took him out, and brought him to Mr. More's house; I am certain of Roberts - I was close to him, but could not take both.</p>

            . I am a well-digger, and live in Upper Boston-place, Mary-le-bone. On the 6th of July, about five o'clock, I met Roberts, alone, in Grove-end-road, going towards Abbey-road - I said nothing to him. About twenty or thirty yards behind him I met Barlow and a young lad; Barlow had something in his left hand, covered with two handkerchiefs: when they passed me I looked and saw four brass nobs at the bottom of it - it was a time-piece. I met the witnesses, and gave them information; I went with them to a field. and saw the two prisoners and another: I saw Barlow put the time-piece into the ditch - they ran away. I got the time-piece up, took it to the prosecutor's house, and gave it to Buckeridge. I did not see them taken.</p>

            . I am in Messrs. Gunns' employ. Having lost property I and Bass concealed ourselves in the cellar at dinner time, and saw the prisoner come into the shop alone - he stood there about five minutes, then went out with this property on his shoulder, and shut the door after him; we secured him on the step. The door had a secret spring, which he knew how to open; I jumped out of the cellar, and secured him with the pump-handles and hooks; he said, "Oh! Cook, it is not your's"</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was looking for work, and met a gentleman in Houndsditch, who said he wanted some pump-screws and handles; I gave him my direction - he said he would call on me on Saturday. I was passing the prosecutors' shop - there are two windows to the cellar; I called to Cook - he made no answer; the door was not fastened, and I went in, but not seeing him, and these things laying there, I took them in my hand, and was going down the steps to call him from the cellar - the moment I put my head down he seized me - I had no idea of taking them away.</p>

I collared one, pushed the other against the house, and secured him - I asked what they wanted there - they said they came to ask for some water; I asked why they came for water when the garden-gate and house were fastened up.

I heard a coach coming behind me, and a horn blow; I was then directly opposite <placeName id="t18260914-15-crimeloc80">Barnet-church</placeName>

I turned round to the coachman, and said, "You villain, you have been the cause of this;" he said, "Me, it was no fault of mine - my guard blew the horn," and I think he said he called to me, and I should have got out of the way. I went round to the other side, between the coach and the church-yard, as he said there was not sufficient room; I said, "Here is almost room for another coach;" he made little or no reply; I should think there were six or seven feet of room from the off side of the mail to the wall; I have since ascertained the distance was seven feet. My wife was taken away by somebody - I did not see her for a quarter of an hour. I asked the coachman to come down and give me his address, which he did on my second or third application. The accident happened on a flat high road; there is no hill. I was driving at the rate of seven or eight miles an hour - it was quite light. My wife was in good health before - she remained at Barnet eleven days, and was then brought home, and died at Bethnal-green. Mr. Jeffs attended her. On the following morning, between three and four o'clock, I went into the road to survey in what situation I had been, and found my wife's ear-ring broken in the dust, and conclude that was the very spot where the wheel came in contact with my wife's head - I measured the road with my feet; the ear-ring was nine footsteps and a half from the foot-path, on my side. I did not measure the distance to the other side.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Do you know the width of the road? A. Twenty-three feet; there is a post to keep the carriages from going against the church-wall, but the wall turns off round just there, so that it does not occupy any space. My mother-in-law sat, as it were, between us. I heard the horn blow - I merely looked aside, and saw the leaders - they had not at that moment passed me; I saw their heads approach as I looked round; my eye was on the leaders, but at the same time on my own horse; they became like three horses abreast, as I just looked sideways. The wheel did not go over my wife's head. I had just started from the Wellington, public-house, and was going rather faster than usual - I was perfectly sober. I had not started above a minute - my pony was pretty fresh. Mr. Morris attended my wife at Barnet.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she not removed contrary to his orders? A. He seemed unwilling for her to go, and said he considered it as dangerous for her to go as at first, but she always said, "I shall die, and let me die at home" - she was moved in a glass-coach.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Is there any post on the side of the road to diminish the space left for the mail? A. I believe there is a post against the wall, but it could not make more than a foot difference.</p>

            . I am a farmer. I had been to market on this evening; a gig passed me, and then the mail passed - I heard the horn blow, and saw the mail strike the gig - I cannot say what part of the mail struck it; I was ten or twelve yards behind them. I saw the deceased almost under the coach wheel; the coachman had stopped then - I had not seen him endeavour to stop before he struck the gig; it appeared to me that the gig was in danger. There was plenty of room for the mail to have gone more to the right; I stopped the chaise-horse; I saw somebody with his shoulder to the wheel of the mail, as if pushing it back; the mail went at about the regular rate, about ten miles an hour, I suppose. I think there was no want of care on the coachman's part - he was on his right side. The prisoner was the coachman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were you when the gig and mail passed? A. Nearly opposite the King's Head public-house, walking in the road. I was as near the middle of the road as possible after they passed. The mail stopped directly the accident happened. I was behind, and saw the mail and the gig.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live at Shoreditch. I saw Mrs. Farbridge the morning after the accident; there were three fractures on her lower jaw, and a dreadful contusion, extending the whole length of the neck - her collar-bone was fractured, and the shoulderbone much bruised, and injured; she had great difficulty of breathing, and altogether it was a horrible case; I was convinced she could not live - she was sensible, but could not speak. I recommended her being brought to town, which was done in nine or ten days - I then attended her daily - she mended for a day or two, but died on the 5th of July. I believe the actual cause of her death was inflammation of the lungs, produced by the external injury.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had inflammation taken place when she was moved? A. I believe it commenced when the injury was given, and gradually increased till she died; I only saw her once at Barnet - I advised her coming home, that she should have a physician. I thought the case was dangerous from the first; her removal would not increase the inflammation in the state she was in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming very steadily round Barnet - it is a very dangerous place. I saw the chaise; the guard blew the horn, and I hallooed out; I was pulling up my horses at the time; the wheel got entangled with my wheel; her head was under my wheel: I was as careful as a man could be. I have driven the mail twenty-two years, and never had an accident.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to HENRY FARBRIDGE. Q. When you turned aside a little, and saw the leaders, can you say you did not pull the right-hand rein a little? A. I pulled to the near side when I was opposite the clock, but pulled neither right or left afterwards; I am certain I did not pull them when I turned. I have been used to drive for about twenty-three years.</p>

            . I am post-master at Barnet. I saw Mr. Farbridge drive by my house, with two other persons in his gig; I thought by the manner of holding his reins he was not accustomed to drive, and was fearful an accident might occur, as I heard the mail go by - I did not see the accident.</p>

               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Where did you see him? A. Passing my door; he might get perhaps fifteen yards before the mail got to my door. The ground slopes rather towards London; the road is about eight yards wide where the accident happened; three carriages might pass with careful driving.</p>

            . - I was guard to the Liverpool mail on this night. At Barnet we saw a gig before us - I blew the horn full one hundred and fifty yards off, and continued to blow till we got up to it, and the prisoner hallooed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140010"/>as well; the horses and the fore-wheel cleared the gig, but instead of the prosecutor drawing his rein to pull out, he stopped for an instant, and came back on the carriage - the horse jibbed back as it were, and so the mischief happened; the step of the mail struck the gig - our splinter-bar projects as near the extremity of the wheel as possible - the bars of the leaders project as near the same length as possible, and, if they pass without touching, we consider that the coach itself will pass. The prisoner pulled up immediately - he must have had his horses very tight in hand - the wheel did not go over the deceased.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Did you ever drive? A. I have in case of emergency - but seldom; the lower step of the coach turns up - I cannot say whether it was turned up - the chaise might have turned it down - it came exactly against it, and bent it - we were on our proper side; I do not believe there was more than three feet of room on our right side, but there was room to pass if the horse had not knocked against the carriage; the backing of the gig caused the accident. As soon as the coachman got somebody to mind the horses he went in and gave his address. We were not going at more than seven miles and a half an hour - our time from South Mims to town is an hour and forty-five minutes - it is fifteen miles and a half - we were coming up. The prisoner has surrendered here to-day.</p>

            . I live at Barnet. I was standing at my door, about ten yards from where the accident happened; I had a perfect view of what passed - I saw Mr. Farbridge, his wife, and mother, coming down in a gig, on the off side, by the church wall - the horn blew some time before the mail got up - Jervis, who was at my house, called to him three or four times to come on his own side, and the coachman hallooed some time before he got up. Mr. Farbridge drew directly across the road - the mail was on its own side - the right rein was pulled by Mr. Farbridge or his mother, and that occasioned the accident; I saw it plainly - the coachman stopped instantly. The deceased was brought to my house, and remained there eleven days. Mr. Morris saw her three or four times a day - she got much better, and was in a fair way of doing well.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. What are you? A. My husband keeps an ironmonger's shop there - the prisoner was quite a stranger to me - he called six or seven days after the accident, to know how she was. I heard Jervis call to Mr. Farbridge to come on his own side - the mail was then about twenty yards from him - he had time to get out of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not the coachman time to stop? A. I do not know - I should not think he had occasion to stop. I swear that Farbridge was on his wrong side - my house is directly opposite the church-yard corner.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. When the gig was called to it crossed over to its proper side? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mrs. BETTY. I live next door to Mrs. King. I was at my ground floor window, which is rather high - I could only see straight before me - I heard a horn blow, and a hallooing, that made me go to the window, as it was a particular noise; I saw a gig coming with particularly large wheels - the Liverpool mail came on its own side of the road, as near as it could be with propriety to the iron railing of the church-yard; the horses and the fore-wheel passed the gig, then the chaise, instead of going straight on (for then the coach would have cleared it) instantly flew back towards the coach doors, and immediately upset.</p>
               <p>Q. As far as you can judge, what occasioned the accident? A. Great neglect in driving, on Mr. Farbridge's part - but I am not used to drive - if he had gone straight on he would have cleared the coach.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Are you acquainted with Wells? A. I never spoke to him: Farbridge was on his right side when I saw him.</p>

            . I keep the King's Head public-house, at Barnet, on the opposite side to the church. I stood in the foot-path, in front of my door, about thirty yards from where this occurred, and could see what happened perfectly well. I first saw the gig on the same side as my house - I saw the mail coming from the post-office - the gig passed my door, and the horn blew - instead of the gig keeping on that side it darted towards the other side - the coachman hallooed very loud when he got nearer to it - the horses and front of the coach passed, but the man in the gig pulled the rein, which pulled the horse from the coach and turned the back of the gig into the lock of the coach. This, in my opinion, caused the accident - I am not acquainted with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. You think it was occasioned by the driver of the gig bringing the hind wheel into the lock of the coach? A. Yes; if it had kept on properly it would have been within a foot of the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not at least seven feet of space where the mail might have gone to the right side and not been near the gig? A. No, there might be about six inches from the mail to the post, but I did not measure it - there is a drain which it must have gone on if it had gone nearer.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Where was the drain? A. Near the coach - there is a post to keep coaches from running on the drain, which is between two and three feet from the wall.</p>

            . I keep the Mitre public-house, at Barnet. I was about forty yards off when this accident happened, but cannot state the particulars. I went up before the coachman got off the box, and saw where the mail had pulled up - I measured the distance of the hind wheel to the post - there was only the length of my foot between the wheel and the post; it had not moved for I saw the blood lay under the step; I measured the road yesterday - it is twenty-two feet six inches from the post to the near side of the road - the fore wheel of the coach stood against the post - the hind wheel would have come nearer to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Could not three carriages go abreast in that space? A. Yes - the gig was in the middle of the road - there must have been a space of about two yards and a half on his near side.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live at Hammersmith. I was sent for on the night of the 31st of July, and sent my assistant; I saw her next morning about ten o'clock - she was much bruised - her left eye was black, and nearly closed - she had a cut over the right eve and another on the side of the head - she complained of much pain over the whole of the belly, particularly the lower part, and her bladder was ruptured - I told her so, and that I considered her in danger; she said she was very bad, and should not be here long; she appeared sensible of her danger; I do not think she thought she was dying at that moment; I was not certain her bladder was ruptured, and did not consider her case as entirely hopeless. I found afterwards that her bladder was ruptured, and that was certainly the cause of her death. She never said she was dying, and could not recover. Her wounds appeared to have been inflicted by a blunt instrument - the cut on the back of her head, appeared as if she had fallen on some broken crockery - she was moved to St. George's hospital that day, and I did not see her afterwards. The rupture of the bladder must have been occasioned by some violence, and the bladder must have been in a state of distension at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Could you judge whether she had been drinking? A. No; her falling violently on any thing, with her bladder distended, might occasion the rupture - any very violent concussion would do it - falling on a chair or tub might do it, if she was struck near the region of the bladder; frequent intoxication increases secretion and produces a weakness in the bladder - a fall might do it if the bladder was excessively distended, not otherwise.</p>

            . I am house-surgeon at St. George's hospital. The deceased was brought there on Tuesday evening, about seven o'clock - she complained of exquisite tenderness on being touched on the lower part of the belly, and there was great anxiety in her countenance - I asked how she met with the accident, and from what she said my impression was that she had ruptured some large blood vessel, or the bowels - I thought she would die, but did not communicate that to her - she told me, when I was examining her wounds, she thought she should not live - I think she said so when I first examined her, but I am not certain whether it was before or after she told me what had happened; she died next day about three o'clock in the afternoon. I opened her body, and found the bladder ruptured in two places - that must have caused her death - it must have been occasioned by a violent blow or fall - there were no external marks of violence.</p>

            . I am a stage-coachman, and lodge with my sister in Fulham-fields. On the 31st of July, as I was going home I heard a noise like china and glass breaking; I met my sister, and afterwards went to the prisoner's door - there was a light there, and the neighbours were outside - the prisoner was in the house - I would not let any one go in till he came out to fetch some water - I saw him come out with a pan - somebody lighted him to the pump - I saw his wife before he came out, laying in her blood; he never returned - I fetched a surgeon, and went into the house with him; I had not gone in before - I then saw the woman lying on a pillow down stairs - the blood was washed off her face, but there was a great deal about her clothes; I helped to carry her up stairs, and staid there all night; between three and four o'clock that morning I saw the prisoner by the side of a potatoe field, close to the road, about a hundred and twenty yards from his house - when he saw me he went down the lane, and when he found I gained ground on him he took to his heels and ran like a deer, and jumped over into Mr. Sandall's ground; I called to him, and told him I wanted him - he got over the fence, and gave himself up to me - I asked him what noise he had been kicking up the night before, and told him his wife was dead; he said "I have made up my mind to die for the bl-dy b-h;" I took him to Hammersmith, and gave him to a watchman. When I went to the house a great deal of crockery lay broken on the floor, near the fire-place; he appeared sober when I saw him. When I carried his wife up stairs she seemed very wet with blood.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What coach do you drive? A. I drive the Richmond coach off the stones. Hawkins was with me when the prisoner surrendered to me; he might have heard what passed. I swear I spoke to the prisoner and said his wife was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not his answer "Good God, that is impossible?" A. I heard nothing of the kind; I did not hear him called an old - when he went to the pump - I did not hear him abused at all; the women called him a murdering thief; I heard nothing else; a great many people had been merry-making at Hawkins' house, and I had gone there, at a quarter to twelve, to fetch my brother-in-law.</p>

            . My husband is a labourer - we live next door to the prisoner. On the 31st of July I was at home all day - I was in bed when this happened - his wife was merry-making at Hawkins' house that evening;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140012"/>I was not there, but I saw her going in and out between five and six o'clock - she seemed rather intoxicated; I believe they lived comfortably when she was sober - she was given to drink.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not he very kind to her when she was sober? A. Never otherways - he is an inoffensive man, and associated with none of his neighbours; I never knew him given to drink; I saw her at Hawkins' between five and six o'clock - she was forward in liquor then.</p>
               <p>COURT to Mr. BOWLING. Q. State particularly what the deceased said on the subject of the accident? A. On my saying I suspected her bladder was ruptured she immediately said he had done it by kneeling on her - I cannot say whether she said he or the villain - I think the husband's name had not been mentioned - something was said to her, immediately afterwards, as to her husband's having caught her with some man in a shed, she said that was false, and when he was drunk he would say any thing. No doubt kneeling on her would have done it had the bladder been distended - taking a quantity of liquor would distend it.</p>
               <p>Mr. RUSSELL. She told me her husband had knocked her down and knelt on her - that would cause the rupture if the bladder was distended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Could there have been an effusion of the urine without a rupture of the bladder? A. No; if she had fallen on a chair or tub it might have happened, if she fell on her stomach. She was brought to the hospital in a cart, by two females, who left in a few minutes - the name of Sarah Bateman was written over her bed by the porter - it is usual for him to obtain the name.</p>

            . I live next door to the prisoner. On the 31st of July his wife came into my house, about nine o'clock and at two - I saw her in the evening, and about eleven; she had been drinking beer - she was very forward in liquor at two o'clock, and was quite tipsy in the evening; I saw her last at ten o'clock - she was very tipsy, and her child, who is about fourteen years old, was begging her to come home: she had been tipsy nearly all the week; the prisoner behaved kind to her except when she was in liquor; she always said he was a good husband, and kept to his work - and if she could wear gold he would be pleased.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear what passed that night? A. I sat up with her, and assisted in putting her into a cart next day, to send her to the hospital, but did not see her after she was there. After the surgeon was gone I said to her "Lord have mercy upon you, you are dying;" she said she thought she should die, several times; I asked if she knew whether her husband stamped or knelt on her; she said she did not know what he did to her - this was about twelve o'clock on the day it happened - there were tubs and chairs in the lower room.</p>

            . I am keeper of the gaol at Norwich, for the county of Norfolk, and was so in 1813. I remember the prisoner there - he came into my custody on the 26th of March, 1813. I have referred to the journal of the gaol for the date - it is kept by myself - I have not got it here - I referred to it on the 14th of July, on receiving a letter from Mr. Stafford - I have no recollection of the date except from reference to that book.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner going into Court to be tried? A. Yes; I took him into Court at the Lammas Assize, 1813 - he had been in my custody about four months, and rather better than a month afterwards. I took him to Portsmouth, in consequence of the sentence of the Court - he was in my custody full five months - I saw him daily, except duty called me away - it was my duty to notice his person; I saw him tried - he is the same person who was tried - I afterwards accompanied him to Portsmouth - we were two nights and a day on the journey. I am certain, beyond doubt, of his being the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ALLEY. Q. Have you many prisoners in your gaol? A.

Mr. Salmon, who is not living; I took five or six more to Portsmouth with him - our prisoners at that time wore a gaol dress as soon as they came in.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Were you displaced for misconduct? A.

            . I was Captain of the Army, on which Crowly was on board; I certainly would not believe him on his oath - I dismissed him shortly after I left England, for making away with my property - he was succeeded by a person; and about six months afterwards he fell on his knees, and begged I would restore him to his situation, on account of his wife and children - he knew the cause of his dismissal; he was despised by every body in the ship. There was a placard on our mizen - it is worn out; the prisoner conducted himself very well indeed on board our vessel; I trusted him with all my stores, and so did all the passengers.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Have you traded long to New South Wales? A. I have been three voyages; I did not know the prisoner was on board till we left; I did not have him from the convict establishment; I did not know what he was: he was found three days after we got to sea, and I have no doubt Crowly secreted him there, for he was not mustered with the crew; he was to have no wages. I found four persons on board before I started, and delivered them up. I was three hundred miles at sea when I found the prisoner; he went ashore at Monte Video, and never returned; I reported him there to Mr. Hood, as being on board unexpectedly; he was called by the name of James.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever write from the ship about him? A. Yes, to the consul, Mr. Hood; I suspected he was Shales by the placard; I knew such a man had escaped: I did not believe him to be the man; some people on board called him James Miller.</p>
               <p>JURY to JOHN JOHNSON. Q. Do you take a description of the prisoners when they come in? A. Yes; I have not got it here; he was about twenty years old when convicted.</p>

The prisoner was three weeks in my service; I had my suspicions, and as I was going into the kitchen I found a pair of new stockings hanging out of his coat pocket, which was in the cupboard; while he was cleaning the front room window I called up Brown, my shopman, and left him there while I fetched Sapwell, the officer. I called Brown down - he was to send the prisoner out with a parcel; I cannot state what transpired afterwards, except that after he was detained I saw him throw some duplicates on the floor, which I took up, and gave to Sapwell.</p>

On Wednesday, the 16th of July, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I saw him and Lee in Leonard-square; Sanders and a person named Ghost were there; Lavey struck Lee twice - then Lee struck him; they fought two rounds - the watchman parted them, and they went home; Lavey challenged Lee to fight on Sunday morning - they agreed during the week not to fight, but on Saturday I understood they agreed to fight; they met at Shoreditch church on Sunday morning, about half-past seven; all the prisoners were there, and a quantity of people; they began to fight in a field about eight o'clock, and fought more than an hour, with their fists; there were no regular seconds - several acted as seconds. Lavey had the best of it, but at the close of the fight Lee fell with his elbow on Lavey's throat - it was an accident in the fall- he was taken up by his second, and put on his knee, but he fell senseless; I and two more helped to take him to a doctor, who bled him, and ordered him to the London Hospital - I went to see him there - he died at two o'clock that afternoon. I saw no unfair blows struck; the other prisoners acted as seconds, as well as others on the ground - when one was tired the other helped. I saw Stockweller pick Lee up two or three times; Smith picked Lavey up three or four times; Sewell picked up Lee once or twice; and Sanders picked up Lavey once or twice. There were fifty or one hundred people there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not the principal object of their interference seem to prevent any unfair blows being struck? A. Yes. Stockweller tore his trousers, and left them after the first three rounds; he sat down on the bank, and did not interfere again; he was not there five minutes; the accident happened at least an hour after - he was ten or twelve yards off - he said nothing, but looked on.</p>

            . I am a pupil at the London Hospital. Lavey was brought there at ten o'clock in the morning, perfectly insensible; he was bruised on his temple, forehead, neck, face, and under the left ear; the bruises appeared to have been produced by blows from a fist; he died about two o'clock that day. I opened him next day, and found a considerable quantity of extravasated blood on the brain, which caused his death; a severe blow or fall was sufficient to occasion it - his stomach and chest were quite perfect.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If in fighting he used violent exertion himself, and fell from that exertion, might not that have occasioned the extravasation? A. Yes.</p>

On Saturday night, as I was coming home, he said he wished to fight on Sunday morning, and in the morning I met him by Shoreditch church, as I had been for some watercresses; he asked if I meant to fight - I said No; he said then he would hit me in the mouth - I did not wish that, and two or three others persuaded me to fight, and I went and fought him in the <placeName id="t18260914-25-crimeloc138">Cat and Mutton fields</placeName>

After he passed that there was a truck, drawn by two men, about four yards before him; the fore wheel caught hold of the truck, and threw the man down who was next the waggon, and the hind wheel went over him; I think the prisoner must have seen the cart and truck; the man called out very loud, and the waggon stopped when the wheel was on the man's legs; it was backed, and the man got out from under the wheel - he was taken to the hospital - I believe he was a pauper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he appear an infirm man? A. He was fifty-nine years old I believe - the other man was not hurt.

On the 12th of July, at two o'clock in the morning, I thought I heard a noise; I got out of bed and heard the church clock strike two, and my own clock also; I listened for ten minutes, and hearing no further noise, on getting into bed again, I awoke Mrs. Pascall - I heard the noise a second time, and got out of bed - I could not find the key of my chamber door for some time, and it was three o'clock when I got down stairs; when I heard the second noise it was light enough to see some distance - the noise was the falling of the Venetian blind; I found the bolts of the parlour door strained open, and missed every thing from the side-board except a large carving-knife, which was placed there as if for self-defence; I missed all the things enumerated in the indictment; I cannot say that I saw them all there the night before; the outer sash of the window was lifted up, and the lower hinge of the lower inside window shutter was burst open, and so the bar was pushed up. On the 14th, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, Levy called and informed me he knew where the property was - I had before that offered a reward of 50l.; in consequence of what passed between me and Levy, I and a friend went to Dr. Beal's, at nine o'clock at night, and met Levy - we went with him into the neighbourhood of the prisoner's house; Levy stationed us where we should find the prisoner - it was then about half-past ten o'clock; we all went to the prisoner's door in Well-street; I saw him and brushed against him - I had four or five persons with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140017"/>me; he said "What the devil are you doing here;" Levy said "That is the man;" and I collared him; he hove me down, and I fell upon him; he had a canvas frock on, and in the scuffle an immense quantity of glass fell from his person - it was part of the property I had lost. He was secured and taken to Dr. Beal's, and sent to the watch-house. Levy proposed we should go to a hedge in Bow-lane, about half a mile from Well-street, and after looking in the hedge with a light, we found a quantity of my property (a pair of bronze candlesticks, and other things) which I knew to be mine; from there we went to the watch-house - the prisoner had then been searched; I said"Oh, Hayes, I am sorry to see you in this situation;" his reply was that he had found the things. I knew there was such a man before, and have occasionally employed him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. You had employed him? A. I sometimes employ three hundred men in a day; I do not recollect employing him, but I am told that I have. I offered a reward on the evening of the 13th- Levy had not called then; the prisoner was searched before I got to the watch-house; it was dusk when we apprehended him; Levy was near us when the glass fell from him - some of it broke, and some was picked up whole; the glass was not marked; the value of the property found in the field is about 25l., for the watch was not found; some of the glass was in the field. I value all my property at 50l., including the watch - I gave 5l. for that, and eighteen guineas for the chain.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you came down at three o'clock, was it light enough to see a man's countenance? A. No; the day had began to break; there were two men under my window, but I could not see what colour their jackets were. My bill offers a reward in proportion to the property recovered, on conviction.</p>

            . I live at No. 1, Borer's-buildings, Cutler-street, Houndsditch, and am a dealer in foreign curiosities. I first saw the prisoner on Friday, the 14th of July - he came up to me in the middle of Poplar, and asked me if I would buy any things of him; I asked what things - he said cut glass; I had seen bills about the street - it struck me they might be the same goods, and I said I would buy them.</p>
               <p>Q. The bill advertised a reward? A. I was too much agitated to think of the reward - I was thinking more about the prosecutor's robbery. He took me to his house in East India-court, Well-street, Poplar, and told me to call on him at nine o'clock. I left him, went about my business for two or three hours, and then went to the prosecutor's, supposing it was his property, but I did not know it. I went at nine o'clock by appointment, and found him at his house; he took me to a field behind a hedge, in the road leading to Bromley, Middlesex, by Bow; before we got to the field he shewed me a silver hunting watch, with a ribbon to it; he said "The things I am going to shew you are queer;" I understood his meaning - he took me to the field, searched along the hedge for two bronze candlesticks, and two cut wine-glasses; he said "D-n it, I cannot find these - I suspect somebody has found them;" he searched further, and found a silver salt-spoon, a china knife-rest, and four shells; he said "I must leave this place, and come somewhere else;" he crossed over the hedge, took me to a ditch, knelt down, pulled up his sleeves, and pulled out two decanters, a handkerchief with eight wine glasses in it, three cut-glass salt-cellars and stands, two cut-glass butter pots and stands: he asked me to purchase these things of him; I asked how much he wanted for them; he said 30s. - and, not with a view of buying, I offered 15s.; he said he would not take it, but I should have them for 18s. I accompanied him towards home, and when he came to the hedge where he had been before, he crossed over, and put some of the cut-glass there: we proceeded on towards Captain Pascall's; he said "You may as well have these things - we are near the place I took them from." We went towards his house, and on the way he asked if I would have them - he would not take less.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you get to his house? A. Between ten and eleven o'clock. I had stationed the prosecutor and his friends in a court; I went to the prisoner's house with him, and directly after he was taken by the prosecutor and his friends - he was giving the glass to his wife in the court. I went out of the court, gave Captain Pascall a signal and he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you mean to say he came up to you in the street, and told you this story, all at once? A. He did; he was a perfect stranger. I had seen the bills up very near his house - he had the same opportunity of seeing them as I had - the bills were in High-street - he lived about three minutes walk from there - I went to no officer but went to the prosecutor about seven o'clock; I intended to do it at the time, but had business to attend to at two or three places, where persons had goods to dispose of; I met him about one o'clock - about three minutes walk from the prosecutor's; I had to go to Blackwall - it would be out of my way to call on the prosecutor going there; I thought if I went when I had done my business it would be just time to attend to the prisoner at nine o'clock; I did not get home till one o'clock at night; I went to the prosecutor's about six o'clock; I was agitated, but was determined to attend to it; I knew a reward was offered.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath is it for the sake of the reward, or public justice that you do this? A. Public justice; I do not care about the reward a bit; I certainly expect it as it is offered, if the prisoner is convicted, as it is on conviction; such a thing never happened to me before; I have been about the neighbourhood daily for four years, and he might know me by sight; I never spoke to him nor saw him before; he did not tell me where the things were - it was not the first time I heard the word queer - it means stolen; I do not keep a shop - I deal with eight or ten respectable tradesmen; I sell goods as I buy them, and keep them at home - I live with my father; I met the prisoner three or four miles from my house; I told nobody of this till I got to the prosecutor's; I had seen the bills about eleven o'clock that morning; I did not tell him of the bills; it would be giving him an opportunity of making away with the property. I was agitated but knew what I was about; as he told me to call at nine o'clock I did not suppose he would take the property away before; he took me to his house - his wife was present - I could not tell what the property was till he shewed it me, and could not be certain it was the prosecutor's; he did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140018"/>not tell me I was to go to the fields, but said he would take me somewhere; it was agreed that the prosecutor should wait at Dr. Beal's, while I went with the prisoner, and saw if they were the goods; nobody saw him shew me the property in the fields; two persons passed but took no notice. The prosecutor does not claim the watch which he shewed me.</p>

            . I am constable of All Saints, Poplar. On the 14th of July I attended with the prosecutor and others, and apprehended the prisoner about half-past ten; he made a most desperate resistance at being handcuffed, during which time several pieces of glass fell from his person, which McLean picked up; I afterwards went to the watch-house, and said I was sorry to see him there- he replied that he had found the property: I went to the field with Levy, the prosecutor, McLean and two watchmen, and found the decanters, chandeliers, and butter-glasses, which I now produce - the prisoner was then in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you search the prisoner's house? A. No. I knew him before, and said I was sorry to see him there.</p>

            . I was in the prosecutor's service. I went to bed at half-past eleven o'clock, and left the parlour perfectly secure as usual - I was the last person up, and saw every thing secure when I bolted the door; all the articles, stated in the indictment, were on the side-board when I went to bed (examining the property produced); this knife-rest I left on the side-board drawer, with master's watch, chain, seals, and key; this curtain ornament belonged to the parlour bell-pull - I saw it the night before: this is our salt-spoon, and the only one I left on the side-board; I know these butter saucers and glass, by having used them daily for nine months; also the decanters found in the ditch, and the wine glasses, by continually using them - these two shells were on the mantel-piece and these bronze candlesticks were also on the mantel-piece - these salt-cellars were used the night before - I swear to every thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. What do you call these candlesticks? A. Chandeliers. This ornament had been pulled off the bell the day before.</p>
               <p>MR. PASCALL. These decanters are worth 15s.; the chandliers two guineas; salt-cellars 4s.; salt-spoon 4s.; seven wine-glasses 4s.; two sugar-basins, 10s.; the butter sancers are worth 1l. My watch was safe the night before - I have not found it - it cost me 5l., and the chain 18l.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do not you call these things candlesticks? A. No - chandeliers; I do not know what they cost but know they were expensive - I have had them four years. My wife is ill, and has been given over, ever since this happened: I am sole occupier of the house.</p>
               <p>COURT to LEVY. Q. How came you to know that the things you pointed out to Bradley were in the hedge? A. I saw the prisoner put them there.</p>

He asked what I would give for it; I said I could give nothing for that; he said he had a horse he could bring me, if I would try it. He brought the horse away, and came up to my place in King's-head-yard, and I tried it; Lock said he had known the horse for three years; I asked what the price would be if I should like him after trying him a day; the prisoner asked what sort of a horse I wanted; I said a strong cart horse, worth about 8l. or 9l.; he said he wanted a little money to go to a fair; I said I would let him have 50s. on this horse till he brought me one to suit: I had but 49s. - he took that, and left the horse with me; I had it about six weeks, I think, when Hoggett came and claimed it in Old Gravel-lane, by the London Docks - I gave it up to him; I did not see the prisoner afterward till he was taken - he never brought another horse - one was brought to me but not by him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who brought it? A.

            . I am a carman, and live at the King's Head, Kingsland-road. I know Bevan.

I went to a house in Golden-lane to him; I saw him again on Sunday morning, between six and seven o'clock, in Old-street-road - he had nothing with him then, and I had no conversation with him; he had told me overnight to tell Bevan he would bring the horse to Gott's stables on the Sunday morning; Bevan had asked me on Saturday if I knew who had one to sell; I said I thought I did, and went to Merrett, and he told me to tell him he would bring one there.</p>

Baker and Bevan were with me when I met the prisoner on Sunday, and we all four took the horse up to the King's Head, which is nearly a mile from Gotts', and tried it; the prisoner went with us to Gotts', and got the horse - Bevan lent him 49s. on it till the Friday following, when he was to bring him another - I do not know whether he did take him another - I never took one. I saw the same horse at Worship-street afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you a horse-dealer? A. No- I only knew Merrett before by sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not ask him to sell this horse for you? A. No - I am certain of that; I did not take another horse to the King's Head; I thought I knew this horse by its working at the back of the White Raven - it was so much like that horse, I thought I could swear to it. I pledged myself that I had known it three years, and one James Howard pledged the same. I did not tell Bevan afterwards that I was mistaken - I did not find it out till the horse was owned. I was at the King's Head afterwards, when another horse was brought, and should know the man who brought it, but I did not; I was there by accident, standing outside the gate - it might be between eight and nine o'clock in the morning. I live half a mile off - that horse was sold to Harwood; I do not know where the prisoner got this gelding from; I told the prisoner I had known it three years, behind the White Raven, and he said that was where he brought it from.</p>

            . I live in Mill-row, Kingsland-road. I was passing the King's Head gates on Sunday morning, when Bevan asked me to go and look at a horse; we went to Gotts' stables, the Crosby's Head - we met the prisoner in Pitfield-street in our way; Lock said he was the man who had it to sell, and he went back with us and showed us the horse; we then went to King's Head yard - Bevan said it was too little; the prisoner said he would let him have it to work a day or two, and would then bring him another, as he was going to a fair.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Lock appear to know the prisoner? A. We should have known nothing of the prisoner, or horse if Lock had not come to us. We were about half an hour in the yard looking at the horse.</p>

I directed Gould and Harrison to watch. Next morning Belsham brought me a sack, which I knew to be mine - it contained four bullocks' udders, two tripes, a bullock's feck, and fifteen penny bundles of tripe; the udders were part of what I marked the night before. I went into the tripe-house, and missed them - there is a door goes from my dwelling-house into the slaughter-house, and then into the tripe-house: they all join together, and are under one roof; there is a back door to the tripe-house and stable, opening into a court in Banner-street; the tripe-house has been added to the building since I have lived there. I and my family all slept at home on this night; the house was fastened up, and in the morning I found somebody had broken into the stable, from the court, by moving one of the wooden staves - it has been cut so as to be moved in and out, to admit a person through the window; I had not examined it for two or three days, and cannot say when it was done.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Robinson, Bolton, and Watt, of Birmingham - they have a house in town. On the 11th of April I procured seven 5l. Bank notes, Nos. 6538 to 6544, dated the 8th of March, and five hundred 1l., Nos. 80,001 to 80,500, and enclosed them in a parcel, directed to Mr. John Robinson, Soho, Birmingham; I took it to the Spread Eagle, Grace-church-street, and delivered it to the prisoner Foyle, at the coach-office, and paid him 2l. 4s. 6d., as an insurance on it, as a valuable parcel.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How do you know the numbers of the notes? A. I took a memorandum of them at the time.</p>

            . I am book-keeper at the Spread Eagle, and was so in April, and so was Foyle. I was not present when this parcel was brought, but Foyle pointed it out to me, and told me it was insured for 535l.; it was directed to Mr. Robinson, Soho, Birmingham; I delivered it to Evans, the guard of the Birmingham coach - Foyle was in the office, three or four yards from me, when I gave Evans particular directions about it; I referred to the book, and saw it entered in Foyle's hand-writing; the other parcels were called over to me by the porter - I checked them off, then gave Evans this, stating it to be a valuable parcel; Foyle went away, according to his custom, before the coach started.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did any thing more happen than there does every night? A. No - he left at his usual time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you gave the parcel to the guard did you speak loud? A. No - I leaned over the counter, not wishing every body to hear me - I think Foyle must have heard me, as we were both behind the counter - here is Foyle's entry of the parcel, "No. 8, Robinson, 535l. insured, 2l. 4s. 6d. paid."</p>

            . I was guard of the Birmingham old post-coach. On the 11th of April Larkman gave me this parcel - it was directed to Robinson and Co., Birmingham; he gave me particular directions about it; I put it into the back seat inside the coach; a man got into the coach unknown to anybody, at the Bull and Mouth - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140021"/>cannot myself say that Edward Archer was in the coach. When we got to Birmingham the parcel was gone. I was taken into custody, and detained seven weeks, till inquiry was made; the coach stopped at Market-street, to supper; a young man who was inside left the coach at Stoney Stratford - he gave me and the coachman 1s. each.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How many inside passengers had you? A. Three from the office, but I had four before I got out of town; a young woman got out before we got to Market-street, and we took her up again beyond Market-street, the other three passengers got out at Market-street, to supper - they got in after supper, and were all three inside when the young woman got in again; I never had valuable parcels with that coach before, but I have with others; if this had not been too large I should have put this into the bottom of the front boot; I could not get it into my side pocket; I should have done the same on any other night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not put it into your pocket when Larkman gave it to you? A. No; I put it under my arm, and took it to the coach; I did not put it inside my coat. The young woman left at Dunstable, and another passenger at Stoney Stratford.</p>
               <p>AUGUSTUS FREDERICK STONEBRIDGE re-examined. I put two magazines into the parcel with the notes - it was five or six inches square; it might, perhaps, with difficulty, be put into an inside pocket.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS to JOHN BROOK LARKMAN. Q. Did not you see the guard put it into his breast pocket? A. Yes; I could not see his pocket, but he put it into his breast, buttoned his coat, and took it to the coach.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live at King's Norton, Worcestershire. On the 11th of April I got into the Birmingham coach at the Bull and Mouth, about six o'clock; two persons were then inside - one of whom was Edward Archer, who was convicted here last Session; I had a considerable sum of money about me - he was meanly dressed in black; I asked how far he was going; he said to Stoney Stratford; I asked if he lived there - he said No, he was merely going to stop a few days on business. When we stopped at Market-street there were three persons inside (a female who got in at Islington had then got out - she got in afterwards again). I and the gentleman who sat opposite to me supped there - we did not see Archer till we came out; he was then drinking a glass of spirits: he got into the coach, and left at Stoney Stratford.</p>

I am a pay-clerk at the Bank. -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140022"/>On the 12th of April Mr. Middleton brought me a 200l. note; I gave it to the party he pointed out; I do not remember who. In the course of the same morning Mr. Gummer brought me three 100l. notes, which I gave the person he pointed out, and whom I believe to be the prisoner Archer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. Q. How many persons are at the desk with you? A. Only one. I saw him over the desk rail - we sit above the rail - I saw the whole of his person. There was nothing more than common to excite my observation.</p>

            , 21, Euston-square;" here are three of 100l., which were presented together before the 200l. - they are endorsed"Thomas Toob, Henley-upon-Thames;" immediately after I paid gold for these three, the same person presented seven 5l.; it was the prisoner Archer, I am certain; I saw him three different times that morning - the first time he put down a bundle on the desk, and said he had got ones which he wanted sovereigns for; I referred him to the Inspector's-office, to have them examined - he returned in about half an hour, with three 100l. notes, for which I gave him sovereigns, and in five minutes he came with seven fives; I have them here - they are Nos. 6538 to 6544 inclusive, dated the 8th of March, 1826; they were not examined when he brought them, and I directed him to the Inspector's, as before, and to write his name on them - he returned, and delivered them to me; Mr. Lugger, a teller, paid them, in my presence, in sovereigns; here is written on them "seven notes, 35l. - Toob, Henley-upon-Thames," in Lugger's hand-writing. I am certain of the prisoner's person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You only saw him on one day? A. No; my attention was called to the transaction a few days afterwards, when Edward Archer was in custody. I paid particular attention to the prisoner, for at that time orders were given to take particular notice of persons bringing large notes for gold; I did not look at his dress; his face was sufficient for me; he had a brown great coat on; his hat was not slouched when I saw him.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did he come prepared with a bag for the sovereigns? A. I do not know; his saying he had three hundred ones induced me to attend to him; I think he had the notes in a handkerchief: it is an unusual sum for a private person to bring.</p>

            . I keep the King of Prussia public-house, Somerset-place, Hoxton. The prisoner Archer came to my house in April, ordered a dinner, and inquired why a beef-steak and cod fish were not taken in for the dinner - they were sent back afterwards, and he dined there with some person, whom I do not recollect. Archer brought a parcel, in a small bag, with him, and said he had been to receive, or was going to pay away, some money - I cannot say which; he put the bag down on the bar door - it sounded as if something heavy was in it - I supposed it to be money - this was between twelve and one o'clock. I was called in afterwards and dined with them.</p>

            . I am Archer's son-in-law, and live at No. 51, Shoreditch - I am a silk-weaver. Edward Archer, who was convicted, is his son. Foyle came to our house before Edward Archer was in custody - he seemed in great agitation concerning where Edward Archer was - he wished me very much to tell him where he was, as he particularly wanted to see him; I asked his reason - he told me Edward Archer was going to fight a duel, and he wanted to get him out of the way; I went with him in a coach to Friday-street, Cheapside; I found young Archer there, and took him to Foyle; they had some conversation by themselves, and after that invited me to the theatre - Foyle paid for our admission; we supped together afterwards - I have not seen young Archer since - I think this was on the 13th of April; I never knew the prisoner Archer by the name of Bartlett.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Why do you say it was the 13th of April? A. I believe it was that day - I was not asked about it till last week. Archer left us soon after we left the theatre; Foyle and him stood a long way off in the street after leaving the theatre; then Foyle came back to me, and we supped together. Young Archer was a lawyer's clerk - his father is no business - I understood he did something by commission.</p>

            . I am principal<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140023"/>officer of Bow-street. I apprehended young Archer at Lewes, in Sussex, on the 9th of May, at a baker's shop - I took him into a room by the side of the shop, and the prisoner Archer was there; the young man had said his name was not Archer; the room door was open, and the prisoner must have heard it; his sister came out of the room, and he said to her "They want to persuade me my name is Archer"; I told her I was an officer, and not to conceal the truth; she said his name was Archer, and I took him. On the 10th of July the prisoner Archer was brought into my custody; I said "How do you do, Mr. Archer - you did not expect to see me so soon;" he said"My name is not Archer;" I said "Yes, it is - you remember my being at Lewes;" he said No - he was not there - his name was Bartlett. On the 12th of July I apprehended Foyle at the Cross Keys at Hull - it is a branch of the concern at London: I asked if his name was Foyle- he said Yes; I told him I had come on very unpleasant business - to take him for the robbery young Archer was convicted of; he denied knowing any thing of it; I said, if I had been informed right, I knew better, for I knew where he had received the two hundred sovereigns from the robbery; he said I must be a strange man for saying so; I took him to the House of Correction at Hull; he there asked if he might have his books, to make up his accounts before he left; I went with the keeper of the gaol to get them from the Cross Keys office; there was a little book some distance from the others - his wife took it up; I saw her open it, and saw a letter in it; I also found a card; his wife was taking the book away - I followed her to the door, and got it from her. Mrs. Foyle wrote on a slip of paper, and gave it to me; I took it to Foyle at the gaol - I did not give it but read it to him; he could see the hand-writing; I used neither persuasion or threat to him - this is the paper (reads)."Tell all, I entreat you - it is only adding to your trouble to act falsely - take care of your health - get the money from Mr. Walton - Mr. Sell and Mr. Chaplin will, I am sure, show you mercy; write directly you get to London." After reading this paper I asked if he had any thing to say; he said No, he should like to see Mr. Chaplin first; I said "You told me you had some money;" he said"Yes, 140l.;" I asked where it was; he said in the pocket-book he had shewn me; he had shewn me this pocket-book; I said I could not find it, and it would save a great deal of trouble if he would tell me where it was; he described a secret drawer in a chest of drawers in the office, and I there found 135l., which I gave his wife a receipt for - it was in notes; I told him afterwards there was but 135l. - he said he recollected changing a 10l. note; I saw him again next morning, and he said, voluntarily, he was very sorry he had done any thing wrong, but that old rascal had come to him several times, as others did, and asked him for a situation - that he had known him at the Bell and Crown, when a clerk there - that he asked if they did not carry a good deal of money at times; he said Yes, and he asked which coach carried most; he told him the Old Post carried a great deal. That these meetings occurred several times; he did not know what he meant, and when he did know he shuddered at it, and had not had a happy moment since. I asked him if Archer's brother had dined with him at the King of Prussia; he said No, that Archer brought him the two hundred sovereigns there in a bag, and nobody was present when he gave them to him, but when the money was paid the landlord was asked in, and partook of dinner with them - he said himself, that Archer and the landlord dined together there - that the landlord's name was Smith, and he had a defect in his eye. On our way to town, at Lincoln, he complained that he wanted money; I said if he applied to the Magistrate he might order me to give up the 135l., he said No, he did not want it - it was Mr. Chaplin's - let him have it.</p>

Foyle came into my employ in 1820 or 1821, and was in my confidence; I went and saw him in Covent-garden watch-house, in consequence of a message from Ruthven, - Mr. Harmer was with me - he was brought into a room where we were - I did not say a word - he knelt down, burst into tears, and said, it was his first offence - that he had been drawn into it by George Archer, and was very sorry for it; he was much confused and agitated at first; a considerable time elapsed and I asked him if the guard, or any other servants, were concerned - he said not any - that he could not account for the manner in which the influence of Archer worked upon him to lend himself to so base an act; I asked how the parties could have stolen the parcel if the guard was not concerned - he said he informed George Archer where the parcel was placed; I asked why he continued his intimacy with Archer after he left London; he said it was through fear; the card produced by Ruthven is his writing, but the letter is very unlike his usual hand. He said some property had been taken from him, and there was other property, which he should expect me to have, and seemed desirous of doing all he could to restore the property; he said the money Ruthven had was mine - that he received 200l.</p>

               <p>MR. HARMER. I accompanied Mr. Chaplin to see Foyle - he was told that any thing he said might be used against him. I have heard Mr. Chaplin's statement - it is correct; but he also said that he himself had received for the booking of the parcel, and saw another clerk deliver it to Evans, and saw Evans put it into the pocket inside the coach; that he then went over to Old Archer, at the Half Moon public-house, Leadenhall-market, and told him where it was; he said he had 200l. for giving the information, and sought to leave London, to avoid further interviews with Archer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner FOYLE to RUTHVEN. Q. Did you not tell me you knew all about it the first time you came? A. I did. I did not say Mr. Chaplin would receive his evidence but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140024"/>not Archer's; I said Archer was inclined to tell all about it, but his evidence would not be received; I told Foyle I could promise him nothing.</p>

On the 10th of June, about two o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop- one of my men came to attend to him; I had dealt with him before, but always for ready money; he had been a kind of warehouseman in the cutlery way - I dealt with him occasionally seven or eight years ago, but not since - it was always for ready money - I always deal for ready money. On the day in question he came about two o'clock - he had called about three months before with a petition, signed by several cutlers, and I gave him a shilling; I was surprised to see him come in on this day, but he said his father-in-law had taken a public-house for him at Hampstead, and had agreed to give him 1000l. - I knew his father-in-law was able to do so, and felt glad; he said he wanted a dozen small and a dozen large ivory-handled knives with forks and carvers, for a dinner he was going to have that day, on the opening of the house, which, he said was the Cock, at Hampstead; my man packed them up in the usual way - he knew my way of business; I told him repeatedly that he must pay for them when he had them; he made no objection to it; he always dealt with me for ready money. When the knives and forks were packed up he requested a bill; I ordered my man to make one; people often have bills, even if they deal for money; while the man was writing the bill he caught up the knives and forks off the counter, threw me down this forged bill, and ran away; he said it was a banker's acceptance for 19l. 10s. and was a security for me till tomorrow morning, at ten o'clock, when he would come for the bill, and pay the 5l. 2s. for the goods; he ran out with them, and I have not seen him since; he was apprehended this day month; one of my men met him in the street; I had tried all I could to find him before; I would not have parted with these goods to him, or any body, without ready money - I would not have taken this paper as a security; I should not have kept the bill but he ran away and left it behind - they were worth 5l. 2s. (The bill was here put in and read; it was dated London, the 2d of May, 1825,; drawn by G. S. Mappin on

            . I have been in Mr. Thomas' employ about two years.; I attend the shop, and work for him - I am his managing man - he deals for ready money only; he is very infirm, and when a customer comes, he calls me to assist him. On the 10th June the prisoner came to the shop, and wanted knives and forks to open his house with - he said he had company coming to dinner that day, and must make haste; I packed them up - he asked for a bill, and while I was writing it some more gentlemen came in; I was busy talking to them and making the bill out at the same time, at a little desk in the shop, and did not see him go out - but when I turned round to give him the bill, he was gone, and the knives also - master had this bill in his hand; he said he had taken the Cock, public-house, at Hampstead - I went there three or four hours after, and found there was no such a house.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did Mr. Thomas say, "He has gone and left the bill?" A. I asked master what he had got, when I had done with the gentlemen, and asked if he had paid - master seemed confused and gave me this bill - I said I thought it was a forgery, as the hand-writing seemed all one; I went to the banker's to inquire - they did not know the party; master then sent me to Hampstead.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not stand talking to him with them under my arm for half an hour? A. He was not in the shop a quarter of an hour altogether; I never said master took the bill as security for the knives; I did not hear his conversation with master, as I was busy with the gentlemen - it is a small shop; he might have left the shop ten minutes when I saw the bill; two gentlemen stood before me, I could not see him go out.</p>

            . I am in the first regiment of guards, but have worked for Mr. Thomas ten years, and am in his employ now when in town, and off duty. I was at Windsor when this occurred, but in August, Mr. Thomas told me if I could find Mappin, to take him; I was inquiring for him, and eight or nine weeks ago an account was sent to master, by a lawyer in Greek-street, and I found the prisoner there; I asked him to go with me to Mr. Thomas, he refused; I said, "Will you wait here while I fetch him?" he said he would; I went down to the door, having an officer there, but the prisoner was conveyed out of the house through some other door; I met him in about seven weeks after in the Seven-dials, and took him to Bow-street; I knew he used formerly to bring cutlery to master, which he was paid for directly - master always dealt for ready money; when I took him, I said, "What a foolish fellow you must be in sending this foolish lawyer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140025"/>for money, master would be sure to find you;" he said,"I was in distress, and thought I should raise a trifle of money by it."</p>

            . I am an officer, and went with Smithhunter to Mr. Burnell's, in Greek-street, Soho, with a warrant against the prisoner for this offence - Thomas had given information at the office six or seven weeks ago. I waited outside the house, and sent Smithhunter up to see if he was there - he came down in a few minutes, beckoned to me, and said he was there; I went up and searched all over the place, but could not find him - there is a back door, which he must have gone out at; about three weeks ago Smithhunter brought him to the office.</p>
               <p>COURT to THOMAS. Q. Did he remain in the shop after he threw down the bill? A. Not a minute; he took up the knives with one hand, and threw it down with the other, saying, there was security sufficient till to-morrow morning, when he would bring 5l. 2s., and take back the bill, and out he ran.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you not in Horsemonger-lane? A. Yes, in 1810 - it was a conspiracy against me about an apprentice I had a dispute with, and he charged me with not giving him enough victuals, and indicted me for illtreating him - but plenty of people proved to the contrary, and I proved he had robbed me; I was never charged with felony.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I traded with Thomas when he lived at Stones-end; he owed our concern 12l. 6s. - I called for it, and he said he would pay us in a week; when I called, he had moved; I could not find him till I found him in Oxford-street; he always shuffled the account off; I have sold him odd things since, which he paid me for - I did this with intent to balance the old account with him, which has never been paid; I lost 10,000l. in the concern.</p>

            . I am an house-agent and collector of debts, and an accountant. I have known the prisoner three or four years, and last April I put him in charge of 500l. worth of furniture; he mentioned to me, when he returned, that Thomas owed him some money, and in July or August, (I do not know which) I sent him a letter, applying for money due to the firm, (as this man informed me) - and stated, if it was not paid, it would be put into a Marshalsea lawyer's hands; this charge was made in consequence of my writing the letter - after I wrote it, Mr. Thomas' attorney called on me, and said Thomas was not in his debt, but Mappin was in his; on the following morning, which was on the 20th of July, I called on Thomas; his attorney was present; I said, I was informed there was money owing him by Mappin; "Yes," he replied,"and if he don't call and pay me, I will get a warrant for him;" in consequence of this, I left Thomas' shop, and in a few days this soldier came, and soon after Mappin came to my door; I have only one room there, as a place of business, but do not live there; the soldier said, "Is your name Mappin;" he said, "Yes," he asked him to go to his master, he said, No - he then asked him to wait till he fetched him - Yes, said he; they both left the room, and what become of the prisoner I do not know; he could not be found when the officer came; it was agreed I should call next morning and meet Mr. Thomas, and I did so, in the presence of an officer; Wardropper said, "I acknowledge Mr. Thomas told me he had received a bill of exchange for goods we sold Mappin;" Thomas said, in answer, "No, I said no such thing, I only said I would let him have the goods till to-morrow morning at twelve o'clock, when he was to call and pay me;" I took down, in this book, what he said.</p>
               <p>Q. You took that book with you to put down what Thomas said? A. Yes; I did not keep a copy of the letter I wrote, and do not know the date of it; I cannot say when it was.</p>
               <p>ROBERT DUKE. I remember this witness being at Thomas'. Thomas said nothing about getting a warrant for if Mappin did not call and pay.</p>
               <p>RICHARD BURNELL. This witness was not present at the conversation.</p>
               <p>ROBERT DUKE. He told me he had never been to Thomas' before.</p>
               <p>Mr. THOMAS. I told Burnell nothing of the kind. I had the warrant before that, and wanted to find the man out; I received the letter long after the robbery; I do not owe him a farthing; this witness gave his direction, No. 6, Clerkenwell-close, and there is no such person there.</p>

            , to milk the cows; I had a bag containing a scarf, a pocket-handkerchief, eight shillings, two penny-pieces, two halfpence, and two purses - we had to pass over Lea-bridge, when we got on the bridge; the prisoner Waters came on the bridge to me, and asked for a halfpennyworth of milk - I told him we had none; he threw up the bag which I had in my hand, and the halfpence rattled, as they were loose - he went down to the other prisoners - there were six of them altogether; we went straight on down the Marsh - Waters and Andrews came up and pushed me down, and held me down till they got my bag from me - I struggled a great deal to hinder them, and was very frightened; the tuck was torn out of my frock when I got up; I then looked to see where they were gone, and the four prisoners were looking into my bag - I called for assistance directly, and they all ran together up the side of the river Lea, towards a public house; they were pursued and taking at Bow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did they appear<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140026"/>to have been bathing? A. No; some boys were in the river, but not the prisoners - none of the six were in the river; some boys were bathing very near the spot where it happened - there were four bathing; I will not swear that neither of the six had his coat off.</p>
               <p>FRANCES LOW. I live just below Hackney-terrace - my father is a cow-keeper, and had cows on the Marsh. On the 31st of August, I was going down the Marsh with Lyons - we went over the Wick-bridge, and met Waters, who asked for a half-penny worth of milk - we told him twice we had got none, and he threw up Lyons' bag, which was in her hand, and the halfpence jinked; he went away to the others - there were six of them; in about five minutes, when we had got a little way from the bridge, Waters and Andrews pushed her down, and took the bag from her by force - she resisted; the other two prisoners were coming towards them when they pushed her down, and met them, and all ran away together down the river side; I saw them do nothing with the bag; I raised an alarm, got on the river side, and my brother ran to the White Lion, public-house, and gave an alarm; he was not with us, but by the next bridge; I did not see them taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. On which side of the river did this happen? A. The left hand, going to Homerton-bridge - I was close to the river - I saw no boys bathing - I saw none but these six; I do not think there could be any bathing; I saw none of their coats off; I was much frightened.</p>
               <p>JANE LYONS re-examined. The boys in the river were by the side of the bridge; the prisoners were down by the side of the water with them; Low must have seen the boys in the water, for she said to me, "There used always to be boys on the river when I came this way." I saw some, and said, "Don't look this way."</p>
               <p>Q. Then she did not look? A. Oh, yes, she did.</p>

On the 31st of August, I was going along the Marsh, walking towards Bow - I was not far from the Wick-bridge, and met six chaps running; Waters and Andrews were two of them; I saw Waters throw a purse into the water, and Andrews threw the reticule into the river - I got them out; I am sure they are the men - I knew Waters before by seeing him often at the corner of Slaughter-street, Brick-lane, where I used to work; I had never seen Andrews before; I saw Lyons crying, and asked if they were her things; she said Yes - I went with her; I gave the bag and purse to Hudson the officer, that night.</p>

            . I am a carman, and live in Well-street, Hackney.

            . I am a carman, and live in Wick-street, Hackney.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know Homerton-bridge? A. Yes; there is no house near it; the White Lion is about four hundred yards from it; there used to be many boys bathing there, but it has been stopped a good deal lately.</p>

On the 23d of June, about half-past twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner go up the area steps, with a basket in his hand. I followed, and before he got to the corner he dropped it - he looked round, and I had a good view of him, so as to know him again, but could not overtake him; I returned, and found the basket moved about five yards from where he dropped it; it contained the articles stated in the indictment. On the 17th of July I saw the prisoner crossing from Bridge-street, Westminster to Great George-street, with another man; I watched, and in King-street he began to go down the area steps - I fetched a constable, and had him taken - he denied the charge, but I am positive to him. The basket was not master's - it was about three minutes out of my sight while I pursued him. I had not seen him come down the area. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140028"/>had been up stairs about five minutes. The plate was kept in the pantry closet - he had to go through the kitchen.</p>

The prisoner Jones was several years in our employ; Britten was a stranger; we discharged Jones early in July, and in about a week I discovered that we had been robbed of ninety bags of nails - I found Jones standing in Fish-street, took him to our warehouse, and gave him in charge, and begged him to make a full discovery of the robbery, that I might discover the receiver; Britten and Griffiths were taken the same day: I was present on the 11th of July, when eight bags of nails were found in Griffiths' shop; the marks on the bags had been rubbed over with ink; some were marked B and B D, in pitch - they contained new nails, but had been cut open, and some taken out; they were precisely the nails we deal in - one bag is marked B D in pitch, and that I can distinctly identify, though attempts have been made to obliterate it; the pitch still remains - the ink is washed out. Griffiths keeps an old iron and rag shop - he said if the nails were mine I was welcome to them - that he had bought them several months ago. - The quantity found are worth 14l. or 15l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Are any of them your own manufacture? A. No; I do not know the maker. I send out perhaps twenty bags in a year; they were in the corner of Griffiths' shop, covered with a quantity of rags; he did not tell me of whom he bought them - I did not ask.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. I believe Jones used to lock up your warehouse, and deliver the keys to the clerks? A. He had possession of the warehouse two hours after I left, and used to take the keys to a neighbour.</p>

            . I am warehouseman to Mr. Bolton, spice-merchant, of Little Eastcheap, nearly opposite the prosecutors' warehouse. About the end of January, about seven o'clock in the morning, I saw Britten come out of the warehouse, with a heavy bag on his shoulder; Jones accompanied him to the door, and shut it after him. I did not give information till after they were apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You did not see the contents of the bag? A. No. I am certain of them both.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see Britten afterwards? A. I saw him pass the prosecutors' door two or three times after, but he never went in - it was just break of day. I mentioned the circumstance to my master. The bag was like those produced.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with a search-warrant to Griffiths' house, at the corner of George-yard, Wentworth-street, Whitechapel; Fortune and Dalton were with me - I found Griffiths standing in the street- I called him in, and said we had a warrant to search for nails. I left Fortune and Dalten there while I went to take Britten - I saw him come out of a public-house, down from Osborne-street, towards Griffiths' house - he was fifty or sixty yards from the house; I told him I wanted him about some nails found at Griffiths' - he said he knew nothing about any nails; I took him to Griffiths'. We<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140029"/>found eight bags and a half of nails, about 2cwt. in each bag - a few were exposed for sale in a saucepan lid: they appeared to be a sample of those in the bag. Ink had been rubbed over the marks on the bags, but we could discover some pitch marks with the letters B D, after clearing away the ink. Griffiths said, "If they belong to the gentlemen take them away, and there will be an end of it;" there was a good deal of old iron and old nails in his shop, but all these nails were new. While I was locking Griffiths up, he told me he bought the nails of Britten. The bags of nails were covered with rags, except the half bag, which was under the window. Two days afterwards I found ten more bags at Wiggens' sale-rooms.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You knew Britten before? A. Yes - he worked as a porter, and lived in Wentworth-street. I am sure Griffiths said,"Take them, and there will be an end of them;" I said,"No, you and the nails must go before the Magistrate" - Mr. Browne was present; I cannot say whether the nails in the saucepan lid caught his eye - he inspected them after we found the bags. I call the bags concealed; they were behind the counter, with rags over them.</p>

I got up at five o'clock on this morning, and about twenty minutes past five I was at the first floor back room window, where I sleep, and saw three men in the yard, one was a red headed young man, who I knew lived in the neighbourhood; it was Haycraft - I knew him well - he was waiting in my yard - the other two were in Heeley's yard - they were strangers; I was within six yards of them, and had them in sight for a minute or a minute and a half; I looked at them particularly; I came down stairs directly without giving any alarm; I went into the street, and saw Haycraft with a pair of half boots in his hand, standing at the corner of the street; I suppose he had heard me speaking to my wife, and had got out of the yard; they had opened my yard door, which was bolted the night before; I had only got my trousers on; I ran up to finish dressing, which did not take two minutes; I looked out of window, and saw two men come out of Heeley's house - one of them was sitting on the water-butt by Heeley's wall, handing the sack to the other, who was sitting on the wall; it appeared very full and heavy; I believe them to be the same two men as I saw before; Morgan was the one who sat on the wall handing the sack to the other; I am certain of him; by that time Haycraft had returned into the yard; I ran down stairs again; I sent my wife to alarm Heeley; I gave an alarm, and they all three ran off immediately; I did not pursue, but went to the yard door; I found Morgan in the watch-house half an hour afterwards; he was in the same dress, and I am positive of his person; I saw Haycraft in prison eight days afterwards, and am positive he is the man.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the morning of the 28th of June, about half-past five o'clock, I was coming off duty at White Conduit-house, and on Clerkenwell-green I saw the two prisoners with another man, without shoes - they were walking sharply, and about three minutes walk from Saffron-hill; I saw the one who escaped with his hand in his pocket, and said to Loadsman, "We will follow these men, there is something wrong;" they were all three in company - they turned down a court - we followed them into Turnmill-street, got before them and desired them to stop; they immediately buttoned up their coats, and began to shew resistance, and threatened to strike us; Haycraft and the one not taken ran; I followed the one who escaped, and lost him - he saw us close behind him, put his hand into his pocket, and threw out this sugar basin over a wall; I got over and fetched it; I am sure he was in company with the prisoners; I ran back, and assisted in securing Morgan, who was taken on the spot.</p>

He began to be sensible on Tuesday, on Wednesday became delirious, and died on Thursday; I opened his head, and found a crack on the skull, which had caused his death - it might have happened from a fall - it was certainly not from a blow of the fist - falling himself, or from a blow, would occasion it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Was he extremely intoxicated? A. Being insensible I could not tell; whether that arose from the injury or intoxication I cannot say - intoxication would certainly increase the inflammation - he might also have got the wound in the face by falling.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he die from inflammation, caused by intoxication, or from the injury? A. It is impossible to tell; the injury might occasion it, independent of intoxication.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Young, of No. 3, Bunhill-row, which is about thirty yards from Mr. Harley's house, on the opposite side. On Sunday, the 9th of July, at twenty minutes to six o'clock, I was standing at the parlour window, which was open, and saw the prisoner Wilson and another come out of the public-house opposite - they walked to Harley's door, then shook hands, and parted; Wilson came on the opposite side by me, continued there two or three minutes, when Walker and another man came out of the public-house - they went and stood at Harley's door, and Wilson crossed over to them; I then saw Walker take something out of his pocket, and put under the door - it did not appear to open it, and he took out something else, which opened the door - I immediately went from the window to the street-door, and saw one of them knock violently at the door three or four times, though they had it open - the three men still stood there with the door open, but they saw me looking hard at them - they had not gone in; I immediately ran across to the public-house which they had come out of, and gave an alarm, but they said, Nonsense; I came out, and missed them all; I went to Mr. Dix, who lives next door to Harley, at the corner house - he came with me directly to the house - we found the door shut - Dix rang both the bells, and we heard some one run down stairs - the prisoner, Wilson, opened the door to Mr. Dix, and asked his business - Mr. Dix said, "My business is with you," and immediately collared him - Walker then rushed out from behind Wilson; I hallooed Stop thief! and he was caught by a young man at the opposite corner, without being out of my sight at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. They knocked at the door? A. Yes, when they saw me observing them - I missed them from the door when I came out of the public-house - I only went in and came out directly; they had time to run into the house while I was in there; Mr. Dix was at the door within five minutes; the public-house is not more than four yards from the prosecutor's; I saw Mrs. Dix first, and she called him.</p>

               <p>JAMES ARDEN. I am fourteen years old, and live in Great Ogle-street, Fitzroy-square, with my father, who is a brewer. On the 7th of July I was coming along the <placeName id="t18260914-44-crimeloc258">New-cut, near the tunnel</placeName>

I refused, but said, I would shew him what it was o'clock, if he stood two or three yards off - but he said, "No, we can't see if we stand so far;" and after a little time, I was pulling my watch out - I had got it quite out of my fob, and held it tight, but he got hold of the chain, and wrenched it from me; I said, "No larks," and he handed it to Tonks, who was about a yard off, and I saw no more of it; Mann was talking to them - they were altogether, not half a yard from each other - the three went away; Tonks remained behind, and said, "If you come under the bridge I will try and find your watch for you." I had said nothing to him - I was crying, but said nothing about my watch - I said, I would not go; some boys came round, at last two bakers came, and Tonks was detained; the other three were then out of sight; when Sanderwick gave him the watch, I thought I saw him put it into the flap of his breeches.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CRESWELL. Q. How long were you with them? A. About five minutes; Mann and Sanderwick were apprehended in about a fortnight - I was certain of them; I think they had been in the water, for Mann was putting his stockings on, and sitting about half a yard from the other two; he had every thing but his shoes and stockings on, and by the time they got the watch, I suppose he was ready to receive it; he went away as soon as he was dressed - he was in the water when I first went up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did Mann go away alone? A. He went with the stranger - I do not know whether he saw the watch taken - he was sitting down - I did not see him in the water; the watch was my father's - I had worn it twelve months; the seal, chain, and key, were mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner TONKS. Q. Where did I stand? A. By the side of the Cut, talking to the two prisoners; I am certain I saw the watch in your hand; if you were on the bridge, it must have been before you came up.</p>

            . I am eleven years old, and know Arden. On the 7th of July, I saw the prisoners and another, by the Cut; Sanderwick stopped Arden, and pulled his cap off; he cried for it, and Sanderwick said, if he would let him look what o'clock it was, he would give it him - he pulled it out - Sanderwick snatched it out of his hand, and gave it to Tonks, who put it into the flap of his breeches - then gave it to another boy, not in custody, and he gave it to Mann - I saw it in Mann's hands; Mann said, "Good bye, I shall see you to night;" and ran down the grove with it: Sanderwick, and the one not in custody, went away after Mann - Tonks remained, and was taken. I knew them all before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were you? A. Sitting at the top of the bridge, about five yards from them, seeing the boys bathe; Arden saw me - Mann was on the top of the bridge at first, putting his stockings on; Arden had as good an opportunity as me, of seeing what became of the watch - he was two or three yards off - I do not know whether he saw it; I ran into the grove, and saw Mann put it into his pocket.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CRESWELL. Q. I am told there was a croud of people looking for something? A. No such thing; they did not accuse me of having their money when they hustled me - they said nothing of the kind.</p>

            . I am in the service of White and Greenwell, of Blackfriars-road. The prisoner used to call from the prosecutors' for goods; I remember delivering these goods to him - here is an entry in my writing of delivering him these pieces of furniture with other goods, on the 22d - the six pieces of furniture have never been returned - they were to be rolled and callendered.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this receipt - here are the initials C. J. H. to it, is there any other person in Messrs. White and Co.'s employ answering to those initials except you? A. No; this receipt was never signed by me or my authority - it is dated 25th of July - I was at the house that day, and went out of town on the 26th, at two o'clock, for three weeks and three days - the furniture was never returned to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you conclude that because you find no entry of them? A. I have crossed off the jacconets, and recollect that they came without the furniture - my recollection was called to it when I came from the country; I also inspected the stock, and found they were not in it; I always cross off goods at the time they come in; I never omit it.</p>
               <p>Q. Has any person inquired of you whether White's stock was all right, and you said Yes? A. Two females made some inquiry on behalf of the prisoner, after he was in custody; I told them as I had not then taken stock, I knew nothing against him on, White and Co.'s account, I did not say the stock was all right; I had not examined it when they called.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. How long after you returned did these women call? A. A day or two; I am certain I had not then examined the stock; I believe it was his wife and sister who called - we had, perhaps, fifty or sixty pieces of furniture at that time, and, at that time, might not sell above a piece or two in a week.</p>

The name "Shacklock," to this entry, is his, and is done when he takes the goods out: his duty, when he returns, is to bring us a receipt from the customer; he produced to me this receipt for these goods (reads) - "July 25, delivered White and Co. six pieces of 7-8ths furniture, twenty-eight yards each, rolled and glazed; received by C.I.H." and in the corner are my initials, which I put on when he gave it me - the receipt is his writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK to HOGG. Q. Does not one clerk sometimes put the initials of another? A. Never; it is my duty to receive goods; if I was absent whoever received them would put his own initials.</p>

            . I am not related to the prisoner. I went with his wife to White and Co.'s on Sunday, and was told Hogg had not returned; we called again on Tuesday, and asked if he knew any thing to the disrepute of Mr. Shacklock - he said No; I said Mrs. Shacklock was anxious to know whether all was correct - he said "Quite correct."</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Why, according to what we have heard this charge was not known? A. No, but I understand Mr. Wheelton told his wife three parties were concerned, but he would not deliver up their names; she was anxious to know who were his accusers.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM HEAD JOHNSON. I live at Enfield. On the 16th of June I sent my servant Brereton to town, with a grey mare - he was to take it to Smithfield and deliver it to Mr. Wignell, the agent there, for sale; he was only to sell it himself if he was offered a price on the road, and not to take less than 8l. for her. He returned between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, and brought neither the mare nor money; I saw it, about eight days after, in possession of the officer, and knew her well again - I conside her worth 8l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Do you know the prisoner? A. He is a stranger to me.</p>

I was to take it to Mr. Wignell, the horse-dealer, to sell; the lowest price was 8l.; I had liberty to sell her on the road if I met with a customer; I overtook the prisoner about three miles before I got to town; I knew him and said "How do you do, Jem?" he was on the footpath; he said "How do you do?" and came by the side of the mare - he asked me if I was going to Smithfield; I said Yes, and asked if he was going; he said he was, and asked whose horse that was; I said it was master's, Mr. Johnson's; he asked if I was going to sell it; I told him I was taking it to a horse-dealer at Smithfield (I did not mention his name), and that master told me if I could get a price for it on the road to sell it; he asked the price - I told him 8l. was the lowest; he said he thought it would not fetch that; he went with me to the Ram inn, at Smithfield, where I put the mare up; we then walked into the market; he said he would go and have a pot of beer - I went and had part of a pot with him; he said "I have got a sovereign, and do not wish to change, if you will pay for the beer I will treat you when I get change" - this was about twelve o'clock; he said "I can shew you a fine place, where there are a great many second-hand clothes; we took a walk round there - it was a long-lane, near Smithfield; we then came back to <placeName id="t18260914-48-crimeloc288">Smithfield</placeName>

I walked about till three o'clock, then took the mare from the stable to the market, and walked her round to get a customer; the prisoner was with me several times, and when a gentleman was talking to me about buying her, he came up, took her, and walked her backward and forward; he took her up, with my leave, to trot her, to shew the gentleman; I do not know that gentleman; I took her from him again, walked her about the market, and this man, who afterwards bought her of Field, bid me 5l. 10s. for it; I asked him 9l., and got as low as 8l., and just as I was going to turn away with the mare, I said "Will you give 7l.;" I said that just to see what he would give; Field stood close by- this was between four and five o'clock - I loitered about till half-past five, when Field came and asked if he should trot her up and down the market - I had hold of her then, and said he might if he liked, and, if asked the price, to say it was eight guineas; but he must see me before he sold her; he took her away - went up the market - I stopped in that place about five minutes, and then, as he did not come back, I walked up the market after him, but could not see him - I expected he was only walking about the market to shew her - I had given him leave to do nothing else - I told him he must see me before he sold her - I saw no more of him - I went all round the market, saw Mr. Wignell, and told him what had happened; I kept looking about for him for two hours, but could not find him or the mare: I saw one Ellis, who lives at Enfield-chase, and told him the story; I at last went home and told my master. I afterwards found her at a public-house in town, took her home, and master has sold her since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You first spoke to the prisoner? A. Yes - I have known him some time. I believe he is known at Enfield; he does not live near master. I do not know the man's name who I first offered it to; one man bid me 6l. for it - the prisoner was not with me then. - While I was talking to another man, who asked me the price, the prisoner came up. I do not know whether the other man's name is Jude. The prisoner did not ask 8l. for it.</p>
               <p>Q. You told him he was to sell it for not less than eight guineas? A. No; I told him to say eight guineas was the price, but he must not sell it before he saw me; if he had sold her, and brought me eight guineas, I dare say all would be right; I dare say master would not have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140037"/>said any thing, but my orders were that he must see me before he sold her; he was not with me all the time I was in the market; he went away, and came several times; I did not ask him to walk the horse about; he asked if he should; I knew his name, and used to see him two or three times a-week. I do not know much of his character - I never heard any thing against him.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you give him authority to sell her without coming to you? A. No; he lived at Enfield, and master lived at Bush-hill, not half a mile from him; I told him I lived with Mr. Johnson.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he come to you before he was taken up? A. No; I looked about for him, but he could never be found at Enfield.</p>

            . I am a constable of Enfield. In June last I heard Mr. Johnson had lost a mare; I sent Pye after the prisoner, and on the Thursday following he brought the prisoner to me at Enfield; I knew he was a labouring man, and lived at Enfield. I took him to the Mansion-house, and on our way to town he asked if I thought it would be of any use for me to go to Mr. Johnson, to try, if he got the money whether he would make it up, and if so I was to go to the prisoner's father - I told him I thought it would be of no use; he said he had sold the mare, and after he had sold her he went into Smithfield to find the lad who he had her from, but could not find him; I asked if he had got none of the money - he said No, he had got into a brick field with some girls, and there lost the money among them - he said he had sold the mare to Jews, who lived near Reid's brew-house, for 5l. odd, and did not know the name.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he say he had sold it to a Jew or Jews? A. To some Jews - to a Jew.</p>
               <p>Q. I am told he said to Jude? A. No; he said "To some Jews;" I swear he did not say Jude; he said they lived near Reid's brew-house, Saffron-hill; I said the brew-house was in Liquorpond-street. I went to Isaac's, in Laystall-street; I got his direction at the Mansion-house - I do not know who wrote it.</p>

            . I am a constable. In June last I received information of the loss of this mare, and a description of the person. I went to Hertford, and received the prisoner in charge at Ware, on the Wednesday after the robbery. I found him at his father's house - his mother-in-law answered the door; I asked for James Field - she said he was not there; I insisted on going in, and found him concealed under the furthest bed in a room which had two beds; I told him I took him for stealing Mr. Johnson's mare, of Bush-hill; he told me to hold my tongue, for he did not want his wife to know any thing about it; I said no more till we got out of doors - he then began to say he had sold the mare to a Jew, near the brew-house on Saffron-hill, for 5l. 15s., and that he had come back to Smithfield with the money, and from there went to a brick field, and there lost it with a girl - from there he went to Kingsland-road, and rode down the same evening, by coach, to Hoddesden, and intended to return Mr. Johnson the money, but could not raise it again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He did not tell you where the horse was sold? A. He said to a Jew, near the brew-house, and that I knew where the brew-house was.</p>

            . I am a Jew. The prisoner sold me this mare, for 5l. 15s., in Smithfield, a little after five o'clock; he took it home to my house, in Liquorpond-street; he took it through the passage into my yard; we made the bargain opposite Long-lane; Brereton was not present. I paid the prisoner for it when he brought her home. I went back to Smithfield again that afternoon, as a young man asked me to go with him - when I got there I happened to see Brereton walking about there, and asked what he was looking for - he said after a mare - I told him I had bought it, and got her at home; he said I had not - I told him I had, and left him my address - the same mare was afterwards taken away by Johnson, on the 26th of June.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was about five o'clock in the evening? A. Soon after; I had seen them both walking together all the afternoon, and bid 5l. for it - in the presence of both; the prisoner wanted 6l.; I offered 5l. 10s. to Brereton; the prisoner wanted 6l., and he(the prisoner) said Mr. Johnson had told him to take 6l. for it; Brereton asked would I give 7l. - I said I could give no more.</p>
               <p>Q. He appeared willing to sell it for 7l.? A. I suppose so. I afterwards went up to the prisoner, and asked him if he would let me have it for the money, as I was going home - he was walking up and down; this was about three-quarters of an hour after I had seen Brereton; I was five or ten minutes with him the last time; there appeared no hurry in his conduct. The mare has been resold since for 6l., as I have heard.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. At what time did you bid Brereton money for the mare? A. A little after three o'clock - I offered him 5l. 10s.; he asked if I would give 7l.; the prisoner was present. I saw Brereton up and down Smithfield for two hours; he was not present when I bought the mare. I knew Brereton had the sale of it - I asked who it belonged to - he said to Mr. Johnson, of Enfield.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What part of the market did the sale take place in? A. Opposite Long-lane; Brereton asked me 9l., and then said would I give 7l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. After selling him the horse I took him to the Bear and Ragged Staff, public-house, to receive the money; he had not got it, so I took it home; he called a man to look at it, who said if he had given more than 4l. 10s. it was too much; I said I would take it back if he liked; Brereton had said if I could sell it he would give me half-a-crown.</p>
               <p>JURY to HENRY BRERETON. Q. You was to deliver it to Mr. Wignell? A. Yes; but Mr. Wignell told me to get a customer for her, as he had to find another horse for master. I did not promise the prisoner any thing to sell it. Wignell did not tell me to take less than master told me.</p>
               <p>Seven witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

               <p>FRANCES HOWELL. I am the wife of John Howell, who lives in Waterloo-town, Bethnal-green. On the 18th of July, about a quarter past eleven o'clock at night, (my husband had lately returned from sea, and spent a good deal of money) I went to look for him, as he had been absent a night and a day - as I came up Brick-lane, to the corner of Phoenix-street, about a dozen men stood there; Davis, who was with me, happened to slip; I stooped down to pick her up, and a person came up and asked me to treat him with drink - the prisoner is very much like that person, and I believe him to be the man, but I have since seen a person very much like the prisoner; he followed me down Hare-street - we went into a public-house and had some drink together - as I crossed the fields a tall man stood with his back towards us, and his hands before his face; as I passed him the person who I believe to be the prisoner, shoved me round; I felt my pocket go from me as I fell - it was tied round me; they both ran away - I was too much alarmed to call out. The prisoner was taken in about a month; it was done in a darkish place, and I cannot be certain he is the man. I had seen a person like the prisoner many times before.</p>

(Sturdy was not one of the men); they met us. The two men appeared as if they were walking on, but all of a sudden one struck me in the jaw, and the other under the eye; the two girls were then standing before me, and all four were in company; I did not answer the girls - the men had passed, and come behind me; the girls saw the blows given, and I immediately felt a tug at my watch, and it was taken out of my fob. - I am certain it was taken by one of the women, for I saw their hands moving, and saw it in one of their hands; the blow rather overpowered me, but in a moment I saw Parmenter before me; where the other three went I do not know; they were gone. I ran after Parmenter as hard as I could, as far as Lisson-street, which is about a quarter of a mile, and called Watch! - as I followed her she spoke to two boys; I could not hear what she said, but they went into a public-house, and fetched Sturdy out; in passing the public-house (which he came out of) in pursuit of Parmenter, he stopped me, and seized me round the waist; a great many people assembled, and released me - I ran after Parmenter again, having seen the road she took; I had not lost sight of her. Sturdy followed me, and when I got within three yards of Parmenter he overtook me, and knocked me down; I got up again, and ran after her; I pursued her into George-street, and there I thought she had turned into a house, but a man said she had turned down a corner; I lost sight of her. I stood a moment, inquiring where she had gone, and presently Sturdy came up, with a gang of boys, and again struck me several blows. I got away, and went home. I have not recovered my watch. I described the prisoners to Hewett and Webster - they were taken next morning, and I was certain they were the three, and am so now: I looked at them when they asked how I did, and am quite certain of them; it was twi-light - the lamps were not lighted. The public-house Sturdy came from is a quarter of a mile from where I was robbed.</p>

The male prisoner was in the employ of my son and Mr. Gylby, whose office is in my house - I had retired, but live in the house. On Wednesday, the 9th of August, I paid some money away, and supposed I put the rest of my notes into my cash-box- but on Saturday I found in my hurry I had left 170l. or 175l. in notes on the desk in the office, instead of putting them into the cash-box; I missed a 100l. and a 50l. note among others - I had received the 100l. note from my son, Charles, that morning, and the 50l. from Mr. Humphrys; it was part of a sum he had received from Messrs. Hoares'. The prisoner continued in my son's service till the 9th, and came on the 10th, but was absent on Friday and Saturday - on missing my notes his absence made me suspect him - he never returned.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Had the prisoner and Mr. Gylby a dispute on Thursday? A. Not a dispute - he admonished him mildly about some neglect, and said he suspected he drank, which, if he discovered, he should discharge him - he did not turn him out of the office.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not inform Mr. Allen of this till the 12th? A.

The prisoners slept in the next room - the second night they slept there I was awoke by their coming to bed, about half-past twelve o'clock - the man appeared much intoxicated - soon after I heard a conversation between them, but I was not thoroughly awake; all I could gather was, that he was much surprised, after being in the gentleman's employ so long, that he should be accused as he had been that afternoon; just after that I heard a rattling of paper, and the female expressing her surprise, in a kind of shriek - she asked him how he came by it - this thoroughly awoke me, and excited my curiosity; I got out of bed to listen; I went against the wainscot - the woman asked how he came by that money - he said it was no odds to her, that it was his own, and he intended to leave London, and asked if she would go with him; that he should first go to Dover, then to Calais, and two or three other places - she said she would not, and wished him to take the money back to Mr. somebody, whose name I did not hear;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140040"/>he said he should go whether she would go or not - she said he had better not, but return the property, and not defraud so kind an employer or benefactor.</p>

On the 11th of August I changed a 50l. note for the male prisoner, who bought two watches, a gold one for 12l., and a silver one for 2l. 5s., this is the note (looking at it, No. 2307, dated 15th of June, 1826.) I asked his name - he said "Williams, No. 29, Camberwellgrove," which I have written on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time of the day was this? A. About four o'clock in the afternoon - our shop is not dark; I was questioned about this the next week, and said I should know him if I saw him - that he wore a dark coat, but I would not be certain of the colour; I did not say it was green; he might be a quarter of an hour in the shop - selling two watches to one person enables me to recollect him; I swear positively to him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not she give up her keys, and say "You will find the things Dunn has given me, in these drawers? A. Yes: Clements said "You had better be candid for we have information;" and she said every thing her Henry had brought were in the drawers.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On Sunday, the 30th of July, I took Dunn into custody, and went the same day to Brook-street, West-square, Lambeth; I got into the house by sending somebody with beer; Smith let us in, and when I entered the parlour I told her Henry was in custody, and said "You know who I mean. Henry Dunn;" she said "Good God, what is it?" I said "I hold a warrant to search the house, and expect you will be very candid in your answers to me;" she said she had received many presents from Henry at different times; I asked where they were - she pointed to the drawers, and said "Some of them are made up in those drawers," and some she had pawned, the duplicates of which were in the drawers - that some of those pledged, were as she had received them from him, and some were made up; she then gave me the keys - I unlocked the drawers in Mr. Cross's presence, and found a quantity of goods - silk and muslin dresses, silk gloves, and a quantity of duplicates - the silk and muslin dresses were made up - some gloves were new and some worn - Mr. Cross claimed them; we went up stairs to search a bed-room with her, and there found some of the articles - she said she had received them all from Henry; I took White, the servant, into custody. I was present at an interview between Mr. Cross and Dunn, at Marlborough-street - it was not in the Magistrates' presence - I believe Mr. Cross had not seen him before.</p>
               <p>MR. CROSS. I had not seen Dunn since his apprehension, till this interview, at which Clements was present - it was on the Monday; I held out no threat or promise of mercy to him, from first to last.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you not say to him "You had better be candid, for I always treat people as they treat me? A. Certainly not - nothing like it; I never said I should have his parents in the country, or his relations, taken up; I said I was going to send an officer there, to see if there was any property, as I had found some letters.</p>

            . I held out neither threat or promise to him - I cannot state the conversation between Mr. Cross and him at Marlborough-street, but I saw him again in prison on the 3d of August, in consequence of finding some lettres - Mr. Cross was with me; I said "Dunn, now have you any thing to say to Mr. Cross, for we find you have been sending presents to Hull, and Mr. Cross or I must go down to Hull;" he burst into tears and said,"For God's sake do not go there, to bring my relations into disgrace, for they are respectable - let it all fall on my shoulders;" I said "Then what have you sent?" he said he had sent a piece of linen to Hull, to be made into shirts, which were sent back, and he afterwards sent his two sisters a shawl each, and (addressing himself to Mr. Cross, said) "It was only two of those marked in your shop at 16s. each and it was all your property." He said that the time he had given him to go into the country for his health, he had passed with Smith; that he frequently felt great remorse for what he had done, but whenever he offered to retract, she said to him "I will serve you as I did young Shepherd." I told him what had been found at Smith's - he said "It is all yours;" he was in great distress of mind; he said two of the parcels had gone from the shop in a peculiar way - that he had packed them up in the usual way, directed them to Mrs. Smith, and sent them out by their own porter to Mrs. Smith, in the way of trade; he said he wanted to get out of the country. I afterwards went to Mrs. Bradley of Holborn, and got from her a white robe dress and a piece of silk.</p>
               <p>Q. He acknowledged that the things found at Smith's came through him? A. Yes; Mr. Cross described them to him; Mr. Cross said "There was some cloth too?" he said "Yes, it is yours, and the silks which are pawned, are all yours." Mr. Cross mentioned some India crape shawls, ladies' collars, silks, and printed cotton - he said"They are all yours;" Mr. Cross mentioned all the property found at Smith's, and he said they are all yours.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Will you swear that Mr. Cross enumerated every article? A. Yes, this conversation was in the New Prison, after he was committed for re-examination. We went (in consequence of two letters found in his box) to learn what had been sent to Hull; nothing was said about his friends being prosecated or taken up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. You advised Smith to be candid? A. Yes - Dunn said he had sent the things to Smith, and carried some himself; we found no whole piece of goods - the silks were mostly made into dresses - there were some silk handkerchiefs; I remember nothing being said about a warrant being sent to Hull - we were to go to learn what had been received - not to apprehend any one.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you ever hear of any intention of prosecuting his relations? A. Certainly not. I produce the silk found at Bradley's, and the goods found at Smith's.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. From whom did you yourself receive her white dress? A.

            . I am a widow, and live in Brook-street, West-square, Lambeth. I was servant to the prisoner Smith, for about six weeks; I went to her in May, and left in June; Dunn used to come and see her on Sundays; I remember when I had been there eight days, on a Wednesday, about six o'clock in the afternoon, he brought some bed-furniture - he came in through the shop up into the sitting-room, and threw them down on the table; I saw two or three pieces of printed cotton; he said he had brought them for her to choose; she seemed very much pleased - he cut off a piece to make a sofa cover; he staid a short time, and left the sofa cover behind - whether he left any more, I cannot tell - he took some away.</p>

            . I have known Smith four years; I lived in the same house with her three years ago, and visited her at times; I saw Dunn and her together about a month before he was apprehended, at Mrs. Rowland's, in Waterloo-road - I called there, and found them together; Dunn said he was going into Yorkshire to see his friends, but was ill, and could not go; after that Smith produced a letter to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. BUTLER, clerk to Mr. Harmer, solicitor tor the prosecution, here proved the service of a notice on the prisoner to produce the letter in question. (notice read.)</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH MILLS. She asked me to read the letter, as she could not make part of it out - I read it to her aloud; it was signed, "Your affectionate father, Dunn," and directed to Mr. Dunn, and stated that he had sent him 3l., which was all he could send at present, but he would send more in a short time; after I had read it, she said she wanted to know where Henry's friends lived, and asked if I could make out the post-mark; I said, it was faint, and could not; she shewed me a piece of Esterhasey silk once, and said it was about fifteen yards, and was to make a dress and bonnet; I knew she meant Dunn when she spoke of Henry - she said he was very kind to her, and a very good friend, and that he was in the linen drapery line - a sort of foreman at a shop; I often heard her say he could get the things at the wholesale price, and would pay for them when he got his quarter's salary; she once shewed me two or three pairs of gloves.</p>
               <p>MARIA WHITE. I live in Brook-street, West-square. Lambeth, I lived servant to Smith for five weeks, up to the time she was taken, which was in July. On a Tuesday, about a fortnight before she was apprehended, I remember a parcel coming once; she said it came from Mr. Dunn; I saw it opened, it contained two pieces of silk, some gloves, and a worked collar; I think the silk was like the brown silk produced; I was taken into custody myself, and when in Pancras watch-house, she told me she had received the property from Mr. Dunn, and did not know it was stolen; I have since been to see her in Newgate; Mrs. Bonny was present there once or twice; she said, "Bonny, you have a duplicate of nine of a piece of silk, don't you mention it to any body, for if you do it will sell me."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long ago was this? A. About three weeks.</p>
               <p>Mr. CROSS, (examining the brown silk found at Mrs. Bradley's.) This is ours - I know it well by the selvage; I will not swear that I missed this particular piece, but I know it to be ours - it cost me 4s. 6d. a yard - it cost 54s.; the muslin dress is worth 30s., and is ours.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. By what marks do you swear to the silk? A. By the selvage, and its appearance altogether - we had a piece of about forty yards of it - we only had one piece of this colour - it is not a common colour, and I do not believe it can be matched exactly - here are two blue cords in the selvage; Dunn told me some of my silk was at Bradley's; we allow shopmen to buy things at the wholesale price, but they should take them into the counting-house, and be debited for them by the clerk; the only charge in the books to him, is 19s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Mr. LAW. Q. Is it not very difficult to get an exact colour, except goods are died at the same time? A. Very; I owed him the current quarter's wages; he had 45l. a year, with board and lodging - it was increased from 35l.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Dickers. On the 6th of March, the prisoner, Smith, pawned a remnant of silk for 33s., in the name of Sarah Smith; on the 11th of March, she pawned a piece of silk for 28s., in her own name, and on the 29th of May, a coat for 29s.; on the 9th of May she pawned two waistcoats and two shirts, for 21s. 6d., the shirts are marked E.H.W.; on the 6th of June she pawned a shawl, on the 15th another; on the 6th of April, two petticoats, and a remnant of linen, and some silk-hose.</p>
               <p>Several other pawnbrokers were in attendance with property, but the Learned Counsel declined examining them.</p>
               <p>Mr. CROSS. I have seen all these goods in possession of the various pawnbrokers, and believe the whole to be ours - I can identify the greater part of them; the pieces of brown silk, containing fourteen yards, I am certain is ours - it is not quite a whole piece; the piece produced by Mrs. Bradley, is thirteen yards, and cost me 4s. 6d. a yard; I have brought a piece from the shop exactly corresponding with the fourteen yards produced by the pawnbroker; I cannot identify the calico, but have no doubt of any of the articles - I know the muslin dresses; it is impossible to keep an account of my stock; the total value of the property found, is 120 or 130l.; Dunn said he had taken a remnant of about five yards of cloth from my shop, and had it made into a coat, two waistcoats, and cloth for a pair of trousers, which Smith had pawned - he described it as a length about 12s. a yard; he said this in the New Prison; I named to him the articles found as well as I could; I named the embroidered collar, a crape handkerchief, and a quantity of gloves. I gave him leave of absence about the middle of May, to go to Yorkshire, to see his friends; he told me, in prison, that he had not been, but was over the water, in Brook-street, all the time, and when he was out of money, he wrote to his friends, and a letter came containing money which she opened, and took out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. When did the silk, found at Bradley's, come into your possession? A. I really cannot say, I think about three months from the time he was taken, about May or June; I told him a quantity of silk had been found; he said he knew she had silks - that some she had by her, and some were pawned.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the least doubt but these were taken at different times? A. It is impossible for me to say - several might be taken at once, but I think all could not be taken together - I should not have missed them if they had.</p>
               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you keep silks in pieces or cut? A. They would be pieces in our house; the quantities produced are such as would make a dress - it is rather more than the usual quantity; this muslin-robe was taken, worked as it is now - I know it by the pattern, and being soiled; I will not swear this silk has not been sold - we sold some of it. I recollect remarking that it was gone very quick, and I thought it could not have been sold.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Did you sell it to either of the prisoners? A. Never; the whole quantity of goods produced, I think, could not all be taken at once.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You have alluded to some conversation you had with Dunn? A. Yes, in Clerkenwell-prison; I told him I was going to Bradley's, as I was informed there was silk there; he said there was silk, and a white robedress - that some silks were made up and pawned, but no doubt she had some not made up; the two lengths of brown silks produced are from different pieces.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner the beginning of July; Jay had given me an account of the robbery - I took the prisoner with another boy, and took both to Mr. Chubb's; Jay said the prisoner was the person who took the basket; he was allowed to go home, as Jay had described him as a fair lad, and the one with him was fair. On the 24th of July I took him again, with two others, in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The other boy was much fairer than the prisoner? A. Yes - I took that boy by Jay's description - he said he had corduroy trousers on, and a round hat.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's mother, and live in Conduit-street. He had not parted from me five minutes when I was fetched, and found him in custody - we had rode to the Post-office, and were walking home; I had heard he was asked in marriage to a girl - we quarrelled about it; I told him if he was saucy, and would not be ruled by me I would never look upon him, but would give him in charge - he then ran away: he never had a charge against him before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where were you fetched from? A. I believe I had passed the Bolt-in-Tun - he had left me a few doors before I got there.</p>

The prisoner, James Boyce, immediately said, "We won't hurt you - we will have what you have got;" I begged of them not to hurt me, and they might take whatever I had got; James Boyce said, "We won't hurt you - we will have what you have got;" James Boyce then took from my right-hand trousers pocket a case of surgical instruments, and two cases of lancets, and from my right-hand waistcoat pocket three keys, and a piece of ass's skin - my left-hand pockets were rifled by the person on the other side - from my trousers pocket he took two sovereigns, three shillings, a sixpence, and a pen-knife, which had a broken point - one of them took my hat off - that was neither of the prisoners; my cravat was then taken off; as soon as the man had taken my hat he said, "Now, give the b-g-r a rum one" - James Boyce said, "No, don't hurt the poor b-g-r," and they did not do me any personal injury. I am quite certain of James Boyce - Houghton came up to me, and felt my fob pocket; he unbuttoned the flap of my breeches, and felt to see if I had a watch, but James Boyce, who had examined it before, said, "The b-g-r has got no toy;" I had no watch. As they were about to leave me I asked James Boyce to give me my keys, as they would be of no service to them - he returned one key, and they all ran away immediately. On the following morning I went to the Police-office, and got Garton, Gleed, Armstrong, Hanley, and other officers, and after the prisoners were apprehended three persons called and told me I could recover my instruments - I communicated that to the officers, and the two cases of lancets were restored to me by Garton - I went with him to Dutton's, in Brook-street, Spital-square.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Nobody but yourself was witness to the transaction? A. One or two women say they were passing, and I believe, one of them is here. I was certainly alarmed - my attention was not much distracted till they threatened to give me a rum one - I then felt more alarmed; I think it impossible I can be mistaken in James Boyce's person; the parties were all strangers to me before. I am sure I am not mistaken - it lasted about two minutes or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there much noise or conversation? A. Among themselves; I had plenty of light to see them. I heard voices behind me as well as before - persons were in front and behind; I was not alarmed till one of them took my hat and said, "Give the b-r a rum one;" as Boyce said I should not be hurt.</p>
               <p>Q. If Boyce is the individual be interfered to protect you from injury? A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it frequently occur to you to make mistakes in persons, or are you pretty accurate? A. I generally am - I could not speak to the whole twenty, but I observed several of them, so closely as to speak with confidence. I never made a mistake in the identity of a person to my knowledge; there were not twenty persons in my view; I observed several in front, who I can identify; I should know the one who took my hat in a moment if I saw him. - Boyce was apprehended on the Wednesday or Thursday following.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. You were much frightened? A. When I was threatened - I saw Houghton previously to the threat - he had searched my pockets while they were releasing my arms.</p>
               <p>Mr. ALLEY. Q. Had you abundant opportunity of seeing them? A. Yes, and have not the slightest doubt of them all; Henry Boyce was present, but not active - it happened in the parish of Bethnal-green.</p>

I apprehended Houghton on the Wednesday morning after the robbery, about six hours after I received the information - I took him in his bed; I told him he must get up and go with me; I asked where he had been on the Monday night before; he said he had had but 2 1/2d. in his pocket, and that he had been to the Angel and Crown public-house, opposite the church in the road (opposite Whitechapel church), spent it, and returned home;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140047"/>the Angel and Crown is about three quarters of a mile from where the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was at the office, but not before the Magistrate, did he say any thing to you? A. He told me afterwards that he had been to the Angel and Trumpet public-house, at Stepney, on the Monday evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You said at first it was in Whitechapel-road. I understood? A. He said the Angel and Crown in the road, opposite the church.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say "Whitechapel-road?" A. It is in Whitechapel-road; he said he went up Brick-lane to the Angel and Crown, opposite the church in the road, and spent it - he said nothing more on that subject - he said, "in the road," not Mile-end-road; Mile-end-road and Whitechapel-road are in a line - I cannot tell the difference. I swear he did not say the Angel and Trumpet - he said "in the road, opposite the church" but did not say what church.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Is it called both Mile-end and Whitechapel road? A. I call it both; the Angel and Trumpet is a mile from the other house, and not opposite a church.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. When did he say it was the Angel and Trumpet? A. Not till after Mr. Fuller had seen him, about an hour and a half afterwards - he said full an hour and a half afterwards that he was at the Angel and Crown, and then contradicted himself, and said it was the Angel and Trumpet - he had spoken to nobody but Mr. Fuller and the officers.</p>

            . I live at No. 3, Stevens'-buildings. Bethnal-green, at the top of Fleet-street-hill. On Monday, the 11th, about a quarter or ten minutes after eight o'clock, as I came out of my house I saw two young fellows following Mr. Fuller; there was a whistle given, and the word "Now;" then about a dozen surrounded him, and he was robbed; I staid there about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and was within about fourteen yards of Mr. Fuller; I did not see Houghton there; I cannot take upon myself to say he was not there, as there were so many; there might be thirty; Mr. Fuller did not fall, for I sat with my baby in my arms, and after the robbery was done, I went up, and saw Mr. Fuller, he was very weak and low, and was taken into a chandler's shop - I did not speak to him; I did not see his hat taken, but, as they ran from the gentleman, I saw a man, named Norton, come under our shop window with his hat in his hand; I had seen them hustling his pockets behind; I did not see either of the prisoners there; they said, "If you offer to resist, or make an alarm, we will knock your b-y brains out."</p>

            . I live at No. 15, Mead-street, near Shoreditch, in the parish of Bethnal-green, and am a journeyman shoemaker. I know Houghton. On Monday, the 11th of September, I was at the Angel and Trumpet with him; we started to go there at half-past six, and remained there till half-past ten; I will take my oath that he was not out of my sight five minutes during all that time; Sidebottom went with me and Houghton to the house; I do not remember seeing one Hawes there.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Who do you work for now? A. Mr. Pollock, of Shoreditch, near the church on the left hand side - I worked for him at the time of the robbery; I do the work at home with my father; I generally work till eight or nine, but sometimes leave off at dark; on Monday we generally do not get our work ready - we get it prepared - I generally go out earlier on a Monday; my uncle lives with us - neither he or my father are here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Sidebottom fall into a misfortune that night? A. Not that I know of - he was taken on suspicion of a robbery - I heard it was committed that night; I do not know whether he was taken that night; when I left the house I left him in company with a young woman at the door; I left the house at half-past ten o'clock; I know Hawes - I did not see him that evening; I know Fleet-street-hill; I was not there that night - I could go that way home, but I did not - I got home near upon a quarter past eleven o'clock; I saw no robbery that night - I never said I saw the robbery committed as I was going home - I swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you never taken up yourself charged with any offence? A. I was taken for a slight offence - they took me for going down a turning, and said I was hunting a bullock - I was fined - I was never in custody for any other offence - the bullock hunt was six weeks or two months ago - I have not seen the landlord of the public-house here - he was not in the house when I went in, but the servant was, and she knows I came in, but her master would not let her come.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The landlord was not there? A. I did not see him for an hour or two - I did not see the landlady - I saw the female servant - she served us with what we drank, which was porter - we had no brandy or gin - we had two or three pots of porter - Houghton and Sidebottom drank with me - we each paid our own part - it came to 15d. - it was 5d. a pot - I went out on the opposite side of the way, and got some bacon and bread from a shop - I do not know who keeps the shop - I am not often at the Angel and Trumpet - I have been there six or eight times - we each paid 5d. - I changed a sixpence - I cannot say whether Houghton and Sidebottom paid in silver or copper; when I went in I dare say there were ten people in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140048"/>the room, and more came in; I dare say there were fifteen or twenty there when I came away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Houghton call for you to go with him? A. No, I went from my residence at nearly a quarter past six o'clock, and met him down Brick-lane - we met Sidebottom at Hanbury's brewhouse, about one hundred and fifty yards from where I met Houghton - we went into the public-house together; I got the bread and bacon soon after I went in.</p>

            . I am a weaver, and live in Cheshire-street, Hare-street-fields. On Monday week I was in Houghton's company; I met him in Brick-lane about a quarter to seven o'clock in the evening. with Adey, and we went to the Angel and Trumpet, at Stepney; we remained there till the publican would not draw us any more beer; he said it was time to be going - I was the last who asked him for beer, but not the last in the house - I went away first, and bid Houghton and Adey good night; they were in my company from a quarter to seven o'clock till half-past ten; Houghton did not leave our company all that time - not to my recollection; if he was out it was not for more than five minutes I am sure.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. You have stated that you went away first; then Adey could not have left you behind talking to a woman? A. I went out of the house first - he did not leave me behind; I was taken up that night on suspicion - they said it was for stealing some pork; I was put into the watch-house, and discharged the next day; I know Fleet-street-hill - I went down Brick-lane that night about a quarter to seven o'clock; I do not know whether you call that passing Fleet-street-hill - it is at the end of the street - it was not a quarter past seven.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you in company with any woman that night? A. I was speaking with a young woman at the door when I left the house; Houghton and Adey came out just after me, and left me at the door talking to the young woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Who drank with you? A. Houghton and Adey, and another young man, who was in the house when I went in; we had two or three pots of beer; I will not be certain how many; I know what I paid for; I paid 2 1/2d. for a pint; Adey paid for the first pot himself; I think he gave a 6d.; he went out after asking for a newspaper,(which he could not get), and fetched some bread and bacon - the servant of the house served us with beer; I saw the landlord, but not when I first went in; I do not know whether the young woman who brought the beer was the landlady or servant; I had met them in Brick-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you certain this was the 11th of September? A. I cannot be certain of the date, but it was on Monday - last Monday week; I had been ino the City about work.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You say there was another man at the house? A. Yes; he was not in our company at first, but drank with us; I do not know his name - I never saw him before.</p>

On the 25th of July Mr. Revell paid me a 50l. note, which I put into my pocket-book, with other notes; I kept my pocket-book in a book-case in the parlour in the daytime, and at night my wife always took it up to the bed-room; I had a key to the book-case; I saw the 50l. note last about seven o'clock on Saturday evening, the 12th of August; it was the outside note of some others; I missed it on Monday morning, about six o'clock, out of the pocket-book, which was then in my wife's pocket, under the pillow, in bed; I had not touched the pocket-book since Saturday; I saw it on the book-case on Sunday morning; before I went to church, and locked the bookcase before I went out, taking the key in my pocket. The prisoner had lived three months in my service, and left on the Friday week before this Sunday - she had given notice; I missed a key of the book-case, and some other keys, before she went away, and a few days after had the lock taken off, and a new key made, but whether the lock was altered I do not know; I expected the prisoner at my house at twelve o'clock on the day I missed the note, but, as she did not come, I went with a constable to Mrs. Stanley's, No. 26, Corbett's-court, Brown's-lane, Spital-fields, about two o'clock, and found the prisoner lodging there; I told her of my loss - she said she was surprised, or sorry to hear it; I said I wished to search her boxes, for I suspected her of having robbed me; she said we might, for she knew nothing of it; I found a box full of valuable silk-dresses - some silk-mercers and tavern bills - she was afterwards taken into custody. I cannot be certain whether I or my wife wrote Mr. Revell's name on the note - we invariably endorse them - I saw his name on the top of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You saw it in the bookcase at seven o'clock on Saturday night? A. Yes; I know that Mrs. Brooks took the pocket-book up to bed on Saturday and Sunday, but it was not opened after Saturday; I sleep with my room door fastened - nobody comes into my room before I am up. I had parted on good terms with the prisoner - she said she was going to Bath to see her friends. I had no other 50l. note from the time Mr. Revell paid this to me till I lost it.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. I generally take the pocket-book and purse every night from the book case to the bed-room, and remember doing so on Saturday, the 12th of August - I brought them down in the morning, placed them in the book-case, took them up at night from the book-case, and put them into my pocket under the pillow - I did not open the book; on Monday morning my husband missed the note; we keep the bookcase locked - nobody can get at it without a key - I had put this 50l. note into the pocket-book about three weeks before, when Mr. Revell paid it to me, and we had no other 50l. note in the house; I wrote his name on it, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you actually see the note in the book? A. I think on the Friday before it was taken; when the key was lost we had another made to the same lock; I never saw the prisoner at our house after she left till she was apprehended; it could not have been taken from under my head; I have the servant still with me who took the prisoner's place; she is not here, but the nurse maid is. When I came from church I heard the prisoner had been there.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. What time did you go to church? A. About a quarter to eleven, with my husband - we returned about one; the prisoner had told me she was going to Bath, but should return in a week, and would call. and, if I was not suited with a servant, would come back.</p>

            . On the 13th of August I was in Mrs. Brook's service, as nurse. Master and mistress went to church - the prisoner called between eleven and twelve o'clock; Butlin, the man servant let her in; I was going to clean myself, and asked her to go with me; we went into the second floor room, and in about five minutes, she said her stomach ached, and she wished to go to the watercloset, which is down stairs, and goes down two steps from the parlour door - she was down stairs about five minutes. When she went away she appointed to call next day about twelve or one o'clock, but did not come.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She was brought to your house on Monday afternoon? A. Yes; she was a very few minutes down stairs; I did not notice the time - she came up again to me, and returned into the kitchen - she was in the house about half an hour. I have lived there four years - master and mistress go regularly to church on Sundays.</p>

            , and live in Corbett-court. The prisoner came to lodge with me when she left Mr. Brooks. On Sunday, the day before she was taken, she came home with Butlin (I think it was about half-past two o'clock) - he spent the afternoon there, and between five and six the prisoner gave me a 50l. note to change; I changed it at the Golden Harp public-house, kept by Mr. Astle; I gave her the change - it was a 10l. note, some gold, silver, and a paper of half-pence - I told her where I got it - she owed some bills, and on Monday sent me to pay them; I cannot tell the amount - I fetched some things out of pawn for her. After she was taken up I took her child to her in prison; she always said the note was Mr. Brooks', and I asked her about the note; she said if I was afraid of the note I might shift it from the public-house, and I did. I went to Mr. Astle, by her desire, and took a man with me, who gave Astle gold for it; I had left Astle 19l. before - that was the remainder of the money the prisoner had left in the drawer - the man I took paid the rest, and Astle gave him the note - the man gave me 4l., which the prisoner has had at different times, as she wanted it. I cannot read or write.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were very much frightened about the note? A. I was when I heard Mr. Brooks had lost it; I was afraid of getting into trouble about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she say, "There is nothing wrong in it, but if you are afraid, let the note be shifted?" A. No; Mr. Brooks did not threaten to take me up; I have had her child four years, and have got it now; I do not know a 50l. note when I see it.</p>
               <p>Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Can you tell how much money you got for it? No, it was counted into my lap; the prisoner told me it was a 50l. note; I was not taken up.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You cannot swear that the same note was given back? A. Yes; for we had no other 50l. note in the house; my husband put Stanley's name on it; I did not look to see whether any other name was on it.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH ASTLE. I do not remember whether any name was on it; I wrote Stanley on it.</p>

I pulled my hat off, and shewed him how I would act; he then gave me the cheque in the letter to take to Mr. Taylor; I asked if he had any particular message - he said, if they asked who I was, to say I was Dalby Williams' youngest son; I told him, if there was any lies attached to it, I would have nothing to do it; he pressed me very much to take it - I thought there must be something bad in it, and refused; when I got home I told my father, who sent me next morning to Messrs. Taylor, and I informed them about it.</p>

            . I am seventeen years old, and live in James-street, Limehouse-fields. On the 1st of July, the prisoner accosted me - I do not think he is the man;(looking at him) I am sure that is not the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a man afterwards taken into custody? A. Yes; he looks like the man who was taken; he was taken on the 1st of July, by Tuson, the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you point out the person who was to be taken into custody? A. I saw a person run across the road, and said, that looked like the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man who ran across the road, and whom you pointed out, the same person who had spoken to you before? A. He looked liked the same person - he was taken into custody - I am not positive that he was the person I had seen before - I was not positive then.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you were not positive, and that you did not swear to him? A. No - I was not positive- I never have been altogether positive; I have had no conversation with the prisoner's friends; I suppose I was about ten minutes with the person who gave me the note; I did not speak positively to the person when he was taken; I was sworn before the Magistrate, and what I said was written down.</p>
               <p>Q. When that man was taken into custody by the officer, did you, or did you not, speak positively to him to the officer? A. No, Sir, I swear that.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you believe the man, taken into custody, is the man who before had spoken to you? A. No, my Lord; I do not think it was the man; I did not say so to the officer; I was so frightened at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body speak to you that day, and give you any thing? A. The man spoke to me, and gave me a note - I was to take it to Mr. Taylor.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. What Mr. Taylor? A. The brewer- I delivered it to Mr. Blaikie, at the brewery in Ropemaker's-walk; I was to return to the person at Poplargate. Mr. Sewell, the clerk, and Mr. Tuson, the officer, went back with me to Poplar-gate - when I got back I did not see anybody for five minutes; I then saw a person run across the road, and then I beckoned to Mr. Sewell, and said I thought that was the person; I do not recollect the person beckoning to me - Mr. Sewell and Tuson saw him running - I called them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen any person before you saw the man run across the road? A. I saw a great many walking up and down the road; I pointed out the man who ran across; Sewell and Tuson ran after him; I suppose he ran nearly a quarter of a mile before he was taken - I believe Stop thief! was cried - I cried out once, I believe. The man was taken in the King and Queen, public-house, Three Colts-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the constable and Mr. Sewell up when the man was taken? A. No - I was up first; the constable came next - I did not point him out to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came this man to be taken? A. Because a man had hold of him by the collar; I did not point him out, nor say any thing to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say whether he was the man or was not? A. No - I did not point at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say he was the man or not? A. No - I do not recollect saying a word - I did not speak a word, or intimate in any way that he was the man - I did not think him the man - I had my doubt whether he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you express to any body that doubt? A. No. The deposition made by the witness before the Magistrate was here given him to read.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. This signature is your writing, is it? A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now read to yourself, beginning at the words "I, the said John Stanbury, on my oath, say" - (he does so) - was the account you have now seen road over to you before you signed it? A. I do not recollect it being read over; I was asked questions; I believe I said to the officer what is written down.</p>
               <p>Q. To what officer? A. To a stout gentleman at the office, and then it was written down; I do not recollect it being read over - I believe I signed it, without it being read.</p>
               <p>Q. Now read it to yourself - (he does so) - having read that do you now know, who is the person who came to you in the morning with the letter? A. The man looked very much like the person at the bar, but that is not the man; I have seen a man since very much like that man.</p>
               <p>Q. You believe that not to be the man? A. Yes - I do not recollect what dress he had on now.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had gone to Taylor's, and Sewell and the constable came back with you, did you see the man who was taken up before he began running? A. No, Sir - I do not think he beckoned to me; I do not recollect his beckoning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you do not think he did, or that he did not? A. No - he did not beckon; I do not recollect swearing before the Magistrate that he beckoned to me(the witness was here again desired to read his deposition) it says so there, my Lord, but I do not recollect his beckoning - I do not recollect saying so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you state before the Magistrate that the prisoner was the person who gave you that note? A. (hesitating) I had my doubts whether it was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you state that it was the prisoner who came to you, talked to you, and gave you that letter? A. I believe I did, but I was so frightened I did not know what I was swearing; I do not believe he was the man.</p>

On the 1st of July I saw Stanbury at the brew-house, and went another way to the place appointed; he had told us where to go to look for a person; I went to that place - he pointed out the prisoner as the person who gave him the letter; I am quite sure he pointed him out; I had not observed the prisoner make a signal; I was across the road; it is impossible I could mistake the man he pointed out; I pursued, and he was apprehended in the King and Queen - I asked him why he ran - he said he was running for a coach for himself - he was standing still when the witness pointed him out - I told him it was a strange way to run for a coach up one street and down another - he said he was on very particular business, which he had to do before he went to the coach, and that was the reason of his running - he asked what was the matter; I said I would tell him when we got to the watch-house; I took him there, and Mr. Sewell gave charge of him, and, in the presence of two or three more, I asked the boy whether he was positive he was the man - he said he was; I asked him, moreover, if he could swear to him; he told me Yes; the prisoner then endeavoured to alarm the boy, by saying"Don't do so; you are not sure."</p>

I heard two or three voices outside the house; I listened some time, at last the noise approached my bed-room; we then got up - the rushlight went out as Mrs. Hill took it up - we struck a light and I looked up the chimney - the soot was falling down, and I could see nothing; I then went up to my children's room, but could find nobody; next day I went into Smithfield and spoke to my neighbour about his having the chimney-sweepers so early, and found he had none; it was remarked that my chimney-pot was broken; I sent a man up, and the prisoner was discovered in the chimney - he had stuck fast there - we were obliged to get him out with ropes; he must have been there before day-light, for all at once the noise of talking became confused and ceased, and, when I looked up the chimney, both soot and mortar fell down; we got him out of the chimney, and asked how he came there; he said he had lost some pigeons, and considering they had flown down there he came down to find them; I gave him in charge - he appeared a chimney-sweeper by his dress.</p>

I saw the prisoner there, and, in consequence of a communication which was made to me, I sent for her, and asked if she knew the object of my sending for her; she said she did not, unless it was in consequence of some papers being taken from under the bed (she had left the house at that time); I said that was not my object, and asked if she did not know she was sent for in consequence of Mrs. Dolway's money being missed - she said she did not - I asked if she had not been told that morning what was my object; she denied it, and I sent for Mrs. Moss and others; I repeated the same questions, and they said, in her presence, they had told her it was for that; she then admitted that was the fact - there are other executors to the will.</p>

An old lady, who lived in the house with Mrs. Dolway as a sort of companion, and had the care of her property; the will has not been proved: I have acted upon it, but not taken out a probate - the offence was committed before I began to act; Hillyer was a sort of confidential servant, who had lived with her, and had the care of her property for thirty years - it would be in her possession till it was delivered up to me.</p>

               <p>ELIZABETH HILLYER. I lived with Mrs. Dolway twenty-six years, in the house of Mr. Thomas Moss, at Kensington - he lived there himself - Mrs. Dolway died on the 23d of August; I always had the care of her things before her death, and after her death took charge of the property left; she used to keep her money in the celeret drawer in the day time, and at night she always took it out and gave it to me to put under the bed - in the morning I used to take it out, and she herself replaced it in the celeret - that was her invariable custom for years; but on the Tuesday night, the day before she died, she gave me but two parcels of money instead of three, and, in the morning, while she was alive, I them out and put them in the celeret - then I saw a third took parcel there, which she had not taken out at night; she died between 2 and 3 o'clock on the Wednesday afternoon; I saw the three parcels in the celeret on Thursday morning: the prisoner came to the house about an hour before Mrs. Dolway died, and continued in the house till the Monday morning following; she had the care of the room and corpse day and night; the celeret was in the sitting room, but on the Saturday I removed it into the bed room, where the corpse lay - nobody was in the bed room except the prisoner and her niece - the celeret had a spring lock; I never opened it after Thursday morning.</p>

               <p>Q. When you say you saw three parcels of money, you cannot say what sort of money it was? A. It was wrapped in paper - I was always informed there was gold; I did not open the parcels, but she always kept her money in that way.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. When did you miss the parcel? A. On the Monday morning when Mr. Storey came - the prisoner had then left the house about an hour - the prisoner was only sent for to take care of the body; I never left the house - her business was to set up with the body; she had no possession of the property.</p>

I know the prisoner - she lived in Newland-street, about five minutes walk from Mrs. Matthew's; I lived two years with her as servant, and she got me my place at Mrs. Matthew's. On Tuesday, the 29th of August, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I was looking out of window, and saw her in the street, and when I came down she gave me this parcel, and said, "Take care of it for me;" she did not tell me what it was; I put it into my box without opening it, and delivered the same parcel to Ellis on the same day as I received it.</p>

            . I am a principal officer of Bow-street. In consequence of information I went to Mrs. Matthews', and received from Rust this parcel, containing twenty-four sovereigns, and a 10l. Bank note, No. 8048, dated 9th of June, 1826 - they were in a silk glove, and afterwards put into the leg of a silk stocking, and tied round with ribbon- Kensington is in the parish of St. Mary Abbotts.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you certain this house is in that parish? A. Not positive; I afterwards took the prisoner into custody, and asked if she had any means of getting her living, except going out nursing - she hesitated, and, at last, I said I was an officer, and that where she had been sitting up with and old lady, who was dead, some money was missing; she said she had some property coming from a mortgage - that her brother, when he came to town, usually brought her the money, but she had received none for a considerable time - that he was in town in May, but brought her none then, nor had he sent her any since; I asked whether, when she went out nursing she left her money at home, or took it with her, or placed it in any other person's hands; she denied a dozen times having ever placed any money in any body's hands; I then took out this parcel, and asked if she knew it; she said she did, and she had given it to Rust.</p>

               <p>Q. Just look at your deposition? A. I see I there state that he snatched it; but he did it forcibly; I held it tight, as he looked at me viciously - there was no struggle for it.</p>

On the 14th of July, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was going to Whitechapel-market, and had to pass through <placeName id="t18260914-74-crimeloc446">Fleet-street-hill</placeName>

When I had passed them ten or twelve yards I heard a voice say, "Here goes the bl - y beadle;" I then thought I was in danger, and walked on quickly, but presently I felt a quantity of stones, dirt, and mud, coming from behind me; they were thrown at me. I turned round a corner, where I was obliged to turn, and turned shortly round to see if I knew any of the men who were throwing the stones, and saw the prisoner Robinson very active in throwing stones - I staid for a little while. and six persons came from the rest - both the prisoners were among those six; King came and said to me, "I say they say you legged some of our chaps;" I understand legging means transporting, or convicting for different crimes; I am not certain whether they said chaps or palls - I made no answer; King then came and tapped me on the shoulder, looked quite close at me, and said,"Have you got any money for us?" I said, "None for you;" Robinson was close at his elbow; King said,"We shall soon have it all you b - r" - as soon as the words were out of his mouth he knocked me down with something which he held in his hand (it is a thing called a dumb-bell - a lump of lead with a nob at each end); an effusion of blood came running down the front of my face; I have the mark across my nose, and shall carry it to the grave; I did not fall from the blow, but stooped down, being in extreme pain, but sensible. I stooped down to let the blood run from me, and the pain was so great I put my hand to my face - I immediately felt King with his hand in my right-hand waistcoat pocket, where I had three half-crowns; this was while I was stooping - some of the half-crowns were out of my pocket directly; a kind of tussle took place between Robinson and King, and some of the money fell on the stones - I heard it jingle, and saw Robinson with some silver in his hand, but whether that was mine or not I cannot say - he said, "Look at this, you b - r?" he opened his hand, and I saw some half-crowns in it; I said, "What have I done to deserve this punishment?" they said, "That is the chap<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140057"/>that has legged some of our coves" - both the prisoners said so - they left me and dispersed. The whole six were round while this took place; I know the other four, but have not seen them since - I should know them again; I knew both the prisoners as well as I know myself - I had seen them several times. When they left me several inhabitants came round - I spoke to a woman, who is not here, first; I described their persons. King was taken next day, and Robinson the day after, but I did not see him till several days - as sure as I stand here they are the men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you see a person named Wood after this happened? A. Yes - I applied to him for some vinegar a few minutes after - I did not know him before; I pointed out to him, and others two persons who were running - they were not a great distance from me. I am not a Jew. I mentioned to Wood about losing money - I swear that I complained of being both robbed and ill-used. I was rather afraid, having no one to assist me; I was in a state of fear, but not so much as to make a mistake in their persons. Robinson threw stones at me - King gave me the blows; his hand was in my pocket - I generally keep silver in my waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after his hand was in your pocket did you see Robinson? A. Not a minute; it was between six and seven o'clock, for when I was crossing Hare-street-fields I heard the clock strike six. I know Robinson's brother, but cannot say whether I saw him there, or spoke to him; I saw several persons, and spoke to them - I noticed particularly who the persons were who I spoke to; I should know the persons I spoke to if I saw them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say to any person that you had not been robbed, only ill-used? A. I did not - I said to several"What I have lost is of no value, but I do not like to be ill-used" - 7s. 6d. is of value to me, but I would rather lose three times that than be ill-used. I was asked if I was robbed while Wood was gone for the vinegar, but did not say I had not been robbed; I told some of them I had only lost three-half-crowns - I do not know Denower, an undertaker, not by name; nor Tow or Low; these persons might have met me in the street after I was robbed. I told every body I had been robbed - I always said I was robbed of three half-crowns.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Are you a foreigner? A. A native of Saxony; I always spoke of being robbed; Norris was the first person I desired to assist me in apprehending them; it was about twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour after I left Hare-street-fields - it was about twenty minutes past six o'clock.</p>

I took King the next night in brick-lane, coming up Spicer-street, about twelve o'clock- I took Robinson on the Thursday morning following, it of bed at his mother's house.

            . I am a patrol. I heard of this affair the same night, but did not hear Myerson describe the parties.</p>
               <p>KING'S Defence. I was looking after work all day.</p>
               <p>ROBINSON'S Defence. At the time of the robbery I was talking to Burdett, at his own door in Fleet-street-hill. I saw a mob at the corner of Wheeler-street - I looked down, and saw them round the gentleman - I turned round, and went to the door again.</p>

            . I live in Ram-alley, Fleet-street, Bethnal-green. I am a weaver, but at the time this happened I kept a coal-shed in Weaver-street. After the prosecutor was robbed he came up to me - I went to the public-house close by, got a halfpenny-worth of vinegar and brought it to him in a basin - the side of his face was cut - it did not appear swollen then - I was standing at my gate when he came up to me; just before he came up I saw two young men run by - he pointed them out to me- just after he got off the ground he said, "See how I have been ill-used by them young rascals, or them young villains;" I will not be certain which.</p>
               <p>Q. When he said that did he point to anybody? A. He put his arms out. I have known Robinson nearly two years, and used to see him frequently - I know both the prisoners; I am positive the men he pointed out were neither of them. I never heard him say a word of being robbed, nor did he inquire for an officer or anybody, to assist in apprehending them - he said he had been ill-used by them villains or rascals, and that he had done nothing to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Were you the only person by at the time? A. Another young man stood talking to me in the yard at the time they ran by - that was Abraham Robinson, the prisoner's brother; we both went out after these young men, to see what they were running after. Robinson is not related to me - I have known his family two years, and he has worked for a master whom I worked for; I had not seen John Robinson that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Mind what you are about? A. I saw him that afternoon come home to his mother's house, just after this happened, about ten minutes after the affair happened - that was as near five o'clock as could be; I stood at my gate at that time - his mother lives close on the spot where it happened, not a dozen yards from where the beadle was ill-used - it was near five o'clock, to the best of my recollection; I had not seen King that afternoon, I am certain-I was in Weaver-street that day, backwards and forwards about my business - I saw nobody gambling there.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Robinson send to you to come to the Old<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140058"/>Bailey? A. About a fornight ago - his brother Tom came to me, not Abraham; he did not send to me before that. I did not go before the Magistrate - I was never before one in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Myerson, in company with either of the prisoner's brothers, to offer him 10l. to throw out this bill before the Grand Jury? A. No, I did not; I went to him before the prisoners' second hearing - the mother asked me to be kind enough to go down - Thomas Robinson went with me; I went to tell him I thought him under wrong notions - he had taken up the wrong parties; I told him so, and that is all. I did not offer him 10l. to get the bill thrown out - no such thing was mentioned - I will swear the offer was not made by either me or the prisoner's brother; I never heard it made by anybody. I merely went out of friendship to the old woman, she being a neighbour.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Do you speak of time to the best of your recollection? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am the prisoner Robinson's eldest brother. I am a weaver, but now keep a green-grocer's shop. I was with Wood in his coal-shed when this happened; we went out to the end of the yard, to the gate, together, and saw two persons running, and then saw Myerson picking his hat up; I did not hear him say any thing; he was twenty or thirty yards from me - neither of the prisoner are either of the two persons who were running - I did not see them in the street. Myerson made up to Wood, and while Wood was gone for the vinegar I asked him what they had been doing to him; he said he had been terribly ill-used; I asked if he knew either of them - he said No - he said he knew one who was in his shirt sleeves. I asked if he had been robbed; he said No, he was not robbed, but terribly ill-used, and he asked no one to assist to take them.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Where is your brother Tom? A. Outside.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this? A. What day? it was about five o'clock in the afternoon - I think it was on Thursday, between four and five o'clock; I had come from my home to Mr. Wood's - I lived in King-street, Spitalfields then; I have moved since; I was going to see my mother, but, Wood being an acquaintance, I called in to see him first. I saw nobody about gambling in the way I came - I came into Weaver-street; I did not come over Fleet-street-hill - I was not holyday-making - I had but little work, and my wife looks after that. When I left Wood's I went home to my own house; I stopped at Wood's three quarters of an hour, and it might be seven o'clock when I got home - I was not in Wood's company all that time; I sometimes chop wood for him; I was in the yard, but he was not with me; his wife and children might be there for what I know. I had seen nobody gambling that afternoon, nor had been with any - I never keep such company - I swear I had not; I did not know Myerson, the beadle, then; I did not know he was a beadle for six or seven days after. I went with my brother Tom to Myerson's, to ask him about the case - it might be six or seven days after, but I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Who desired you to go? A. I went of my own free will, to ask him how he meant to manage the case, and acquaint him he had got the wrong person; I never mentioned a word about bribing him to throw out the bill, nor did my brother - I swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. As you did not see Myerson robbed, why did you go to tell him he had got the wrong men? A. Because I knew it was not the two people he had taken whom I saw run away.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Do you speak of time as far as you recollect? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>LEWIS MYERSON re-examined. Wood is the person who brought me the vinegar, but I did not see this man there.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoners were in custody did any body come to make you an offer? A. Yes, Wood, Abraham Robinson, and a third man; they came and asked if I was Myerson, and if I was beadle of the Episcopal-chapel; they asked if I would go and take any thing to drink; I thanked them, and said I would rather not; Wood said,"Now, you know me?" I said "Yes, I know you are the person who brought me the vinegar;" he said "Yes, now you know the proverb, 'If one hand washes the other, they will both be clean;" "Yes," said I, "but give me an explanation thereof;" he said, "Now, it is a serious case of this young man - you have got a family, and so have I, and I am an acquaintance of this person's, and you don't know what your children may come to." -</p>
               <p>Q. Without stating all this did they offer you any bribe of 10l., by any means you could, to throw out the bill? - A. They did - ten sovereigns. I mentioned nothing about shirt sleeves when I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Who was present when any thing was said about ten sovereigns? A. My wife was at the door, but did not hear it; they came three times - Wood and a person not here came the first time, Abraham Robinson came the second, with Wood, and the third time they came to the chapel on a Wednesday - Wood came then with another person; it was only the second time that Wood and Abraham Robinson came together; there was another man standing a dozen yards or so off.</p>
               <p>Q. Now where was this? A. At my house, one evening - I think about three weeks after the prisoners were apprehended - ten sovereigns was mentioned when they were both present. I have heard them both deny this.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was any offer made to you the first time? A. Ten sovereigns, if I would make a flaw in the indictment, and throw it out - they said the second time 10l. was at my service - they had before said sovereigns, and at the chapel they offered me ten sovereigns, and some thing handsome besides. I knew the prisoners by name before the robbery, and I mentioned their names to the officers when I described them.</p>

            . I am an undertaker, and live at No. 18, Princes-street, Mile-end New-town. I was passing at the time the prosecutor was ill-used, and saw the persons who ill-used him - I was about one hundred yards off, and could see perfectly the persons who did - I am confident neither of the prisoners were present - I have known them from their cradles.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. As they did not do it, perhaps you can tell who did? A. No - I do not know the two, but can safely say it was not the prisoners, although the two men who did it ran by me; I should know them if I saw them; I was afraid they would serve me the same if I stopped them; I was going up to help Myerson, but be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140059"/>fore I could reach him they came running by me - I only saw two - I know Robinson's mother; I did not see her that evening. I happened to call on her two or three days after he was taken; I heard they were taken, and of course, thought it my duty to right them as well as I could; I did not ask when they were to be examined, being an undertaker I am so much engaged; they had been examined when I was at Robinson's mother's; I do not know what day they were taken up, but think it was Saturday; I cannot say whether they had had their last examination. I told her I would come here with the greatest pleasure; I did not go before the Justice. I was going, on the 14th of July, to my brother's, about a bill he was answerable for - he lives in Fox-street, Pott-street, Bethnal-green-road - his name is Elias Denower - it is above half a mile from Fleet-street-hill, but that is the nearest way to it; I was endeavouring to get to my brother's about five o'clock; I went through Weaver-street - I saw nobody playing at cards or tossing; there were a few people at the top, but only two were near Myerson - I only saw two near him - they both had long coats on - neither of them was in his shirt sleeves. I saw Wood give Myerson some vinegar - I saw nobody go into Mrs. Robinson's house - if Robinson had turned into his mother's house while I was there, I must have seen him.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you go on to your brother's? A. Yes. As I went along I saw Robinson talking with a young man at his own house - that, of course, convinced me that it was not him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know who that young man was? A. Yes, Robert Wilkinson - it was at Wilkinson's uncle's house.</p>

               <p>Q. Two persons were ill-using Myerson - how far off were any other persons? A. Sixty and seventy yards - at the top of the street; only these two were about him - there was no other person within sixty or seventy yards of him at the time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far was Wood's house from him? - A. As near as I can guess sixty or seventy yards; it was done opposite Mrs. Robinson's door - they were both taken when I heard of it - they had had their hearing; I did not notice the date - it was the second or third day after they were taken that I heard of it; I cannot say how long it was after it happened - I cannot say whether it was a week or ten days after.</p>

            . My uncle lives on Fleet-street-hill - his name is Burdett. I was inside my uncle's room on this day; I heard a great noise, and came out to ask what it was - I did not see it begin, but I saw a mob at the corner of Weaver-street, and while I stood there Robinson came up to me from quite a different way - he was coming towards the crowd; he came to me as I stood at the door; I asked how he was, and if he had any work, and then he asked me what was the matter at the corner of the street - I advised him to stop with me till the crowd was gone away; he did so, and then went home.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Did you see the man ill-used? A. No. I know Denower, and saw him pass my uncle's door, going towards where Mrs. Robinson lived - he was ear the house, but had to turn a corner before he could to her door.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if the man was robbed opposite Mrs. Robinson's door he could not see it? A. He might see it after he turned the corner; he could not see her door when I saw him, but could directly he turned the corner. I am a weaver, and work for Mr. Huxtable - I live in Church-street; I was holyday-making that afternoon; nobody was with me - I had just come from home. After seeing Denower I went into my uncle's; I left Robinson to go home - it was on Friday, the 14th of July. I do not know when the prisoners were examined; I did not attend as a witness - I said I would attend here; I should have gone if I had been asked. I never saw Myerson before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you say you would come here? A. About three weeks ago - it was after the examination; I do not know where Wood lives.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Wood when the prosecutor was there? A. Yes - he asked for a little vinegar, and Wood got it - the vinegar was there when I first went up; the prosecutor was asked if he had been robbed, and replied, No; he complained of being ill-used; I have known Robinson from his cradle, and always heard a good character of him; king was a carpenter, and has a good character.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. In what employ was Robinson when he was apprehended? A. A weaver; he manufactured lusterings for his brother, at his brother's house, which is a quarter of a mile from his mother's; I have seen King working at his father's; the prosecutor was ten or twelve yards from Mrs. Robinson's door, on the opposite side.</p>
               <p>Q. And you saw it going on? A. I was going by at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know Robinson was taken up on a charge of robbery, six months ago? A. I know nothing of it - it was not for robbery; I did hear he was taken up, but what for I did not hear, whether it was for interrupting any body in the street, or what - I never asked.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Did you see him at large afterwards? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>ROBINSON. I was taken for assulting Wood, and officer.</p>
               <p>COURT to NORRIS. Q. What time on Friday evening did the prosecutor describe the persons to you? A. As near nine o'clock as possible - he gave me both their names; I did not know where they lived - I found out where Robinson's mother lived on Tuesday, but understood he never lived at home, and did not go to disturb his mother till Thursday, at half-past six o'clock in the morning, when I took him; King had been taken before the Magistrates on Monday, when I took him, and both were finally committed on the following Monday.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses gave King a good character.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BARRY. Q. How far from home were you robbed? A. About 600 yards; I had been selling shrimps and perriwinkles that afternoon, and sold some in the tap-room of the public-house - I was there about half an hour, not more - I had been round Hackney-road, and through Haggerston, and called at two or three public-houses, to sell my goods, the Plough and the Shoulder of Mutton - I drank at the Plough, but at no other house, till I got to the Adam and Eve, and am quite sure I was sober - it got dusk about nine o'clock; I might leave twenty people at the Adam and Eve - I am sure I left the prisoners there; as soon as I got the penny, their companion owed me, I went out; there is not a house nearer to where I was stopped, than sixty yards; I do not know who lives there, but believe Thomas George does; I did not go there - I went straight home; I found my wife at home- I knocked at my door, asked my wife for another hat, and afterwards went back to acquaint the night officer; I did not return to the public-house, as I was as near my own house, and thought the alarm had been given, as I had cried Stop thief! and Murder! all the way home as I ran. Nicholls stood on my right side - I turned my head, and saw him - he put his hands round my neck - I am sure he is the man; they were kneeling down on each side of me, and kneeling on me at the time the money was taken - I had two farthing among my money; I did not see them in custody till I got to the White Lion - Mr. Algar had told me he had got the men in custody - they stood up in the passage; it was a very light night, light enough to distinguish their countenances; I was not struck, but thrown down - I never saw them before; it might last five minutes, perhaps - I cried Murder! three or four times, and was alarmed when I was thrown down; they were on each side of me, and not behind.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did they meet you? A. No, they came behind me; I turned my head, and saw Nicholls seize hold of my neck, and, as soon as I got down, Goulby was on the other side of me; I am certain they are the men, and have always been certain.</p>

            . I am a shop-keeper, and live at Hackney-bay. On the 29th of June I was at the White Lion public-house, and heard a cry of Murder! coming in a direction from Homerton - there are fields at the back of the White Lion, and Nichols' house is not far from there; on hearing the alarm I went, in company with Bawm, towards the corner of Mr. Alsager's field; I heard the cry of murder just as I got up to the field, and presently heard footsteps coming toward me, having first heard the turnstile move; I then heard footsteps of two persons running towards us, as from Homerton - there is a footpath in this field - it is a short cut from the Homerton-road to Mr. Alsager's; I stooped down and Bawm stood on one side to prevent the persons from seeing us, and secured the persons, who were the prisoners; I took Goulby, and Bawm Nicholls - Goulby wanted to get from me, but I had a cricket bat in my hand, and told him I would knock him down if he did; I found two cloths tucked into the left side of his waistcoat; I gave them to Martin; some copper money was found on Nicholls, and 1s., in silver, which Cowling had. We took them to the White Lion, left them there, then went to see it - any one was robbed, and found the prosecutor, Nicholls, with another man, just against the place where he said he had been robbed - that is about ten yards from where the footpath leads from; he was all over blood - he told me of his being robbed, and that he knew the men who had done it - I told him they were in custody; he appeared to have been very ill-treated - indeed, when I got to the watch-house I observed marks of blood on both the prisoners' clothes; I rubbed fresh blood off the knee of one of them in the watch-house; the prosecutor had marks on the side of his head and throat - it seemed quite white matter in the morning; there were several marks as if a hand had been thrust into his collar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the prisoner Nicholls taken? A. Yes; I did not see him attempt to get away- I saw them searched by the officers - a great many coppers, and two farthings were found on the prisoner Nicholls. The spot where I found the prosecutor is in a direct road from the public-house to his home; the prisoners were in a by-way to the public-house, and not the shortest way.</p>

On the 23d of August, about five o'clock, the prisoners came into the shop with two females; this handkerchief was in the shop; I had seen it a quarter of an hour before, and nobody had been in afterwards; the women asked to look at some black silk stockings, which I shewed them; none suited - this handkerchief was on a line on the right hand side of the shop, and, in the mean time, Williams went to the bottom of the shop, where some other handkerchiefs lay on the counter; I saw him take hold of one piece, and put my brother on the watch; Dark observed me looking at Williams, and called him back; I was shewing stockings to the females all this time; Dark stood behind them, and Williams behind him; they bought nothing; I saw Williams take this neckerchief off the line, and conceal it about his person; he then tried to take a crimson one, but, observing me looking, he dropped it; he touched Dark, and they were out of the shop immediately, women and all; I took the stockings off the counter, put on my hat, and overtook them four doors off, all four in company, in the passage of a house in the Old Jewry; I had seen Williams pass the handkerchief to one of the women; I secured the prisoners, took them back to the shop, and gave them in charge; the women ran away.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Has it been found? A. Yes; my brother told the Magistrate that the women went out leisurely, and I said, very quick; I could scarcely take the prisoners; Dark resisted a great deal; he said to the women two or three times, "They are nice stockings, you had better take them;" it was a black handkerchief, with a crimson and white border; my brother did not see him with this, but with the crimson one; I saw Williams touch Dark.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's brother. I saw the two prisoners and two women come in together - they looked at some black silk stockings, which the females looked at, but none would suit; I saw Williams go down to the further end of the shop, and lay hold of a silk handkerchief, as if to examine it; he came to the back of the shop - I saw him with a crimson one in his hand, which hung up by the black one; when he saw us looking, he dropped the crimson one; he then went behind Dark, and they went out of the shop together; I jumped over the counter, and saw the black handkerchief was gone; I remained in the shop - my brother went out, and brought the prisoners back; Dark said we might search them, for they had not got the handkerchief; the officer produced it on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there any suspicion before they left the shop? A. Yes; my brother trod on my foot about five minutes after they came in; I knew what he meant; I looked most at Williams; Dart could reach the handkerchiefs easier, as he is taller, but he was not near where this handkerchief hung; he stood behind the women.</p>

On the 29th of August, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was sitting at work in the shop - some ear-rings were in the widow for sale - I heard the cracking of glass in the shop-window - I immediately looked up, and saw the prisoner, Johnson, looking through the broken glass as sted fastly at me as he possibly could - the ear-rings were quite close to the window - there is a wire against the window for the card of ear-rings to hang on; the prisoner, Luckhurst, was in conversation with a woman - he was two or three paces from Johnson, but he left the woman, and came on the other side of Johnson, who was only looking through the glass, with his arms quite straight down - a piece of glass was cut out, and fell on the tray of ear-rings; the hole was large enough to admit a man's finger, so as to reach the ear-rings - my little brother was in the parlour; I called to him, and said, I thought that man had cut the glass; he immediately run out - both the prisoners were at the window when he got outside the door; he tapped at the window, and said, "Yes, Jane, it is cut;" upon that, the prisoner, Luckhurst, looked in and went away - he one way, and the woman the other - Johnson remained at the window; I went out and laid hold of him, and told him it was him who had done it; I had missed nothing then, but some of the ear-rings were disturbed - Payne came up, and Johnson seeing him, walked away, and Payne after him - he laid hold of him, and brought him back; I saw the ear-rings in the shop afterwards - they had been only partly got out of the window - I have no share in the business.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. Has your mother any share? A. No. It was quite light.</p>

            . I am fourteen years old. I was in the parlour with my mother - my sister called me out; I had seen the window quite sound shortly before - I ran out, and saw Luckhurst at the window, where it was cut; I saw his fingers inside the pane of glass which had been cut; he had a pair of coral ear-rings between his fingers - he had got them half out, but not quite - he left them lodged in the pane of glass, half in and half out - he went away, and I after him - he went to the corner of Golden-lane, and crossed twice; I lost sight of him for about two minutes, but am quite certain he is the same person - I laid hold of him - he came with me, and said upon his word he was not on that side of the window; I am sure I saw the ear-rings between his fingers; I went for Payne, and my mother went out to Johnson, and he abused her very much, in my hearing when I came back, as she charged him with being concerned - he was at the window when I first went out - I said to my sister, "Yes, it is cut," and Johnson said, "So it is;" Payne took them both into custody; I cannot be mistaken in Luckhurst's person.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you went out you saw Luckhurst? A. Yes; his fingers were full half of them inside the window - the ear-rings were between his fingers - he left them half in and half out - I pushed them in - they had laid close to the window - the breaking of the window would nearly have moved them - I saw them between his fingers - he was pulling them, but when he saw me, he went away; the breaking of the window could not have let them out, unless he had taken them out - they were supported by a wire, they would have fallen down flat, but not have gone outside - the bottom of the card was on the wood-work of the window, and the rest on the wire - but when he had them, they were quite off the wire - he walked away - I was soon after him - if he had offered to run, I should have hallooed out - if I had stopped to tell the people, he would have got away; when I took hold of him, I said, "You have cut the window;" he said, "No, upon my word, I was not on that side of the window;" he had got about three houses up Golden-lane, (our house is seven doors from the lane) he came back quietly, but I held him tight - a child, two years old, might have brought him back, he was so frightened; when I went out I saw a woman at the window - Johnson was by the side of the window, Luckhurst and the woman were talking together, and they walked different ways - the woman was near both the prisoners; Johnson was about two panes from Luckhurst, and the woman about one pane from Johnson, when I saw them - I did not see them speak - I saw the woman walk away, as I came out, before I got to the window - I was out in a moment - she was gone before I said the window was cut, but my sister watched them more than I did - Luckhurst saw me coming, and walked away just as I got to the door; when I got to the threshold of the door, I stood at the pane, and saw the ear-rings in his fingers, which were within the glass.</p>
               <p>Prisoner JOHNSON to JANE TYAS. Q. You said you laid hold of me when you came out - was it not your mother? A. We both laid hold of him; my mother, seeing Payne coming up, let him go; he walked away, and Payne after him; the woman was next to Johnson; Luckhurst was at the other side of the window, and he was a few paces beyond Johnson.</p>

            . I am a street-keeper. I was sent for, and found Luckhurst in custody, in Tyas' shop - I found on him a knife, a tooth-pick, and this piece of wire, turned round as it is now - a piece was broken out of the window; I tried the knife to the putty, and it fitted the marks, as if it had been used to break the glass. Richard Tyas pointed out Johnson, who was running towards Golden-lane; I ran, and brought him back - he said he knew nothing about it - he had only heard the boy say the window was broken; I found nothing on him. The ear<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140064"/>rings were left in the shop; I knew nothing of them till next morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there any thing particular in the knife? A. No, it is a pen-knife. The wire does not appear to have been used.</p>
               <p>JANE TYAS. The ear-rings were marked 17s. 6d.; they cost 12s.</p>
               <p>Mr. TYAS. The window was safe when I went out - the ear-rings were supported on wire; if that fell they must have fallen backwards.</p>
               <p>LUCKHURST's Defence. I am innocent. I never saw this young man till I was taken.</p>
               <p>JOHNSON'S Defence. I was passing the shop, and happened to look in; a woman and two young lads stood there - directly I came to the window the two young lads walked away - this boy came out, and said the window was cut; I looked at it, and said it was cut; they came and took this young man into custody. This girl's mother came and laid hold of me; I said I had nothing to do with it, and the people round said, "Young man - you had better walk on;" Payne came and laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>JURY to WILLIAM PAYNE. Q. Was Johnson running? A. Yes - he tried to escape from me; I only live twenty yards from the place; Tyas pointed him out to me - I ran immediately, and stopped him.</p>
               <p>JANE TYAS. My mother's name is Mary. The pane of glass which was broken is the one Johnson was looking through; I and my mother seized Johnson, but, on seeing Payne, we let go, and he popped off. When the pane was broken nobody was at the window but the prisoners and a woman; Luckhurst spoke to the woman, then separated from her, and came round.</p>
               <p>Six witnesses gave Luckhurst a good character.</p>

            . I am the wife of William Arnold - we live in the parish of Willsden. On the 28th of June, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, I went out hay-making - I left my room all fast and secure, and nobody in it; I locked the room door with a padlock and another lock - I returned about eight in the evening, and found the door forced open; the staple was drawn; I missed the articles stated in the indictment, which are worth 4l.; the house is let out in tenements - we rent two rooms up stairs. Between four and five o'clock that morning I saw the prisoner Johnson and Elizabeth Allender laying by the side of the road, when I went down for some wood to light my fire; they were about one hundred yards from the house. Ann Allender lodged in the back room of my house, down stairs - before I went out Elizabeth Allender came in, and went out with Ann, who is her mother, and had lived there about two months. Elizabeth did not live with her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Who keeps the house? A. Mr. Wilson, who lives in town - he has no room there; an old lady has the front room below; Elizabeth Allender and Johnson cohabited as man and wife; I heard the mother say they were going to be married. Ann had a key of the street door, to let herself in and out; the robbery was committed between six o'clock in the morning and eight at night; my husband went out before me; he had no key - I had it in my pocket. The property was all safe in my room when I went out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many rooms are there? A. Four - we occupy the two up stairs; Ann Allender had the back room ground floor, and lived there with a man - another person<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140065"/>has the front room; it was my room door that was broken open, not the street door.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Junction-terrace, Edgware-road. On the 28th of June the prisoner, Johnson, pawned a silver watch, the maker's name Collet, for 1l. On the following Monday he brought two men, and sold them the duplicate - they redeemed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have not seen it since? A. No. Johnson came again in the afternoon, to pawn a waistcoat and a pair of shoes, but he behaved so rude I would not take them in. I have seen Collet's name on other watches.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there a seal to it? A. It had a steel chain, a gilt key, and a small silver coin, such as a 3d. or 4d. piece to it - that is not an uncommon thing.</p>

I apprehended Ann Allender on the 29th of June, at Paddington, with a gown and handkerchief, which she said she was going to pawn for a woman; the prosecutrix said it was not her's. I took her to the office; she was discharged, with orders for me to take her again if the other parties were found. I had seen the three prisoners in company together on Wednesday, the 28th of June, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, at the Green Man, public-house, Alsden-green, Willsden, and a little after nine o'clock that morning I was on a coach coming to town, and saw them all three together in the Harrow-road, coming towards town, about two miles and a half from the prosecutrix. I am certain of them - Elizabeth Allender was behind the other two.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You only saw them as you passed? A. No - I knew she lived in the same house as Arnold. Ann gave her name at the office as Allender.</p>

On the 28th of June, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I came down for my milk, and went to Mrs. Lee's room, which is the front room on the ground floor of Arnold's house; Elizabeth Allender came in there with some fea; Johnson came in his shirt sleeves, and without his shoes, outside the house, and looked round the corner of a brick wall into Lee's room; he then went into Ann Allender's room; I saw no more, but I heard her singing in her mother's room, and dancing a child about; next morning, the 29th, I saw that Arnold's door had been forced open, and went with her and the constable to take Ann; she was afterwards liberated, and, on our way from the office, we found the bundle of clothes at Traill's, and, on going home, I met Ann Allender at the Red Lion public-house, Harrow-road; she said, "You and Mrs. Arnold had me locked up to day, and I had not so much as half a pint of water, but now I have got half a pint of beer;" I said, "You deserved to be locked up, for you knew of the robbery; I have found the things at Traill's;" she laughed, and said,"Ah, and you think to find the watch, don't you?" I said I hoped so; she laughed, and said "Oh, but you won't."</p>

            . My husband works for Mr. Staple, of Paddington. I live next door to the Paddington watch-house; the watch-house keeper's wife was very poorly on the 29th of June, and I went to help her wash; I went to take in her clothes, which hung directly over the lock-up place! I had seen Johnson and Elizabeth Allender put in there that afternoon, and when I was taking in the clothes, I heard them talking, but could not see them nor they me; I was on the leads - I heard the man say to the woman, "We are done at last - I am a dead man; for the pawnbroker will do me;" the woman answered,"Yes, and if they find out where the gown and shawl is, I am a dead woman;" she said, "Never mind, we shall both go together, and, I hope, we shall meet together again;" she said "If we could let mother know, it would be all right enough," but she could not; he then said, "I put a shirt down the necessary;" she said he was to blame, but said "Never mind, it won't do us any harm."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the watch-house-keeper's wife here? A. No; she is not well - she has been here two or three days, but was not examined at the office, and thought she would not be wanted - the leads are directly over the lock-up place - they were separate from each other, and were looking through a trap door talking; they were talking when I went out there - when I heard them talking I listened - my husband has been a watchman - he has 14s. a week, and I have a mangle - I never heard of the parish giving a reward on conviction of house-breakers - I should not have come here if I was not obliged; they were in different cells opposite each other.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were they locked in separate cells? A. Yes - with a passage between - about six feet a part - their voices would be heard on the leads, as the passage between the cells is open at the top, and they speak through trap doors - about nine inches by eight.</p>

               <p>MATTHEW FINCH. I live on my property, in Chapman-street, Cannon-street-road, St. George's East. On Monday, the 26th of June, after eleven o'clock at night, on my way home with my wife, on coming through Brick-lane, at the corner of Hare-street and <placeName id="t18260914-83-crimeloc508">Brick-lane</placeName>

I bled most dreadfully on the head - I have the marks now, and shall as long as I live - there was several hands at one time in my pocket; they took out half a sovereign, and 8s. 6d. - I know I had eight or nine shillings in my pocket; I was knocked down with sticks - I received several blows - I think the second blow I had on the back of my head, knocked me down; the blow I have on my forehead, which was cut open, is the last blow that was given, and they left me; directly after the rattles began to spring - several blows were struck after I was knocked down - I lost a stick, and a new hat, that might have fallen off as I fell; the one, who I believe to be the prisoner, was the one down on his knee, and as I laid on my back, I struck him several blows in the face, with the head of my stick - it had a silver head, larger than half a crown - I struck him with all the force I could, and when they wrenched the stick out of my hand, I hit him several times - he was kneeling on one knee in the kennel - there were six or seven round me; I had not so much sight of the prisoner as I had of one who I can positively swear to, and who is here for trial, and it was him who almost caused Mrs. Finch's death - I do not recollect the man, I suppose to be the prisoner having a stick; I went to Spitalfields watch-house, and gave information, and I sent for a doctor, who dressed my wounds; I went to Worship-street on the Wednesday following, and saw the prisoner; he had several cuts in his face, on the side where I thought I struck him with my stick - he wore white stockings when he knelt down; a pair of white stockings were produced before the Magistrate - I have no doubt of his being the person who was on his knee; he knelt towards the curb, and in the kennel, or near it - there was dirt in the kennel, for I was all over dirt, both my trousers and coat; it was a fine light night, and there is a gas-light directly opposite.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. You reason about his being the man from circumstances, not from a recollection of his person? A. I have some recollection of his face, but not so as positively to swear to it; I had a sight of him while he was on his knee - if he had no marks on his face, I should say as I do now; I have some slight recollection, but do not positively swear to him; the marks on his face, certainly made a strong impression on my mind - I was most dreadfully ill-used - I received several blows after I was down - and struck the person who I take to be the prisoner, myself - he did not strike me; it might be a quarter of an hour, twenty minutes, or half-past eleven o'clock - it struck eleven when I passed Shoreditch-church; the brewhouse may be half a mile from there; it was a clear night - there was a gas-light opposite, and one on each side, right and left, fifteen paces off; they all had their hats on.</p>

            . I am a weaver, and live at No. 45, Brick-lane. On the 26th of June I was at the Three Sugar Loaves public-house, St. John-street, Brick-lane; my two brothers, Stevens, and Fox were also with me; I saw Willett there - I went there about half-past nine o'clock the - prisoner and Fox were then there, and about an hour after Stevens and Fox quarrelled - they continued there till about five minutes beyond half-past eleven o'clock - the landlord then turned us out; Fox had struck the prisoner just before eleven o'clock, as they sat there; the prisoner wanted to fight Fox - the landlord said he would have no fighting there; Fox went out first, and when Stevens, my brothers, and I went out, Fox began wrangling with the prisoner again, and struck him, and they fought for about a quarter of an hour; Fox got the best of it, and both fell down; in one round particularly, Fox threw himself down, and threw Stevens over his head, which occasioned his face to be grazed as it caught the stones; I and my brother persuaded Stevens to leave off, and they put on their coats: we stood talking round the Sugar Loaves for about five minutes; I then told my brothers, as they were not going my way, I should go home; I left Stevens there, and as I passed Truman's brewery, on my way home, I saw a number of watchmen, and some persons round the Black Eagle tap, and saw a great cake of blood on the pavement, nearly as large as the crown of my hat - the prisoner was very ill at this time, and had been bad some time - he is a looking-glass frame-maker.</p>

               <p>MATTHEW FINCH. I live in Chapman-street, Cannon-street-road. On the 26th of June I and my wife were going home, up <placeName id="t18260914-84-crimeloc513">Brick-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. Were you in a situation to be certain that you are accurate in recollecting the prisoner? A. I certainly am - before I was knocked down, and when I arose I noticed him particularly - he is the man who gave me the last blow; I gave information immediately I got to the watch-house - I saw Barrs, Almond, and the beadle; I described the persons to them, and, among others, described the prisoner; I said one was a tall one, who I could swear to - I did not see him afterwards, till last Thursday, when he was at Worship-street - he was not in custody when I preferred my bill against Stevens.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BARRY. Q. What do you suppose to be the distance between where you first saw the croud of men, and where you were robbed? A. I do not think I was ever up Brick-lane before, but I have heard it stated as three hundred yards; I looked repeatedly about me - I turned round and faced them several times - I noticed other persons besides the prisoner - I think I should be able to swear positively to one more, who was with the prisoner, and had a large stick in his hand, the same as him; I do not think I could swear positively to more than one besides the prisoner - there were six or seven of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the person stand who struck you with the stick? A. On the left hand - they kept two together, two behind me, two in the middle, and two on the opposite side - I heard a low whistle, and then they came up; I had not so good an opportunity of observing the face of the man on his knee as I had of the prisoner - I was on my back, and rose up - that man's face was partly over me, but down at my pockets - the other man, who I should know, is the one who laid down on my right side, and who walked with the prisoner behind me - the one, I suppose to be Stevens, was more in the center - the man on my left was standing - that was the prisoner; and he beat Mrs. Finch; Stevens was down on his knee; they were all young men, and most had sticks; I had sense enough to know them; I was not stunned at all.</p>

            . I was with my husband on this night - he was knocked down by some men who followed us; there were six or seven, as near as I can tell; I was knocked down at the same time, and very much cut in the head and about the arms. I have a wound in my head now, which is not quite well. I have every reason to think it took away my senses for a moment, for I cannot say who knocked me down; they followed us from Hare-street to the brewery, and I frequently saw their faces while they were following us; they went backwards and forwards about us several times; the prisoner was one - I think he came round us, and stood nearly opposite us, at the time we were standing at the corner of Hare-street, for my husband was rather alarmed then; I have more recollection of him than of any one, for I saw him striking me; he was beating me when I got up - he struck me several blows on my arm when I got up; I did not see who struck my husband. When I got up the prisoner stood at stick's length from me, and gave me two or three blows - my husband at that time was on the ground, and men holding him. I am positive the prisoner is the man who beat me - I have no doubt whatever of him; I am sure he was one of the party. I looked round at them while they were following us, and have no hesitation in saying so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you almost positive he is the man who struck you? A. I am quite positive; I had a better opportunity of seeing him than any other; I had hold of my husband's arm till he was knocked down. I let go of his arm when they came up, for several took him by the shoulders - he was knocked down before me; I cannot say who knocked him down.</p>

            . I am an officer, and was with Gooding on the 13th, when he apprehended the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - a previous arraignment, I trust, will not operate against me on this occasion, so far as to induce even a suspicion that I am in the most remote degree guilty in this case, than in the former; however, I feel that anxiety which every unfortunate individual, awfully situated as I am, ought to feel - that is, to exculpate myself, and procure a vindication of my character from a public tribunal of my country, to set at rest the public charge brought against me, placing me in the utmost jeopardy of my life, and at the same time involving my unhappy family in one continued state of disgrace. At the time specified in the indictment I was at the Ship, public-house, in Brick-lane, Spital-fields, and had been there, without removing, the whole of the evening, till the time of my departure to go home, which I did, and immediately went to bed at my mother's house, where I lodge, and whose residence is only the second door from the Ship; and from that period till last Wednesday, although I have been as regularly engaged at following my occupation as a silk weaver, and as easy of access at home, I never heard that even my name was in question, being perfectly conscious that I had not committed any offence against the laws of my country; it will, therefore, be readily conceived how I felt when a second charge of so serious a description was advanced against me, when before the Magistrate, with no other foundation than supposition, originating from the idea of the officer, that I had been one of the party - whereas, I was totally unacquainted that ever an offence of such a description had been committed, until it was thus laid to my charge; therefore, I rely, with full confidence, on that dispassionate view of my case, which it requires in my present situation, and justice demands; thus I submit myself to whatever decision the sacred tribunal before whom I now stand may come to.</p>

               <p>Q. When you parried the blow, did you strike his hand or arm? - A. No; I did not: the blow be struck me hit me in the left arm; I felt the arm bone stunned four or five minutes after he was gone; I went into the shop and found the blood began to run profusely, and went to a surgeon, as I found he had stabbed me in my left wrist through my shirt and coat - I had stopped his blow with my left arm - he made a blow at me, and came in contact with my left arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at your deposition, and see if you say there that the blow reached you? - A. I was not asked - there certainly must be an error here - I told the Magistrate I had been stabbed - he aimed the blow at my breast - he made a straight forward rush, and I put up my arm - I was about three weeks getting well - it bled more after the first dressing - I did not discover it for four or five minutes after he was gone - it had then bled scarcely any - I discovered it first by the blood.</p>

I believe it was, but I did not pay particular attention to it - I did not tell him he might go and be d-d, or that I would kick him out of the shop - immediately on receiving this thrust, I took him with my right hand and threw him out of the shop, and believe I struck him in the shop - he did not run into a butcher's shop for protection - I never said I would him kill or any thing of the sort; he went away within five minutes of my recovering the blow - I believed I told some of the neighbours I was stabbed - I do not know where I held him, when I put him out of the shop - I have not seen Mrs. Leach since I was at Bow-street - I do not know where she is.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Careless. The prisoner came into the shop and asked for Brooks - I pointed to him outside the shop - he called him in, and asked if he recollected seducing a person named Murray - Brooks asked if he was the person who had married her - he said Yes; and asked if he had 100l. to pay down for the child; Brooks said he had paid 50l. and had nothing further to do with it - they had some conversation, and, I believe, the prisoner abused him - he afterwards made a rush at him to hit him, as I thought - he aimed at his breast - Brooks warded it off with his left arm, and they came in contact with each other - they closed together - Brooks put him out of the shop - after he was gone I saw Brooks' arm bleeding - I had seen nothing in the prisoner's hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were you? - A. Behind the counter; I had a perfect view of the prisoner; I did not hear all that was said.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Blackmore-street. On the 27th of June, about eight o'clock, I dressed Brooks' wound (my young man had dressed it before); the wound was near the left wrist, and not three quarters of an each long; it was a clean incision and must have been done with a sharp instrument; a small artery<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140070"/>was divided, which bled, and that caused me to dress it a second time; I told him to keep it quiet a few days or inflammation might come on; it was not a dangerous wound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If an artery be divided would an effusion take place? - A. Immediately; in a clean incised wound it would bleed instantly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. From what you saw of the wound do you think the effusion could be delayed a few minutes? - A. No; it would take place immediately; it would spout out directly, and must be perceived directly, and cannot account for his not discovering it for four or five minutes.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner on the 28th of June - I told him I had a warrant; he said he hoped it was his death warrant; there was an altercation between him, his wife, and her sister, in the street; when I took him, I said I took him for assaulting and maiming Brooks; he said, "Oh, ah! Brooks, I know, and I hope I have done enough for them to take my life, or I will take it away myself;" I asked what he had done with the instrument he had done it with - he said,"If I have done it, it must have been with a pallet-knife, but I did not know I had done it;" he said the pallet-knife was in his basket, which he had left in St. John-street, Smithfield, but he could not tell the number, or the peoples' names, but it was on the left-hand going from Smithfield, and he left it there last night; I went to the top of St. John-street, and found a basket with a pallet knife, and two others; he is a writer, and would use them in his business.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not you think he was joking when you took him? A. No. I do not know where his wife lives.</p>

            . I know the prisoner - he came into my shop four or five months ago, and asked me where Brooks was; I said I did not know - he said I did - we had a few words - he got into a passion, and placing his hand on his breast, said, "I have been and purchased an instrument, and intend to put an end to the existence of Brooks, and also my wife and child - I will leave you alone for the present;" he did not shew me any instrument.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known him any time? A. Yes; by his living at a cheesemonger's where I dealt; I had some business to transact about a child; he did not say people had been saying this, but said he should do it; I was not alarmed about it at all.</p>

I work for different shopkeepers.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 1st of September, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was in Bishopsgate-street, and saw Romaine holding the prisoner by the collar - he said he suspected he had bad money about him; Payne came up, and we took him into the Black Raven, public-house, and in his right-hand breeches pocket I found a paper, containing forty counterfeit sixpences, and in his other pocket 5s. 6d. loose - I found a good sixpence, and about 6d. in copper on him; Payne picked up 3s. 6d., which I saw drop from his hand behind him.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How far was Romaine from him when the 3s. 6d. fell? A. About a yard in front of him - I saw it drop from the prisoner's hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you know Romaine? A. Yes, by seeing him about the office; I do not think I had seen him for two months before; I do not know how he gets his living - I never knew him as a common informer.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH PAYRE. I am a patrol of Bow-street. I saw Romaine collaring the prisoner; we took him to the Black Raven; I saw the 3s. 6d. drop from him, and took it up; nobody but him could have dropped it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How came you there at that moment? A. It was quite accidental. I had had no communication with Newsam.</p>
               <p>MR. FIELD. These forty sixpences are all counterfeit; the 3s. 6d. is three counterfeit shillings and a bad sixpence - the five shillings are counterfeit; the sixpences are all from one die.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, entered into a long Defence, stating that Romaine kept several bad houses, and that he had been entrapped through his villainy; that he was continually laying bad money in the way of the unwary, for them to pick up, and that he had been convicted of getting 30l. from persons to get a bill thrown out by the Grand Jury.</p>

               <p>THOMAS HOBLEY. I live in Great Guildford-street, Southwark. On the 13th of September, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was returning from Brentford-fair - I was quite sober; I had been <rs id="t18260914-89-viclabel536" type="occupation">selling pastry at the fair</rs>

I was going on to Turnham-green, for assistance, and when I got a little way I heard a cry of Murder! I saw the prisoners and another coming towards Turnham-green - I got assistance, and they were secured; I have no doubt whatever of them. I have not found the tray.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. How long had you been at the fair? A. From about noon; I was quite sober; it was not a general fight; I did not strike till I was knocked down - I believe my friends were looking on - one of them was in contact with Gould - we were not all fighting together; I saw Gould with his nose broken - I wished to put up with the insult and go home.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it not a general fight? A. No: I fought in my own defence; the prisoners appeared in liquor. I believe I took off my coat, and had about three rounds; I believe there were six in the party - they came back and beat me a second time; I flew to a waggon for protection, and in about three-quarters of an hour, saw them in the watch-house.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not you go from the path into the road to fight? A. No - we were in the road; the prisoners' coats were not off; I saw nobody come up to separate them - one of the prisoners had a black eye and broken nose; I met Wilson returning with two tilted waggons, and I returned with him; I did not see the first of it - I saw no woman there.</p>

            . I am a pastry-cook. I had been to the fair; we were all coming home together; Hobley was a stranger to me; the prisoner, Leake, knocked the tray off his head; he caught it as it fell, and put it on his head again; he knocked it off again with violence; Hobley picked it up, and Leake put himself in a fighting attitude; Wilson came to assist Hobley; two or more fell on him - I went to assist Wilson, and Gould struck me several times; three or four of them were on me all at once; Gould knocked me down three or four times; after getting away, I went to lift Wilson up; Stephen Leake then struck me, and said, "This is the b-gg-r in the black coat;" the confusion was very great; I saw Stephen Leake take away the tray, but what became of it afterwards I do not know - I did not see the end of it; I went towards London; the same party attacked me again, and knocked me down; Freeland came up, and asked if they were going to murder me; I got up, and escaped over a hedge there were more than three engaged in it; one boy had two large stones, and threatened to knock my brains out; I swear the three prisoners were active in attacking Hobley.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons were engaged in the scuffle? A. There appeared seven or eight at first, but afterwards a good many more; there were seven of us; I heard nobody try to part them - none of the prisoners called Murder! we only defended ourselves; I laid behind a hedge till they had gone away, I was so alarmed.</p>

               <p>HOBLEY re-examined, The prisoners were going towards Brentford - they met me - they were apprehended going towards Turnham-green; I had seen none of them at the fair. <rs id="t18260914-89-verdict538" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>COURT. Q. How long had he been in your service? A. About twenty years - he settled his accounts with me every week once or twice; if a person paid money, he entered it in a book, which I have here - here is the week including the 15th of October - there is no entry on that day; the whole of this is his writing.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did he ever make payments on your account? A. No; I supposed this money to have been due about Christmas last, but I never applied for it, as it was the first transaction I had had with them.</p>

Mr. Stone received part of the money with other monies; Mr. Stone has received money from me and not given me an account of it; I went after some other money, which the former clerk had not collected, and was proud to bring it to my master; I have been making him a reparation for some money I lost three years and a half ago.</p>

I called the watchman, who was the only other person in the street, and he picked up the handkerchief close to where I had seen the action of the hand.</p>

I saw the articles safe in my box on the 2d of June, and on the 15th of August I went to it again, and missed them - Mrs. Hatton was then gone. I took the officer to search the premises of the prisoner, who had lived with Mrs. Rogers, but had then left; she said she was innocent, and would take her oath that she had left the box locked - the lace and two handkerchiefs were found on her.</p>

Yes, this apron and this handkerchief - there was some tea and sugar left in a caddy, belonging to me, and I said the servants might have it between them; the prisoner came to me as a single woman, but I afterwards found she was married, and has four children; I went into the scullery, and saw her putting the lid on the boiler - I said, "What are you doing?" she said, "Nothing;" I lifted up the lid, and said, "Whose box is this?" she said, "Mine;" I said I would have it opened.</p>

I did not see Scannell at that time, but I know that Ring struck me on the right eye - they then went on and went down Charles-street; I washed my eye at the pump, and went to a wine vaults, at Charing-cross, to inquire for an officer - I got Mr. Goddard, and we went after them to the Park - Scannell was taken there, but nothing was found on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. What are you? A. A wine-cooper. I was quite close to Britton, and am quite certain he did not say he would fight any one of them; there was a fight with Britton, and I went up to assist him; I did not see Scannell at that time; I found him near the Horse Guards in the Park; I did not say he had taken a sovereign from me; I did not see him till I saw him in the Park.</p>

            . I was with Hill and another person, named Forrest; we had just passed the pump, where some young men were standing; I saw the prisoner among them; a young lad said to me, "Sir, there is some water on your coat;" I pulled it off, and the back was covered with water; he pointed Scannell out, as the one who did it; I said "Sir, what did you do that for?" he struck me in the mouth; Hill came up to take my part, but before he could look about him he was pulled down- I did not see Scannell at that instant, for some were on me, and some on Hill; I afterwards saw Hill lying on the ground; the two prisoners were upon him - I cannot say that I saw Ring, at that moment upon him, but he was in their company; as soon as they had knocked him down and took the money, Hill got up - he could not see out of one of his eyes, and his nose was bleeding - I had a white hat on, and they said "Fall on the man with the white hat on;" I retreated and they did not follow - we followed them at a little distance, and one of them used very bad language, and said "What are you going to do now?" I made no answer, but watched them; we followed them to some steps leading to St. James's Park - Goddard, the patrol, turned round the corner, and Forrest ran and told him - he followed them into the Park - they scattered and ran, and Scannell said "It is of no use- it is all over?" Goddard heard him say that, and took him. Ring was taken at his own house on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Were there four of you when Scannell was taken? A. Yes; three of us and the officer. I am a saddle-tree-maker; I did not offer to fight any of them; Hill was near me, and he could very well see the boy who struck me; I took my own part, but they all came up to me, and fell upon me, before Hill got up; I did not strike them first, nor offer to fight Scannell; he had a yellow handkerchief on - there was nothing said about a sovereign - Hill did not say he had lost one; I did not see any money, but I heard it on the stones; it lasted about ten minutes; I never lost sight of Scannell - I followed him into the Park - they were walking in the Park, but they all ran and scattered - Scannell had been running but he gave himself up. I swear Scannell ran, and the officer saw him - this was near the canal.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You saw very little of Ring? A. No; I am sure he was of the party.</p>

            . I am a saddle-tree rivetter. I live at No. 15, Monmouth-street. I was with Britton and Hill - I heard a little boy come and tell Britton that some water was thrown on his coat - he pulled it off, and there was water all over it - he went up and asked which of them did it; one of them struck him on the mouth, but I cannot say which, because I was behind him; about thirteen of them fell upon him - Hill went up - five or six of them came away from Britton, and knocked him down - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140078"/>saw Scannell put his hand into Hill's pocket, and turn it out - the money fell on the ground, and Scannell, Ring, and another person, picked it up; I was going to help them, but one of them said "Pitch upon the other with his watch," meaning me; I drew back, and went to see for an officer; when I came back they had all got up - Hill was all over blood; he said he had lost 7s.; we followed them as far as Charles-street; they kept walking in the road, and turning round, and swearing at us, and asked what we were going to do now; when we got to Charles-street we saw Goddard, and we pursued them into the Park, and took Scannell there - they were all standing in a cluster, but when they saw the officer they all scattered.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Could you see the person who came up to Britton? A. No; not to identify him; I kept aloof - it lasted two or three minutes - there was a great confusion; we gave no alarm in the street, but we did in the Park.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You saw nothing more of Ring than his picking up the money? A. No; there were some small boys left standing round the pump.</p>

            . I am fourteen years of age. I was near the pump in Parliament-street - I saw the three witnesses walking, and thirteen or fourteen standing round the pump; Scannell had a mouthful of water, and he squirted it over Britton and Hill - Britton pulled off his coat to look at the water, and turned back to Scannell, to ask what he did it for - they made no reply, but formed a ring round him; Britton was then struck, and Hill went to assist him - he was knocked down, and they cried out"His pocket - his pocket;" Scannell put his hand into his pocket, pulled it inside out, and the money fell on the stones; there were some silver shillings; Scannell and two more stooped down to pick it up; I took notice of the prisoners but cannot swear to the other; Ring picked up some of the money - they all fought - I did not hear any challenging; Forrest was coming to assist Britton and Hill, and they cried out "His watch - his watch!" he then drew back; the others then got up, and Hill went to the pump to wash himself, as he was all over blood; I did not hear him say any thing about his money - the others then went away, and we followed them, and three or four of them asked what we were going to do; they turned down a street leading to St. James's Park, and Goddard came up - Forrest went and told him - he pursued them into the Park, and Scannell cried out "It is no use - it is no use;" and the officer took him; I went with Goddard on the Monday, and took Ring in Crown-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Have you been talking this matter over? A. No; I am sure I have not talked to the other persons about it; I was close by but I did not interfere; it lasted ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; I had never seen Scannell before; he was taken in about ten minutes after, near the cannon in the Park; he was not standing looking at the canal; I swear he ran; the officer could see him run. I swear the prisoners were there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you pick up any of the money? A. No, not 1s., nor the little boy's neither; it was only those belonging to the gang took it- there was nothing said about a sovereign in my hearing.</p>
               <p>HENRY GODDARD. I am an officer. I saw Forrest, and, in consequence of what he said, I went into the Park, where I saw Scannell, with a gang of twelve or thirteen persons; they turned round and saw me, and ran in different directions - I took Scannell then, and Ring the next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was not Scannell standing near the canal? A. No, he was going on, near the bomb, walking with the others; I did not hear any thing said about a sovereign; I saw them first in Charles-street; I swear they all ran - I overtook Scannell, and took him to the watch-house - nothing was found on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Who directed your attention to Scannell? A. Forrest and Britton - there were others mentioned, but I made Scannell the object of my pursuit - they were not within view at the time Forrest spoke to me; I asked who were the principal persons, and they pointed the prisoners out; they would not have known which way to have gone only I happened to see the gang running into the Park.</p>
               <p>SCANNELL'S Defence. I and Ring, and two or three more, stopped to get a drink of water - the prosecutor and two or three others passed, and one of the boys there threw some water, which happened to go on one of their coats - a little boy went and told him, and he turned back and asked who did it; the little boy pointed us out, and he struck one of the lads, and they all got fighting - we then went into the Park, and the prosecutor and his companious came up, and said we had a sovereign belonging to them; the officer then came and took me.</p>
               <p>RING'S Defence. I was coming from Millbank, and we stopped, and one of the boys took a mouthful of water, and squirted it over one of their coats; he turned back, and asked what they did it for, and one of them struck him; he then struck me, and my nose began to bleed - he struck me again, and I hit him in my own defence; the rest came up to assist him - the others struck them, and we all fell to the ground; we got up and walked into the Park; I was going towards home.</p>

               <p>COURT to Mr. NEILE. Q. Was there any new settlement in November last? - A. Yes; I then hired another traveller, because the prisoner was so very deficient in getting customers; and I said to him, "If you will drop any other commission you shall have 30s. a week;" he said, "I am much obliged to you;" before then he had had 25s. a-week, and 5 per cent. commission.</p>

No, there was a person waiting for me, and I went out with him in a carriage, and I did not return till the following evening; a lady and a little boy live in the house - the lady sent the prisoner out, that she might look into her box - she came to me with a lap full of things, and said,"These must belong to you, Madam" - the prisoner went away directly, with her own box and these articles in it: she had dressed me the evening before, when I went to the Opera - these articles were left laying about the room; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140080"/>believe they could not have been put into the prisoner's box by mistake, because her box was in the kitchen.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the handkerchief taken from the gentleman? A. No - I could not see what was taken from the gentleman; he owned the handkerchief, but refused to give his address.</p>
               <p>DANIEL REARDON. I was with Stevens. I saw the four lads - the prisoner and one more were in front; I saw them close on the pocket, and the prisoner took the handkerchief; they crossed the road towards me - I seized the prisoner with my left-hand, and the other with my right; the other struck me, and I let him go; I secured the prisoner, who had the handkerchief on his thigh; it appeared the same colour as the one taken from the gentleman - the gentleman came back, and the prisoner begged him not to prosecute him.</p>

               <p>CONNELL'S Defence. I was coming up Long-acre, and saw a great many officers; I saw a young man in a long brown coat drop this handkerchief, which I took up; Boston then asked what I had got - I said it was nothing to him; he said if I did not give it him he would get an officer. Soon afterwards the other prisoner was brought to me, but I had never seen him before.</p>
               <p>BALL'S Defence. I was coming up Long-acre, from Queen-street chapel - I passed a great many officers, who caught this young man for something, and then they caught me, and said I belonged to him.</p>

            . I am an officer. About a quarter before one o'clock, on Friday morning, the 21st of July, I was passing Cable-street, and saw Green at the corner of North East-passage, and Read came down, putting on her gown - she crossed over to Green, and I heard her say"I have got it;" she was not dressed, but Green was - they went down North East-passage, and I went up Cable-street; when I saw the prosecutor standing at a door in his shirt - he said he had been robbed of his pocket-book and eleven sovereigns by two women, and should know them again - I went down the passage and took Read - I brought her back, and went up and searched the house - I found the watch and seals close to the window on a nail in the shutters; I put them into my pocket, and took Read to the watch-house; she said she should send for her child; I knew where her child was kept, and I went there to see for Green; I heard a man, whom she lives with, say"Is that you, Bet;" I took hold of Green, her apron was wrapped round her arm; I told her I wanted her for stealing eleven sovereigns; I found one sovereign in her hand, one penny in her pocket, and nine sovereigns, and this shilling, in the corner of her apron; the prosecutor was quite sober.</p>

               <p>READ'S Defence. He said "Can you get me any thing to drink;" I said it was too late; but I went to the door to see, and the officer said he would dash my brains out if I did not deliver him twelve sovereigns and a pocket-book; I had been at the public-house, and the man drew me into his company, and persuaded me to go home.</p>
               <p>COURT to CARTER. Q. What part of her dress had Read off? - A. Her shoes and her gown; I found her shoes in the room where the prosecutor's watch was; Green told me to be as easy as I could; and if I could not do without her, to say I found it in the entry.</p>
               <p>COURT to RALPH TAITE. Q. Do you believe Green to be the girl called Bessy, who was in the room? - A. Yes; the other girl was talking to her; there was no other person in the room; Green left the room first, and Read in a moment after; I found the jacket on the floor; there was 20s. in silver in my jacket pocket, which they had not time to take.</p>

I saw the prosecutor struggling with the two prisoners - he had hold of them, and asked them for his watch; he held them till the watchman came up - I got a light and found the watch opposite to where he was, by the side of a board fence, where the buildings had been taken down; I had heard the chain rattle when he called for the watchman; the prisoners were near enough to the boards to place the watch there.</p>

            . I am a constable. I received the two prisoners at the watch-house, and received this watch from Scriven.</p>
               <p>JOHNSON'S Defence. We met this gentleman, who was very much intoxicated; we went into the house, and had something to drink - when we came out he said "Good God, I have lost my watch;" he then seized us both - I said "Don't pull us so, you had better call the watchman," which he did.</p>
               <p>COURT to JOSEPH DURWAND. Q. When the prisoner came to the watch-house did he appear to be drunk? A. No - he swore so hard and fast to them that we were forced to lock them up, though it was not till after they were locked up that the man came in, and said he had found the watch - we had searched them before, and found nothing on them.</p>

               <p>Mr. PHILLIPS to FAY. Q. Why did not you tell us you was led in by him? A. I did not know it; I was sober when I got out of the watch-house; and I drank nothing till I got to the public-house; I swear I did not give it to him, but cannot say whether I was at a grocer's shop - the prisoner was there.</p>

I was in my shop on the 21st of July last - I went into a private passage for about half a minute; when I came back the prisoner was there; he asked the price of Burn's Works, but did not purchase them. Another gentleman came in - the prisoner went away, and soon after I missed a prayer-book, and another book - I went down Broad-street, and saw the prisoner walking with another person; I said, "You have stolen some books" - I did not find the property with him. When I got back to the shop I found the prayer-book on the chair; I did not see him take it from his pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He did not attempt to run away? A. No. I understand his connections are respectable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I waited in the shop I had ample time to run away; when I came back the books he said were stolen were found, one on the desk, and the other in the chair.</p>

               <p>EDWARD LONDON RODICK. On the 16th of August I took a coach, with another gentleman, from St. Paul's Church-yard, and ordered to be driven to No. 7, <placeName id="t18260914-141-crimeloc825">Jermyn-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he object to your sending for change? A. No; I do not know whether the coach was opened while the servant was gone - I am sure I did not drop the sovereign in the coach.</p>

            . I took the prisoner into custody. The prosecutor said he had lost a sovereign; I then searched his pocket but did not find one; but found a sovereign among the straw, in the coach.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. No gold was found on him? A. No; he was too anxious to be searched; I mean he did not express any disinclination; five or six shillings were found on him - it might be only three.</p>

            . I live with my mother, in Greenwell-street, Somer's-town. I know Mr. Morris' shop. On the night Mrs. Smith was taken I was in Skinner-street, at a grocer's, opposite Mr. Morris'. I saw a woman, like a dustman's wife, stand at Mr. Morris', and take the bacon - it was not this lady who took it; there was a person passed me at the moment, and I did not see what the woman did with it; in two or three minutes I saw Mrs. Smith in the hands of the watchman; I took hold of his coat, and said, "Sir, that is not the person who took the bacon," but he went on to the watch-house- I could not get in, or I should have said the same there. When the woman took the bacon Mrs. Smith was at the green-grocer's, next door but one, taking some sallad up to price it; the person who took it went up West-street, in a line with Mr. Morris' - there was no one serving Mrs. Smith.</p>

            . I am a sweep. The prisoner lodged in the room under me - he and Thomas Hope came and knocked for me to go and get some dust, on the morning of the 4th of August; we all three went to several houses for dust, and when we got to Mr. Blake's hotel, Hope rang the bell; the prisoner and he went in; I stopped outside; when they came out they brought their brush, sack, and shovel with them; we went to No. 47, Duck-lane - Biars was then in bed; I saw the sack in the room; I had not been out with the prisoner before, but afterwards William Hope called and gave me 1s. 6d. for my trouble.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was there any thing in the sack when they came out? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I left my place, and came to lodge in that house; William Hope asked me to go to work with him; he took the witness with him; Hope took me up stairs to clean the flue - he went into another room - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140089"/>got some ashes, came out of the hotel, and stopped talking with the porter.</p>

I have seen the prisoner pass my door - one day, in July, he asked me if I wanted to buy a duplicate of a watch - I went to look at it at the shop - I paid the interest, and had a fresh ticket written - I brought it back to the prisoner, and said I did not like the watch, and would not have it; next day I went to a public-house and saw him again; he asked me again to buy the duplicate, and said I should have it for 4s.; I had not so much, but I gave him 3s. 5d.; I asked if it was his own - he said Yes, but it had been his brother's, but being out of place he wanted to get a few shillings - I went to Smithfield the next day to buy two pigs, and wanting money, I pawned the watch in Theobald's-road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you known the prisoner long? A. No; I had not seen him more than nine or ten times; this was the first time I ever spoke to him.</p>

            . I am a watch-house keeper. I was in Bunhill-row, about two o'clock in the afternoon of the 13th of July, and saw the prisoner with this cask on his shoulder - I followed him opposite to the watch-house - I then asked what he had got - he said "A cash of butter;" I said "Have you a bill of parcels with you;" he said No; but he was going to the top of Bunhill-row; I said"You must go over to the watch-house;" he crossed over, and threw it down and ran away - he was pursued and taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say he was carrying it for a person, who was going on before him? A. He said he had to carry it to the top of Bunhill-row for two men, who had given him 3s.; he did not tell me they were gone on before; a gentleman afterwards came and said he saw a man carrying a cask of butter in an awkward way.</p>

A man, who appeared rather distressed in his mind, accosted me, and said, "You seem poor like myself - if you will go and pawn this coat for me, I will give you something;" I went and pawned it; he gave me the duplicate, and I was to see him the next day, which I did; he gave me these spoons to sell, and said I should have seven of them for myself if I sold twelve of them; I went and got some beans for two of them.</p>

On the 20th of July I lost a cask of white lead; I had seen it safe in the passage on the 19th - this is it; I have no doubt it is my property - I missed it about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, when I came home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you any mark upon it? A. Yes - B. W. L.; it is the usual mark put upon casks of this description, from the British colour manufactory; they supply many houses with these articles; here is the mark of the weight - I could swear to it, because the casks are not all of a weight - this is not an unusual size cask.</p>

            . I am a watchman. At half-past five o'clock on the morning of the 20th of July, I saw the two prisoners and another man rolling this cask; I followed them from Fleur-de-lis-street to Phoenix-street; I knocked at a person's door to get assistance - they saw me knock, and all ran away; I took the cask to Mr. Beavis, at the watch-house, and left it with him; I knew the prisoners before then, and where Johnson had lived- the cask is more than two men could carry, but they rolled it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. A dyer. - Johnson did live in Spital-fields; the other man, who was with them, was Gront - I spoke to him, but they did not give me an answer; they did not go past any watch-house. I saw Christmas the same evening at the watch-house, about eight o'clock.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. FISH. Q. What hour was this? A. About twelve o'clock; he had half-a-crown in his hand, but I would not take it; I swear I had no money of him. I was going up the steps to fetch the breeches. They both ran away.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He called me into the stable, and showed me some things, for which he asked 10s. more than their value - I said I could not buy them, but if he had any shoes or hats I would buy them; he showed me these shoes, said they were mis-fits, and I should have them for 6s.; I said I would give 4s. - he said I should have them for 5s. - I put them into my bag, and gave him 5s. for them - he then ran after me, and tapped me on the shoulder, and said if I did not give him 6s. he would give charge of me, because I was a Jew.</p>
               <p>COURT to JOHN HODSON. Q. Did you ever mean to sell these shoes? A. No, I never received any money.

I was sober, and am quite certain I did not give it to her - I intended to have gone home with her.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner; he was very drunk, and went to bed at seven o'clock in the morning. In putting on my pockets, I found I had no money in them; I had had 16s. the night before in them, 10s. of it was in a brown paper, and the rest loose; there were some half pence and farthings; I had counted them the night before; my room door was not locked; I can swear to this piece of paper as one that had been in my pocket.</p>

            . I slept in the same room with the prisoner; I heard the clock strike four in the morning, and said to the prisoner, who was in bed, "How do you find yourself," as he had been tipsy the night before; I went to sleep again, till between five and six o'clock, and then he was standing in the room without his shoes; he walked backward and forward, and then laid down on his right side; I heard him count some money, which I thought was half pence; and then thought I heard some silver; I heard some paper tear, and saw his hand go over the head of the bed; I heard something fall on the floor - he said soon afterwards "I wish to God they would get up; where am I;" I said "At Mr. Corcoran's;" he said"What! Corcoran's in Grub-street:" I said Yes; and he said "I am all right;" I said "Your son was here last night, and ordered you not to go till he came between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, and you can't go out till Mr. Corcoran gets up;" I then heard Corcoran go down, and said "Corcoran is gone down, and you may go down now if you like;" he got up; I went down and saw him in the bar taking change for something; he then went out and returned shortly after; some inquiry was then made; I went up into the room with Corcoran and found the torn paper - I gave it to the officer.</p>

On the 4th of August, about twelve o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop with this rug; I asked if it was her's - she said Yes; she wanted 2s. for it; I said "Where do you live?" she said "No. 8, Tothill-street," and gave her 2s. - I then said "I will go as far as Tothill-street with you;" we went about ten yards, and then she said "What are you going for?" I then took her to the office.</p>

I was in Thomas French's shop on the 21st of July, and saw the prisoner there, who had selected some leather out of a drawer on the counter - I saw him put his hand twice into his left-hand coat-pocket, very quickly, and accused him of having leather here - he said he wondered how I dare to accuse him of such a thing - French then laid hold of his collar, and took five or six pieces out of his pocket - he asked forgiveness.</p>

               <p>SURRY'S Defence. I bought the pocket-book of the same person he bought the coat of - he was a hawker, who exposed braces, and such like things, for sale; he found the papers in the pocket, and gave them to me to read them.</p>
               <p>GILLETT'S Defence. I gave 9s. for the coat, to a hawker near Petticoat-lane.</p>

On the afternoon of the 5th of August I was in the parlour, behind our shop, and saw Padden take up the desk, which was outside the shop; I went into the shop, he put his hands on the desk, trembled very much, and asked me the price of it; I said 30s. - he said 20s. - No, said I, 30s. - he said "What is in it;" I said, "What there ought to be, some drawers;" he offered me 20s., and then on to 27s., if I would send it to his house, as he was going abroad; I said I would not take it - he then went on to Manley; I saw them talking together; Padden crossed the way, and Manley was on our side; I was engaged in serving a glass - I told my husband they were the men who came for the desk; I then left the shop, and went up stairs; I saw Paddon on the opposite side of the way - he rubbed his hands together, and took off his hat - I then saw him rub his hands very quick, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I ran down, and took Paddon - the desk had been taken in the mean time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not this a very warm day? A. Not particularly warm - when I went down Padden was standing in the street; I was not the first person who collared him; I did not see him attempt to run, but he wanted to get away, and said there was no charge against him; I said there was, for he had offered me 27s. for this desk.</p>
               <p>Q. When he offered the price did he produce any money? A. No - he was very much agitated.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM USHER LEATHER. I am a cabinet-maker. I saw Padden ask the price of the desk - I was behind my wife - he offered several prices to her - I then saw him at the corner of Bateman's-row, on the opposite side of the way; I saw Manley a hundred or hundred and fifty yards higher up; Paddon went to him - I then saw Padden on the other side of the way, coming towards the shop, and I saw no more till Manley took the desk; Padden, at that time, was on the opposite side of the way - I saw him take off his hat, and put it on again; Manley instantly took up the desk, and put it down again - Padden then rubbed his hands - Manley then came and took the desk, carried it away before him, and walked across to Paddon; I followed, and he turned to throw it, apparently, on my feet - I took him in New Inn-yard without losing sight of him - my apprentice took up the desk - Manley endeavoured to get away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you in the shop when Padden offered the money for the desk? A. Yes; he said, if we would send it to his house, in Weymouth-terrace, he would have it; I passed by him in pursuing Manley - he was standing, lolling against the wall, and no doubt saw me; I took Manley in two or three minutes - when I brought him back Padden had been taken, and was brought afterwards to the office - he did not attempt to impede my pursuit of Manley - I should think we passed within two yards of him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He said he was innocent and wished to be let go? A. Yes; Mr. Leather had passed him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140105"/>before I got down, and Padden could see him - I had seen him bargaining about the desk before Mrs. Leather was in the shop - there was no one there, but a little girl - it is an open window.</p>

I left my plane at an unfinished house on the 20th of August - I missed it on the 22d - the prisoner worked for my master; I asked if he had seen it- he said No; I found it at Gideon's, the pawnbroker's, on that day; I told the prisoner I had found it, and asked him to go with me - he said he would - he ran away and I pursued him - an officer was sent for.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not I offer you a book till I got the plane out, and tell you what induced me to take that liberty with it? A. He offered me a book after he tried to give me the slip.</p>

               <p>These letters were here read: - the first dated 25th of December, 1824, stating that a 1l. note was enclosed, and the second dated 24th of May, 1825, enclosed two 1l. notes.

On Saturday, the 5th of August, I missed a pair of shoes about five o'clock, which I had given to the prisoner on the Friday morning, to make for me - he worked in my house; he came to work about seven o'clock on Saturday morning; I told him they were missing; he said, he had left them under his seat the night before; I said, I was determined to find out who stole them, as I had lost a watch and some other articles - he said, he he knew nothing about the shoes; and I might as well say, he stole the watch - I wished him to stop while I went to get somebody.</p>

The prisoner was in my service, and left it in August; I did not go over the stock - but on Tuesday, the 5th of September, the officer called to know if I could identify any of these things - I am sure they are all mine- I have the remains of the same articles.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS Q. If they had been sold you would have had the remainder? A. Yes; I considered the prisoner a highly respectable young man, and we parted very good friends; if a servant wants any article, it is cut off by another person, and placed to his account. - Here is one piece of ribbon, which I can swear had not been cut - there were eighteen yards of it; he has twelve yards, and I have six - I had been at Margate. He did not say that I had had a very bad business, and he had cut off these goods to make it appear better.</p>

            . I received these tools from Gaskin, who came to our shop alone, on Monday morning, the 24th of July, about eight o'clock, and asked if I bought such things; I said, I bought any thing if it was not stolen; he had not the goods then, but came again with Sanders, and brought them; he asked 3s. for them - I took them to the bed to my husband, and he told me to offer 2s. 6d. for them - and they took 2s. 4 1/2d. for them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. What shop do you keep? A. A marine-store-shop. I never saw either of them before - there were twenty-five tools brought; I did not know what they were worth.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WAKEMAN re-examined. Q. What was the worth of these things? A. They might have been worth to Mr. Cubitt 14s. or 15s., but I might have got only a 1d. or 2d. a piece for them; I have kept that shop about fourteen months - we do not buy such things of boys without asking where they get them; Gaskin told my wife he was a stone-mason, out of work, and forced to part with his tools.</p>

I said, I was an officer, and if he made any attempt to oppose me, I would take him also; he wanted to fight me, and I took him to the office - just as we got there, he put put his head on one side, and said he would give me 2l. to make it right; I found the handkerchief he had bought, in the woman's basket - he said that was his property.</p>

               <p>JOHN ALDRED COOPER. I desired the young man to move the other handkerchiefs, that this piece might not mix with them - she dropped this; I did not see it fall, but I am certain it was not on the floor when I went out, because I passed the same ground in going out and coming in; she could not have brushed it from the counter, for they were removed before she got back.</p>

On the 31st of August I was at work in the shop, with my back to the door, for five or ten minutes - when I turned round I saw Keefe behind the counter, shutting the till; he stooped, came round, and walked out at the door; Poole was at the door, looking through the window; they crossed the road, and met Wolfe, and they all joined together; I went and looked at the till. and the money was all gone except a penny or three halfpence; I ran out, and secured Keefe and Poole- Wolfe attempted to run off, but two Excisemen came up, and I asked them to stop him; I brought them back, and Keefe dropped the silver on the stones; he had the money when I took him. I took off Wolfe's hat, and found this wire in it, and some string.</p>

               <p>JOHN GWYNN. I live in Vernon-place, Old-street. On the 21st of June I had been knocked down, and was much injured - the prisoner came to my house, on the 22d, and said he heard I had had an accident; he said "I have a leech at home, and if you will come I will give it you;" I said "What can I do with my clothes;" he said "Take them with you," and he put them into his handkerchief; he employed his son to put on the leech, while he dried my clothes and brush-them, and, while my head was down, he took my clothes out and pawned them - I did not miss them for two or three days.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What was the cause of my coming to your house on that morning. A. I do not know; on the day before I took a watch away, belonging to Mr. Edwards, which you told me to pawn, I did not know but what it was yours, but it proved to be another person's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On the 20th of June, at eleven o'clock, this man was sitting in company with me, at my door, taking some porter - two young men came by, and one asked me to let him drink - he would leave his watch with me, and I said he should have it when he called for it - the prosecutor called for it the next morning, with a young man, named Berridge, and said "Let me look at that watch," which I said they might - he then ran away with it.</p>
               <p>Witness. No - it was not the next morning - but he gave it me to pawn; I was going to Bow, and in going along I said "This cannot be the watch the young man left," but I took it to pawn - I saw Berridge that day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he complain of your taking the watch? A. No; I did not desire him to pawn my things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. Have not you got the duplicate of these clothes? A. No, I gave it to the officer - they were pawned in the name of Wilmore - I never saw anything of the money - he did not give me the duplicate - I found it in his house - it was given me by his landlord, who said "If you will keep a secret I will give you the ticket."</p>

On the night of the 29th of July I went to a beanfeast at Holloway; I was rather tipsy, and sat down by the side of the road to wait for my companions - the watchman came - and then two men came, who said they could take me to the cottage in the bric-kfield - one of them left me, and the other went with me to a high hill - I awoke at about six o'clock - I missed a sovereign, a coat, and 2 1/2d., which I am sure I had after I left the beanfeast - I also lost my shoes, my hat, and two handkerchiefs; I do not know who the man was, but he had a straw hat and a white jacket on - the hat and handkerchiefs were left in the field.</p>

On the 23d of July, in the evening, the prisoner came in with one or two more persons, who went out again - she came and sat down by my side a little while, and then went out; she had some of my beer when she returned, and sat by me again, and then we went to another house and had some porter; I then went to a room with her; I sat down on a bed; she turned herself, and put her hand into my trousers pocket, and took out my purse, which had one crown, two half-crowns, five shillings, and two sixpences in it; I felt her hand coming out of my pocket, and said "You hussy, you have robbed me of my purse;" she denied it, and went to quit the room; the people below asked what was the matter; they then sent for an officer, who searched her; but I have never got the purse again.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 3d of September, between twelve and one o'clock, I was returning from Kentish-town to Battle-bridge - I saw three or four persons together, and the prosecutor was on the ground; I saw the prisoner lift the prosecutor, and take up something, which I ascertained afterwards to be his waistcoat; I did not see any stripping - that was done before I got there - I saw him shake the waistcoat twice,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140114"/>and I heard something fall; Wescott stooped, as if to pick up something - the prisoner did the same; Wescott said, "You have got something;" the prisoner denied it, and used very bad language; I said, "I thought you was very busy about that man," and I asked what he had in his pockets, and whether he knew the prosecutor; he said he did, and, I think he said, he had been drinking with him; the prosecutor then got up, took hold of his collar, and said, "You have got my money - I don't know you at all;" I asked again what money he had got - he said 29s.; I searched him, and in one of his breeches pockets I found 8s., in the other 2s. 6d.; I asked him how he came to say he had 29s. - he said that was no consequence - I asked if he had no more money - he said No, but from his left-hand coat pocket I took this crown-piece; he said somebody must have put it there, and he accused us of so doing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not find three crowns and two half-crowns? A. No; the prosecutor had been drinking, but was sensible. I have found the prisoner is a coachman in place, and bears a good character.</p>

            . I am a carver, and live in Tash-street, Gray's-inn-lane. On the evening the prisoner was taken, word was sent to me, that it was for things she had pawned through distress, and if I could in any way assist her, she would be obliged; I went and saw Mrs. Stote - I told her that I could not make up the money to release the things that night, but I could the following morning, and I paid 1l. 12s. 6d. to a man named Ward, who lodged there, with this proviso, that I was to pay 16s. more.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did Mrs. Stote agree, if you paid this money. to forego the prosecution? A. Yes - and I paid 1l. 12s. 6d. to the man, but the Magistrate ordered him to pay it back again.</p>
               <p>MARY STOTE re-examined. Q. Did you ever agree to take this money? A. No, never in my life - I never received a single farthing.</p>

            . I am porter at Messrs. Pickford's. I remember a bale of goods coming, directed to Mr. Sclater, Knutsford; I saw it opened the next day, and it contained seventy-six yards of kerseymere in one wrapper - it was brought to our warehouse from the Castle inn, Wood-street, on the 3d of August; I saw it in the warehouse - it was to go to Knutsford, by Pickford and Co.'s canal boat. It was the duty of the shipping clerk to put it on board; the prisoner was boatman to Messrs. Pickford and Co.; this truss was to have gone by a Liverpool boat; I saw the prisoner going across the warehouse with it - he had no business with it, because he was not loading that boat then - this was about nine o'clock at night; I was at work in the warehouse, and he set the truss against the door, near the scale where they weigh the goods; I went out, and when I returned I saw the prisoner - the truss was gone; I went up to the door to see where he was gone with it, and he was carrying it in his arms, up to the far end of the boat - it fell into the water - he took it up, and put it in a place where they put coals- not where they put goods - when he came back I asked what he had been at, and what that was which he let fall in the water; he said he supposed it was a block fell off the boat; I then went and told the gentleman of it - they came out and we went and pulled the boat back, and found the truss - the prisoner was then gone out.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Will you swear this young man was in the shop? A. No; I saw the coffee-biggin while he was in the shop - I missed it about ten minutes afterwards; I went into my parlour - there was no one in the shop - I had a child in my arms, which sucks - it was not crying; I had been robbed five<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140117"/>days before of some spoons; I do not swear to this young man at all, but I am sure it was him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came he to be taken up? A. Because the young lady, who came to tell me I had lost it, said she would point out the man - she did so, and he was taken.</p>

            . I am a waistcoat-maker, and live opposite this shop. Between eight and nine o'clock I saw the prisoner, in company with two men; they stood next door but one; the prisoner went into the shop; I am quite sure it was him; it was broad day-light, and my window was open; he had nothing with him that I saw; the other two then crossed; the prisoner then came out of the shop, and, in a few minutes, went in again, and the second time I saw him draw a coffee-biggin from the corner of the shop, and put it under his coat; he and his two companions then went away; I was so much alarmed I could not cry out, but I went over and told what I had seen - on the following Tuesday I pointed the prisoner out; I am sure he is the man; I had never seen him before, but I particularly observed him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then you did not see any thing in his hand when he wentin? A. No; he could not have had a spectacle case in his hand; he had his face towards me for about five minutes - when he came out of the shop with the biggin, they all walked away; I was but a little way from him; it is not a wide street - he had lightish-coloured napkeen trousers on, and a blue coat; I observed him particularly; he has a particular walk, and is rather a bow legged man; this was on a Saturday; I saw him again on the Tuesday, when they all three went past the house again, I went and told Mrs. Tiddeman - she went to try to get an officer, but could not; they got away - the prisoner was taken on the following Saturday; I could see the coffee-biggin in the shop as I sat at my window; it was just as you go in on the right hand.</p>

I was shewn some silk and some worsted, dyed; there were two hundred and fifty-seven bobbins of silk; I cannot tell the weight of silk on them, but 45l. is the value, speaking under the mark - there were thirty-three bobbins with silk and worsted, and one hundred and seventy-four empty bobbins, worth, perhaps, 10s. - there is my stamp on them, but a number of the marks are defaced<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140119"/>- Samuel Clarke was in the house during the time I examined the property - he did not give any account of it, nor say any thing about it; neither his father, nor any part of his family had the means of being lawfully possessed of these goods.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. The house you searched was the father's? A. Yes; Samuel lives and works there; I will not swear the silk was mine; they have learned the weaving trade, and must use such sort of silk as this; his father have had silk of me; he might have been in possession of my bobbins, and wound other people's silk on them; if I had found empty bobbins I should not have ventured to affirm they were stolen. The father has not bought twelve bobbins of silk of me in twelve months; the silk I die is peculiarly fine, Italian tram, not usually kept; there may be then or twelve houses in London where it might be bought.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Does Samuel lodge in that house? A. I believe he does; his father never dealt with me in my life, to a tenth part of the extent of this property - I believe, from the nature of it, it is mine, and that I had not sold it to the father.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is there any thing to convince you that this silk had not been sold off your premises? A. I know I have lost property. I was not present when the young man said he could not account for it in the absence of his father. I have sold to Henry, but not more than once in twelve months - that was what is called gut coarse worsted or yarn.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Have you ever sold to Henry, for himself, or for Samuel, or for the father, such property as you found? A. He has bought silk, but never such a quantity as we found there. I have sold silk to Henry, for the father, but very little.</p>

            . I went to Wild-court, to the house where the father lives - I found Samuel Clarke up stairs, his mother and the children; I told him I had a warrant to search his premises - he said, very well, I was very welcome; he went up stairs, through a trap-door, to a very long workshop; Mr. Robertson went first, Samuel Clarke followed him, and I went behind; I turned on my right hand, and in the corner of the window I found bobbins, with cotton or worsted on them; they had Mr. Morris' name on them; they were not concealed, but quite open. Mr. Robertson identified them; Mr. Morris was not there - Mr. Robertson said, "Who has got the key of this desk?" Samuel said, "I have;" in that desk several bobbins of silk were found; Mr. Robertson said, "How came you by these;" he said he did not know - we then went to the other end of the room, and found some bobbins of cotton in a basket, which was behind a butter-flat- we collected together all the property which Mr. Robertson thought he came to search for; some was found up stairs and some below - the desk was on the right-hand in the work-shop; we came down to a little room on the first floor - Samuel unlocked it - I suppose he got the key out of his pocket; we found some of the property in some drawers, and all that Mr. Robertson identified as Mr. Morris' property was put into a bag - before we had done searching the little room Mr. Morris came - he said, in the presence of Samuel, that it was his property - I cannot say whether Samuel made any answer; Edward, another brother, came while I was there; he asked if I had been below - I said No; he said, "I dare say there is a cart load below - it is a bad job;" Samuel did not say any thing to this. Samuel was then taken to the watch-house - Henry was there before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You know the father is a weaver and twister? A. I do not know it. The property was in the work-shop and store-room; Samuel said he did not know how it came there - he was not at work - he was at dinner. I said at Bow-street that Edward said it was a bad job - he did not say we were all wrong.</p>

            . I was in the employ of Mr. Morris, and know his mark - I left his employ about two years and three months ago. I accompanied the officer in this search, and picked out what property I supposed to be Mr. Morris' - I should think the value is 8l. or 10l. Edward Clarke came in, and he said it was a bad job, and if we went down stairs we should find a cart load - that was in the hearing of Samuel - the silk is in such a state as it would be if it had been sold, but the worsted is not; we find that bobbins do sometimes change hands, and the property of A may become the property of B, but it is not usual to erase the mark.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not you find some of these bobbins marked I K? A. Yes; I do not know how many; there are some of other persons'; I did not take every bit of silk round a bobbin of Mr. Morris's, to be Mr. Morris's silk, because I knew the prisoner had bought silk of Mr. Morris; I could not distinguish which, but the officer took away that which had his mark on it; I know his father is a twister, and has had his sons taught weaving; I have employed them myself; the goods there found were such as weavers would use.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You said the silk was mostly in the state it would be if it was sold? A. Yes; but some of it has been used; here is one which had not been sold, because it has the winder's note on the top - but it is ready to be sold; I should think, from finding other letters on a bobbin, it was merely to obliterate the former letters - but if a person of that name had bought these bobbins, and chose to keep them, he might put his I. K. upon them, and then they might pass to other hands.</p>

On the 17th of July a letter was received, which was handed to me on the 18th - this is it; there was then the other half-sheet containing a direction; I gave direction to Vogler, my shopman, to get the order done immediately, according to this letter; I think the value of the articles sent was about 49l.</p>

            . I am shopman to Messrs. Turner. In July last I put up three dozen silver spoons, and two dozen forks - they were all the fiddle-pattern, and worth about 50l.; I gave them to William Simmons, to be taken to Mr. Buck's, No. 13, Cumberland-street, who has been a customer of my masters' many years; I was at Messrs. Turners' at the time the prisoner was an apprentice there, and I know his hand-writing; I believe this letter to be his writing, but it did not strike me then, as I had it not long in my hands before the order was executed; I think I destroyed the other part of it, and put this part on the file.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Why did you destroy the other part? A. It is customary in our business; the other part had contained the direction, "Messrs. T. and C. Turner, No. 58 and 59, New Bond-street, London; by favour of Capt. Montgomery;" it came by the two-penny post; this is the prisoner's hand-writing - I have no hesitation in swearing it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure it came by the post, and had Capt. Montgomery's name on it too? A. Yes; it had his name on the fore-part, immediately over the direction, and yet came by the post. (read.)</p>

             will thank Messrs.

Montgomery will call there on his return to Hampton.</p>
               <p>Another letter came on the 8th of August, which, I believe, to be the prisoner's writing, but there was something in it which excited my attention, there is one word mis-spelt in it, the word has instead of as; I went to get directions in consequence of the suspicion I entertained, and I went to the office and to Mr. Buck's house; this is the letter(read)</p>
               <p>Mr. G. Buck's compliments to Messrs. Turner, and informs them, the plate gave every satisfaction - has Mr. B. wishes to make the set more complete, he will thank Messrs. Turner to let him have six more of each, (except the teaspoons) and a soup ladle.</p>

On the night of the 4th of September, I was going home at a quarter past nine o'clock, and looking round my premises I saw the large shed-door moving; I cried out, "Who is there?" I got no answer - I called to my daughter, and she brought a light; we saw the prisoner standing at the door, and pulling this truss out of the shed; he had come up with the boats of hay that day, but he was not in my employ, and had no right to take my hay; we found five trusses of hay ready for taking away - he said he was going to stop there, because his boat leaked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you never given leave to any persons to sleep there? A. Yes, at haymaking time, but not lately - there was no young woman with him upon the hay; and I had given no one leave to sleep there; I fastened the shed myself, bolted, and pinned it.</p>

            . I am a constable. I saw the prisoner come out of the shop with the dish in her hand; she walked at a quick pace; the prosecutor came out, and called "Stop that woman" - she turned into a lane; I pursued and took her - she had several persons round her, who said "Go the watch-house" - no cap was found on her.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were you the first person who took her? A. Yes; she said I might search her, but I should find no cap on her, but she was in a crowd, and, to the best of my belief, it had been given to another person.</p>

            . I was on duty in Vauxhall-road, on the 24th of August, about half-past four o'clock in the morning, and I saw Dickinson and another man coming up Belvoir-terrace, towards Pimlico; they made off at the back of Belvoir-terrace, and I saw them turn their heads frequently; I thought there was something wrong, and I made up to them, and overtook them; I asked them what was the matter; they said, Nothing - they had been at the Cobourg, and staid drinking all night; I did not detain them; it was directly opposite Mr. Colley's place that I first saw them.</p>

            . From the information I received I suspected Dickinson to be concerned in the robbery, and I went to the back of a house in Duck-lane, Westminster; I found Costellow standing at the door with another woman; I went into the back part of the house, and found Dickinson in bed; I said to him, "What is your name?" he said, "Pace; you know my name very well;" I said,"Get up," which he did, and under the bed I found this chissel, and these three centre-bits in a cupboard by the fire-place; I took him to the office, and took the female the same day, when she came to inquire about him; they had been living together. I sent Mrs. Colley to Mrs. Longley's - before I got there she hung up the jacket; and I went and said, "Who did you buy this of?" she said,"Of a woman, in the family way, named Carrotty Bet - you know her very well."</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I have always done my best towards my master - and when I had bad silk I was always taken before the Magistrate - and he said I was lazy when I could not do my task of work - it was very bad indeed.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL GRAVENOR. It was the best silk I could get, but he was always altering it, and therefore it was disabled from working as it should do, he was so fickle minded.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to JOHN VINCENT. Q. Did not you know that I could not get on with the work? A. You said so several times - it was a new harness and not quite settled - if he had made three quarters of a yard, it would have done very well.</p>
               <p>JEMIMA MARGON. I know he complained of his work, and I went with the boy to look at it - it appeared to be bad.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL GRAVENOR re-examined. Q. Supposing the work to have been wrong, could it have been put to any use? A. Yes - it could have been made in another loom; the harness was new, and every thing in a complete state; the value of the silk, spoiled, is about 8l.</p>

I was at the General Graham on this night; I saw Prudon and the prosecutor come in and ask for a pint of porter; Prudon asked the prosecutor to give him a bit of tobacco - he said he had not got any - then another person lent him a bit, and went out, and the prosecutor took the box and played some trick with it - Prudon gave it back to the man - and after a little while the prosecutor told him he had not got what ought to be in the box; the man rattled it and said he was sure it was all right; the prosecutor said he would lay him a wager of it - that he had got no money, but had got a good watch, and would lay that against 5s.; the watch was put into the boy's hand; the housekeeper would not let him hold the stakes; he then asked Prudon to hold it, and he would give him 6d. if he won - Prudon took it to hold; the box was then opened; I did not see what was in it, but directly the prosecutor ran out to get an officer; the others remained there drinking their porter.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who was at the door? A. There were some persons there; I was drinking with Rose; there were a great many people at the door; I have known Prudon four years, he is quite a good sort of man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor complain of losing his watch. A. He ran out after the man who won the watch - he said if he could see the man he would leave it at the bar for the money; I remember the pot-boy returning the watch, because the lady would not let him hold it; Prudon gave it to the man who won the wager; the prosecutor put it on the table, and then took it up and put it into Prudon's hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that Cox did not run off with the watch? A. I do not know Cox; I do not know who<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140127"/>took it; he gave the watch to the man who won it; and he went away almost immediately; he did not stop; there were other persons there; the man might stay a minute or two in the house; I cannot say who took the watch; he gave it to the man who won the wager.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was not Cox? A. I cannot swear a thing I do not know.</p>
               <p>CHARLOTTE SPARKHALL. My Lord, this witness was not in the tap-room, he was in the bar; he saw nothing at all of it.</p>

On the 8th of August, about six o'clock in the evening, I was in a house which may be deemed a lodging-house; it is a private house, and has been mine for upwards of twenty years - I had lived there one night- there had been soldiers quartered there upwards of eleven years; I had recently come out of trouble, as I was convicted illegally; I went to my house, where I found the prisoner; I had known him before; I gave him a bottle, and he got some gin. I begged him to dine with me, which he did - there were four persons in the house. After dinner I laid down on the sofa, and fell asleep; I had four sovereigns, three half-sovereigns, and fifteen or sixteen shillings in my purse, in the left pocket of my small clothes; it appears I could not have slept two minutes before the house-keeper,

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe he had a shop of his own once? A. I believe he had; he was not in any kind of partnership with me; I never had any cards with his name on the back of them; he came with a condition that he should recommend his former customers, and I allowed him 15 percent.; I did so with all my shopmen - he was allowed to take shoes out and sell them to his own customers with my leave, or with the shopman's permission in my absence, and to book them afterwards - I should have no objection to take him again.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was it you permitted him to do on speaking to you, or to any body in your shop? A. If any of his friends had a pair of shoes, I allowed him the profit of them, but I never allowed him to take any, except for sale.</p>
               <p>HANNAH ANDREWS. I was in the service of Mr. Bonham. On the 12th of July, I observed a pair of shoes in the prisoner's coat pocket, which hung in the cupboard - he took them out with him; I sent the apprentice to see where he went to - he gave me information, and I found them at the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were in the shop when he went out? A. Yes; the cupboard was not locked - any one might have gone there - he put the coat on openly before me - he has borne a good character.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You say, when the boy went away the prisoner had returned? A. Yes; and in about half an hour I found the silk in the cotton-room. I had been some few moments in my house, once or twice; a person might have gone into the warehouse without my seeing them, but not without my hearing the door go; my house is about six feet off; I went up stairs into the bed-room which looks into the warehouse; I was there five or ten minutes, I might be a quarter of an hour altogether in the house - I employ forty or fifty other workmen; I believe they were not on the premises; I did not see any one go from the warehouse to the cotton-room; they might have done so, but it is very improbable.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Could any person have gone out of the warehouse without your hearing them? A. I think not, because the door makes a noise; it was not the business of any person to have been employed there but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you came back the prisoner was in the room where the silk was? A. Yes, and I suppose he took it from the warehouse to the cotton-room during the half hour; he must have opened the door that I speak of; it was his usual custom, after he has done his work in the warehouse, to lock the door and bring in the key; I went out with the key, and he was coming out of the cotton-room; at that moment my dog got loose in the cellar, and I desired him to go down and fasten him; I then went into the warehouse, and the silk was gone - I found it in the cotton-room, behind a box of rubbish - I sent for the officer, and told him what I conceived the prisoner to have done, and it was when he was going out of the door that he used this expression - I had desired him to look for it, but he would not; he stood<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140132"/>before the hole where the silk was, within a yard of it, and I desired him to move; I put my hand in and took hold of it.</p>

            . I was with Mr. Emett, near Somerset House, and saw the prisoner very near us, actively engaged at the head of a mob, which I evidently saw was created for the purpose of making depredations. I cannot say I saw him make an attack on my friend, but he was very near him; I did not see the watch taken, but some time afterwards I asked Mr. Emett, and he said, "I have lost my watch" - I went to the head of the mob, and saw the officer - I told him of it. I did not see the prisoner till he was at Bow-street.</p>

               <p>EDWARD EVANS. I was at the Adam and Eve, public-house, Westminster, on the 5th of September - I went from home about twelve o'clock, and remained at the public-house the rest of the day; I was not very much in liquor, and I left my friend who I had been with, at half-past seven o'clock in the evening; I had some money on my person - I had never seen the prisoner before I was at Queen-square-office; I do not know how I got into her company.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You had 2s. 6d. in the office the next morning, and you told the gentleman you had lost no money.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do not know that you had more money then than you had the next morning at the office? A. Yes; my landlord brought me half-a-crown that morning.</p>

            . On the 5th of September, I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor; he appeared to be in liquor, but appeared to have been extremely ill-used; he was quite stupified from the effects of the usage; the prisoner was accompanied by three young men and a boy about ten years of age - she placed the prosecutor against a door, and supported his head with her left hand, while she put her right hand into his breeches pocket, and passed something to the boy, who made off; she then put her hand again into his left hand pocket; I watched her; she changed her position, and put her right hand before his eyes, and put her left hand into his breeches pocket; I saw her put something in her bosom; I went and asked her if she was his wife; she said No - I went and told a grocer, who came out, and said it was a pity there was not a street-keeper about - I went on to Shetton-ground, and when I returned I saw three youths ill-treating the prosecutor in a most barbarous manner; the prisoner had his hat in her hand, partly concealed by her apron; I went up and remonstrated with them - I was afterwards desired to give my address, which I did; the prisoner ran off as soon as she knew there were officers coming.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into the house where the prosecutor was drinking, and my friend sat down by him; he gave us some beer to drink; he had half-a-crown, and said he had pawned his coat for 6s., and had no more left- he then got up to go and he fell into the sink; I raised him up and set him against the wall, and told her to mind him while I went to get him some water; when I got back his hat was off, and I put it on his head.</p>
               <p>COURT to EVANS. Q. Did you pawn your coat that morning? A. Yes, for 6s.; I had but 1s. 11d. in the morning, and thought that not enough; I was sober then, and I went to the Adam and Eve with my friend, and we drank several pints of beer together; I then left him to go home; I was not so tipsy till I was knocked down and ill-treated.</p>

I was on duty on the 14th of July - the gentleman came to me and said, he had been robbed; he said there were two men, and one held him while the other took his cap from him - he described him as dressed like a sailor - we went down Gray's-inn-lane-road, where we saw them, and he said, "That is the one in the middle" - I took the prisoner, and he began fighting - his hat fell off, and the cap fell out of it.</p>

I was in Kensington-gardens, heard a cry, and ran with another person in that direction - I saw the prisoner running towards us, in an opposite direction to Mr. Meyer, about a furlong from him - he then turned, and went in another direction, at a good pace - I went up to him, and asked what was the matter; I did not distinctly hear his answer then; but afterwards, when I returned from assisting Mr. Meyer. (whom I left bleeding on the box with the porter.) he told me he was in want - the grass was very high, and I could not see whether any one else was near Mr. Meyer.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Why did not you give charge of him at once? A. I did not know that I had lost any thing; when he was taken he was speaking some flash words to a woman, who was very angry with him for not taking both shoes - one expression which I remarked was,"What a d-d fumbler he was not to get the two - one was of no use."</p>

On Friday evening, the 28th of July, about half-past nine o'clock, I saw Lacey, Newman, and another with Coles, who was very drunk, and had had a fall; they were in Turnmill-street - I saw Lacey turn up the skirt of Coles' coat, and take from his pocket a handkerchief, which he delivered to Newman; they went round Clerkenwell-close, and when they got to Corporation-lane I met a watchman, and told him; Lacey was then taken, and locked up; as I returned I saw Newman with a different hat to the one he used to wear, which he was offering for sale.</p>

            . On the evening of the 28th of July, about half-past nine o'clock, I saw the three prisoners and Coles in Cowcross-street - he was very tipsy, and had a desperate fall; he dropped the umbrella out of his hand; it rolled into the kennel - I saw Wright pick it up, and walk by the side of Coles, and then go down a court by a public-house. I then saw Lacey, Newman, and another follow Coles, and at the corner of Clerkenwell-close I saw Lacey take the handkerchief, and by the New Prison Newman took Coles' hat off his head, and put his own hat on Coles' head.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. I am an apprentice to Mr. Hey, of Coppice-row. I knew Wright, by seeing him on Clerkenwell-green - he had the same dress he has now - I was not a yard from him - there was light by the public-house; he put the umbrella under his arm. I never stated that he had light-coloured trousers on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner WRIGHT. He stated at the office that the boy who ran away took the handkerchief and umbrella? Witness. No, I did not; he took up the umbrella, and put it under his arm; he then turned into a court, as if he was unlocking a door, I thought, and two children followed him. The prosecutor was quite senseless; Lacey took hold of him, and was dragging him along; Newman took his hat off.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Haddon. I remember the prisoner going out on the 27th of June; I can tell by the book what beer he took out - it is put down every morning, and he signs it, and gives an account when he returns. On that day he took out twenty-five casks of different dimensions, containing beer and ale; there was some of it be-spoke; he brought back an account at night - but there was a deficiency of nine gallons of table ale - he did not account for any thing delivered to Mrs. Parker, her name is not mentioned, she had never been a customer of ours.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You take an account when he goes out and when he comes in? A. Yes; it was not till a letter came from Mrs. Paker that we found there was some deficiency - he was authorized to sell beer to any body, if he brought the money; but he gave no account of this.</p>
               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. He accounted for the whole of the casks, but did he account for all the money? A. No, there was a deficiency of 5s. 6d.; it was a nine gallon cask of table-ale; which I afterwards saw at Mrs. Parker's - he accounted for all but that - he had accounted for the casks sent out, so that it was a deficiency, in the value of the beer, of 5s. 6d.; I did not discover this till the letter came a fortnight afterwards.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Newby's employ. Smith came in and asked to see some wedding-rings, which were shown him; Wilson then came in, and joined him in conversation; they then asked to see some seals and keys - they had selected a ring, but not paid for it; I suspected them, and shut the door; I saw Smith take a seal and put it up his sleeve; I then rang the bell - Mr. Newby came down, and an officer was fetched; I saw Smith put the ring on the counter, saying, "Here is a ring of your's;" it was not the ring they had selected.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Did they see you ring the bell? A. Yes; they attempted to get away - Wilson broke a pane of glass - only 1d. was found on them - a 6d. laid on the counter.</p>

            . I am a glassman, and live in Queen-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields. I saw the prisoners following Mr. Lobb, who was with a lady, by my door - I followed them about twenty yards and saw Keefe take the handkerchief from his pocket, and give it to Connory, who put it into his pocket. I secured them both, and gave them to my father, who took it from Connory, while I went to Mr. Lobb.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Do not you very often come here as a witness? A. I was here six months ago; I have been here six or seven times, about robberies which I saw committed; I had seen Keefe before. My father was a constable of St. Giles'; it was done under the arch-way, between three and four o'clock - I was about twenty yards from them; nobody was between me and them.</p>

On the 5th of September, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, I was returning from Covent Garden, where I had been to see my uncle; I met the prisoner by the Seven Dials - I was a little in liquor, and asked him to shew me the way to <placeName id="t18260914-385-crimeloc2161">Tottenham-court-road</placeName>

I lost sight of him once in turning the corner; but I heard the watchman say "We have got him;" I went up and found him in charge - the money I lost was found on him.</p>

I met the prisoner in Lisle-street, Leicester-square, on the 1st of June, at half-past two o'clock in the morning, with a bag under his arm - he looked at me, and went on into Little Newport-street - I went up to him and said, "I think you have got something that is not all right;" he threw it at me - I caught it in my arms - it contained this glass; he ran off; but was not a quarter of an hour out of my sight - I gave the alarm, and he was taken.</p>

I had never said that previous to my going to the Cooper's Arms, he had seen me double it up, and put the lock-chain over it; he must have seen it when he raised himself up - he was near the cloth, and could get it; I went to his house that night - I found his wife at the gin-shop; I went with the officer and found the prisoner on his beat - he denied it to the officer - but when I went up to him, he said, if I went home with him, he would give it to me; I found it there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not the officer tell him he had stolen it? A. No; he said, "There has been a waggon robbed - do you know any thing about it?" I did not say. I would give him something to make an apron; I did not think any thing about his putting his hand and foot on the waggon. We drank the beer, and came up as far as Butcher-row, and had some rum; I did not ask the prisoner to hold the whip while I went up Morgan's-rents; I left the whip inside, and he brought it out, but I did not desire him.</p>

            . I am a headborough. I received information from the witness, at a quarter before ten o'clock, and went to the prisoner on his beat, in Nightingale-lane, with Beaman - I went up to the prisoner, and said, "Bates - you are charged with stealing a piece of linen out of a waggon to day;" he said he had not; I then stepped five or six yards back, and Beaman went up, and said."Bates"- I did not hear more, but when they had been in conversation about a minute Bates said, in a louder voice, "Yes, I did take it out of the waggon - if you come home with me you shall have it;" we all three went to his house, and, after searching a few minutes, we found this linen on the floor, at the foot of the stairs, in the lower room - the prisoner took it up. I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you went up did not you charge him with stealing it? A. Yes - the carman knew what he was about - I think he was sober.</p>

On Saturday, the 6th of May, the prisoner, whom I had not seen before, came to my house with a woman whom I knew; the prisoner said she had let that old lady have a pair of decanters to get some fruit for her stall, and on the 4th of May she had let her have another pair to get some clothes for herself; she wanted me to lend her the money, and go with her to get them out before her mistress knew it; she said she lived with a lady in Regent-street, who performed at the Opera; I went to Mr. Cameron's, the pawnbroker, in the Strand, with the woman, but I did not get the decanters out; Mr. Cameron had stopped them - I did not own them as mine; I had known the old woman by seeing her stand every day with fruit at the corner of my kitchen window; I found there were six decanters at Cameron's - she said there were but four.</p>

Yes; it was safe during the absence of my husband; but I cannot say it was safe on the 6th of August - I had seen the money locked into the drawer that day - the drawer, where the sheet was, was not locked - he had lived with us fourteen or fifteen years - he had access to all our property - we had a good opinion of him.</p>

I went to Spitalfields-market - I left the room door on the latch; my husband had gone out some time before; I returned at six o'clock, and was told I had been robbed; I went to the watch-house, and saw my apron and a shirt, which I had seen safe at five o'clock - the shirt was on the bed, and I think the apron was over the head of the bed; the prisoner was a stranger.</p>

On the morning of the 11th of July I was coming up from the cellar, and heard the room door shut; I said, "Is that Mrs. Gibbons," but no person answered; I went out at the street door, and saw the prisoner, who had a basket, with an apron or something in it I went and told her she did not belong to that place - she said she did; I brought her back, and said to her, "These things are not your's, for I saw the woman tying up onions in this apron, and this is the shirt the little sailor boy wore"- she then threw them down.</p>

            . I am an officer. About four o'clock on the 18th of August, I was at the corner of Heath-street, and heard a noise - I saw the prisoner running, and Welch following him - we took him; I found this crow-bar in his right-hand pocket; I had passed the house just before, and heard a noise, but I thought it was a family affair; I asked how he came to break into any person's house; he said he was sorry for it - that he was in distress; there was no marks of violence whatever on the door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going across Stepney, and as I ran by the prosecutrix's house, she came and cried, Stop thief! I had not been in the house.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I found the prisoner in the Strand on the 11th of July - the prosecutrix pointed her out to me - she, at first, denied the charge, but afterwards admitted it, and told me where she had pawned them.</p>
               <p>SUSANNAH HOLLIS re-examined. Q. Did you know what time the two servants went out? A. Yes; at seven o'clock - the drawer was kept locked - I had seen the articles safe at half-past eleven o'clock the night before - I had seen the money safe on the 26th of June, when I took it to pay my rent at the Bank, but the person was not there, and I brought it back - the servants came to breakfast at eight o'clock that morning; they were out all day, and came home at ten o'clock at night; I think it was in August they went into the country - it was the prisoner's duty to to make the bed in that upper room - when I discharged her she went directly out of the house.</p>

            . I am a boot-closer. On Saturday night, the 22d of July, I called on Mrs. Young - I do not know her husband's Christian name - I went up stairs, by her desire, and found the prisoner in the second floor room, where Evison slept; he was walking from the cupboard, with the hat in one hand, and the bundle in the other - I asked him what brought him there - he said Evison let him in to sleep with him, as it was a wet night - I was rather rash with him, and Mrs. Young desired me not to be so violent - I went with him to the public-house where Evison was - I found Evison was gone - the prisoner then went away with the property.</p>

On the 3d of August, at ten minutes past seven o'clock, I passed by Singleton's shop door, and saw the prisoner run out, about a yard before me - a boy called Stop thief! - finding a watch was missing, I followed calling Stop thief! - I lost sight of him while he turned the corner - he was secured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Will you swear he was above a minute in your sight? A. I cannot say.</p>

On the 14th of September, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, I was getting up to go to work; there were other persons in the house; the first thing that attracted my attention was the screaming of women, upon which I opened the parlour door where I slept; I looked up the stairs and saw the prisoner, who was a stranger, coming down; I looked at him with astonishment, and held up my hand to strike at him; I was not near enough to hit him, and he darted on me - I caught him by the collar; he was quite a stranger, and had no business in my house; I had fastened my house up, and I do not know at all how he got in; I found no part of it broken; he was not there when I went to bed; he tried to get away, but I held him fast - John Walker's property had been removed.</p>
               <p>JOHN WALKER. I have lodged in Mr. Brick's house five months. On the night of the 13th of September I fastened up the house and went to bed about ten o'clock: on the 14th I got up and went to work, about twenty-five minutes past six o'clock - I am sure I locked my room door; (it is the back-room on the second floor,) and hung the key up above John Brick's room-door where he sleeps; I had left my box in my room - I was fetched from work by Bricks; and when I got home my key was gone from the place where I had left it, and was in my room-door, and my box moved to the middle of the room - I had left the box securely locked, and in it a watch worth 2l. 10s.; a seal, and two coats not finished, worth 3l. 10s.; and a pair of of trousers, worth 1l.; they were my property - when I went out, I fastened the street-door with the latch - I put my shoulder to see if it was fast; I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

On the morning of the 14th of September I heard the bolt of his door slip back very softly; I was in bed at the time, but I got up immediately just as I was, and threw open my door - I saw the prisoner with the chest on his back, ready to carry it away - I said nothing but Oh; and then I shut my door - I heard him throw down the box and go down stairs - I opened my door again, and screamed out Thieves! my landlord caught him at the bottom of the stairs; I know it was Mr. Walker's box.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. These are two persons who, I believe, are tailors, whom I have not been long acquainted with; one is a cutter-out, and lives in this house up stairs; he came to me on the 13th, and asked if I could carry a box for him? I said, I did not mind, and he sent for some liquor to my house - I did not go with him for five or six hours; when we got to the door of that house, he said,"Oh! I forgot myself, it does not matter to-night; if you come to-morrow morning it will do" - his brother-in-law Andrew, came the next morning; I went with him to the house, and he was standing at the door in his stockings; I went up stairs with him to bring the box away; he lifted up the box and put it on the bed, and said to me,"Do you think you can carry it?" I found it was too heavy,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140162"/>and said, "I don't think I can;" he went down stairs, and I missed him all at once; and the lady put her head out of the next room, and said, Thieves! I said directly,"I see how it is; I am trepauned;" when I got to the bottom of the stairs, this man put himself in a position to knock me down - I said, "I have done nothing wrong, the man has gone out at the door."</p>
               <p>JOHN BRICKS re-examined. Q. Was he running down stairs? A. Yes; as fast as he could, ready to make his escape.</p>
               <p>ANN SULLIVAN. The moment I heard the bolt of the door turn I got up; so that there was no time for another person to go down; there was another person up stairs in the house in bed; we called him, and he came and assisted in taking the prisoner; his name is James Gainer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That person has run away since. Witness, No; he has left to go into a good situation; he did all he could to apprehend the prisoner; it was my screams that brought him out of bed; there was no conversation between them whatever.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

(he came right in front of me) I never lost sight of him till the officer took him; a crowd collected: as we were going to the watch-house Hall came up, took hold of my arm, and said, "That is not the man who robbed you - I know where he is gone"- we then went to the watch-house - my property has not been found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. At the time the man snatched your watch did you hear any thing? A. No. The place was very quiet. I had not seen Hall till he spoke to me.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was on duty at the end of St. Martin's-court, looking up New-street, and saw the two prisoners station themselves at the bottom of the court; Flashman stood at the corner, and Hall about a yard from him, so as to let one person pass between them - I heard Hall say "Now;" they drew close together: the prosecutor came up - Flashman snatched at his watch and ran away; I pursued, and took him; Hall came up, and said, "Let that young man go - he is not the person"- I said, "If you know any thing about the robbery come to the watch-house;" I saw Hall go close to Flashman's side - my brother officer came up - I got him to hold Flashman's other arm; we went to the watch-house, and secured him there - then came out, and took Hall; I knew them before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. They must have been close together? A. Yes - I was not two yards off; the snatch was made within a second of his saying "Now." I was paying more attention to them than Shaw - whether he heard it I do not know; Hall might have escaped if he chose. The watchmen were not on duty.</p>

The prisoner was in my service upwards of a year and a half - on the 30th of August I missed a coat and pair of trousers, and afterwards a marlin-spike was gone; I had missed the snuff-box six days before, and had sent him to different coffee-houses to inquire if I had not left it there; I told him and the servant girl that it would be prudent for me to go to their houses to see if any thing was there; I pretended to go, but went to Worship-street; I then went home with the officer, and told the prisoner he might sleep in the house that night, and go before the Lord Mayor in the morning, but after two o'clock he got up, and went out, pulling the door after him; I got up, and spoke to the officer, who was on duty at my door.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. (Written.) The truth is, that having accidentally omitted to enter this sum, I did not like to acknowledge my inattention, and as Cape was going out to collect, I got him to pay the amount, as if he had received it.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Pearce's employ. On the evening the prisoner was taken, he gave me 2l. 17s. 6d. to take care of; he afterwards told me he had received it for Stevens - he gave it me after he was in custody; he never told me why he gave it me - I gave it to his sister; I told Mr. Pearce I had some money of Hartley's, and asked what I was to do with it - he had not told me not to give it him - I was in the room, he put it into my hands, and said, "Take care of it."</p>
               <p>Mr. PEARCE. I gave the prisoner 30s. a week; I find, by my cash-book that he paid me no money on the 22d; I never made an error in my entries; Cape occasionally collected for me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the cellar under ground? A.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I came home on Sunday with a shilling and a sixpence in my pocket, which I put on the drawers, to put into my other pocket in the morning - I was stooping to untie my shoe and picked up this shilling, which I threw on the drawers; and in the morning I took a shilling and a sixpence off the drawers, and thought they were my own.</p>
               <p>Mr. WARD. It was impossible that it could have fallen from my pocket; there was no shilling found on the drawers; I put it on the floor carefully; he was in bed before I put it there.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 6th of September, about twelve o'clock, I had been watching the prisoners above an hour, in company; I saw them go round several gentlemen, and touch their pockets; when they came to Finch-lane, Pink took a handkerchief from a gentleman's pocket, and ran off - they were close together - I was thirty yards off; I called to the gentleman - he did not hear me; I then followed them, and took them both; Pink twisted from me and ran away, but was stopped; he threw this handkerchief down.</p>

The prisoner came to my shop on the 7th of September, at a little before eight o'clock in the morning - I was called down - he asked to see some mourning rings; I showed him a tray, and observed that he took up two, and returned but one to the tray - he said we had none to fit him, and was going out; I told him he had stolen a ring; I closed the door, and sent for a constable - he had then had the ring in his possession about five minutes - he was searched - his coat and waistcoat were taken off, and I saw a ring between his fingers, which I supposed to be mine, but it was not; we then ceased searching him - he was taken to the Compter; I swore to the ring before the Magistrate - it was a fac-simile of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any ring? A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. And yet you swore to this? A. Yes - I believed it was mine then, but now know it was not; I told the Grand Jury so, and am surprised they have found the bill.</p>

I said I had been one hundred and thirty or one hundred and forty miles across the water; he said "Ah, well;" he then left the house, and I looked for the Jew, as I wanted to get rid of the watch; but he was gone; the prisoner appeared to me like a broken down Captain, or something of that kind; I had been in London but four days; I looked round and saw the prisoner running away. I left the porter, half drank, and followed him down two or three streets into Petticoat-lane, crying Stop thief! but no one stopped him; I ran on and caught him; I said "You villain, you have imposed upon me; you have sold me a thing not worth one quarter the value I gave you for it;" he said "You be d-d;" I said "I shall hold you, unless you give me up my money, and take your watch;" I had scarcely looked round, before four or five people came up with the Jew and struck and kicked me violently; so that I was obliged to let the prisoner go; I saw him get off; I got into Whitechapel, and described him to Forrester, and he knew him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then you thought to get a bargain of this man? A. No; I bought it for the Jew; I did not examine it.</p>
