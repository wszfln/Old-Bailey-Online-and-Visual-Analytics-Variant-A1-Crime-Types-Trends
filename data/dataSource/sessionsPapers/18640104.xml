On the evening of 17th December, about 8 o'clock, I saw the prisoner leave Mr. Suttaby's premises—I noticed a small parcel in his hand—I followed him into Fleet-street, stopped him, and told him I believed he had got some property belonging to his master, some books—he said, "No, I have not"—I said "Are you quite sure that you have not?"—he said, "Yes; I have no books at all about me"—I then took him back to his master's warehouse and searched him, and in his right-hand coat-pocket I found this Bible; there is no private mark in it—he gave his address, 36, Nelson-square, Blackfriars-road—I went there, and searched the premises, and found eighty other books, consisting principally of Bibles, Church-services, and Prayer-books—I had no conversation with the prisoner about those books; I spoke to him about the one found in his possession, and asked how he accounted for it—he said he was going to take it to show it to a lady.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. James Henry Stewart, jeweller and optician, 406, Strand—on 30th November I fastened up the house about 11 o'clock—I saw to the whole of the astenings—between 3 and 4 in the morning of 1st December, my wife and I were awoke by a strange kind of noise; I got out of bed to go to the window, but before I could open it I heard some glass fall in the yard below—I opened the window, looked out, and saw a man going over a wall which separates the back of our house from the back of the first house in Bull Inn-court—the entrance to the court is two doors from our house—my wife sprang a rattle while I was dressing myself, and some constables came and appeared at the window from which the prisoner got out—I let them in, and we examined the back parlour window—the puttey had been carefully removed, the window broken, and the hasp pushed back—later in the morning I searched the window, and, on the sill found a couple of chisels, which I produce, also some paste in a piece of paper—I saw the broken pieces of glass scattered about.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, F</hi> 16). On the morning of 1st December, about a quarter past 3, I was on duty in Bull Inn-court, Strand, about six or seven yards from the prosecutor's house—I heard a scuffling noise in the house, 15, Bull Inn-court—I said, "Who's there?"—I received no answer—in a minute or so the door came open about a few inches and was slammed again—I said, "Come out, whoever you are there," and directly the door flew open, and the prisoner, with another man not in custody, rushed from the house into the Strand—I pursued the prisoner, calling "Stop thief!"—he turned towards Temple-bar—I pursued him till near Wellington-street, and after I had turned him some distance, nearly half-way back to the house again, I caught him; I should think I had run nearly half a mile—when I caught him, he said, "What are you going to do with me now?"—I said, "I am going to take you to the police-station," and I did so—I then went back to Bull Inn-court, and in the passage of No. 15, close by where the prisoner came from, I found this dark-lantern, and this rope very ingeniously tied together for the purpose of letting a person down—I then went to Mr. Stewart's house, 406, Strand, and saw last witness—when I returned to the station, I searched the prisoner, and found on him this knife, these two keys, and this handkerchief stained with blood—</p>

               <p>the prisoner's fingers were out and bleeding—he was wearing this waistcoat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there are three buttons missing from it; they are common buttons—about half-past 9, I searched the top of the water-closet on the wall leading over into 406, Strand, and found, these two buttons, which exactly correspond with those on the prisoner's waistcoat—they are exactly the same description—the house, 15, Bull Inn-court, is divided by a wall from the prosecutor's premises—the house in Bull Inn-court is occupied by lodgers, who go in and out at any time of night—it would be possible for a man who broke the window of the prosecutor's house to get over the wall to the back of 15, Bull Inn-court, and then to get out from there.</p>

On the morning of 1st December, between 2 and 3 o'clock, I was on duty in the Strand, and heard a rattle spring from the second floor of 406, Strand—I ran up Bull Inn-court, and went into the first house, No. 15—I went through there, and saw this board laid from the kitchen stairs on to the window-sill which leads up to the top of the water-closet—I found this centre-bit, two gimlets, a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, and likewise this piece of iron, on the top of the water-closet leading to the back of 406, Strand—I also found this bag—I saw two holes in the top of the water-closet, and this board was suspended from the water-closet into the premises of 406, Strand, level with the parlour window, which was broken.</p>

On the night of 24th December, about 11 o'clock, I was on duty in Mortimer-market—as I was going by Tot<lb/>tenham-court-road, a little boy said something to me; in consequence of which I went round Mortimer-market, and saw the prisoner with the prosecutor on the ground, with his hand in his right trousers pocket—directly he saw me he ran off—I caught him in Oldham-street—he had two half-crowns, three florins, and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in his hand—he said it was his own money, which he had drawn of his master, Mr. Walter Abathen, of 16, Gower-street—I went there, but there was no such man known.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 56, Poland-street—I know the prisoner and her husband—they lived at 1, Union-street, Marylebone—I was there on 23d November—they had some angry words, and I saw them exchange blows in the parlour—the prisoner then ran into the shop—there is a door leading from the shop into the parlour—the prisoner pulled the door to after her—it came open, and I then ran out into the street.</p>

I am the widow of John McCarthy—on Tuesday evening, 8th December, I had been out on my walk—I went home between 5 and 6, went into my own room, and Patrick McConvey and John Daley were there—they said they should go and have tea, and went down stairs into Mrs. Keefe's room instead of going home to tea—she lives on the first floor back, and I on the second floor front—my husband was in my room, and I made tea for him and my children and myself—I gave him a cup of tea, which nearly dropped from him—he had a drop taken, but I could not tell how much, as he had been out all day—he said that he wanted to go after Patrick McConvey, but I would not let him—he then told me he wanted to go down stairs—I did not prevent him, for I thought he wanted to go to some private place—I sat down to have my tea, and took my baby in my arms—I heard violent screams down stairs, turned the baby away, and went down with a poker, which I laid down on the landing—I Opened the prisoner's door, which was open before, went in, and saw John Daley holding my hus<lb/>band by the shoulder, in the middle of the floor—I rescued him—I drew him as far as the door, and Daley shoved him—the prisoner then ran</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does erysipelas very frequently arise from wounds of that sort? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, if not carefully attended—the wounds were not very ex<lb/>tensive; they were such as a pair of tongs would make, but the erysipelas was the cause of death—if he bad been attended to immediately, his life might possibly have been saved—he had also disease of the lungs, and of the kidneys, both of which would make the erysipelas more likely to be fatal—drink would be likely to make the erysipelas worse—his drinking before he received the injury would render him more likely to have erysipelas from the wounds.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of the G Division of police—I saw the prosecutrix—my assistant dressed her wounds on the night of 10th—I examined her the next day; she had a punctured wound on the right side of the forehead, and a wound on the back of the neck, and another wound over the left blade-bone, which was an inch and a half deep—they were all punctured wounds, from which I had no doubt she must have lost a great deal of blood—the wound on the forehead was somewhat dangerous, inasmuch as I think the bone was penetrated by the instrument which had caused the wound—she was under my care for ten or twelve days, and she went on well after that—the wound Jon the forehead was the only one that would endanger life, and that could only have been dangerous if erysipelas had set in—it would have been dangerous if it had been a little deeper.</p>

I am landlord of the Earl of Warwick, at Welling—on 12th December, at a little before 4 o'clock, Woodger and Sullivan came in together—it was dusk—Woodger asked for half a quartern of gin, and tendered a shilling—I put it in the till—there were three or four other shillings there—I gave him sixpence and 31/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—they both drank of the gin, and left the house together—a policeman came in immediately—I then looked in my till, and found that the top shilling was bad—I had put nothing else into the till afterwards—I gave it to the policeman—I live a mile and a half or two miles from Plumstead-common.</p>

I am a carpenter—on 12th December, at a little before 4 in the afternoon, I was at work in Welling-road; heard something, looked up, and saw Woodger running towards me and a policeman following him—he put his hand in his trousers pocket, took something out with his left hand, which he appeared to be putting into paper—I saw some coin in his hand which looked like silver—it was partially in paper—he threw it across the road, over the fence, into the Park—I was about two yards from him—I stopped him, and a policeman came and took hold of him—I afterwards got through the fence, and found five half-crowns in paper, and two loose, a crown, and two shillings, and gave them to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a charwoman, and work at the Roupell Arms—I came there about a quarter past 7 on the morning of the 23rd—Mr. Cuth<lb/>bert let me in, and I had some conversation with him—I saw the prisoner that morning about ten minutes to 8—he came into the bar, went to a cupboard there, and took out a large glass with something in it, which looked like gin, and as he drank it, his hand trembled very much—I did not say anything to him then—I afterwards went out into the back yard and said, "This is a pretty job, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>; how did they get out?"—he said, "The house where I was at Bexley-heath was robbed, and they did not find it out"—that was all he said.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I went to bed about five minutes past 11, and got up at twenty minutes 8, and came down stairs. Mr. Cuthbert said, "William, did you hear anybody in the cellar in the night?" I said, "No." He said, "There has been some one." I said I did not hear any one, and I went about my work, and after breakfast he came to me and said, "William, I demand your keys; there is something about this I don't like." I said, "I hope you don't accuse me?" and he said, "I have no suspicion of any one." As for the footmarks, people got there all hours of the day and night too. I am as innocent of the robbery as a child unborn. I knew no more where the spirit cellar lay than I did where this Court was. I never was inside the cellar—the tap room window is always left open, any one could get in there; it was not locked for a week and three days before this night, and the land<lb/>lord says it was fastened that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am toll collector of Lam beth-bridge—on Sunday night, 27th December, I was on the Surrey side taking tolls—the prisoner came up and paid with a shilling—I placed it on one side, while I took the halfpence from other people—I then gave the prisoner 11 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and he went on—about two minutes afterwards I discovered that the shilling was bad, and sent a man after the prisoner, who brought him back, and I told him he had given me a bad shilling—he said that he was not aware of it; he was sorry for it, he had just changed a half-crown for some tobacco—he asked to look at it—I allowed him to do so—he put it in his mouth, and I believe he swallowed it—I sent for a policeman, and he was given in custody—I saw him put his hand to his mouth a second time, putting something in, and he made the attempt to swallow something—I followed to the station, two or three yards behind, and as the prisoner passed, I saw something like metal fall into an area in Paradise-street—I Saw Mr. Tricks go into the area, and find a bad shilling—I cannot say whether it was the one the prisoner had given me; but I am quite sure the one uttered to me was bad.</p>

After it was given back to me, not having got any pockets in my clothes, I put it in my mouth, and having some tobacco there which I wanted to spit out, the shilling and the tobacco came out together. No man in England can swear that I ever uttered a bad coin to my knowledge; my eyes are very bad, as is well known to the Governor of the Gaol. My spectacles were broken, and I could not see whether the shilling was bad or good.</p>
