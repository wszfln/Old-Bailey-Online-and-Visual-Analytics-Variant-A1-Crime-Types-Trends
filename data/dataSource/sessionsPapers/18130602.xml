I had not to go with it; a messenger came to me, desiring me to return home. I returned home, and found a large assembly around my door. I entered the house. I was there met by a person of the name of Wilmot. He produced two pieces of wet printed cotton, and he wished me to say whether it was my property or not. I answered, I would inform him when I looked at the remainder of my stock. I looked at the remainder of my stock, and found the two pieces missing. I examined the wet cotton, and found it to be the same pattern and quality that I had lost. I then proceeded further through my house in the passage. I found the prisoner under charge of Mr. Wing. The prisoner, upon finding I was master of the property, begged for mercy. I then took him to Marlborough-street office, where he was committed. This is the property that was found upon the prisoner. I have no doubt it is my property. I had two such pieces at eleven o'clock in the day, when I left my house, and when I returned I had not these two pieces.

            . I live at 26, Weymouth-street, very near Mr. Bowen. On Saturday, the 13th of March, I heard a cry of stop thief. I went out of doors, and the prisoner passed me. A witness of the name of Wing caught hold of him, and asked him what he had done with the furniture that he had stolen out of Mr. Bowen's shop. He begged not to be exposed, but to be taken into a private house, and he would pay for what he had done. I then went in search of the furniture; I found it at No. 6, Great Chesterfield-street, in the area, in a water-butt. I was directed there by several persons who saw him throw it away. It was all wet. He had thrown it over the rails. It had fallen into a water-butt. I then took the prisoner to Mr. Bowen's shop. He offered a silver watch for the injury the cotton had received, and not to be prosecuted. We took him to Marlborough-street; there he was committed.</p>
               <p>MR. WING. On the 13th of March, I was coming past Mr. Bowen's shop, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner come out of the shop. He appeared to be very much confused. He had a basket, and two pieces of print. I looked in the shop, and saw no person in it; that gave me more suspicion. The prisoner seeing me look at him. He set off running with the property. I gave the alarm in the street. A great many people followed him. He threw over the area rails the basket, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020004"/>the two pieces of print. I then got hold of him, and took him back to Mr. Bowen's shop; he begged we would not take him into a public-house, but to take him into a private-house. I took him back to Mr. Bowen's shop; he there begged to be let go, not to be prosecuted.</p>

            . Q. Are you a single woman - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In October, 1810, did you live at Tottenham - A. Yes; I occupied the whole of a house, I intended to go away, and I advertised the house. I carried on dress-making, and millinery business. I saw the prisoner in October, 1810; I had not known him before; he was a perfect stranger to me. He came there to take the house; he said he had no objection to take the furniture if I meaned to dispose of it. I understood he had been there before, and had conversation with somebody about taking the house. I do not know what day it was in October; it might be the latter part of October. He took possession on the 20th; it was not long before the date of the bill; the bill was dated the day it was given, November the 12th, 1810. He told me, he would take the fixtures of the shop, and my furniture that I had to dispose of he was willing to take, if I would consent to take two bills in payment for the furniture. The fixtures of the shop, he said, he would pay me ready money for, which amounted to twenty-six pounds fourteen shillings; but instead of paying the twenty-six pounds fourteen shillings, he made a payment of twenty pounds, and the six pound fourteen shillings were added to the bills. He sent for the stamps, and when the stamps arrived, he wrote the bills; he did not ask me to write the body of the bills.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the same bills again if you were to see them; look at the bill for nineteen pounds fourteen shillings, and tell me if that is the bill - A. Yes; the name to this bill, is my hand writing. He wrote the body of the bill, and I put my name to the bill, as the drawer; he wrote the acceptance across the body of the bill.</p>
               <p>"Accepted Thomas Scott, No. 4, Staining-lane, London." He wrote the whole of it, except my name. He wrote

            , at Terris and White, Staining-lane, London. He called Terris and White his agents. I understood from him that was the place to which the bill would be payable, both in six weeks, but he said if it would accommodate me in making one of the bills for two months, it would suit him the better, than paying both together. I agreed to that.</p>

            . He said if I enquired at Terris and White's, I should find it all satisfactory; they were his agents. I did not see him after that, until he removed into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did he come and take possession of the house - A. On the 20th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, what passed when he came and took possession of the house - A. I met him on the road, and gave him the key; he came to the Ship. I there gave him the key; he was in a chaise he asked me to get into the chaise with him, and to go to the Ship with him; I did so, I gave him the key of the house. He said his goods were coming down in the waggon; they were on the road. I staid some time with him, and then I left him. The stage called for me, and I came to town. I did not hear any more of it, until the first bill was due; I had paid the bill of nineteen pounds fourteen shillings to a Mrs. James, in Castle-street, a dress-maker.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that the bill that you had of the prisoner was the bill that you paid to Mrs. James - A. Yes, it was returned to me by Mrs. James as unpaid.</p>
               <p>Q. Three days after it was due Mrs. James sent for you, to tell you that the bill had been returned - A. She sent to me to ask me whether I would let Mrs. Garlick take the bill to Terris and White, to get it paid. Mrs. Garlick is a person employed by me. I agreed to it. Mrs. Garlick had the bill, and went for the purpose of presenting it; Mrs. Garlick returned, and I found it was unpaid; the bill was returned to me; it was the same bill that the prisoner gave me that was returned to me, by Mrs. James; upon it being returned to me unpaid, I went down to Tottenham to see after Mr. Scott; Mr. Scott was not at home, his wife was; she asked me to walk in, and to wait until he returned. The prisoner returned in a little while; he said he was very sorry, he could not take it up; if Mrs. James would wait he would take it up in a few days. I told him, I would speak to Mrs. James about it; and hoped he would not fail to keep his promise. I came to town then. In a few days afterwards, the prisoner sent a man to Mrs. James, requesting further time; Mrs. James granted a week longer time. I heard nothing more of the prisoner until after the second bill was due, that was two months I think after the first. I went to Tottenham again, when I found the other bill was not paid I saw Mrs. Scott, at that time. Scott was not at home. Mrs. Scott never asked me to sit down, and as soon as I got out of the house, Mrs. Scott put up the shutters. I returned to town again. I never saw Mr. Scott as he called himself, until I saw him on horseback in Chiswell-street; it was on a Sunday I never spoke to him. After that I saw him at Union Hall; a period of twelve months had elapsed then. At a broker's shop, opposite of where I lived at that time, in Whitecross-street, I saw some of my furniture for sale; I think that was in the following summer, after I had left my house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you ever receive any of your rent -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020005"/>A. I assigned away my interest; the bills were my security.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. When you came to Union Hall did you recognise the prisoner - A. Yes. I went there to see whether it was the prisoner; I saw him; it was the Mr. Scott with whom this transaction had taken place, I am confident of it; he was called by many names there. He was called by the name in which he is now indicted, and by the name of Smith and Jones. I then made my complaint to the magistrate, my deposition was taken, and I was bound over to prosecute.</p>
               <p>CHARLOTTE GARLICK. I assisted Mrs. Lawrence in carrying on her business at Tottenham.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the time of the bills being given in the way the last witness has described - A. I was; the prisoner at that time represented himself to go by the name of Mr. Scott.</p>
               <p>Q. Take that bill into your hand, and tell me whether you know that to be the bill that he wrote - A. Yes, that is the very bill; he gave his name as there described, 
               <persName id="t18130602-4-person70">

             the body of it, and wrote the acceptance. Directed to Mr. Terris and White; he stated Terris and White to be his agents; the prisoner said he was employed in making purchases for Government.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember being desired by Mrs. James to go to Staining-lane with this bill I put into your hand - A. Yes; on the day it became due I went to No. 4, Staining-lane, I there presented the bill for payment. I saw an elderly man; I did not get any payment; he said he had no property in hand whatever, belonging to any such person of that name, nor had not known anything of him for some time past. I was desired to call on the morrow. I went there on the morrow. I then saw no one but the servant maid, who gave no answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the persons of Terris and White - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find there were such persons living there - A. I made no enquries but there. I returned the bill to Mrs. James, in Castle-street. I am sure it is the same bill. I had seen the prisoner write in my presence. I was with Mrs. Lawrence, when she went down to Tottenham; and afterwards went to Union Hall; I there saw the person of Scott, that I had seen write the bill; he was there called, Thomas Bontein, and several names. I was bound over to give evidence.</p>

The prisoner begged I would call upon her to know whether the prosecutrix had any thing to say concerning the bills in question. I asked Mrs. Garlick when Mrs. Lawrence would be in town. She said, in a few day I said I wanted to see her for what purpose I did not know, only that the prisoner wanted to see her.</p>

He said, he came from the prisoner in Newgate; he came to Mrs. Lawrence's lodgings, 198, Whitecross-street. He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020006"/>enquired for Mrs. Lawrence. I told him she was not in town. He said, he wished to know how the circumstance took place, and whether she was in possession of the bills against him; he said he had seen the prisoner that day; he wished to see Mrs. Lawrence. I said, she was not in possession of the bills, and if she was in town she would not visit the prisoner in prison. He expressed himself as sorry at the transaction of the prisoner defrauding an alone woman; he also said he had himself been a sufferer by the prisoner.</p>

I waited with my horse and cart at the side of the rails towards Oxford-street. It was dark, in the evening, between six and seven o'clock. I saw only one man; the prisoner is the man, to the best of my knowledge. He brought me three tables; they were covered up with baize and blankets. I did not see them uncovered. They were in my possession until the next day. Mr. Lawrence came for them, and took them to his house at Walworth. Reeves put them in my cart, and told me to go on; he would meet me. He helped them in my cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or not see one table uncovered in your house - A. Yes, one of the tables was, and that was one of the tables that I got from the prisoner. I had them all together. I kept the tables until the next day, then Lawrence came by the direction of Mr. Smith, the man that hired me. He said he sent him for them.</p>

               <p>Q. Where these tables came from, you do not know - A. No. By Smith's directions I gave them up to Lawrence, as I understood Lawrence said Smith had sent him for them. Reeves put them in the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a public-house, the sign of the Crown, Pie-street, Westminster - A. No. I know a public-house, the Crown, in Westminster.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you last see them in George-street, before they were stolen - A. About three weeks before they were stolen I saw them in the house. The key of the house was kept in Mr. Phillips's office. In consequence of information I went to Huggins's house. I got a search warrant, and searched Huggins's house, on the 24th of February. I found the mahogany pembroke table in the one pair of stairs front room.</p>
               <p>Q. When were these things missing - A. About a fortnight before. I afterwards went to Lawrence's house at Walworth. I found the tables that are now in court. I know the card tables to be the property of Mr. Smith. I have had them in my care.</p>
               <p>Q. to Huggins. I understood you to say that you took these tables to your own house, all three - A. Yes. Then about four o'clock in the afternoon Lawrence came.</p>

I asked him how he got on at the Old Bailey; he said, very well; the three men were acquitted. I then said, I supposed Reeves might come forward. He said, no, he must stay a little bit; he had put it all on Reeves's shoulders to get the men's liberty. I said to Mr. Jones that he ought to be subpoened, and several other persons that stood by, they also should be subpoened to declare what they had heard.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take an interest in this - A. Why I had heard that Huggins was a very bad character; I thought it proper to represent what he said.</p>

I then asked her for three more; she said, as many as I wanted she would go and fetch them; she went to the girl at the step of the door. I saw her daughter give her the money out of a bag; she then gave me another three shillings, six in all, and I gave her the other marked eighteen-penny piece. Hutchins, and Lock were watching her. Upon her giving me the last three shillings, Hutchins and Lock took the good money out of her hands, and the bad money out of mine.</p>

I asked him how he came to take them. He said he had only taken four. I said bring them back again, or I will have you. He throwed them in the water. And in the water we found fifteen; I can only say he had four; and he owned having four.</p>

            . I am a taylor. On this day week about twelve o'clock, I was at Mr. Peart's shop in the Poultry. I saw the prisoner pass the door of No. 13, in the Poultry, just as he passed the door he put his hand into the gentleman's pocket that passed. I immediately ran out, and seized him by the collar, with the pocket-book under his coat. I told the prisoner he had robbed the gentleman of his pocket-book; the pocket-book dropped on the pavement. I picked up the book, and secured him. I told him he should go before the Lord Mayor, before I should let him go. I dragged him towards the Mansion House. Two men came and said they were officers. I said I did not know; I should not let him go until I came before the Lord Mayor. I am sure the prisoner is the man that took the pocketbook. I never lost sight of him until I took him to the Mansion House.</p>

I was sitting in my room adjoining Mr. Holman's, with my door shut, between three and four in the afternoon.

I went into Mr. Holman's room, and looked into Pump-court; and seeing the prisoner go out of the door, I looked round, and missed this desk off the table. I then suspected it must be her that had got it; I pursued her, and caught the prisoner in Temple-lane Whitefriars, with this aesk covered up in an old great coat. I uncovered it, and discovered it was this desk that I had missed out of the chambers. I then called out for an officer; nobody came. I took the desk from her. I tried to secure her myself; but my having the desk, she got away from me. I am positive she is the woman. This was on Saturday; she was apprehended in the Temple on Monday, for an assault.</p>

He accosted me with the name of Simmons, or Wiggins, something to that effect; I cannot charge my memory which. The prisoner put himself in a fighting attitude with his thumb to my throat, but not with violence. The other man pushed me with force against the prisoner, and when I came in contact with him, the prisoner took from my person my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. From what part of your person - A. I had it in my waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do it with violence - A. No, he did not; I did not perceive I had lost my property until he left me, he did it so quick; I did not perceive him take it. I missed my watch; from the appearance of the men it struck me that I had lost something. I immediately gave the hue and cry of stop thief. I could have easily have taken the other man, but being pretty positive the prisoner had my property. I conceived it necessary to follow him; and when he found I followed him, I saw him throw it away. I picked it up myself. This is the watch; I am positive it is my watch.</p>

            . Q. Look at the prisoner, do you know her - A. Yes. On the 28th of April last, between seven and eight in the evening, she came up stairs; I lodge up one pair of stairs. I saw her come from my bed-room door; she went up the second pair; I was in the front-room. On hearing a noise I came to the door, and went into the passage: I came outside of the front room door, I saw the prisoner come from the bed-room; she went up the second floor, and asked for a false name; she asked for the name of Clark. I went into my bedroom, and found my watch was gone; it hung in the pocket at the head of the bed; I had seen it about ten minutes before the prisoner came on the staircase. It was a metal gilt enamelled watch; I gave seven pounds for the watch; I think it is worth forty shillings. When I came out of the bed-room, the prisoner was coming down the second pair of stairs. The person of the house came up the first pair of stairs, and stopped her; she saw my watch in her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your watch again - A. Not till the next morning; a lamp-lighter picked it up, and brought it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. When the girl was coming down stairs what did you do - A. She pushed by the person of the house, and went into the street; I ran after her, and Mrs. Smith ran after her; we cried stop thief: an officer came at the time, and took her. I saw her searched, nothing was found upon her, but a gold pin. The prisoner was taken in custody. That is all I know.</p>

She said, she did. The lower room is a shop, there is a private door in the passage; she had opened the private door in the passage, and went up stairs. The prisoner passed me on the stairs; I saw a watch in her hand; I screamed out that she had got the watch. I saw the watch, seal, and ribbon.

She said, no, he might go home to her apartment. We all three went together to her home. He took something out of his breeches pocket, and gave it to Writtle; she throwed it on the bed. He went away. On her return to the bed she picked up a three-shilling piece. I am as innocent as a child unborn.</p>

I locked my door, and went after him; I was going to treat him. I went with him to the public-house door. I said, we will go in here. He said, go in; I want to speak to a person in the street. I stopped about six or seven minutes; I did not go in. I went to him. He said, Day, go in and call for a pint of beer; I will come and pay for it. I went in then, and called for the beer. He never came near me at all. I stopped there an hour, and then went home. When I went home I found the door fast and the window fast. I did not perceive the house broken at all. I went up stairs, and missed two pair of boots.</p>
               <p>MR. BLAND. I am one of the marshalmen. I was informed of the robbery on the 13th, and I heard the prisoner was expected that evening at the Warwick Arms, Warwick-lane. I went there, and slept there all night, expecting his coming there the next morning. On the next morning, the 14th, he made his appearance; I took him in custody, and found one pair of boots on his legs. These are the boots. I questioned him respecting the boots; he gave me three accounts: first, that he had them some years; secondly, that he had them some months; and lastly, that he had them a day or two. I shewed them to the prosecutor; he claimed them.</p>

I went into several public-houses and got very tipsey. I had twelve pounds with me. I changed a ten-pound note at a linen-draper's shop; I bought some linen; they gave me seven one-pound notes, and I had two more besides. I then went into the White Horse public-house; when I was there I fell asleep. I had nothing to drink for near three hours. When I awoke I called for a bottle of wine I had been sick, and dirted the room. I called for a bottle of wine to treat the company, to make apology. We had five bottles of wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these people that you treated your acquaintances - A. No, I never saw the men or the house before.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner. Can you recollect whether he was there - A. I am sure he was in company with me at that public-house. He did not sit so near me as some others did. I took my money out to pay for the wine. I do not know how much I paid. I know I changed two one-pound notes at that public-house. A man that sat at the side of me I felt him meddling at my pocket. I got up, and came out. I was very tipsey then. There were two or three men at the door that had been drinking with me. The went out a little before. There were three or four of them. They took me into a dark passage. I cannot say the prisoner was one of them that took me to that dark passage. It was a dark night, and a dark passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what the men did - A. I know they did not hurt me. They took my money from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive them take your money from you - A. No. A gentleman or lady gave me my pocket-book; there were no notes in it. I called out murder when they took me down there, and I called out for the watch, and when some persons came to my assistance the men were gone.</p>

             NEWTON. I live in Bethnal-green. On Thursday evening, the 22nd of April, between seven and eight o'clock, I went down Shoreditch, to a Mr. Shippens, a linen-draper there. I purchased a shawl and a piece of cotton for a gown, for which I paid fifteen shillings. I left the house, and went on to Webb-square; there I met the prisoner; she asked me to give her something to drink. I went to the sign of the Crown, in Webb-square; there we had some porter and liquor to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you intoxicated - A. I was as sober as I am now. I staid there till near ten o'clock. There was another woman in company which I know nothing of.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020013"/>Q. Had you known Wetherall before - A. I never saw her to my knowledge before, and by the time I was leaving the house I was the worse for liquor; I told the prisoner. I would give her a shilling if she would see me home.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married man - A. I am. I had the gown piece and shawl in my pocket. We went up Bethnal-green-road, as far as the turnpike, and at the turnpike she asked me for the shilling that I had promised her. I told her I was not at home; I had got to cross a field to go home. She refused going across the field, and left me. As soon as she went away I missed the gown piece, and the shawl. I did not go after her that night. The next day, about one o'clock, I went again to the house in Webb-square. I saw the prisoner and the other woman in the tap-room. I accused the prisoner of taking the parcel from me. She denied it. She said she saw it. I had it in my pocket when she left me. As I could not get any information from her I went home. On Thursday following I mentioned it to my wife and a young woman that lodges in my first floor. We all three went to the public-house in Webb-square. We mentioned the affair to the landlord; he sent for the prisoner. He said he knew if she had got it, he could get it; and when she came she was accused of it several times. She stedfastly denied it. I then left the house, and went to work.</p>
               <p>SUSANNAH JONES. On Thursday, the 29th of April, I went to the public-house with Newton and his wife to Webb-square. When Newton was gone, Mrs. Newton and me we knew she had got it by her countenance. She denied it a great many times. The landlord came into the room; she told the prisoner to give up the duplicates if she had them; he said he hoped it would be the better for her. She gave me two duplicates. I looked at them, and gave them into Mrs. Newton's hand. Mrs. Newton was angry with her husband; she said she would not be seen in it. I gave them to Mr. Newton when he came home.

            . I am a watchman in Whitecross-street. On the night of the 21st of May, I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor in conversation about a watch. I heard Syre say, you have got my watch. I said to the prisoner, give the gentleman his watch, and then go about your business. She said, what was I, I was no watchman. I told her, I was a watchman. I took hold of her arm, and said, she should go to the watchhouse, and then I will see whether you have got the watch or no. I had got hold of her arm in Chiswell-street; I felt something touch my hand. I catched hold of the watch; I cried out to Syre, I have got your watch; and when I came to the watchhouse I laid the watch on the table. The officer of the night took the watch.</p>

            . On the 21st of May I was officer of the night. The prisoner was brought to the watchhouse by the watchman. The prosecutor followed, and said, the prisoner had robbed him of his watch. The watchman laid the watch on the table; the prosecutor said it was his watch. The prisoner said he gave it her as a compliment. This is the watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my watch.</p>

On Saturday the 8th of April, in the evening, I had been at my pay-table; two of my mates and I came together as far as Shadwell; by this means I got intoxicated. I fell in with the prisoner; she stopped me in the street; I told her to be gone; I would have nothing to do with her. A woman unknown to me asked her what she stopped me for. I was very much in liquor. The prisoner shoved the woman off the pavement, and told her to go about her business. The prisoner followed me through Shadwell-market; I turned round, and told her to go about her business again. I had not walked far before I fell sick. I walked to <placeName id="t18130602-25-crimeloc142">Pope's-hill</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18130602-25-crimeloc142" type="placeName" value="Pope's-hill"/>

I was sick, and laid my head against the wall, and sat down upon the stones, and I fell asleep. I looked up in about ten minutes, when I saw the prisoner standing over me. I told her if she was not gone I would give her in charge of the watchman as soon as he came past. She said, I was very bad, and she wanted to take care of me. I threatened her with the watchman again. She went away. I never saw her after that. I fell in a sound sleep. I had my property when I fell asleep I am confident.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fall asleep on the ground - A. Yes, on Pope's-hill. I continued asleep from between ten and eleven o'clock until between three and four in the morning. When I awoke I found my property was gone, another man's and my own.</p>
               <p>Q. What property - A. A five pound note and two one's. They were in a pocket-book in my side pocket. From that I went home. I got home about five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was it from where you fell asleep to your home - A. About two minutes and a halfs walk from Shadwell-market to Ratcliffe-cross. As soon as I missed the property I went about to look who had got it. They took me to the officer, and Brown found the prisoner and the property.</p>

            . I am an officer of Shadwell office. Mr. Scott, the last witness, came to my house on Sunday morning; he told me he had lost his pocket-book and seven pounds I told him to be quiet, and I would find out the woman if he knew her. In coming from my house I saw him and a young woman with him, and two or three more shipwrights. The young woman said, she saw Mrs. Hicks with him, and by information I apprehended Mrs. Hicks in Ratcliffe-highway. I told her she must go with me; she was very unwilling to come. I told her if she was not the person I wanted she should come back, there was a person waiting to see her. When we reached the house where the prosecutor was waiting, the prisoner put her hand into her pocket, and pulled out these notes, and was making away to the fire with these papers. I made up to her, and caught these papers out of her hand. I said, you shall not destroy him. Then I took her into another room along with another woman. I called the prosecutor, and asked him whether he knew the woman. He pointed out the prisoner. I then searched her, and found a five pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Should you know the note that you lost if you were to see it again - A. No. I had two following numbers, five pound notes, from the bank. My master told me No. 5613 and 5614; the five-pound note and the other papers were altogether. I have never found the pocket-book. I believe that note to be mine; I will not swear to it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Saturday three weeks last I was going along Ratcliffe-highway; I saw the prosecutor and two women that he had with him; they walked into a house in Spring-street. I was going that way to Shakspeare's-walk. I was returning in about an hour afterwards; I saw the prosecutor and the same women again. When they saw me come up they bid him a good night, and went away. He took hold of me, and said he was very much intoxicated. I said he was a foolish man he did not go home; he said he had no home; he belonged to a ship called the Four Brothers, in Shadwell dock; the gate was locked; he could not get in to go on board of her, and while I was talking to him he dropped these papers. I picked them up, and gave them to him. He told me to take care of them for him till the morrow. He told me to come to him on board the ship the Four Brothers, and give them him; to ask for the carpenter. He had got some dirty linen I was to take home and wash for him. I never knew there was anything in these papers until the Sunday morning. I only saw the five pound note; I intended to take it to him on Sunday afternoon.</p>

On the 5th of May I found a bushel of black oats tied up in a sack, hid under a barn of mine. I wrote my name upon a piece of paper, and Mr. Hodge divided the paper into three pieces; I put it in the bag. The next morning I found the corn gone from the place where I had seen it. I then looked upon a cart loaded with hay; I saw it there.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner assist in loading this cart - A. No; the hay-binder generally loads the cart.</p>
               <p>Q.Who had the care of your corn - A. The corn was generally given to him once a week; six bushels on a Monday morning; but suspecting the corn was misapplied I gave out two bushels. On the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020015"/>Monday morning, preceeding this, and one on the Wednesday morning; and it was on Wednesday I found this under the barn; and on Thursday morning it was upon the cart, underneath the bottle truss of hay; it was the same sack, with the same quantity of corn. Our carman are not allowed to take any corn to town; they are allowed a bottle truss of hay, and no corn to take away with them. The cart set off to London under the carter's care alone. I followed him on foot at some distance, until I met Bishop, the officer, near the Bird-cage. I then returned. I value the bushel of oats at five shillings.</p>

            . I am an officer. I met the prisoner in Kingsland-road, towards Stamford-hill. The team was going to London; the prisoner was driving it alone. I followed the prisoner until he came to the Bird-cage, Stamford-hill, and there he stopped. The ostler came out; they had a little conversation together; one of the Newington coachmen came by, and spoke to the ostler. The prisoner went into the public-house with the ostler. I then went into the public-house and took the prisoner into custody. I examined the cart in the presence of the prisoner; at the top of the load of hay covered over with the bottle of hay and a tilt, was this corn in this sack; I asked the prisoner how it came there; he said he put it there; he had brought it for his horses, his master knew nothing about it. On searching the corn, I found Mr. Holbrook's name on three pieces of paper; putting the pieces of paper together it was visible.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I am a silversmith, 83, Whitechapel. These six forks were brought to me for sale, about six months ago; I asked the young man who they belonged to; he said from a gentleman in the City. I asked him why the gentleman did not bring them himself; he said he was confined in an office; he could not well get out. I told him I would rather see the owner of them. He left them, and promised to send the owner to me. The owner nor the young man never came. I believe the prisoner to be the man that brought them; he gave me the name of Emms, at a linen-drapers, in Cheapside; he gave me a number which turned out to be a linen drapers. I went to the number; they knew nothing of the name. These are the spoons; they are worth ten shillings a piece.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These spoons are my property.</p>

On the 21st of April, he came to me, he brought several articles, which I cannot charge my memory; and among the rest he brought some parasols and an umbrella; he sold them to me; I suspected him, and sent my lad after him. The lad lost him in Exeter-change; he came back and told me had lost the prisoner. I then found out his master, and sent to a relation of Mr. Fossick. In consequence of that Mr. Fossick waited upon me, he saw the parasols, and the umbrella; which he claimed. These are them. I am quite sure they were brought to me by the prisoner. I gave the prisoner eleven shillings a piece, for the parasols and for the umbrella 15 s. 6 s. The prisoner had been at my shop selling umbrellas. When he came with the three parasoand the umbrella I bought them, as Mr. Fossick wished to detect him.</p>

             OF WILTON. Q. Was the prisoner in your lordship's service - A. He had been for several years. In consequence of having missed bank notes for a very considerable time, a year and a half I believe, I was convinced that some person in the house was dishonest. Not wishing to make this known to my family that I suspected them, I wished to find out the best mode, who was the plunderer. On the 5th of April, I put four or five bank notes marked in a particular manner, with T. E. there was one two-pound, and three one-pound notes. I put them into a silk pocket-book, which I have here; and put this into a travelling-box, which I have always locked up. The-travelling box is here if it is necessary to be produced. I examined that box from the 5th of April, to the 25th, every morning, and locked the box again until I missed them; from that time to the 28th; I did not look into it. On the 28th I looked into the box again; I found one of the notes gone, that I had so marked, a one-pound note. In consequence of that I sent to Bow-street office; Adkins came to my house at ten o'clock the next morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Had any of your servants access to that box - A. No, never, by my permission.</p>

            . On the 29th of April, I went to Lord Wilton's house in Grovesnor-square. The male servants were all assembled in a room in his lordship's presence; it was announced to them, that they would be searched; as soon as the search was announced the prisoner left the room; he said he was very ill; I went out with him, and staid with him until he came into the room. I searched the butler first, and then the prisoner; I found in the prisoner's watch-pocket, a one-pound note. This is the one-pound note. I took a key from his pocket. He opened a closet in his room, in that closet I found another one-pound bank note in this pocket-book; and on the top shelf of the cupboard, I found these four skeleton-keys. I tried the large key to Lord Wilton's travelling-case, it locked it very easy.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. The two notes produced by Adkins have my mark on them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you give a bank post bill to your clerk - A. I was not present at the time.</p>

            . Q. Are you clerk to Messrs. Grant, Burby, and Company - A I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember in April, 1812, making up a parcel for London, containing bank notes - A. I know a parcel was made up the evening of April the 11th. I did not make up the parcel. The parcel was made up in my presence, by another clerk, a Mr. Barrs, who usually makes up the parcels.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there in that parcel a bank post bill of fifty pounds - A. I have no doubt it was. That bill passed through my hands for the purpose of being put into that parcel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hand that bill to Mr. Barrs, in order for him to put it in that parcel - A. I am not positive whether I handed it or the partner. It is generally handed by one from him or by me.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that bill - A. This is the bill that passed through my hands; here is my endorsement; it passed through my hands on the 11th of April, 1812, it was handed to me by the partner for the purpose of endorsing it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you see any body for Grant and Burby endorse that bill - A. I cannot say that I saw the gentleman, the partner, endorse it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is their endorsement on it - A. No, there is not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Was that bill in your possession on the 11th of April, in possession of the house of Grant and Company - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that bill endorsed by them to your knowledge - A. It has my writing on it, and I handed it to the gentleman, the partner. It has the writing of the firm of the house now.</p>
               <p>COURT. It has your writing on it - A It has. I have written,</p>
               <p>"pay Grant, Burby, and Company." That is my writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever endorse bills for Grant, Burby, and Company - A. No, I do not. I have not a procuration.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. When you wrote that upon that bill what did you do with it - A. I made it payable to the house of Ladbroke and Company. That is taken out by appearance now. They are always endorsed to Ladbroke and Company. I have no doubt it was upon that occasion.</p>
               <p>Q. Hold it up to the light, and see whether you can see that now - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say,</p>
               <p>"pay Grant, Burby, and Co." is your hand-writing - A. It is. I have signed no name. After that, them gentleman sign their names for the purpose of saving trouble. There is the endorsement of Mr.

               <p>Q. Have you got these books here - A. No. This is the hand-writing of a clerk in the office, who copied the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of some intelligence you received did you issue some advertisements in London - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. The number, 4780, is the hand-writing of a clerk of yours at Portsmouth - A. Yes. The number 4780 upon the bill is the hand-writing of Mr. Green, the clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw this bank post-bill either upon the 11th or 12th - A. I saw it in the custody of Grant and Co. upon the 11th.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, look upon it, and say whether you saw the number 4780, when you handed it over to the clerk - A. I have no doubt but I did. When I handed it over to the clerk I saw the number. I have examined it by the bill-book; it agrees in other respects, my name and Macklean.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Dismiss from your mind all considerations of the book, and attend to the question. Do you distinctly remember, independent of the book, that on the 11th of April last year, there went through your hands a fifty pounds bank bill without reference to your books - A. I cannot undertake to say so far as that.</p>
               <p>Q. I scarce need ask you, as you cannot recollect that a fifty pound bank bill went through your hands; whether, independent of your books, you have recollection of any number or date upon such a bank post bill - A. I remember that there was a fifty pound bank bill passed through my hands that day, certainly, by reference at the moment. I recollect that.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you now recollect that a fifty pound bank post bill passed through your hands except from reference to your books - A. I do not say that I can say as far as that.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you look at that bill, and tell me whether you find any writing of your own indicating that went through your hands on the 11th of April, 1812 - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, what do you find that indicates that it was in your hands that day - A. I find the words,</p>
               <p>"Grant, Burby, and Company, or order."</p>
               <p>COURT. Is it your practice to put that kind of constructive endorsement upon it the day before it is sent to London - A. Only on those days that we charge it to be sent to London.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Do you not very frequent upon bank post bills write</p>
               <p>"pay Grant, Burby, and Company, or order" - A. It has been done.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not often done it - A. Yes, it has been done.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020020"/>Q. Now, sir, will you shew me anything that indicates to be written upon the 11th of April, 1812 - The number being in our book.</p>
               <p>Q. You are to dismiss anything from your mind in your books, which we cannot take. You told me you found something in your own hand-writing in that bill. How do you know that was written in your hand in April last year. What is there in the entry,</p>
               <p>"pay Grant, Burby, and Company," which is written without any date, to enable you to say it was written on that day - A. The number of the bill in our book. I can trace it no other way.</p>
               <p>Q.Now, sir, what is there in this endorsement unconnected with your book at Portsmouth, that leads you to say it was done on April the 11th, 1812 - A. That being there.</p>
               <p>Q. You have written on other bills the same - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This endorsement is without date, except assisted by your books you cannot say, and which we cannot look at. I find that enables you to say it was written on that day - A. If the bill was put into my hands at this distance of time I could not without reference to the books.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lockhart. Q. You live with Grant, Burby, and Co. - A. I do, and have access to their books.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing you had gone away, and lived with any other merchant, and such bill had been put into your hand, could you have ventured to recollect it without reference to your books - A. No, I could not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. How soon after the 11th of April, was your particular attention called to the subject of a bank post bill - A. We had an account on the 13th, in the evening, of a bank post bill being missing on the following morning. I knew it at that time, my attention was turned to the circumstance of a bank post bill being missed. That bank post bill had passed through my hands on the preceding Saturday. I then recollected it by reference to the books, I recollected it.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time your attention was called to it - A. Yes, and I recollected that it had passed through my hands.</p>
               <p>COURT. Without the assistance of the book - A. Yes; I knew it was a fifty pound bank bill, because it came in on the Saturday, and I remembered how it was disposed of.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you remembered a bank post bill by something particular attending it coming into your house; was that the bank bill that you handed to Mr. Grant to endorse - A. Yes, certainly. I handed it to Mr. Grant for his signature; and my memory was particularly called to it on the Tuesday. I particularly remember the bank post bill passing through my hands. If that bill was put into my hands a month afterwards I could not say that without reference to the books.</p>

            . Q. Do you know the prisoners - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Brady - A. About two years latterly. I knew him some years previous.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Birkett - A. About two years or rather more.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not ask you particularly. You have been concerned with a great number of persons in robberies and forgeries - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. And I think you stated upon those occasions the number of offences such as I have described were so great that you cannot tell the number of them - A. I will not be bound to answer that question unless the Court commands.</p>
               <p>Q. Some time in April, 1812, did either of the prisoners make application to you - A. They did. Brady made application to me about the month of November, I should think. He told me that the Portsmouth mail had been robbed, and he thought he could procure me the property. The property afterwards was sent to my house.</p>
               <p>COURT. What was the expression - A. That the Portsmouth mail had been robbed; that he could procure me the property. He said, it consisted of a great number of half bank notes, among other property.</p>
               <p>Q. What other property did he describe - A. Bills of exchange, and halves of bank post bills, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any whole - A. I believe there was. I received a parcel containing a great quantity of property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how the mail had been robbed - A. He said the parcel had been stolen from the mail; he did not say by whom. I inferred by whom from the conversation.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Never mind what you inferred. In consequence of receiving this parcel did you see him again - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that paper, and see if you can remember that - A. There was a bank post bill, which I believe to be this bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Brady and you any conversation what should be done with that bill - A. We had. It was agreed that some of the property should be taken to James Cook. This bill I reserved myself, and took it to Birkett with other notes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was there any other bank post bill - A. Not that I know of, whole. I told him I should take the bill to Birkett, for Birkett to extract the endorsement.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any memory what the endorsement was that was to be extracted - A. I think it was Ladbroke and Company, and Grant, Burby, and Company. It was known to both of us that Birkett could extract these things. It was merely suggested at the time to shew it to Birkett, and to take his opinion on it, as to the endorsement whether it should be extracted or not. I should think that was the case, and what was proper to be done with it for the purpose of negotiation. I accordingly took it to Birkett, at his house, No, 1, Riley-street, Chelsea. I saw Birkett; he said he would extract it. I left it with him for that purpose; he afterwards produce the bill to me, with the endorsement extracted, some days afterwards, with the old endorsement taken out. This was at his own house in Riley-street. The old endorsement was taken out; I think a blank endorsement was substituted to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had made that - A. Birkett I should suppose. I did not see him do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020021"/>Q. By blank endorsement do you mean any name put on. By whom was it done - A. By Birkett, I should suppose. I did not see him do it; some name was put: I do not recollect it. There is another I believe on it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Look at the bill. What has been altered upon it - A. I can speak positively the name of Ladbroker is extracted, Grant and Burby remains.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not the original Grant and Burby - A. I think it is. I am not positive it is.</p>
               <p>Q. He delivered it into your hands, with the alterations he made upon it - A. He did. That alteration was such as it now appears. He told me he would pay 
               <persName id="t18130602-53-person395">Brady</persName>
             a consideration for the bill. He admitted he had altered the bill, and he had paid Brady twenty-five pounds for this bill; twenty-five or thirty pounds. I think it was twenty-five.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Brady upon that subject - A. They had one meeting at my house, in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was your house - A.Winterton-place, Chelsea.</p>
               <p>Q. Was anything said respecting this bill - A.There was a conversation ensued, but they did not come to any agreement at that time. Birkett told me afterwards that he had paid this.</p>
               <p>Q.Was this bill particularly named in this conversation - A. That bill and other property was named; they did not agree at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that bill ever again produced from Birkett - A. When it was produced to me with the alteration I delivered it again to Birkett, and accompanied Birkett to a person of the name of Stanley.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you and Birkett and Stanley meet - A. I think in St. James's park. It was delivered to Stanley with other notes by Birkett, for Stanley to negotiate that and other property.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any knowledge from Birkett what became of that bank post bill afterwards - A. Birkett informed me it was paid away.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you about this time frequent occasion to be in company with Birkett - A. I had. I met him sometimes at the Man in the Moon, King's-road, Chelsea, a house kept by a man of the name of Clark, I believe. I met him upon this and other business.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you heard from Birkett that this bank post bill had been parted with; tell me the whole he said - A. Birkett told me, in company with Stanley, the bill was paid away with other notes to a Mr. Miller, a silversmith, in Whitechapel, for foreign gold; doubloons and other gold coin.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lockhart. We have heard the character of you; have you been convicted before now and transported - A. I have.</p>

He gave his name, Captain Henry Hunter. He paid in Bank of England notes that were joined, and a fifty pound bank post bill among them. I objected to the bill at first. I said I would rather have a bank note; he said he had received it in a remittance from Liverpool among other notes; he had no doubt it was regular; upon which I examined the endorsements, and found they were regular, apparently. I afterwards in consequence of what passed took the bill; I looked at it very particular; that is the same bill; I paid it away with the other notes.</p>

               <p>Birkett's Defence. May it please your lordship, gentlemen of the jury, the charge for which I stand before you is such which precludes me any defence. It is a charge of enormity. It is only to be defended by my appealing to my maker, and solemnly to you that I am innocent.</p>
               <p>My lord, and gentlemen, this is not a charge of a robbery on a certain day, where I might prove my innocence. It is a charge of forgery, stated to be committed in April, a twelvemonth ago; were you gentlemen to be charged with forgeries of a twelvemonth ago, what could you say, you could only plead your innocence; what is to be expected from me, more than solemnly declaring before this court, that I am not guilty of any charge in this indictment, Gentlemen, the proof of guilt to any criminal must be established by the testimony of many persons, whose testimony cannot be doubted, before you are called upon to say whether I am guilty or not. Who is Richardson? Is he a man whose testimony cannot be doubted? He is a man who has been convicted at this bar; whose life has been forfeited a thousand times. This man tells you he brought the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020022"/>bank post bill to my house to get the signatures eradicated; he might as well say he took it to his lordship. It is from these circumstances my innocence must be drawn. The circumstances are, that Sunday the 12th, or 13th, of April, 1812, a robbery was committed on the Portsmouth mail, and bills of exchange, and bank post bills to the amount of two or three thousand pounds were obtained. Gentlemen, it is acknowledged by Richardson, that as soon as he was in possession of the property he immediately took the same to Cook, his accomplice, who has acknowledged in his deposition before the magistrate at Bow-street office, that he extracted the above endorsements out of all the bills, after they were so extracted they sent to the bankers for payment. Now, gentleman, is it to be credited that Cook and Richardson extracted the above endorsements out of all the bills the day they were stolen, and then to bring this one to my house. Gentlemen, if such testimony is to be credited in a court of justice and such a man as Richardson is to be believed whose life has been forfeited a hundred times, it is better for a man to turn an assassin for an act in this way, no man could be safe in his bed, but he would be liable the next morning he rises of being charged with a forgery. Gentleman, let me remind you of Lieutenant Johnson; he was a man who impeached two innocent lives in order to save his own. Gentlemen, guilt ought to be so clearly established that every by-stander could not entertain a doubt of it. My lord, and gentlemen, I put my case into your hands, and commit myself to your reflection.</p>
               <p>Brady's Defence. I know not why I am coupled with this man, any other man might be guilty; I know nothing of the robbery, therefore I can offer no defence.</p>

            . Q. Are you acquainted with the three prisoners at the bar - A. I am; I have known Badcock about a twelvementh, or rather more; Hill and 
               <persName id="t18130602-54-person418">Brady</persName>
             some years; two years latterly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Cook - A. I do; I have known him upwards of three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been engaged with these parties in various transactions - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of August last year was it agreed between you to do anything respecting any bankers in the City - A. It was in the middle of August we agreed to commit forgeries upon the house of Robarts, and other bankers.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the parties in that agreement - A. Brady, Badcock, Hill and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. For the purpose of concerting the mode had you various meetings - A. We had; we met at the Horn tavern, in Goodliman-street; and I think once at the Swan tavern, in Sloane-street; our principal place was at the Horn tavern.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you met at the Swan tavern in Sloane-street, do you remember what time of the day it was - A. I think it was in the morning part.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what refreshment you had - A. Some sandwiches, and sherry.</p>
               <p>Q. You say your principal place was the Horn tavern - A. It was. It was agreed that Cook should forge the drafts and Hill should obtain the copies: that he should obtain small drafts for the purpose of copying the hand writing to obtain genuine checks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards meet and receive from Hill any genuine checks - A. We did; that was about the middle of the month of August; I cannot state the precise day; it was at the Horn tavern, Doctor's-commons. They were delivered to Cook by Hill, in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hill tell you from whom he obtained them - A. No, he did not; I understood that he was acquainted with a man of the name of Parsons by report only.</p>
               <p>Q. You say they were delivered to Cook, what was Cook to do - A. Cook was to forge other checks from them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it understood further what was Hill to do in the business - A. It was understood that Hill was not to be present at all, at any future part of the business; not at the committing the forgeries, or at the uttering.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what he intended to do with himself - A. He did not tell me, but I understood he was to be out of town at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards receive back the three checks which you saw Hill give to him - A. I did, with other checks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the house of Robarts and receive the amount of these checks - A. I firmly believe I did; it was a day or two previous to the forgery being uttered; I went and received the amount of the genuine checks.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these, and tell me whether you believe these to be the checks - A. I believe these to be the checks.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. One dated 17th of August, 1812, Messrs. Robarts and Curtis, pay Messrs. Magnay and Pickering, nineteen pounds ten shillings, Priest Shrubb; another dated 12th of August on Robarts and Curtis, drawn by Walker, for six pounds; another 12th of August, nine pounds ten shillings, drawn for Burchall and Company; all three on Robarts and Curtis's house.</p>
               <p>Richardson. I think I received twenty-five pounds in notes, and part of it I think I received a twenty-pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Brady and you in two or three days after any arching anything, any intercharge with paper -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020023"/>A. I cannot recollect that; I met Brady afterwards, I do not recollect paying him any money.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you receive from Cook the forged checks - A. On Friday the 4th of September; I received from Cook, a number of forged drafts at his house, King's-road, Chelsea.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that one of the forged drafts that you so received of Cook - A. I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. After that did Cook and you come to the Horns tavern - A. Yes; I think Cook, myself, and Badcock, to the best of my recollection on the 4th.</p>
               <p>Q. What was agreed between you to be done - A. It was agreed that various forged drafts should be uttered, and we agreed to meet there the next day that is Saturday. On the morning of the 5th, I met Brady, Badcock, and Cook, at the Horn, we met together to consult about uttering these, and other notes; we had very little conversation on the subject, as it had been previously arranged, that Badcock and myself were to go with these drafts, and negotiate them; that had been settled at that, and other meetings. When we met that day, after we remained a short time in the coffee-room at the Horn, Brady and Cook parted; I understood they went to Moorgate coffee-house, as I was told. I accompanied Badcock to Milk-street. I had the forged draft when I went out of the Horn, and in my way I gave it to Badcock. Badcock delivered the forged draft to a porter in Milk-street; I suppose then I was about twenty yards from him. I followed the porter to the house of Robarts and Curtis; I went into the banking-house; I had some country note to change, payable at Robarts's.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the object of your going with the porter to the bankers - A. In case the check should be paid I was to come back and give notice to Badcock, who waited at a public-house in the neighbourhood; I think at the Bull's Head, in Bread-street. I saw the porter present the check at the compter, and receive the money. After having seen that, I returned to the public-house to Badcock, and told him the draft was paid; Badcock then went to Milk-street, and received the money of the porter, five hundred and ninety pounds. I was standing at the time he received it thirty or forty yards from him; after Badcock had received this of the porter Badcock and I joined in company, we went to the Bolt in Tun coffee-house, in Bouverie-street, and there we divided it; Badcock retained three fifth shares, and gave me two for myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were these three shares for - A. Hill, Brady, and himself; he gave me two shares for myself, and Cook.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you receive for your two fifths - A. I am not able to say.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was the whole sum you divided - A. I think three thousand eight hundred pounds; that was the produce of this day, and the day preceding.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of the evening did you part any of this you so received - A. I did, to a man of the name of Birkett, the man that stood at the bar just now; I let Birkett have eleven one hundred pound notes at the rate eighty pounds for an hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe in the course of the last winter you were taken up - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. When apprehended you disclosed this and other transactions - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe some years ago you were convicted here - A. Some years ago I was, sir; I think twelve years ago.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Pell. About twelve years ago you went from there to the hulks - A. Yes; I was sentenced for seven years. I staid there the whole seven years nearly; I served seven years, from the date of my sentence.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you on board the hulks - A. Nearly the whole of seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been concerned in transactions of this most infamous nature - A. I never kept any account; a bad action needs not to be recorded. I am not able to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Hill live when you first knew him - A. I first knew him in Newgate-market.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know whether at any time of his life he lived in Whitechapel, and kept a public-house - A. I have heard so.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Cook - A. That is a difficult question for me to answer, except in being engaged in these transactions; he has gained his livelyhood in an honest ways, and some in dishonest ways.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you give me the time you met Hill upon this business - A. I think towards the 20th. I do not know that I am correct; I only know by report that he was out of town.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that meeting on the 20th - A. I think at the Horn tavern. I was there about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a private-room - A. I do not know that we had the day that Hill was with us. I had about three meetings with Hill himself, and others; they were previous to the 20th of August.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present at the next meeting before the 20th of August - A. I think Cook only.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present at the first meeting - A. I think Brady, but I am not positive as to that. We had one meeting in addition at the Swan tavern, Sloane-street.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you told me you did not see Hill after the 20th of August - A. Not to my knowledge; I never saw him after that day, until I saw him here now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Badcock appear to know, or did you know the porter that was sent to Robarts - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hill know him - A. No, he was not present.</p>
               <p>Q. Then according to your opinion Hill obtained the checks as copies, from which the forgeries were to take place - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you learned from Hill that he was to obtain these checks from Parsons - A. I never learned it immediately from Hill; I heard it at the first meeting, at the Horn tavern; it was generally stated in conversation, and well understood by the whole of us; I cannot recollect who stated it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lockhart. Q. You have stated that you have been in the hulks a considerable time, and that you served your time out there - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You think you have atoned for your offence by serving your time out - A. No doubt, sir. I was discharged regularly.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020024"/>Q. Was there no intermediate time in which you got out of the hulks - A. I believe there was. I was only absent from it not many hours, a night and a day, not more. It was an attempt to escape, it failed. I was on shore, it might be twelve or fourteen hours, out of custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. to Mr. Fitzpatrick. What was the sentence of this man - A. To be transported for seven years; a Samuel Richardson, It of December, 41st year of his Majesty's reigh.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Newman. Were you jailer in the year 1801 - A. I know no person here that was in the jail in 1801; there was one in the debtor's side, he knows nothing about the matter.</p>

               <p>Q. By what means were you to be enabled to commit the forgery - A. By a draft that I understood was obtained by Hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at either of these meetings receive any draft from him - A. I am not certain, I think I received three from him. Richardson was present at the meeting, and Brady was there I think. I do not remember whether any other person was there at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these the three drafts so received - A. I think they are.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember meeting there the day the forged check was uttered - A. We did. I then met Richardson, Brady, and Badcock; this forgery was to be presented by Badcock; I left the Horn, and Brady and I went to the Moorgate coffee-house. Brady and me left the Horn, and left Richardson and Badcock.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see any of the party again - A. The same day, I saw Badcock, and Richardson.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on that day or the next day receive any produce of the draft - A. I received part of the five hundred and ninety pounds on that day, or the next day, my share. I received the fifth part of Richardson.</p>

               <p>Q. In the month of August last year did you see him in Whitechapel-market - A. I cannot exactly say the date of the day of the month. I cannot say whether it was in August or not. I have seen him in Whitechapel-market.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember having a check for any hay sold to Messrs. Magnay and Pickering - A. Yes, and also of Birchall and Company, of Old Ford. I believe these transactions took place in the month of August.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive upon these three transactions the three checks I put into your hand - A. Yes, two of them, one dated the 12th of August, and one the 17th.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Mr. Hill making applications to you for checks - A. He frequently used to give me change for checks, to save my trouble of going into the City.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he live at that time - A. He either did live at Newgate-market, or had just left it.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you identify these you had given to the prisoner - A. Upon my life, soul, and body, I cannot say that these are the checks that I gave to the prisoner Hill.</p>

               <p>Q. About that time did you receive three checks of Robarts and Curtis's banking-house - A. No, not myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Pell. You having a great variety of these small drafts in your possession; you have, as has been most convenient, given them to Mr. Hill, or to Mr. Nash, to cash for you - A. Yes. Mr. Hill and me had many transactions together. Mr. Hill lent me money; he lent me one hundred pounds; I paid him twenty-five pounds; I am indebted to him seventy-five pounds. As we sell the hay we receive the checks of the buyers.</p>
               <p>Q. And you are in the habit of giving these drafts to such persons as are going into the city, or that you have a good opinion of, to get cash for you - A. Yes. Sometimes I receive ten or a dozen in a day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did Hill apply to you or you to him A. Sometimes he would say to me, have you got any business in the City? I would say in reply, I have got a check or two. I never applied to him, nor he to me.</p>

Yes, I do; Badcock, he was the person that sent me; he asked me if I knew Robarts, Curtis, and Company, Lombard-street; I told him, yes. He said he wanted me to go with that check, and to bring him the money for it. He gave me a check for five hundred and ninety pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe that to be the check that he gave you - A. I think it is. I was to bring the money to the same place where he stood. I was to bring the money back to Milk-street. I took the check to Messrs. Robarts and Curtis's; I received five one-hundred pound notes, a forty pound and a fifty pound. When I came he was waiting at Mrs. Williams's door. I gave Badcock the notes; I had a shilling paid me for my trouble.</p>

He came on the 27th of August; he staid with me three weeks in the name of Mr. Smith. He was dropsical or rheumatick; he came in ill health for the purpose of using the bath. He appeared to me to be very ill; his legs were swelled, and he frequently kept his bed.</p>

               <p>Badcock's Defence. I can say no more than I am innocent.</p>
               <p>Brady's Defence. Respecting the twenty pound note that Mr. Partridge says he received of me, I purchased five hundred pound stock. I knew Mr. Partridge, and he knew me. I had five hundred and fifty pound standing at that time in the name of Hazard. Is it reasonable to suppose that I had the most distant idea that was part a forgery? and to part with it where I was likely to be criminated for it: had I known how it was obtained, can it he supposed that I would have gone to the stockbroker where I was known. The name of Swan, Manchester, I told him in the street; as for Suffolk-street I am not acquainted with: I only did it for a family motive; and how I came possessed of the twenty pound note I cannot say. I was in the habit of receiving and paying a great deal of money. The name of

            . I am a police officer. On the 1st of May I was sent by Mr. Blanshard to take the prisoner into custody. In his apartment I found three or four hundred weight of type, and about a coach load of paper, printed and unprinted. I brought the paper to the office, and shewed it to the prisoner. He said he took them at a sheet at a time; he considered them as perquisites.</p>
               <p>Q. How many sheets are there - A. As many as would fill a coach.</p>
               <p>Mr. Blanahard. This is part of the paper I took from the prisoner's apartment. These are books which are printed by our society for the use of the society, which nobody does but ourselves.</p>
               <p>Q. How many reams of paper are there - A. About ten or twelve reams.</p>
               <p>MR. FIGGENS. I have examined the type; I cast it for that printing office. The type is what we call Three nick; the face is No. 4, English. I never cast No. 4 upon this body for any other than the Methodist society.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. These types I bought at sales. I had a license to be a master printer in the year 1801.</p>

               <p>Q. On Tuesday morning did you go into the back drawing-room - A. I did, a little after seven. I was the first that came down stairs. When I went into the back drawing-room I found the window nearest the Bow window open; the Venetian blinds were half down, and the sash quite up. There is some leads underneath that window; I there saw one of these ink stands and a gold cup tied up in a pocket handkerchief. I afterwards examined that room; I saw the drawers open, and the papers about the floor. I went into the adjoining-room; the cabinet was open, and all the boxes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether the contents of the cabinet and boxes were gone - A. No, sir. I then went and communicated it to the man servant.</p>

            . I am porter to the Marchioness. On Tuesday morning I was called by the last witness; I went first into the anti-chamber, and then into the front drawing-room. Nothing was broken open in the front drawing-room. This was a little after seven o'clock. I then went into the back drawing-room; I found the cabinet broken open, the table drawer, and some boxes that were in the room were broken open. There were papers about the room. There were things gone out of the cabinet and drawer.</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. to Marchioness. Was it in this cabinet and drawer that you kept your valuable things - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. 
               <persName id="t18130602-58-person477">Pooley, Q.</persName>
             to Brian. Did you look out of the window of the back drawing-room - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It adjoins the bow - A. Yes. There are leads under that window, the back drawing-room. That window was open. On the leads was a bundle tied up. I went down to it; there I found a bundle containing two ink stands, and on the top of the bundle some small ornaments of silver. I found a gold cup quite in the corner of the leads, under the window. It was pressed quite flat to make it portable.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020028"/>Q. The ink-stands and cup you found there were the Marchioness's, I suppose - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how the persons got in the window - A. Apparently by what I saw by a frame tied to the rails, and a lamp-lighter's ladder; the frame was used, and the ladder; the ladder upon the frame. That frame had been there perhaps for years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards procure the ladder which the lamp-lighter used to use - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the ladder long enough to have got in the window without the frame - A. No; so it appeared by the tying of the frame.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found the frame that morning was it tied - A. It was tied to the rails in three place.</p>
               <p>COURT. What rails - A. At the back part of the house. That old window frame had been brought from the lumber-room, and fastened there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Did you see where the ladder was found the next morning - A. No; I did not see the ladder found. On my going up the area steps on the landing-place the lamp-lighter came; he asked me if there had been anything the matter. I said, yes. He said, because I found my ladder there this morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went into the room how was the door between that and the stair-case - A. That door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the back drawing-room door fastened - A. I cannot tell. I did not go there last at night.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hazard. How was the back drawing-room door at night - A. It was shut, but not locked. I shut it a quarter before one; the time that the Marchioness went to rest. I shut both the doors, but not locked them; I am sure of it. I shut the back drawing-room door, and the front drawing-room door.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how the anti-room door was that night - A. I shut it at the same time. I think I was the last person up.</p>
               <p>EDWARD BIGNELL. I am a lamp-lighter; I light the lamps for the Marchioness of Downshire; I fasten my ladder behind the rails of the stable wall with a padlock and a chain. It was a strong chain, like a brewer's chain.</p>

               <p>Q. On the night of the 29th of March, do you recollect fastening your ladder there - A. I did, about six o'clock in the evening. In the middle of the night, about two o'clock, I go about for the purpose of re-lighting the lamps, and when I went to relight the lamps, the ladder and the chain were gone. I found the ladder about eight o'clock; it was standing upon the area steps of the Marchioness, inside of the rails.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know Richardson - A. Well, sir. I met him on the evening of the 6th of April, between nine and ten o'clock, in Little Earl-street, Seven Dials.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Richardson see you - A. By his actions it appeared he did; by his turning down a street, and then running. He slipped off two great coats in running. I came up to him, and apprehended him in Little White Lion-street. I secured him. He asked me what I wanted. I told him not to talk to me in that way. He appeared as if he did not know me. He said, Mr. Beckitt, I shall be hanged. I took him into a back-room of a public-house, and searched him. I took from his person five hundred and twenty-three pounds in bank notes. He then asked me to get him a coat. He had not a coat or hat. I sent for a coach, put him in, and then he offered me the money to let him go. He said, I might keep the money for my own use, provided I would let him go out of the coach. In about ten minutes after that, in our way to the House of Correction, he acknowledged to me of robbing the Marchioness of Downshire; that he had been very lucky in respect of robbing the Marchioness of Downshire of a large property; he said he was one of the party that was concerned in it. I then declined having any further conversation until we got to the House of Correction. I then took him into the office in the Governor's house, to the Governor, and there I believe he made a confession to the Governor of the robbery. After that, me and the Governor and Richardson went to

            . I am the Governor of the House of Correction. I know Richardson. On the 6th of April, Richardson was brought to the House of Correction by Beckett, one of my turnkeys; Beckett brought Richardson immediately into my office. I said to Richardson, I was very glad to see him back again; Beckett said he had taken a great deal of money from him; I said whatever you have taken. I said let me take an accompt down before Richardson; I then said to Richardson, from the manner in which the Marchioness's house had been broken open I had no doubt he was one concerned in it; he sat about a minute, and then he said, sir, I will not tell you an untruth; he said, I was concerned, and his part he sold to Simons's, meaning Simons and his wife, as I understood.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew the Simons's, did not you - A. Yes. I asked him if he could give me information where I could find Simons; I meaned the father and son; he told me he could not tell me where they were at that time. I then asked him if he thought there was any chance of recovering any part of the property; he told me there were two rings, which he had given to a Mrs. Joseph, and that I might recover them again, for he was certain that she had got them; he then told me that old Simons and young Simons had lodged at Joseph's house, and by going to Joseph's house, I was likely to find some of the valuable boxes that had been stolen; he had seen them in a drawer in a bureau in a room in which the father and son had lodged; in a chest of drawers I believe; I am not certain whether he said in a chest of drawers, or a bureau; he then said that Joseph could give me the information where to find old Simons. I asked him the name of the street in which Joseph lived; he said he did not know the name of the street, nor the number of the house, but if I thought proper to take him in a coach he would take me to the place; I sent for a coach. I went with Richardson,

               <p>Q. Before you got to Joseph's house was anything said by Richardson to you, how he came by the five hundred pounds in notes - A. I omitted that in taking down the number of the notes, I asked Richardson if that was the produce of what he had stolen from the Marchioness of Downshire; he said part of it was, about three hundred pounds. Richardson took me to a house in Chandler-street, No. 13, he told me the house door would be open; I found it was, that Joseph had a shop and parlour. Richardson said, you had better knock at the door, and when Joseph comes, say it is Joe; Richardson's name is Joseph; I understood he meant the shop door; I did so. Joseph came and asked who is there; I said Joe. He opened the door, and when he found there was more than one, he then attempted to shut the door again; however I bursted it open again and got in; Joseph and his wife slept in the back parlour; they were both undressed; it was near twelve o'clock. I said to Joseph, do not make any resistance, it is of no use; I want two rings of your wife; Joseph said have you got two rings, give them to the gentlemen if you have got them; Wheeler then brought a light; I then said to Mrs. Joseph, I want two diamond rings of you, which have been stolen from the Marchioness of Downshire; she said she had got no rings, nor had she had any. Richardson then went up to her, and said you had better give them up, because you know I gave them to you. She positively denied knowing anything about it. We then proceeded to search the two rooms belonging to Joseph below, and found nothing. I then went upstairs to the second floor where Richardson, understood, had lodged. Richardson had described old Simons and young Simons had lodged there; I saw the drawer that Richardson had named to me, and found nothing. I came down stairs; I then told Joseph and his wife, that unless they gave up the rings I should take them in custody; said that she had not got them I took Joseph of oneside, I said do you know where old Simons lodges to night; he said he did not know. I told him I should take him to the House of Correction, and I should leave his wife at home with Wheeler; We got into the coach, and went to the

               <p>Q. Did you there find old Simons and Frankil in bed together - A. We did. I assisted in taking them. I took these keys from them. One of these keys upon the ring applied to the tea-caddy. We asked Simons if the tea-caddy belonged to him; he said it did not. I then went to the windows to see if they were secure in the inside. I found they were. The prisoners then were taken to Bow-street. I locked the door, and put the key in my pocket. My brother went with the prisoners to the house of Correction, leaving Frankil. I waited until he returned, and when he returned we went back to Seymour-court. As soon as we got there we searched the room. I found that box under the bed, at the head of the bed, under that side of the bed upon which Frankil was laying. They were both laying in the same bed. All the things that I found have been in my custody or my brother's.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020031"/>Q. How had the thieves got in - A. By a ladder at the back window. There is an area, and there are pallisades, and a sash was tied with three strings to the pallisades. The ladder was put on the top of the sash. There were the marks of the sash upon the ladder. In the evening I got the ladder, and the ladder reached the window within four or five inches; any person so disposed, by the assistance of the sash and the ladder, might very easily get in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, what was the appearance of the room where you supposed they had been in - A. The first room I went into was the anti-room. As soon as I went in I observed a kind of a writing desk with a drawer for paper and pens; it appeared to have been cut by a knife, and to have been wrenched open. Upon this writing-desk I observed drops of a wax candle. Upon the floor I found the knife which is in that trunk; a clasp knife. This is the knife. I then went into the back drawing-room where they had entered. I found there the cabinet broken open, boxes broken open, paper and every thing throwed about the floor. I found an iron crow upon the floor and a small centre-bit, and a piece or two of dirty candle. In different parts of the room I found some spots occasioned by the droppings of a wax candle. I then went into the bow-room; I found that room in the same state; the sash was up. That is all I know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. In searching old Simons did you find any money upon him - A. Fourteen pounds, sir. In the box under the bed was an hundred pound bank note.</p>
               <p>Q. And how many guineas did you find also - A. Seventy-nine guineas, and two half-guineas.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember your mother-in-law shewing you anything there - A. Yes, she shewed me some diamonds.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she shew you any diamonds like tops of pins, in gold - A. Yes, and a large cross set about in pearls, and a diamond; the pearls were large; that was all that she shewed me that time; she wished to know the value of them; I and Levi went to Benjamin to get them valued; I shewed him the diamonds; Benjamin said, they were worth two hundred pounds. I went back and saw Mrs. Simons; upon my return, Levi asked her what she asked for them; she said there are more at home, and she would sell them together. Mrs. Simons went home then, and left the diamonds with my wife, who is her daughter. About seven o'clock Mrs. Simons came with her son James, they produced a great many gold things; Mrs. Simons had some in an handkerchief; this box was shewed by Mrs. Simons; the musical-box was among them, and the watch; I cannot exactly say to the seals; I believe the seals before me may be the seals; I do not speak positively to them.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you afterwards send them things that you had of Mrs. Simons - A. They were at home; Mrs. Levy had them.</p>
               <p>COURT. You delivered all you had of Mrs. Simons, or of James, to Levi - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did not she say, that she brought these - A. No, she did say it in that way; she said when Mr. Levi offered her the money, she could not take it until she had told her husband, for fear she should do wrong.</p>

               <p>Richardson's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, a just sense of horror at my present awful situation, and being unwilling to attempt to justify my conduct, I plead guilty; which guilt originated in the dangerous acquiescence of most dishonest practices. Pardon my presumption; having only attained my twenty-six years, bred to a stonemason. I cannot be supposed to have transgressed the laws of my country, to that extent as I humbly acknowledge to be the case without wicked advice, by characters whose chief dependance were to trace the steps upon various mansions, for advising me, and other unfortunate persons like myself, to rob and plunder every thing to themselves, they acquiring the property; to such characters I have fallen a prey. I can assure you that my actions have never been that of a self-premeditated thief, and it is the only reparation I can make. Sorry I am to make my own condemnation, justice makes me do it; I never carried any offensive weapon about my person, and so far from doing violence on these occasions, upon the least noise or alarm sooner to risk violence I ran away rather than by violence endangering the lives of valuable subjects. I have too frequent fallen into and adopted the mode of systematical house-breaking. Mrs. Simons and her family, who are now indicted with me, they have been the chief persons that I have been connected with since my being in London three years, who have informed me what houses to break into, and when and what part the most valuable property was contained, which property I was obligated to sell to them at the sixteenth part of the value, and when I have so done there have been persons in the street to rob me of the same. My escape from Cold Bath-fields prison is too notorious, it is well known I escaped from there; when being moneyless I went to Mrs. Simons; Mrs. Simons then mentioned the robbing of the house of the noble Marchioness. I have pleaded guilty, and am therefore determined to tel of the Simons's family. They gave me instructions about the house; which after their giving me several times, they set me to rob the house, which I humbly beg pardon for the same. On my apprehension I acknowledged my guilt and contrition. I have been the chief instrument of restoring the property back again. Pardon me, my wife is only seventeen years of age, entirely without any protection by the recent loss of her father. I humbly implore your mercy; spare my life; I have transgressed in the extreme, yet as I have endeavered to discover the present robbery and to restore all the property in my power, I humbly hope you will save my life. Banish me wherever you please; I implore mercy, for which I and my family will for ever pray.</p>

               <p>COURT. What day of the month was it the prisoner came - A. It might be two or three days before Burgoyne came.</p>
               <p>Q. How long afterwards was it that Burgoyne called upon you - A. About two or three days; I then saw the bill in the hands of Burgoyne; that was on the 5th; when Mr. Burgoyne brought it it was payable at the house of Stevens, Rimington, and Smith, that had been added since the prisoner took it away. Mr. Burgoyne brought it in the state it now is. I discounted the bill for Mr. Burgoyne; he said he brought it for Ennis; I gave him the cash for it, and discounted it in the regular way.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave Burgoyne the money - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a surgeon; I am a native of Ireland. I came here to improve myself in my profession.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you known the prisoner in Ireland - A. I knew him about two or three years ago, a clerk in the mail-coach office in Dublin.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of February, or beginning of March last, did you meet him in Long-lane - A. He called on me the day before I went with the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the 4th of March - A. Yes. I was not at home; he left a note at my lodgings; in consequence of that note I called at his lodgings, agreeable to the desire of the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was his lodging - A. No. 68, Long-lane, Smithfield. He asked me to take a walk out with him; he told me he had a bill of the Lord Mayor of London, for an hundred pounds; he said he had called a few days before with the bill at Messrs. Gill and Thomas to get the bill discounted, at the time he called there was only George Scholey and Company on the bill; they told him if he would get the bill made payable at a banking-house, they would discount it for him; he told me he was ill that day, he could not go back according to his promise. He then shewed me the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that he produced the bill was it in the words "payable at Stevens, Rimington, and Company" - A. Yes, it was; he asked me to go with him to Gill and Thomas's to get it discounted.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and he go into any house together - A. Yes. I observed the bill was not endorsed by him, the prisoner; I told him if he would endorse the bill I would go; upon that he and I went into a public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he there endorse the bill in your presence - A. He did; P. Ennis.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the house in which he wrote the endorsement - A. Some place near Moorfields. After he had so written that, he gave the bill to me to go to Gill and Thomas.</p>
               <p>Q. How near to Gill and Thomas did he go with you - A. He went with me nearly opposite of the house, and shewed me the house, he told me he would stop there until I came out again; I went there; they discounted the bill for me; I received one hundred pounds by the discount. Having received it I came to the place where I had left the prisoner. I did not find him there. I walked about nearly half an hour to find him; not finding him, I went to his lodgings in Long-lane, and gave the money to his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see the prisoner - A. I did not see him for three or for days I think; he told me that he had received the money of his wife, and that he had been robbed of it.</p>
               <p>Q. He had been to a house of a certain description and got robbed of it - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In consequence of my expectation to put off my trial I am not able to bring any person to speak in my behalf; I am now without any witness to come forward to prove that I am not the person, nor did I offer it with intention to defraud Messrs. Gill and Thomas. I went to Bartholomew coffee-house; I knew a number of Dublin gentlemen frequented there, and as I was sitting there I was telling some gentlemen my situation, and shewing them some letters that they might know who I was. One of the gentlemen asked me was I distressed. I said I was. He then asked me could I get a bill discounted. He said, if I could get a bill discounted, he would give me an hundred pound. He walked with me as far as Bartholomew's hospital; he gave me this bill. I went to a gentleman in Copthall-court; he could not discount the bill. I applied to Gill and Thomas. They told me if I got the bill made payable at a bankers they would discount it. I went to Bartholomew coffee-house, left the bill for the gentleman, and a note with it. On the next day I received the bill as it is now; and after receiving the money for the bill I went at nine o'clock to Bartholomew coffee-house; three gentlemen came in. I walked out with them to Blackfriars-road; they made me intoxicated. They sent four men after me, who robbed me of my watch and my coat; the produce of this bill was in my inside coat pocket. I have no doubt it was these men that gave me the bill that robbed me of the money. Mr. Mathers, if he is in court, he can say that I never acted in a dishonorable way.</p>

            . At the time this watch was taken from me I lived with my father at No. 3, in the City chambers, Bishopsgate-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose a watch on the 12th of March - A. Yes, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon the watch was in my fob.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you missed it did you perceive it safe about your person - A. About an hour. I was in a crowd in <placeName id="t18130602-60-crimeloc320">the Minories</placeName>

               <p>Q. While you were standing looking at the fire can you tell me whether you saw the three prisoners about there - A. No. I felt a great crowd; they were pushing about me very hard, just before I missed my watch. While I was in the crowd I found my waistcoat lifted up; I missed my watch. That was just after I felt the pressure about me. It was a gold watch, worth about four pounds; a gold seal attached to a ribbon; the seal was worth a pound; the key was a metal key.</p>
               <p>Q.How long after your perceived your watch missing was it before you saw either of the prisoners - A. About half an hour. I seized Phillips and Dalton myself, in consequence of information. When I had taken these men many cried, take this man and all, and then Levy was laid hold of. They were searched at the time; the watch has not been found.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of the men say anything to you when you laid hold of them - A. Phillips said he would knock me down, and dared me to take hold of him. Dalton said, mind you do not get in the wrong. That is all I know.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. I work for Mr. Moggeridge; I live in Bethnal-green. On the 12th of March I was at the fire; it was at the back of the Minories; the name of the place I do not know. I saw these three prisoners, and two more; they appeared to be in company, and acting together; all the five were near Mr. Burton. I saw Phillips take Mr. Burton's watch; then Phillips and Dalton went away, leaving Levy behind and the other two in the crowd. I informed Mr. Burton what I had seen. I afterwards saw Mr. Burton lay hold of Phillips and Dalton; I had pointed them out to him. Another man brought Levy to the office in Lambeth-street. I am quite sure Levy was one of the five. I had seen them all there about half an hour before they robbed Mr. Burton. I cannot be mistaken in their persons; after I saw the watch in Phillips's possession. I never saw how it was disposed of.</p>

            . I am a master-cooper in Seething-lane. The fire took place at a gun manufacturers in the city of London, near Glass-house-yard, Minories. I had been at the fire about an hour. I was informed that a gentleman had been robbed of his watch; I instantly went to the place where Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020038"/>Burton had got hold of Phillips and Dalton, in the crowd. I said, I was an officer. Mr. Burton gave them me in charge. They neither of them said any thing. Levy was brought to the office soon after I got there. The watch has never been found.</p>
               <p>Phillips's Defence. I was coming along the Minories; the fire attracted my attention. I was not two minutes at the fire before I was charged with taking this watch. I am innocent of the charge.</p>
               <p>Dalton's Defence. When Mr. Burton accused me I told him he accused the wrong man. I never saw the watch. I never knew either of the prisoners in my life.</p>
               <p>Levy's Defence. I was at home at my mother's at dinner; there was an alarm came that there was a fire in Rosemary-lane; my mother said, for God's sake go and look whether it is near your sister. She lived in Rosemary-lane. I stopped and looked at the fire. Some of the persons said I had a suspicious look, having a yellow handkerchief on. I was taken to the office.</p>

My husband does not rent the whole house; he has two rooms on the second floor; Mr. Eaton the landlord sleeps in one room in the house. About half past five on the 17th of May my husband got up to his work; it was quite light then; he missed a one pound note, a dollar, a shilling and an eighteen-penny token and five small keys.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen any thing before you missed them - A. On the Sunday night at eleven o'clock the money was in a tea-caddy standing on a table in the room, and the keys were on the table; the tea-caddy was not locked. When my husband got up he went into the sitting room and missed the money.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to bed do you know whether the door was locked or not - A. Yes, it was locked; I had the key by the side of the bed.

We did not find the room in the same order as when we went to bed.</p>

            . I am a constable. About half after five on Monday morning I was sent for; I went to one Edwards, a milkman. I found the prisoner in Edward's room, in a court in Bride-lane. I took him in custody. I searched him, and found a one pound note upon him, a dollar, and an eighteen-penny piece, and a shilling. Edwards had taken the keys from him thirty-nine keys, and there was five keys that were afterwards owned by Mrs. Ray. The prisoner said he had no money in his pocket but what was his own. I told him I should search him, and if the alderman thought proper to return him the money upon the examination I should have no objection, and when I took him before the alderman the money was returned to him. I did not see Mrs. Ray until the next day. After I had heard that Mrs. Ray had been robbed I tried all the keys to the boxes in her apartment; they opened the boxes; and this key opened the door. These are the five keys that opened Mrs. Ray's boxes.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. They are my keys. One of these keys I have had ten years. I cannot swear to the one pound note: I lost a one pound note.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There is many keys like that; the rest of the keys and the money I found them altogether in a bag; they laid in the street; why not another man throw them away, and I am charged with the robbery.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any lodgers - A. Samuel Berry; he was in the house at the time I found the prisoner in in the house. I returned and came in doors about twenty minutes past five; I heard somebody up stairs; I thought it had been my wife. I occupy the ground floor and the first pair of stairs. I heard the noise on the first pair of stairs; I supposed it was my wife. I am positive I latched the door when I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you leave the room door on the first pair of stairs when you went out - A. I shut it on a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020039"/>spring lock. That is my bed room. I am sure I shut it when I went out I left my wife in bed; the bed room door lock caught.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard a noise up stairs - A. Yes; I called my wife twice, and went up upon the second or third stair. I saw the prisoner coming from my bedroom towards the second pair of stairs. I went up to my bed-room door; I saw the door was open. I looked in the room; my wife was out. I saw the drawers open, and the clothes laid on the table. On seeing the clothes out I went up stairs after the prisoner; I saw him upon the second landing; he was looking to see if I saw him. I went up to him, and asked him who he wanted; he said he was looking for a person of the name of Robertson living there. I had no such person living there. I seized him by the collar, and asked him if he pleased to walk down with me. I took him into my own bed-room, and asked him how he opened the door. He wished me to let him go, and said he was a poor person, just come out of the country; it was distress that induced him to do this. I asked him how he could think of my letting him go, when he had got all my money. He said he would give me all the money he took to let him go. I asked him to hand the money out. and let me see what it was; he took out of his pocket a three-shilling piece, an eighteen-penny piece, three silver tea-spoons, and a pair of ear-rings. These tea-spoons were kept in my wife's trunk, and the three-shilling and eighteen-penny piece were put by for a keep-sake. When he gave me the money I told him he must have more silver of mine. He said he had no more about him. I clapped my hand upon his thigh; I said, you have more money. He said, that was his own; I should not have it. His waistcoat pocket was full of keys. I then said, what a pretty fellow you are to ask me to let you go; you will come before night and take all I have got. I called Berry; he went for a constable, and the constable came and secured him.</p>

            . What time did you leave your bed-room - A. A little before five. I locked my door before I went out; I left the key on the shelf, down stairs. The prisoner was taken away before I returned. My husband found the key on the shelf, where I had left it. There were thirty-nine keys found on the prisoner; one of them opened my door. I tried it, and locked and unlocked it three times.</p>

               <p>Q. to Mr. Blanshard. What does that paper consist of - A. In the first place, here is the history of Henry earl of Westmoreland, and here is a copy of the duodecimo hymn-book which we use; it is a gathered copy ready for the binder. Here is some sheets of a commentary of the bible; the rest consists of unprinted paper, and chiefly whole quires; altogether it is worth twenty shillings.

            , and where - A. On the 27th of April she was brought to Pancras parochial infirmary; she was brought in a senseless state. She had fits at the time until the 2nd when she died. On the day following I examined the body and the brain. There were no external marks of violence whatever on the body, except a small wound on the arm and a black eye.</p>
               <p>Q. The blow on the arm could not be the cause of her death - A. By no means. On the brain was an extensive inflammation, the blood vessels being considerably extended, besides which there was an organic disease, a kind of cheesey substance on the brain. The deceased had been subject to fits for four years past. She was a patient at the hospital for four months, in the house. I understood from herself that she had been subject to fits for four<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020040"/>years; I cannot take upon me to say what was the cause of this inflamation.</p>
               <p>Q. Did there appear any external marks upon the deceased that could accellerate that disease - A. I think not; it could accellerate it in some measure.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing you discovered in the body after it was opened that could lead you to discover what was the cause of her death - A. I suppose the organic disease would ultimately kill her.</p>
               <p>Q. That disease could have nothing to do with the blows that she had received - A. No, it could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it possible for you to say whether any of the blows that was the cause of her death - A.No, the greater probability was that she met with her death through that disease.</p>

               <p>Q. From this connection that subsisted between you, you received mutual accommodation - A. In the first instance, we certainly did.</p>
               <p>Q. The custom was that you accepted the bills, Mr. Nash discounted the bills at the Bank always, and a great many bills of the same description as these have been paid - A. A great many; never one dishonoured but these I think, from the latter end of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020041"/>the year 1807, or the beginning of 1808, to the present time.</p>
               <p>Q. The circumstance that occasioned the dishonor was the sudden stopping of payment - A. I thought it was best to stop.</p>
               <p>Q. This bill was not paid owing to your sudden stopping of payment - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day - A. I believe, I proposed it on the 19th of April: there was no bill due until afterwards. I think the first bill was not due till the Wednesday; I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. By your stopping payment the prisoner was suddenly called upon for payment of these bills - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say at the time that you stopped payment you knew that you and the prisoner were not insolvent - A. I knew I was, and I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your stopping payment there was an arrangement made - A. There was an arrangement made with the Bank. I was not there; my trustees went to the Bank. I put my affairs into the hands of Mr. Warner.</p>
               <p>Q. Nash put his affairs into the hands of Mr. Kemble, the tea broker - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the least idea that the prisoner had the least idea of defrauding you, or the Bank - A. Not the least; I always believed him to be a safe man, a respectable and worthy man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. Who provided the money for the bills - A Mr. Nash, generally; if he was short I provided a part.</p>
               <p>Q. To bills that became dishonored, it becomes necessary to make proposals to the Bank - A. Yes.</p>

I have a wife and four infants, wholly dependant on me.</p>

            . I live at the King's-mews-gate, Castle street. I am a dealer in foreign linen; the prisoner came to my house and asked me if I wanted to buy any rich furniture, he produced three curtains, the outside rich damask, the inside rich sarsenet, and the border blue velvet; I asked him how he came by these curtains, I had suspicion they were not his own; he said he was a carpenter by trade, and he was in good circumstances. I said where these curtains were, there must be more; he said his wife had got the remainder of the curtains, he had got a bad woman for his wife, he had parted with her; he said I had no occasion to have suspicion if I would go with him to Westminster, I should find he had a good character. I went with him to the corner of Charles-street, there is an oil shop, he went into the oil shop and stopped ten minutes; he came out again; he said the people that I want<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020043"/>to give you a character of me are not at home. I went into the oil shop. I happened to know the oil shop-man. I asked him if he knew the prisoner; he said he did not know him; I took him of oneside, and said the prisoner had brought me some furniture, I thought it was not his own. In the mean time the prisoner ran off. I went home and found the prisoner at my house; I said, what did you ran away for, I think the curtains do not belong to you. I sent for a constable; the prisoner ran out; my son ran after him, and caught him in the mews; I went for a constable, and he was taken before the magistrate at Queen-square office. The prisoner asked me two pounds for the curtains.</p>

On the 4th of May, past ten o'clock at night, I was coming out of my own house, and found the prisoner lay at my door. I shut the door, and very civilly desired him to go away. I was outside; the watchman was coming by at the time I was entreating him to go away. I desired the prisoner civilly to go away; he was very abusive; he was an entire stranger to me; he swore many oaths in the course of abuse; he appeared to me to be drunk; he struck me with his right hand over my left breast, in consequence of my desiring him to go away, with his fist.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a blow was it - A. A good smart blow on my collar bone; it drove me against the house; against the jam of the door. As soon as he had struck me he snatched at my watch and got three seals, a watch-key, and part of a steel chain. After he had got these he d - d my eyes, and said he would have my watch; with his arm he got me round the hips, while with his right hand he endeavoured to take my watch out of my pocket. The watchman was very near. When he endeavoured to get the watch out of my pocket I charged the watch with him. He held himself so fast by me I could not get myself disengaged from him until the watchman got hold of him, and then with his assistance I got into the house and got away from him.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the seals - A. I do not know. I never recovered them since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Had you ever seen the prisoner before - A.I never spoke a word before to him in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do not you know that he lives within two doors of you, perhaps six doors - A. I do not know that he lived in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. You had seen him before - A. Very possibly I might.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not give me possibly. Upon your oath had not you seen him - A. No. I was never in company with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you keep this house - A. I keep it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020044"/>Q. Was not Mrs. Rainbow lately indicted. Upon your oath have you known this man and repeatedly seen him - A. I may have seen him. I cannot swear that I have never seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. If you cannot swear that, my inference is that you have - A. I may have seen him. Yes, I have seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say a while ago that he was a total stranger; that is the answer I took down from my lord. Do not you know that he is a wheelwright, a very industrious mechanic - A. From what he said at the watchhouse. I never knew it.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there is a forty pound reward - A. I do not know it. I have heard it. I heard them talking about it in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mrs. Rainbow indicted for - A. For keeping a bawdy-house in the house that I live in.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not you indicted for the same sort of thing - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that man is a witness against Mrs. Rainbow - A. No. Yes, I know he is now.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard there is a forty pound reward, and this watch-chain and seals you have never seen - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not break the chain yourself, did you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What business is Mrs. Rainbow; what business is carried on at that house - A. A lodging-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many other people there besides the watchman - A. None but the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was it you that called the watch first, or the prisoner - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner ever been in the house with you - A. Never to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the prisoner in the house with you that night - A. I never saw him until I saw him at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Now tell me what the prisoner first said to you. When he knocked at the door did not he say that he came after a girl that he had been with - A. He never spoke to me until I spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was the watchman from you at that time - A. Just coming by the area rails when I first spoke to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. And so you want us to believe that this man offered you that violence; he knocked you down and held you round the waist while the watchman was so near - A. He did it.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance did you live from the watch-house that night - A. Near a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the door where you say this offence was committed - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find the seals - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear you do not know where they are - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What seals were they - A. A silver seal, two gilt seals; this part of the chain.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the man was searched or not - A. I do; nothing was found on him.</p>
               <p>Q. So at the next session your friend is to be tried at Clerkenwell - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Might you be one of her bail - A. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been taken up and called to give bail - A. Yes. No.</p>
               <p>PETER FLANNAGHAN. I am a watchman. I went round Suffolk-street on the night of the 4th of May, I was calling half past ten; I was called by Mr. Flentham. I was about twenty yards off; he called watch. I went up, and the prisoner had him across the thigh. When I came up Mr. Flentham desired me to take him away. I took him by the breast, and dragged him out upon the flags.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Flentham say when he desired you to take him - A. He desired me to take him away, that is all. When I got him on the flags he struck me with his fist; then I sprung my rattle. The prisoner appeared to me to be drunk. There was another watchman came to my assistance; we took him to the watchhouse. We searched him. I heard nothing of the seals until we got to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Flentham charge him with - A. Taking three seals and part of a watch-chain. That was at the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you took him from the flags did you search to see if there was any watch-chain - A. No; I knew nothing of any watch-chain; nothing was said until he was brought to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. So that when the prisoner had hold of Flentham all he said was, watch, take charge of this man -</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. The poor fellow was very drunk - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JURY. We are perfectly satisfied of the man's innocence.</p>
               <p>COURT. It is a scandalous prosecution.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I hope I shall have a copy of my indictment.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. I was in Kensington Gardens with Mr. Johnson; there was a great crowd close to the palace; I found somebody trying to pull my watch from my side. I said, good God, my watch is gone; before really it was gone; still the hand gave it a sudden jerk, and took it away, but I cannot say who it was. I saw all the prisoners there. I should not have recollected them, only I saw them pass several times. I saw a great many of them there, and I was astonished that mechanical persons should be suffered to be there on such an occasion. On Thursday I saw the prisoners again; they were brought up at Bow-street<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020045"/>office all three. I knew their countenances again as men whom I had seen and having been near to me, and near to the palace, and at this time I remember the faces of them all, having seen them on that Monday in Kensington Gardens; the prisoners were so near me they could have taken my watch; they brushed me. I cannot speak to any one taking my watch.</p>

I immediately told Johnson that I believed the person whose name is Wilson had got the watch. I saw all the three prisoners together. Wilson was close by Mrs. Johnson at the time.</p>

            . I am a city officer. On the 12th of April the Lord Mayor went to address the Princess Regent in Kensington Gardens. I saw the three prisoners in the Gardens, facing the princesses windows, near the palace. I saw the three prisoner's altogether, and knowing

             I watched him closely. I saw Wilson and Clark attempt several people's pockets. I saw Mrs. Johnson, and heard her say she had lost her watch. I was not close enough to see which of the prisoners it was that took the watch, and seeing Wilson leave Mrs.

             likewise to watch, as the prisoners were making away. I told Mr. Bacon I would thank him to give me some assistance, as there was a party of thieves, I suspected them to have a gold watch upon them, and several other articles. Westcoat and Hooker came with me; we overtook the prisoners just before they got out of Kensington Gardens, all three together. We searched them a little in the Gardens; we felt in their pockets, and found several handkerchiefs on Wilson, and then I told Wilson we had better take them to a place where we could search them strictly. We took them to the Nag's Head public-house, Knightsbridge; we searched Wilson first; we stripped him; in his breeches we found the gold watch.</p>
               <p>- WESTCOAT. I produce the watch; I found it on Wilson, and this handkerchief in his hat. I said to Wilson, there has been a lady robbed of a gold watch, do you know any thing of it; he said, I do not. I then said, I must take the liberty of searching you. I found this watch up in his breeches fob. He said he picked the watch up in the gardens. I told him it was the watch that I wanted. I searched Salmon; I found nothing upon him. I searched Clark; in his pocket I found this gold seal; he said it was his own; he had it a long time. I then asked him what was the cypher upon the seal; he said, H. The cypher is S C upon the seal.</p>

I then followed the prisoners across Kensington Gardens until they came to the Mount, never losing sight of them, where they made a halt some little time, and just as they were proceeding to go out of the gardens,

               <p>Q. On the 13th of May had you any parcel for mangling - A. Yes, of linen. It laid in the shop on the basket by itself; I saw it there at twelve. While I was cutting some bread and butter for my children's dinner a girl knocked at the door, and informed me that a man had taken my bundle away. I ran to the door, and saw the man with the bundle. I ran after him; he was stopped by somebody else. I saw the prisoner drop the bundle; a witness picked it up. I have got all the things safe in the bundle. The bundle contained all the things in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person that took the prisoner - A. A carter in the road.</p>

I then asked him to let me look at them; he ran; I sprang my rattle, and ran after him. He ran about an hundred yards; he tried to throw them over the area rails; he could not; the clothes dropped on the pavement. Atkins, another watchman, stopped him. We took him and the clothes to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>- ATKINS. I am a watchman. I took the prisoner after he had dropped the cloaths. When I took the prisoner, Green was running after him; he dropped the cloaths in Edward-street.</p>

               <p>MR. HEWITT. The prisoner was brought to the watchhouse on the 27th of April. Green gave me these clothes.</p>

            . Q. Do you know Conner - A. Yes, he lives in the same house that I do. On the night of the 27th of April, I was standing at the shop-door, I saw the prisoner walk up and down the court that night; the last time I saw him was about ten o'clock. He put his foot into the side door; I asked him what he wanted there; he asked me if our house was not No. 14. I said, yes. He then walked down the court.</p>

I did, sir; one of the notes I put in this pocketbook on the 15th of April and placed it on the mantle-piece, and left it there by accident, and went out the whole of the day; when I came home at night I did not go into the room not till the next morning. On Saturday morning I examined the book; the five-pound note was gone; upon missing the five-pound note I called my servant, and told her of it.</p>

In two or three days in the next week I found her lodging with a Mrs. Jacques, in Compton-street. I went there, and when she saw me she asked me what I wanted with her. I told her I knew she knew what I had lost, and that I had come to tell her that I believed she had taken it. She positively denied ever having seen it. Mrs. Jacques then came forward, and said that the prisoner had told her she had changed a five-pound note. The prisoner denied ever having told Mrs.

             any such thing, but on Mrs. Jacques persisting in it that the prisoner had so said, she said if I would excuse her she would tell the truth. I said I would make no condition with her, but I would wish to hear the truth. She then said she found it in the dust bin, but refused to tell me what she had done with it. She said, it is not thieving; you cannot hurt me. I told her I should take her before a magistrate.</p>

Shortly the prisoner went again; I looked over the screen to see what he was doing; I saw him at the cupboard, at the further end of the room, and away from any of the company; he put his hand in the cupboard, reached something out, and put it into his pocket, two or three times; I heard a tinkling noise like spoons. I went up to him, and collared him. I told him he was stealing spoons; he shuffled himself about, and took out of his pocket three table-spoons, and put them into a knife-tray. I told the prisoner to sit down; I told one of the company to call Mr. Robinson, the landlord; and Mr. Robinson came in the room. I told Mr. Robinson that I saw him take the spoons, and that I believed he had some still more upon him. Mr. Robinson sent for a constable; the constable came, and told him to get up to let him search him, and when the prisoner got up there was another spoon under the seat where the prisoner had been sitting, and during the time the officer searching him a tea-spoon was observed to be sticking out at the bottom of his galter which he pulled out, and threw across the room. He was then taken in custody. The prisoner said before the alderman that he was in liquor at the time; I did not observe it.</p>

The prisoner Williams came into out shop, asked for some silk stockings with cotton feet and tops; I shewed her some; she said she wanted some with silk clocks. In the mean time the prisoner Cook came in, and said she wanted some black worsted stockings at about eighteen-pence; I shewed her some; she asked for some about a shilling; I told Williams I had got none with clocks. She told me to shew her some plain, about nine shillings or half a guinea; I could not find any of that price; I shewed her some at fourteen shillings, and then looked for some black silk stockings for Cook; I found I had not got any. I told her I had got none at a shilling; she did not go out of the shop. A parcel of white cotton stockings were loose upon the counter, underneath the flap of the counter, which turns down, and while I was turning my back the prisoner Cook must have taken two pair.</p>
               <p>Q. Why must she have taken it - A. She had got out of the shop, and the officer dragged her in, and took her into the parlour.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Tuesday, the 25th of May, in the afternoon I was going up Holborn in company with Brown; I observed the prisoner Cook looking in the gentleman's shop-window, with a bundle in her hand; immediately after I saw the prisoner Williams pass behind her, and go into the shop, and Cook followed her; we waited about five minutes, and saw Cook come out of the shop; she had one hand under her apron, apparently with something in it; I took hold of her, told her she must go back to the shop, I suspected she had something. I put my hand to take what was under her apron; she struggled to get away; I took these two pair of stockings from under her apron. I took her back into the shop; she denied knowing any thing about them. There are the two pair of stockings.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. On Tuesday, the 25th, I observed Cook standing at Mr. Chauncer's window with a bundle under her arm, and an umbrella behind her in her right hand; the prisoner Williams almost immediately passed her behind, took the umbrella from her, and went in at the door. Cook followed her into the shop; Cook came out, Branscomb followed her to Bartlett's-buildings, and finding her struggling with Branscomb I took her in custody, and took her back into the shop; Williams was then sitting there, and the umbrella leaning against the counter. I searched them, and on the prisoner I found this new silk handkerchief.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 1st of May I saw the prisoner in Newgate-street, in company with another man. From suspicion I followed them to Dowgate-hill; they crossed the road to the prosecutor's window; they stopped and looked in the prosecutor's window; they passed and repassed three or four times. The prisoner went into the shop, pretending to buy a pennyworth of Spanish liquorice; the other man went and took the ham out of the window, and ran to Bloak-lane. He put the ham on his shoulder, and set off running. I ran after him, and thought I had got hold of his collar, instead of that I had got hold of the ham. He stooped down and made his escape. I took the ham back to the prosecutor's shop. The prisoner was there, not secured. I am positive the prisoner is the same that was with the man that stole the ham.</p>

               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am a city officer. On Thursday last, the 3d of June, I was attending at the North gate of <placeName id="t18130602-81-crimeloc431">St. Paul's</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18130602-81-crimeloc431" type="placeName" value="St. Paul's"/>

I observed the prisoners following a gentleman, I immediately followed them through the crowd of about two or three hundred people, close behind them, with my head over their shoulders; I observed the woman (Saunders) with her hand close to a gentleman's pocket; the other closed to her, and the moment she took it out she put it into his hand, and he put it into his breeches; there was a sudden crowding at the moment, and I lost the gentleman. The prisoner Saunders went toward; the other turned round behind two gentlemen. I let them get as far as Bowles's picture shop; I then took hold of them both, and took them into a wine-vauls. In the passage they wanted to knew what I wanted; I told them to search them; Meers told me there was no occasion; he pulled it out for me. I searched her; I found nothing. I took them to the Compter, and the alderman thought proper to commit them</p>
               <p>Mees's Defence. I was at work; a young man asked me to go with him to see the children at St. Paul's. I lost him; I accidentally met Saunders; she said, here is a handkerchief which I had of a gentleman that has been with me. She gave me the handkerchief; said the gentleman gave it her. I had it not in my possession five minutes before the officer came up; I gave it him. How she got it I know not.</p>
               <p>Saunders's Defence. I am an unfortunate girl. I went down Ludgate-hill with a gentleman, he gave me two shillings, and that handkerchief to keep till night, and then he said he would give me more.</p>

The constable (Johnson) told me that the prisoner had picked my pocket of my handkerchief, and had given it to Williams. I felt in my pocket, and found my handkerchief was gone.</p>
               <p>- JOHNSON. I am an officer. On the 14th of April I was in the Exchange, I saw the prisoner Williams close to the prosecutor. I saw him go away very quickly from the prosecutor, apparently to me, as if he had picked his pocket of his handkerchief. He went a few yards, and stood with Brown; he gave 
               <persName id="t18130602-83-person790">Brown</persName>
             a handkerchief, which I suspected was the handkerchief he had taken from Mr. Jenner's pocket. Brown put in his pocket, but left a good bit of the handkerchief hanging out of his pocket. I took Mr. Jenner, and asked him if that was the handkerchief that he had lost. He said, it looked very much like his handkerchief. I took them both in custody. Brown put the handkerchief down. This is the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my handkerchief. I should not like to swear to it. It was just such a handkerchief as this; I cannot swear</p>

               <p>Q. I believe sir, it is not usual at the Bank ever to have in circulation two notes of the same number and date - A. No, they are never in circulation at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time in the morning was that thirty-pound note presented to you for payment - A. From ten to half past ten o'clock, to the best of my judgment by the appearance of the day's work.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the person who presented it to you a stranger - A. Yes, a postman.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you say he was a postman - A. Why it is unusual for us to put the name of persons upon the notes, and I see this is my writing, the name and address; the name and address of Jones, 23, John-street Minories, is written upon it by me; that is the name and place of abode given to me by the person who presented the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it your practice to require persons who present the notes to write their names with their own hands - A. Yes, that is our usual practice.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how happened it that you wrote that name - A. Because the person that presented it had his hand full of letters, and I wrote the name; he appeared to be a postman.</p>
               <p>Q. He had post letters in his hand - A. Yes.</p>

Yes; in consequence of that bank note having appeared to come from the Bank of England, a note was sent to me of it, that it was paid in by the receiver general of the Post office; I set on foot an enquiry, and ascertained it had passed from the hands of the prisoner, by what appears upon the endorsement of the note. I desired that the prisoner might be sent to me. I told him how the bank note had passed through the various stages; I asked him where he had received it; he admitted that he had received it for postage of letters I mentioned to him that he had not written his name upon the note; I asked him why he had not written it upon the note; I knew that was the order of the board; he said he had not written it, it was an omission, and he was sorry for it. I asked him from whom he received it; he named one or two persons; I do not recollect. He said it was received for postage of letters. I recommended him to apply to these persons; he said he would; and I desired him to call again upon me. After a few days he called again; he said he could not make out from whom he had received it, but certain he was it was for postage of letters. It must have been a day or two after, within the 14th of February, that I had this conversation with him, by a memorandum I have in my hand. The prisoner was not in custody at that time; he was not taken into custody untill the 1st of April.</p>

He took from his pocket a piece of breeches stuff, and compared to mine; he said I don't think this is the stuff I sold you for a pair of breeches; he took from his pocket a pen-knife, and cut a piece out of my breeches; he told Mr. Parkins he could not swear this to be the same that he sold for the ten-pound note. My breeches were ordered to be taken off by Adkins the officer; they were taken off. Then when I came back after searching my house, they were to be produced to shew to Mr. Parkins. The breeches were given to me again by Adkins; he said, here, take your breeches, they are of no use. Mr. Parkins knows that he had a piece of stuff to compare with the breeches, that I had on. As I am brought here, I call God to witness I am an innocent man. I think Mr. Parkins had the piece of stuff which he brought in his hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Parkins. Jacob had furnished me with a piece, the pattern of the stuff that he had sold.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I lost my watch on Friday night, the 11th of May, between ten and eleven o'clock. I was going from Shadwell to Limehouse: I met the prisoner Arnold in the street, she accosted me. I was very much intoxicated she drew my watch from my pocket, at which time I catched hold of the seals and part of the chain. I turned the chain round my finger with my left hand, by some means she forced the watch from me. She then said if I would go home with her she would give me the watch back again; I then went on with her a little way; she repeated the same, if I would go home with her she would give me the watch. She took me to the house of Mrs. Mead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you pass some watchman - A. I believe I did, but I had not my regular senses although I knew what passed. Mead lived in <placeName id="t18130602-86-crimeloc456">Angel-gardens, Shadwell</placeName>

I went up stairs with her, and Mead came in the room; some discourse passed between the prisoner, but what I do not know. Mrs. Mead went out of the room. The prisoner Arnold persuaded me to go to bed, and she would give me the watch in the morning. I went to bed and fell asleep, and when I awoke a candle was burning, and no one there but myself; I dressed myself and went down stairs. I saw some people down stairs, but not Arnold.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the prosecutor; from his information I apprehended Arnold; she said she would not be transported by herself, Mrs. Mead had as much right to be transported as she, they went together to pawn the watch, and Mrs. Mead had one of the one-pound notes. I went back and took Mrs. Mead in custody. I found in a box a one-pound note, which the pawnbroker said he gave.</p>
               <p>- . I am a pawnbroker. I produce the watch; Arnold pledged it with me on the 18th of May, in company with another woman, not Mead. I lent her two pound on it; the one-pound note produced by Mr. Brown is one of the one-pound notes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was your house at any time broken open - A. On the night of the 6th of April, from the hour of ten and six the following morning, which would be the 7th, the casement window of the washhouse, which was closely latched, was taken out, and some iron hooping nailed against it was pulled away; he then got into my washhouse, and into my premises; some person did; I do not mean to swear it was the prisoner, of course. From there to the dwelling-house by another window, from whence was stolen a writing desk, which was mine, and eight shirts.</p>
               <p>Q. The desk is not in the indictment - A. He took it out in the garden and broke it open, and took away the silver in a bag, containing ten pound and sixpence in silver and the bag, and left the desk in the garden. Another bag with three shillings and sixpence in copper, the remains of the contents of the desk, was left in the desk in the garden, and from the house he took eight shirts; I value them at two pounds; one shift, six shillings; five pocket handkerchiefs, five shillings; a child's frock, two shillings; and one pair of child's shoes, two shillings. On the following day I was given to understand that a man was taken up at Hackney with a great deal of wet linen upon him, and a bag containing silver. He was taken at the Brook at Hackney. That is about seven miles from our house. This is the linen.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these things, and tell me whether you can identify them - A. There are seven shirts; they are mine; I can swear to the child's shoes, two shillings: and the frock, two shillings; and four handkerchiefs, two shillings. I recognise the silver particularly by two pieces of money in the bag. I will swear to a shilling and a sixpence; they were altogether in the bag in the desk. There is in the bag now nine pound eighteen shillings; when my house was robbed there were ten pound and sixpence, which with what was found in this bag and the other bag exactly makes up the same amount. They were found upon the prisoner.</p>

            . I am constable of the night, in Hackney. On the 7th of April, a quarter before five in the morning, two patrols brought the prisoner into the watchhouse. I found all the linen on him, them articles that have been spoken to by Mr. Mills, and a screw-driver, a box with matches and phospharus, and a piece of candle. This screw-driver I fitted to many of the marks on the desk; it fitted the marks exactly.</p>
               <p>- IVES. I am a patrol of St. John Hackney. I stopped this prisoner a little before five in in the morning on the 7th of April. I found this property upon him that is now produced before you. I asked him how he came by it; he said he brought it from Norwich; afterwards he said he bought some of it from Woodford.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I was stopped Preston and Wells were with me; they came all the way in my company from Epping; they came in company with me to Lea-bridge; at Lea-bridge I found the property concealed in a sack in a ditch. Preston and Wells were with me; they are not here; they are the people I want. Pardon the presumption of an old weather-beaten sailor. I am in Greenwich hospital. Restore to me an old silver watch which I have been possessed of twenty years, a pair of spectacles, and a tobacco box, which articles have been detained from me.</p>

            . I am a printer. I live at No. 18, Warwick-square. On the 18th of May I found I had lost upwards of two hundred copper-plates. I mentioned the circumstance to Harper; he was in my employ; he is a copper-plate printer. On the Thursday, twelve days subsequent, I charged him with having robbed me of the plates that I had lost, which he confessed, and gave up a quantity of goods. About fifty were given up out of the two hundred. I then gave him in charge of the officer. The officer went to his lodgings, and found a quantity of duplicates; he found fifty out of two hundred. Among the duplicates were three out of date.</p>

               <p>DANIEL CARTWRIGHT. I am one of the Marshalmen. On the 20th of May, Mr. Pittman came to me; I went to his house. The prisoner came down stairs from where he was at work. We went to his lodgings, and there found a quantity of duplicates. Three of the duplicates were out of date, so that we could not get the property at that present time. Mr. Sadler said, as being out he had sold them to another person; he found out the person, and said he had got the plates again that belonged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020056"/>to Mr. Weaver. These were pawned by the woman prisoner. These are the plates; one has been cut in three pieces.</p>

            , one of my journeymen, to go up stairs and see that there was a parcel of silk concealed in a very curious situation. I went up stairs, and he took a parcel of silk out of a hopper of a mill. I saw him. That was while the men were at breakfast. I took the silk out of the handkerchief, and challenged ever one of the men with it when they returned, and asked who were the owners of the handkerchief. Every one denied it. I then sent for an officer. I was determined to find out the thief. Before the officer came, I suppose an hour, the prisoner acknowledged he was the thief that had taken the silk, and when the officer came I delivered it over to him, and he then again before the officer, in my presence, confessed that he had taken the silk.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced him to confess - A. I said there was a thief on the premises; I was determined to find it out. After he knew I sent for an officer he came to me and trembled, and said, sir, I am the thief. He had been with me ten years, and till the time he confessed I had no reason to suppose he was a thief.</p>

He came. I said, young man, I have heard what your master has said, do not say any thing to me, I shall be obliged to report it. He said, sir, I am the thief; I took three pounds on the Saturday, and sold it to a Jew for three pounds. I have looked for the Jew; I have not been able to find him out. I believe he has been trepanned by the Jew to do it. I never saw a more artless thief than he is.</p>

             was with me. The prisoner came up to me, and asked me whether I would not get some sorrel. I said, yes, and asked her whether it was far. She said, no. Then I said I would go, if it was not far; then I went up to that field; it was a good way. I said, Billy. She heard me say, Billy. She then said, let me have Billy. I said, no, I must not let him go. Then she said she would buy him a lollypop; she would be back in a minute. She left me in the fields, and went round a corner by some houses. She said she would come back. She did not. I saw no more of her nor of Billy until I saw her at the magistrate's.</p>
               <p>MRS. FOSTER. I am the mother of this child. On the 27th of May I lost my little boy; I went every where to find him; I could not find him. A gentleman came to my house on Friday night, and let me know. I went to Wanstead. My little boy was taken away from a little girl in Bethnal-green. My child was lost in Bethnal-green. I found him at Ilford. I never saw the prisoner until I saw her at Ilford.</p>
               <p>MR. WISEMAN. I was going through the village of Wanstead; I saw the prisoner with this little boy. She was dressed very wretched, without shoes and stockings. I asked her if the child was hers. She said, yes. I thought it could not be hers. She said, it was. I thought the child was certainly stolen. I told her, I should take the child. I detained her for an hour, and sent for a constable; the constable came; I gave him charge of her. and kept the little boy in my house. The child said he lived at Bethnal-green. At Laytonstone a woman informed me she was in London, and heard a child cried. This was about nine o'clock in the evening. I ordered my horse to be put to. I came to London, and after about two hours searching I found out where the parents lived.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is the little boy - A. Three years old. When I saw the prisoner with the child what attracted my notice was, she had taken the flannel petticoat off, and tied it over a good frock. I saw a good frock underneath, that made me more positive in my opinion; I found she had torn the sleeves of the frock. I had her before the magistrate at Ilford. She had offered the flannel petticoat for sixpence. She said she took the child to go a begging with.</p>

            . apprehended the prisoner at Mr. Lightfoot's, a pawnbroker, in Marybone-lane. Benjamin Wait said she was Mr. Hall's servant. I asked her what she had got in her pocket; she said, nothing but her own. I searched her; I found on her two five-pound notes, one two-pound bank notes, and three one-pound notes, all bank notes; twenty-eight shillings in silver, and twenty-five duplicates; two of them were for eight silver spoons, each of the duplicates for two table and two dessert; one was in Chandler-street and the other in Jermyn-street, and a duplicate of a watch I found. I went to the pawnbroker in Chandler-street, and in Jermyn-street, and I got six spoons at another place, which she had left for safe. I found a gold seal and a gold key upon her; the seal and key were owned by Wait; a silver watch I found in her pocket, that was owned by Broad, the servant girl; and in looking over the duplicates I found there was not the quantity of spoons that Mr. Hall had lost. I asked her where the remainder of the property was. She told me she, would take me to a shop where she had left it for sale. She said her master should have all his property back if he would forgive her. I told her it was not in my power to promise her that; I would tell her master of it. She took me to a cook's-shop, there she demanded a large bundle of wearing apparel of different description, which she had left there. I took the bundle under my care; then she took me to a shop in Marybone-lane; it is a kind of sale-shop where they buy second-hand plate. She went in, and asked Mrs. Manuel for the plate that she had left. I went in with her; six spoons were delivered to her; two table, two dessert, and two gravy spoons; she had them delivered to her. I took them out of her hand. No other property was found. These things have been in my custody ever since, all that is here present. I put her in the watchhouse a little before five. I apprehended her a little before four. I went down to Mr. Hall with the property that I had in my possession. Mr. Hall said his servant was robbed also. I did not know it then. Then William Clayton stated that he had been robbed of two five-pound notes. I produced the notes; he said he believed they must be his by the numbers. I went to the pawnbrokers the same evening, taking these spoons with me. These are the duplicates that I found on the prisoner. I recovered a watch by these duplicates. the property of Wait; a gold seal I found on her person; four silver table spoons and four silver dessert spoons I obtained by the duplicates. That is all I know.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Hall. Look at your own things - A. The spoons have my initials all of them; I believe them to be mine; they are worth ten pounds.</p>

               <p>Q. to Elizabeth Broad. Look at that watch - A. That is my watch; I value it at one pound.</p>
               <p>Q. to Clayton. Look at the note - A. I can only swear to one five-pound note. I took it at the bankers; I know. It by the number, it is in the bankers book; the book is here.</p>

            . On the 29th of May I was standing in my shop, which is opposite of the prosecutor's, between one and two o'clock in the day, I saw the prisoner go into his shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive that he went over the threshold of the door - A. I am positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any person in the shop - A. None. I saw him take a parcel off the counter, and run up Everett-street with it, he put it under his arm. I immediately run across the road, and seeing no one in the shop, I called out to the prosecutor that he was robbed. I did not wait for any answer, but I pursued he the prisoner immediately, I kept him in my eye except in turning the corner he turned another corner into Wilmott-street; I there lost him, and seeing a boy, I asked him if he saw any one run with a parcel; he said yes, a man run down Wilmott-street, and looked in a gateway; Mr. Lipscomb was close behind me; I there saw the prisoner standing behind a gateway; he seemed very much confused at the sight of me, and I saw the parcel drop from him.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose there was no one behind the gate but the prisoner, was there - A. No; I saw it drop, and heard it; there is a vacancy between the gate, the post about five or six inches.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not get sight of him in Wilmott-street - A. No, not till I came up to the gates, and then I saw the jean drop on the ground; I collared him immediately; Mr. Lipscomb came up at the time.</p>

               <p>MR. PARTRIDGL. The prisoner was brought to me at the watchhouse, and Mr. Lipscomb delivered me this parcel; it has been in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Is that jean your property - A. Yes, I can safely swear it is my property. The value of this is near four pounds; I have only valued it at two pounds; that is under the value of it.</p>

I said it was too soon to go to work, and advised him to lie down again; he took off his coat and shoes, and laid down again; and between that and half after seven o'clock, when I awoke, he was gone, and part of the clothes I had taken off the over night was gone likewise.</p>

               <p>EDWARD BROWN. I keep a chandler's shop, 17, Sydney-street, City-road. The prisoner offered me some cheeses.

            . I am a constable. On the night of the 28th of April, the watchman came to me; I went with him to a house in Long Acre; I broke the door open, and I and the watchman searched the house; we searched every floor until we came to the top, and in the corner of the back garret we found the two prisoners; they said they come there because they had no money to pay their lodging; I asked them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020063"/>who belonged to the porters knot; they denied it belonging to them. I saw some stones had been taken down, and some lead was taken from the first floor, and the lead all round the sides of the pump was ready to take away, and one grate stood at the door, ready to take away, and three mahogany window blinds were taken down and carried away.</p>

He did not succeed in running away with it. He only unfastened one of the pins. I went and fastened the waistcoat, and waited in the shop a few minutes, expecting the prisoner's return. He almost instantly returned, snatched the waistcoat away by force, and ran off with it. I cried stop thief. He dropped the waistcoat. I pursued him, and brought him back. This is the waistcoat; it is mine; I value it at three shillings.</p>

               <p>PETER CLELAND. I am a constable. I searched the room the prisoners lodged in; I found a pair of lacers, and on moving the bedstead from the wall I found this bundle in this handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. That bundle is part of my things that I put in my box; that is part of my gown; the other things are trifling things. The handkerchief is mine.</p>
               <p>Elland. I applied the pincers to the box that had been forced; it talked to the marks where the box had been wrenched.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BENTLEY. I am a lodger in the house where the robbery was committed. On Wednesday evening I saw the constable search the prisoners room. I have seen the prisoners go in and come out of that room, and Mr. Aldred said he let the prisoners that room.</p>
               <p>Garrett's Defence. On Wednesday afternoon, as I came down with the bundle, the prosecutrix and the landlord stood in the bar; I had four leaves of bread in my haversack; I said it was of no use to keep them till they were mouldy. I took them to Bunhill-row, and sold them for seven pence a-piece.</p>
               <p>Hatfield's Defence. At the watchhouse the landlord said he did not think I was guilty.</p>

On the 6th of March I discharged them on account of having burned whalebone to a considerable amount. In consequence of information; on the 14th of April I went down to the side of the Thames, to where the prisoner Whitford lived, and there I saw both the prisoners. Tibbott, the officer, accompanied me, and there I found forty-eight lancets which I knew to be mine; Gilbert was using them.</p>

            . Q. In the course of last spring did the prisoner come on purpose to nurse your wife - A. She did. My wife died on the 11th of March. She quitted my house on the 26th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time she went, had you and she been upon good terms - A. We had not quarrelled. I had a constable to see her out of the house. I sent for a coach to take her peaceably away.</p>
               <p>Q. Two days after that were you well or ill - A. I was ill and in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were so ill on the 28th, did you know of the prisoner coming to your house - A. I did not know of it; I heard of it, and saw her there. She came into my room and asked me for her things; she had leave to take her own things and part of mine that were in the wash; none but what were in the wash. She had began to wash before she went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Shortly after that did you discover that any of your property had been missing - A. I did, before and after too. I lost silk handkerchiefs and gowns, my wife's great coat, and a waistcoat of mine, and five shirts, and all the curtains of a bed, except the top and the vallance. I lost a shift, and a shawl, and bed gowns. I have lost a hundred times more than I have recovered.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. How old are you - A. I am forty-nine.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost your wife, poor man, in March - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not like long to be single - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you buy a ring for Cousens, and pass her for your wife to your servants - A. No, I did not. She asked me to lend her the money to buy her a ring to turn that man out of her house. I lent her the money to buy a ring, and I went with her to buy it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not lived with her as your wife - A. No, never. I have acknowledged I was her husband.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you live with her as your wife - A. She certainly came to bed to me; I will not deny that. She wore a ring, as if she was my wife.</p>

After he drank what they had got he came and took my hat off my head; he wanted to put another hat on my head, but I would not have it. The prisoner went out of the tap-room with my hat on his head. I went after him; he said, I am not gone, you need not walk after me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lay hold of him - A. No; I did not like for fear I might be ill-used. There was an officer on the other side of the way. I gave charge of one of the men that was with the prisoner; he told the officer where the prisoner lived. The officer went after the prisoner and took him.</p>
               <p>- HOOPER. I am an officer. I received information that a person had lost his hat. I immediately ran over to the Adam and Eve. I apprehended a man on suspicion; I told him I should take him to the watchhouse; and as we were going along to the watchhouse, he told me if I would not take him there he would tell me where the hat was. He told me the hat was at Paddington; the person was gone there. I went to Paddington. I met the prisoner with the hat on his head. I asked the prisoner if that was his hat on his head; he said, no, it was not his hat, he had taken it from the prosecutor in fun; he was going to return it. I took him in custody. I asked him if he knew the prosecutor; he said no, he had never seen him before.</p>

            . I live in Brick-lane. On the 29th of April I saw the prisoner run past my house; he had a chest of tea on a knot; it was marked C. G. H. Sheerness. He pitched a chest of tea at a public-house on a block. I went after him and asked him if he knew of a situation, that he might not know I was following him; he answered, he did not, and then he said he did, at an ironmonger's. He then took up the chest of tea and carried it as far as Lamb-street. I then asked him whether he was not out of his way with it; he threw it down and ran away. I took him in custody, and gave him in charge of an officer. This is the chest of tea.</p>
               <p>ROBERT SINFIELD. I am a carman to James Cousens, a tea dealer, in Coleman-street. On the 9th of April I went to Davis's wharf to deliver a chest of tea. I had two chests in my cart. I took one of them to deliver at the wharf. I left the other in the cart; it was marked

            . I am a cheesemonger in Brooks's Market. I saw Smith with the carpet in Baldwin's Gardens; Fincham was with her. Mr. Norris took the carpet from Smith; Fincham ran away. I followed and caught Fitcham in Grays Inn Lane.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the carpet; it is mine. I took it from Smith. Fincham ran away.</p>
               <p>Fincham's Defence. I ran away; I was in a hurry; that gentleman ran after me. I have been in confinement ever since.</p>

            . On the night of the 10th of April, I was on patrol duty in Kingsland-road, between nine and ten; we met the three prisoners<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020067"/>coming down towards Shoreditch church, each of them carrying rabbits; we stopped them; Hassett ran away, and threw down a handkerchief containing a doe, and five young ones; they were alive. Gleed secured the rabbits. I pursued Hassett, and catched him; the two other prisoners were in the custody of Valentine. On Sunday morning we found the rabbits belonged to Mr. White; when he saw them he said he had no doubt they were his.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. You lost eight rabbits, did you - A. Yes, five young ones, and three grown ones. I believed they were mine at the time I first saw them.</p>

The officer then laid hold the prisoner, and said this man has got them. I saw the prisoner drop one pocket-book, the other was taken out of his breeches; the one that he had in his breeches contained the two-pound note.

            . I was at Tothill-fair. I there saw the prisoner close behind the prosecutor, and from the prisoner's appearance I thought he was doing that which was not right, which induced me to watch him: I did not see him take the books; I stood at a little distance that he should not see me; I saw him so near the prosecutor's clothes as to suspect he was doing it; there was no one behind the prosecutor, but the prisoner. I saw him move a little way of one side; I thought he had something. I found he was going to leave the prosecutor; I tapped the prosecutor on the shoulder, and said; have you lost any thing, sir. The prosecutor said, a pocket-book. I then laid hold of the prisoner, and saw his hand throw something; I did not exactly see the book. I saw the book picked up; the prosecutor claimed that book. I searched him. I unbuttoned the flap of his breeches. I found the other pocket-book in his breeches. On examining it I found a two-pound note in it. I have kept the pocket-books ever since.</p>

            . I am a bookseller, in Broad-street, St. Giles's. On Saturday evening, the 10th of April, the prisoner came into my shop; he offered to sell me this book; it is Ovid's Metamorphosis; it is the last translation; he asked me seven shillings for it. I told him I thought it was handsomely bound for a man of his appearance; he said his son was a bookbinder, he got it from his son. I asked him is son's name; he said if I would let him go he would bring his son to prove that he had given it him. He was a miserable looking creature, and the book by no means corresponded with his appearance; however, I let him go for that time. On Thursday morning following he came into my shop while my boy was taking the shutters down; I came down half dressed; the prisoner was then in my shop demanding the book in a peremptory manner; I said have you brought the person that gave you the book; he said he had not. I took him to the watchhouse myself.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What is the book worth - A. I have valued it at two shillings; it has ten shillings and six-pence marked in it, that is the selling price; the ten shillings and six-pence is my private mark; it was never sold by me or my people.</p>

The prisoner came to me about a quarter before five in the evening; he brought three almond pigeons, he asked nine shillings for them; I was considering which way I should detain him; I told him I thought that was too much. I endeavoured to stop him; I asked him if they were his own; he said yes, victuals was so dear he could not keep them; he wished to sell them. I locked the door, and locked him in; he made his escape from me; I laid hold of his jacket, and the pocket came off. I delivered the pocket to Mr. Parr; here it is. I was sent for in the evening when he was taken in custody; and the piece that same off his jacket made his jacket complete. Mr. Parr claimed the three pigeons that were left with me.</p>

             in Webb-square; I there found the prisoner between ten and eleven at night; when I saw him his jacket appeared to be torn, the part torn off fitted the jacket that he had on. At the watchhouse; I asked how he got these pigeons that he sold to Mr. Ball; he denied having any pigeons in his possession. I asked him how his jacket came torn; he said by the wheel of a cart. I then sent to Mr. Parr to come to the watchhouse for this piece; I matched it to his jacket, and it formed a jacket.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What is the value of these pigeons - A. I would not take ten pounds for them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the pigeons of a man, and at Worship-street office I was willing shew them the man. Mr. Armstrong said take him away, that is enough.</p>

I gave him a breakfast, and after breakfast he said he was very tired, he wanted to lie down. I permitted him to lie down in my house. I had got to go about half after twelve o'clock, and when I came home he was coming down stairs again; he asked me to give him some beer. I gave him some. I thought he looked rather bigger than when he came in by bulk. I stopped him, and searched him; I found on him a jacket, waistcoat, a pair of breeches, and a silk handkerchief. The breeches belonged to me; the other things to a lodger of mine; they were left in my care. I gave him in the charge of Turnbridge.</p>

On the 4th of May I asked her to let me in the room to see if my things were safe, and upon her refusing I got a constable and I went into the room, and found two shirts, two bed curtains, and a counterpane were gone. She was searched, and the duplicates found upon her.</p>

The prisoner is building two cottages for himself; they are unfinished at this present time. We seized all the property on the premises which we were suspicious of being stolen, and during that time I saw the prisoner at a distance off in a field. I ran after him, overtook him, and apprehended him. I took him to his house; he asked my permission to put in some long boards that were standing outside of premises; as soon as he had got the last board in he locked the door; I jumped in the window, and ran up stairs after him; he jumped out of the window into the prosecutor's arms; he got away from the prosecutor. I jumped out of the window and ran after him, and secured him. The prisoner then said I will go quiet with you now; I am done.</p>
               <p>- OLIFFE. I am the constable. I can only correspond the evidence of Tibbott. We found a quantity of timber under grass, and a parcel of dead branches laid over it. This is part of the oak scantling, and this is a piece of beech quartering; there is a considerable quantity of it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am sure these are all mine; I bought it this time twelvemonth. The pieces of beech are all stamped at the end by the person that I bought it of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the stuff, and paid for it.</p>

            . Q. You are an artist in the employ of Mr. Akerman - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sell the prisoner Brown any sets of Westminster Abbey and Microcosm of London which you had taken away from Mr. Akerman - A. Yes, about five sets of Westminster Abbey; the first two sets at five pound each, and the others at four pound ten shillings. I swear positively to having sold from seven to ten sets; seven I am sure I have sold. The Microcosm was the same price, and about three sets at four pound ten shillings. I am sure I am speaking within compass of the number. I received money and goods both for them; the goods were furniture and birds. The agreement was to take part money and part goods.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner - A. From ten to twelve years; he has carried on the business of a green-grocet, print and picture dealer; his house is in Crown-street, Soho. The application for dealing in this was made by Brown; I was passing Brown's house; he asked me how I was, and where I was; whether I was still in the service of Mr. Akerman. I told him I was, but that I should shortly quit it. He then said, Mr. Akerman has published some pretty works, and that he should like to possess them if he could get them cheap; he asked me if I could help him to any. I asked him what price he would go to. He desired me to name my own price. I named eight pound or eight guineas; I would get him a set of the Westminster Abbey; he ridiculed the idea. I told him the trade price was ten guineas, and the price to the public was fifteen guineas; he said, that would not do; he could get them cheaper; he did not mind what the trade gave. I took him one set, which I sold him for five pound.</p>
               <p>Q. When you afterwards took them what you sold for four pound ten shillings, do you remember his giving you any reason why he would not give more than four pound ten shillings - A. He said he could buy them cheaper at sales. I wished to rise the price on account of their being proof impressions; he said he did not care for that so that they were cheap; I could afford to let him have them a great deal cheaper than that, for in the way that he should dispose of them I need not fear any thing; he would take to any extent, and always pay ready money. On Thursday morning, the 15th of April, I saw Mr. Simpson come out of his door, and when I came up Brown was at the door; he asked me if I knew that gentleman. I said I did, it was Mr. Simpson, a friend of Mr. Akerman's. He then said he suspected all was not right, Mr. Simpson had been there the night before; his son had told him there were many copies in the house; he begged me to take away two sets, if I could deposit them safely. I took away two of the sets I had sold for four pound ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you deposited any pawnbrokers tickets with him - A. Yes, I sold him some duplicates of sets I had pawned. Brown told me he expected to get into trouble, but he would not give up my name, nor was I to mention his.</p>

            . Q. I believe you are acquainted with Mr. Akerman - A. Yes, and I at the request of Mr. Akerman went to Mr. Brown on the evening of the 14th of April. I saw the son as he represented<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020072"/>himself; he came to me in the shop; he shewed me two sets of Abbey; I told him I would call the next morning. I made an appointment to see the father. On the next morning I called between seven and eight, I saw the prisoner, I told the prisoner I called in consequence of seeing two sets of Westminster at his house the evening before, which his son had shewn me, that I had come to see these and ten or twelve sets that his son told me he had up stairs, that I wished to see them as well as the two sets that I had seen the night before; upon which he told me he had none. I told him that he could not be correct, for I had seen two the evening before; what had become of them. He then said a stranger left them; he would have nothing to do with them; he sent them away. I then told him that his son had told me that he had sold upwards of twenty sets before; then he declared to God as an honest man he never bought one set in his life. I then wished to see his son; upon which he told me he was a youth, subject to fits, and was silly, and did not know what he said. Not being able to make any thing more of him I went to Mr. Akerman and told him what he said.</p>

             - A. I saw such a person at the watchhouse. On Sunday the 11th of April, I saw Mr. Harbinge and the prisoner, about a quarter before one, just at this end of Cow Cross; the prisoner had another with him; the other person looked older then the prisoner. I saw the prisoner and another following the gentleman, and just as they got two yards by me the prisoner put his hand into the gentleman's pocket, and pulled the handkerchief a little way out of the pocket, but not entirely out. I followed them; they passed by the end of St. John-street; they went up Charter-house-lane after the gentleman; the gentleman did not perceive what they were about at the time; when they got about half way down Charter-house-lane on the left side, the other man put his hand to the handkerchief and pulled it out; the prisoner was close to the other at the time; he put it under his coat, and away they both walked together. In consequence of my seeing this I made the best of my way to them, and as I passed the gentleman I made a nudge at the gentleman for him to follow me, and just as they got close to Charter-house-gate the one with the handkerchief ran through the square; I immediately then catched hold of the prisoner. I told the gentleman that he had lost his handkerchief; he said so I have; he said are you are an officer; I said I am. He gave me charge of the prisoner. I told him what I had seen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the person of the other man who ran away - A. He was a man I had seen before. I knew him to be an old thief. The other ran away with the handkerchief; it has never been found.</p>

From information I got a search warrant and two officers, and went to the prisoner's house; one of the officers stopped below, the officer went up stairs and opened a cupboard; I there saw my canvas. I knew it; I sewed the seams myself. This is the canvas; there is five yards; it is not so much as I lost. I lost sixty yards.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 2nd of June, a little past six o'clock, I met the prisoner; he had a basket on his shoulder; I asked him what he had got in it; he said, wood and chips. I told him I was an officer; it appeared to be heavier then wood, I would like to look in it; I then examined it, and wood was on the top. I took the wood out, and at the bottom of the basket was thirty pounds of white lead. I asked him where he got it; he said at Mill-wall. I told him he worked at some place, and I must go there; a gentleman standing by said it is at Price's manufactory, I had better go there. On my taking the prisoner along he told me not to go there, he did work there, if I took him there he should lose his bread. I took him to the manufactory. I asked a gentleman in the accompting-house if he knew him; he said, yes, he had been working there all day, I went to his room afterwards.</p>
               <p>HENSHAW STEVENS ADAMS. I am clerk to the prosecutors. The prisoner was a labourer. On the evening of the 2nd of June, the prisoner was brought by two Police officers; I asked the prisoner where he got the lead, when, and what he took it for; he said nobody had given it him, he took it in the morning, he took it before the person employed in this department came to work; he took it with a view of painting some part of his house. He has been four years in our service; I never heard any complaint against him before.</p>

I lodged about three or four nights in her house; I met her by accident at Gravesend on Tuesday night, I do not recollect the day of the month; it was about a month ago; I came up to town with her in a Gravesend boat; on the Wednesday night I arrived in London between twelve and one in the morning; we shored at Limehouse; I went home to her house; she keeps a lodging house; I went to bed in a bed by myself. Last Saturday was a week I went to the India House and received money there; she would come with me; she saw me receive it; the last money I received was eighteen pounds; out of that I gave her a one-pound note, and when I came to her house at Poplar I had sixteen pounds. I am positive I had the notes at the time I was going up stairs She said stop for a light; I said I do not want a light. I went up stairs and went to bed. She came up stairs; I awoke; and said, who is there; she said it is me John; come down to supper; I said I do not want any supper; and when she was going away, she laid hold of my trowsers; I said let them alone. She said put them under your head; she went down stairs again. I told her I could take care of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine them before you put them under your pillow - A. She went down stairs; what time she stopped I cannot say; she came up again and brought half a pint of beer; here, said she, I have brought you something to drink: I said I did not want any, however I will drink with you. I asked her where her husband was; she said down stairs. I said go to bed to him. I got up in the morning, the clock struck five; I found my trowsers had been removed from the place where I put them when I went to sleep, curiosity led me to examine the pockets, I thought the bulk was diminished. I examined them, and found only six out of sixteen; they were all one-pound notes; I dressed myself, and went in the kitchen; I said, what, are none of you up; she said no, came and lie down with me. I said, no; I am robbed, and I will have every one of you up in the morning; a man that slept in the parlour said, d - n it if I did not think so; she dug a pit for another, and she will fall in it, and I went to get a constable, and had her taken up; she was searched, and only one-pound note was found upon her. My notes have not been found. They offered me seven pounds of the money.</p>

            . I am an officer of Poplar. On the 30th of May, about five o'clock in the morning, I was applied to by Flood; he said that he had been robbed of ten-pounds, that Mrs. Hughes had been in his room, and had taken the ten-pound. I took Mrs. Hughes into custody. She denied having taken any. It was supposed that the husband went out with the money, as he went out unusually soon that morning. I afterwards took the husband, imagining her might have had it; no property being found upon him the magistrate discharged him.</p>

               <p>ELIZABETH JONES. In the beginning of November the prisoner took a one pair of stairs furnished room of me at five shillings a week. She staid with me until the 21st; she stopped away a week, and then she came one morning and said she should come home in the afternoon. I never saw her from that time, and when the door was opened I found all the things gone. I next saw the prisoner as I was going along Cripplegate-buildings. I brought her home to my house, and sent for the officer. He took her. She said she was very sorry for it. She was a quiet, civil woman, at the time she was in my house.</p>

Garvis observed if it was his money there was orange-peel with it; he had some orange-peel in his pocket. On examining the hand there was orange-peel with the money. I looked at Oliver's hand and saw orange-peel. I then told the two prisoners they must go with me to Hatton Garden office.

               <p>Q. Was you pocket picked of a handkerchief - A. Yes; about twelve o'clock in the day on the 18th of April. There was a crowd assembled to see the Prince Regent going to chapel.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before you missed your handkerchief had you seen it - A. About an hour or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the prisoners there - A. I did not notice them. Johnson tapped me on the shoulder and said, that I had my handkerchief taken out of my pocket. I looked in my pocket directly, and my handkerchief was gone. I turned round directly, and saw the prisoners in custody of Johnson and Humphreys.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they produce the handkerchief to you - A. They did, at the watchhouse; that was the handkerchief that I had in my pocket that day. It was a silk handkerchief, worth five shillings.</p>

            . I am a city officer. On Sunday the 18th of April, I was in the park; the Prince was going to chapel. I saw Mr. Williams there. I was watching the prisoners; I saw them near Mr. Williams near half an hour. They noticed Humphreys; they were attempting some time; they saw Humphreys; they drew back to the wall; at last Kay backed himself towards the prosecutor, and put his hand behind, and pulled his handkerchief half out; Hibbert got close up to Kay, and finished taking the handkerchief out. They were a long time doing it. They were noticing Humphreys as much as the handkerchief. Hibbert put the handkerchief into his bosom. I laid hold of Hibbert. Mr. Williams claimed the handkerchief.</p>

I saw the prosecutor looking through the balustrades; the prisoner came up and stood close behind him. The prisoner was alone. I watched him. As soon as he came up behind the prosecutor he looked into his pocket, and then he put his fore finger into his pocket, and drawed the handkerchief out a little way. He looked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020077"/>round to the right and left. I then got behind two horses in the road. I saw him take the handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket. He was making off; I catched hold of him by the collar. Cave came-up and laid hold of him by the other side. Cave took the handkerchief out of his coat. Mr. Corby claimed it as soon as we informed him of it. The prisoner begged for God's sake to let him go. I told him I would not let him go in an hundred years.</p>

On the 26th of May, about half past eleven at night; I met the prisoner she was in company of two other young women; I was passing by when the prisoner ran up to me; she left her companions; she walked with me an hundred yards to where there is a passage that leads into <placeName id="t18130602-164-crimeloc889">Dover-yard</placeName>

I only went with her to the end of the passage, and stopped there with her three minutes, not exceeding that; at the expiration of the three minutes she ran curiously away from me, up this passage, into Dover-yard. I had a watch with me in my fob. My purse was in my left pantaloons pocket; in it was a ten-pound note, a five-pound. and two ones, and a silver coin that I brought with me from Spain. On her running away from me I observed by the light of the lamps the seals hanging below her hand, not knowing that she had taken my purse. I immediately ran after her, and lost sight of her in a moment. I did not see any thing more of her that night. I then went to the spot where I met her, and saw her companions. In consequence of what I heard from them I did not proceed any further that night. On the morning of the 27th I went to my late employer; he gave me the number of the ten-pound note. On the 28th I went to the Bank to stop the note; and on the 28th, in the evening, I found the prisoner in the Three Compasses public-house. She was searched; nothing was found on her.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you perceived your purse was gone - A. When I lost her. The ten pound note has been traced.</p>
               <p>Q. It is only from Mr. Brett's account that you can prove the number of the note, is it - A. There is nobody here that can prove that was the number.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the worth of your watch - A. Twelve pounds. It is a gold watch.</p>
               <p>Q. One hand could not take the watch and purse at one time - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were her hand about your person - A. Yes.</p>

I watched him out of his father's house, there I saw him take something out in a sack, and get on the cart, and give it to his brother on the cart. I followed him about two hundred yards down the road. I asked him what he had got on the cart; he said, nothing. I told him I knew he had something, therefore I should examine the cart. I examined the cart, there I found the sack that I saw him put on the cart, besides what he had for the horses which was proper. I took it off, and found the sack contained split beans. The sack I am positive is our property, and I have no doubt the beans are our property. I took a sample from the saek, and a sample from the bulk in the granary: they correspond. This is the sack; it is our sack.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 4th of June, about two o'clock in the morning, Lee, the patrol, called me out of bed; in consequence of his information I went to Day's house in Pear-street; I broke Day's door open, and there I found these two bundles of linen, but not him. I expected I should find him either at Thompson's or Jones's lodgings; I went to Jones, and in Jones's garden I found Day. I took Day to his own lodging, handcuffed him, and went back to the same place, there I found Jones laying on the floor in the two pair of stairs. I thought at first it was a bundle. I kicked my foot so I thought against the bundle; his father said that is my son. I said I must have that bundle. I then went to Thompson's lodging; I broke open Thompson's door; there I found Thompson partly undressed, just going to bed; I told him to dress himself, which he did; and under his bed was another large bundle of linen; as soon as he had dressed himself he jumped upon the bed; he said now, Gillmore, I will show you something. He clapped his hand to a sword on the top of the tester; I told him if that was what he meaned to shew me, I had got another, and I would run him through as sure as he was alive, if he dared to take it down. He said no; I will not serve you so; but if these b - y charleys had been here by themselves there would be something the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. That, was meaning the patrols - A. Yes; I have seen the whole three of these chaps together frequently; and I saw them all three together that evening.</p>

I told Bradman I thought the linen was there; I went to Gilmore, and told him of it; he came, and broke Day's door open, and found two bundles of wet linen; I went and told Mrs. Bradley to come to the office.</p>
               <p>- POPE. I compared this button to Thompson's coat, it fitted the shank left on the coat.</p>

               <p>FREDERICK SUTTER. I live in Poland-street Oxford-road. On the 9th of April I was at the Royal Exchange, about o'clock in the day, I came round to the Bank in Bartholomew-lane; I saw the prisoner, he was selling oranges there; I bought six penny worth of oranges of him; I gave him a three-shilling piece, and in change he gave me two bad shillings and a good six-pence; I put them in my pocket. I afterwards saw the prisoner where he first accosted me; he was taken in custody by the constable; I gave the constable the two shillings.</p>
               <p>HENRY MILLER. I am clerk at the Bank. On Friday the 9th of April, Mr. Sutter came to my house, he was there when I came home from the Bank. In the course of conversation it came out that I was going to London-road. He said he had some little business to do, and I could do it is well; among the other money he tended to me were these two shillings. I said they were bad; he said he should like to trace the jew that gave them to him. We went out and called on Sapwell, and when we went to apprehend him he put his hand behind him; Mr. Sapwell picked up another bad shilling. Take notice, the prisoner then said, I have not stirred from the place.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with Mr. Miller. I apprehended the prisoner; I found eight shillings and six-pence good money upon him, which I returned him at the Mansion House; behind him on the stones there lay a shilling, it was a base one. This is it; and these are the two shillings delivered to me by the prosecutor.</p>

I put these tokens in the till; I had no others in the till. The prisoner then went and sat in the tap-room; he called for half a pint of gin; there were more in company I served him the gin; it came to ten-pence. He gave me another eighteen-penny token; and I gave him the change. I put it in the till with the others. He called for a half quarten of gin; he gave me another eighteen penny token; I put that in the till. A woman, one of the party, called for three half quartens of gin, she gave an eighteen penny bit again; upon my looking at that, I said to my husband I thought it looked like a bad one; I said if that is a bad one they are all bad; I went to the till to look to see whether they were bad or not; I called the young man up, and told him he had given me four bad ones; I asked him if he meaned to change them; he said, no; he took them in change he could not think of changing them.</p>
