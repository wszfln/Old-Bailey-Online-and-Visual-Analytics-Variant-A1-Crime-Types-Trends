I am a solicitor of New Inn, London—I acted as solicitor for Mr. Munster in the case of Munster <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Bailton—we issued a writ on February 1st against the publishers of the <hi rend="italic">Brightonian</hi> news<lb/>paper in accordance with the name at the bottom of the paper, A. J. Railton and Co., 24, Duke Street, Brighton; and on February 9th an appearance was entered by Nye and Greenwood, the London agents for Lamb and Evett, in the name of Railton, trading as Railton and Co., seeing which I thought that one person at that time was the proprietor of the paper—the case was tried by Mr. Justice Hawkins on 22nd, 23rd, and 24th June, and there was a verdict for the plaintiff for 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., an ample apology, and costs as between solicitor and client, which is the</p>

               <p>highest scale on which costs can be taxed in the profession—the ordinary costs are between party and party—Messrs Lamb and Evett acted on behalf of Mr. Railton, and Mr. Evett, the defendant, was in personal attendance throughout the trial—I saw Mr. Cox there; they were all in one place together near their Counsel, and when the arrangement was made they were in consultation about it—Mr. Bartlett, the clerk to Messrs. Farmer and Bull, Lamb and Evett's agents, attended the taxation—two or three appointments were made, and on the 18th the Master gave the allocation which is on the Judgment, "The above costs have been allowed at 489<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—the Sheriff was put in about the 20th, and about the 24th I heard of this bill of sale far the first time—as inter pleader summons was then taken out at Chambers, and Mr. Justice Day directed an inter pleader to be tried at Lewes—the next assizes when Civil business was taken were in the following January, when Mr. Cox, the claimant, was plaintiff, and Mr. Munster, the execution creditor, defendant—it was tried before Mr. Justice Field on 15th January, and Mr. Cox, Mr. Bailton, and Mr. Evett were examined and cross-examined and a verdict passed for Mr. Cox—an application was made to the Divisional Court for a new trial, which was made absolute on March 15th—Mr. Evett acted as solicitor throughout—Mr. Cox then appealed to the Appeal Court, which in June confirmed the decision of the Court below—Mr. Railton was made bankrupt in November 1882, and in June, 1883, the matter came before the Judge in Bankruptcy, who made this order. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated June 26th, and stated</hi>, "This Court being of opinion that the said bill of sale is fraudulent and void as against the said trustee, &amp;c., the said bill of sale is hereby set aside, &amp;c.")—afterwards Mr. Cox took out a summons to abandon the interpleader issue, I cannot give you the date; the case came before Mr. Justice Field, and this order was made on 23rd November, 1883: "Upon hearing Counsel on both sides and upon reading the affidavits of Edward Bartlett and William Brewer, filed November 23rd, it is ordered that the claimant, Eichard Cobden Cox, pay all costs, &amp;c., and that all further proceedings under the inter<lb/>pleader issue order herein dated September 5th be stayed, and that the security be cancelled"—that referred to the interpleader issue granted to us before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk and cashier to the firm of Lamb and Evett, Ship Street, Brighton—it is part of my duty to post the books—I write in shorthand—I was examined as a witness at the interpleader issue between Munster and Railton tried at Lewes, 15th January, last year—I produce what is known as Pettitt's Diary; a general office diary—in that diary I take down not only what my principals tell me, but what the clerks tell me, and anything I do myself—that diary is in shorthand except with regard to the name of the client and the action—the entry of the 13th March, 1882, is "Cox, B. C., Railton <hi rend="italic">ats</hi>. Minister"—Cox is the client, and "Railton arts. Mynster" is the name of the action—the remainder is in shorthand, and runs, "Attending upon you and Mr. Railton discussing matters, when it was arranged that we should act for you, and it was further arranged that the defendant should see Mr. Nye, who was at present acting for him, and get him to hand over all the papers"—Mr. Evett dictated that entry to me—I believe that is the first entry with reference to this transaction—the heading of the page of the rough bill book with the entry of 13th March is, "Mr. R. C. Cox, Queen's Road, Brighton"—underneath is "Railton ats. Munster," and then begins a series of items—the item I have just read is the first—from the 13th March to the 14th June there are seven folio pages—every one of those entries in the pages from the 13th March to the 14th June has been altered to make them consistent with the heading—the original heading was "Cox;" that "Cox" has been simply struck through and "Railton" substituted, and all the entries from the 13th March to the 14th June have been struck through so as to be consistent with the new heading "Kailton"—I made the alteration about the 10th July—no one directed me to make the alteration—neither Mr. Lamb nor Mr. Evett spoke to me about making the alteration—I wish the Jury to understand that I made that alteration without any direction from my principals—I said at the trial at Lewes that I made an alteration in June in con<lb/>sequence of a communication made by Mr. Evett—the communication was that Cox entirely denied that he was our client—I made the altera<lb/>tion in June in consequence of a communication from my principal—I remember seeing this letter of the 16th of June commencing "Do we understand that you guarantee?"—I saw a letter of the 16th June from Cox on the Saturday morning—the letter commencing "Do we understand?" was the second—I remember on Saturday marking Evett calling me into his room—he produced to me this letter of the 16th June from Cox in reply to ours of that date—he said "Thorpe, there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188403170006"/>
               <p>is a letter from Mr. Cox"—he was then about to go to town to deliver the briefs in the action of Railton <hi rend="italic">ats.</hi> Munster—I said something to him about Mr. Lamb being under the impression that Cox was the client, and that as he had repudiated his liability, and Railton was worth nothing, those briefs should not be delivered until I got something for Counsel's fees—it was arranged that I should go and see Cox, and Mr. Evett left then to go by the 9.55 express, and he was to do nothing until he had a telegram from me—my other principal, Mr. Lamb, happened to pass through the law clerks office at the time, and I told him the difficulty that had arisen about the retainer—Mr. Lamb did not direct me to fetch Mr. Cox; I went myself, in accordance with the arrangement, and he came to the office with me, and we saw Mr. Lamb in his private office—Mr. Lamb was very angry indeed with Mr. Cox, and said to him "If you are not legally liable for the costs already incurred, you are morally, and had I thought for one moment Railton was the client, I should have declined to act for him"—Mr. Cox then said "I only introduced Railton to you as a friend, and I did not instruct Mr. Evett"—Mr. Lamb said "I do not mind losing the costs now owing, but I absolutely refuse to go on unless I have 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Cox then said "I cannot let you have that now, as I am short at my bank"—Mr. Lamb then said "I will take your guarantee for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and Cox agreed to give it—it was then dictated to me by Mr. Lamb, and signed in our presence—the body of this guarantee is in my handwriting—the date "June 17th" is in Cox's handwriting—it was put there at the time—when I took this down I thought it was merely meant to be a rough draft, and I was going to fair copy it; but Mr. Lamb said "That will do," and Cox signed it, and put the date on him<lb/>self when he signed it—there is a stamp on it dated 29th June, 1882; it was taken possession of by me, and I had it stamped in the ordinary course with the impressed stamp on the 29th—the stamping would be after the verdict—I drew the bill of costs to Railton—I make out all bills—the alteration in the books and my drawing up of the the bill of costs were done at the same time; they were all done together—I posted the back entries—the letter of the 13th July asking for payment of 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was sent by Lamb and Evett with the bill of costs—it is in the hand-writing of a clerk called Robinson—the signature is Mr. Lamb's, in the name of firm—the bill of costs was made out to Railton as if Railton was the client—on the 20th April there appears in the bill, "Perusing Mr. Nye's costs, writing you therewith, and for cheque"—originally it stood "Writing Mr. Railton"—I struck that through and put "you"—on the 25th, "At<lb/>tending upon the defendant and Mr. Blackburn;" that was so—the 16th May, "Attending upon you, informing you result of interview with agents"—it was posted originally like that—as it originally stood it would mean Cox—"Attending upon you and informing you result of interview with agents and of opinions of Counsel, and conferring and advising as to course to be pursued"—this is not an attendance upon Cox—the word "you" in that entry referred at the time to the person whose name was at the top of the first folio, "R.C. Cox," originally, but I think myself it was not Cox that was attended upon, I feel certain—grammatically "you" would refer to the name at the top of the page, but I do not think the interview was with Cox. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If it did not refer to Cox why did you put down "you"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would be a very easy mistake to fall into, because in taking down these items I take down the name of the action as a rule in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188403170007"/>
               <p>the diary and not the name of the client—I think it is clearly a mistake, I don't think Cox saw us about that time at all—"Attending you on telegram received from agents, and conferring and advising, arranging that you should see us early in the morning" on 16th May is a charge of agents which was put in here when I received the bill—I cannot explain at the moment whether it stood originally as it appears now or whether it has been altered; it is as you read it—it does not refer to Cox, I say again Cox was not seeing us at all—to the best of my recollection it did not refer to the person at the head of the page—17th, "Attending; upon you on letter received from agents, conferring and advising, and made an appointment,"—that stood originally before it was altered, "Attending upon defendant"—the bill of costs was not signed, we simply sent a signed letter—I remember Cox and Hailton calling with reference to the bill of sale, I think it was on a Friday, 11th August—the bill of sale was executed in Mr. Evett's room on 12th August—I was called into the room when it was executed—a clerk named Robinson engrossed it to the best of my recollection—the clerk would bring it when it was engrossed—I was there certainly—I know nothing about what passed between Evett, Cox, and Railton before I came into the room, I was not present at the interview—it is Mr. Evett's signature to the affidavit attached to the Regis<lb/>tered bill of sale; that is an affidavit which must be prepared by the solicitor in accordance with the late Bills of Sale Act—two of the three bills of exchange given have been paid; they were for 113<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. respectively, I think, at six, twelve, and eighteen months, and those three bills cleared off this bill of costs; only two are paid, but the third is due—I think I identified at Bow Street this letter of 20th July from Lamb and Evett to the trustee in bankruptcy (<hi rend="italic">This was in Evetts handwriting, and without prejudice said that Mr. Cox was willing to give </hi>150<hi rend="italic">l. for the whole of the assets of the estate</hi>)—speaking off-hand the only thing left out in the bill of sale which that letter comprised was the book debts; there may have been something else, I should not like to be positive—the statement of affairs was drawn under my supervision.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR H. GIFFARD</hi>. There is not the least pretence for saying that I gave a different account, either at Lewes or Bow Street, of the entries in these books—the answer to that question was this, it was in consequence of a communication, but it is not correct to say that either Mr. Lamb or Mr. Evett directed me to make those alterations—I do not think Evett had for one moment seen those books or that book before the trial at Lewes—all the entries are first made in this general office diary—by looking at that I am able to refresh my memory as to what was the exact condition of things on 16th May—the action simply is given "Railton ate. Munster"—the entry is, "Attending upon you and inform<lb/>ing you of result of interview with agents, and as to the coarse to be pursued, and conferring and advising"—the action is against Railton at the suit of Munster—if that is the only heading the person with whom I would have had the interview there would have been Railton—there was a motion to commit Mr. Railton—the entry of the 22nd May, "Motion to commit Mr. Railton," is "Railton <hi rend="italic">ats.</hi> Munster," simply the action—those are the entries that were made at the time, and the alterations appear upon the face of them—there is not the smallest effort In any of the books to conceal the fact of there having been a previous entry, they are simply struck through with the pen—the first time I ever heard of a</p>

               <p>partnership between Cox and Railton was after the time that the bill of sale was executed, I had not the slightest idea before—I have been in the service of Mr. Lamb and Lamb and Evett nearly 11 years; they have every confidence in me, not only with regard to the books, but monetary transactions in every way—I settle the bills myself, it is very seldom indeed that I have to go to them to settle a bill or even look them through—all the books are in my own handwriting—there is no pretence for suggesting that the guarantee was not written on the day it bears date—"Railton <hi rend="italic">ats.</hi> Minister.

I am the wife of Henry Hanscomb, a painter, of 36, Yeoman Road—I was nurse to the prisoner—I went to her on 25th January, and stayed until she was taken into custody—she did not tell me at first what was the matter with her; she said she was very poorly; I found that she was suffering from <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—I watched her and kept her from drink as far as I could—on 31st January a case containing six bottles of whisky and six of champagne came—the prisoner took a little champagne—she used to go out during the first fortnight I was there, and she took too much drink when she was out, and when she came in she was very troublesome—the prosecutor came into possession on the 15th; he might have been sober when he came in, but not after—I suppose he took some drink during the day—I did not give him any—he went out once or twice—on Saturday, the 16th, he was drinking whisky; he knew where it was kept; I showed it him and asked him to get me a bottle—I did not see him drinking with Mrs. Murray that afternoon; she was upstairs and he was in the kitchen—he was not drunk in the early part of the day; towards night he had been drinking—he was drunk—he was not in the kitchen the whole time; in the evening he came upstairs—I saw him when he took the liberty to come into Mrs. Murray's bedroom between 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning—Mrs. Murray was then in bed; I was sitting by her bedside—she went to bed between 12 and 1 o'clock; she went up with me—the man was downstairs then—Mrs. Murray came downstairs to have some soup—when the man came into the room between 3 and 4 o'clock I said "What do you want here?"—he said "Oh, I am lord and master here; I can go into any part of the house I like"—I said "You go downstairs in the kitchen, or to your bed where you slept on Friday night"—Mrs. Murray said to me "Get me a bottle of water"—I went downstairs for the water and left him there, standing in the doorway—when I came back I found the door looked against me—when Mrs. Murray went to bed she was sober—I did not get into the room till between 6 and 7 o'clock—he was then in bed with Mrs. Murray—he was drunk then, and Mrs. Murray was not sober—there were two bottles there—the man must have brought the drink upstairs; I am sure of that, for it was not upstairs and she did not know where to get it; he did—before I went in I knocked at the door and said "Will you open the door?"—Mrs. Murray jumped out of bed and opened the door, and I said to the man "You wicked man, you have taken liberties with my patient, and I shall report you to the doctor; you know very well her mind is deranged and you had no business here"—he said "All right, <hi rend="italic">cockey</hi>, I am all right; take no notice of me, I am going to have a smoke"—he did not have a smoke in my presence—Mrs. Murray got bock into bed, and when I went up again she was asleep—I said to the man "Are you coming out of this?"—he said</p>

I keep the Star public-house—on the night of 29th February, about 10 o'clock, I was called from upstairs and the last witness showed me a bad florin and said "This young woman gave this florin in payment for a pint of fourpenny ale"—I went towards her and looked at her—she looked at me and said "What is the matter?"—I said "Have you any more like this?"—she said "No; a young man gave it to me a short time ago"—I sent for Mrs. Hall, and when she came said "Do you know this young woman?"—she said "Yes, she is a customer of mine"—I said "What for?"—she said "Passing several bad coins and nothing else"—the prisoner said "No, Mrs. Hall, only one"—I sent for a constable and gave her in custody with the coins.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed by Mr. McMertry, a baker of 19, Norton Folgate—on Feb. 25 the prisoner came in and asked me if I could let Mr. Brown of the Unicorn have some silver—we serve Mr. Brown with bread—I went and spoke to Mr. McMertry, who went upstairs and brought the silver down and was counting it in the parlour—I asked the prisoner, who was standing in the shop, if he had any gold with him, and if he would take 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of silver with him—he said that he had not, but he wanted to know how much Mr. McMertry could spare—I want in and came back and told the prisoner 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he left, and came back in 10 minutes with a cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. signed "F. Brown" and not crossed—he said "Some of it will do now and the rest in the morning"—I gave it to my master—he came out with a bag and the cheque and went out with the prisoner, who I did not see again till I picked him out from nine other at the police-court on 4th March—I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was about 5.40 when he came in—I had never seen him before—Christiania McCloud was in the shop—three of us went to the station together; I went in first and Mr. McMertry next—I said "He is the man," not "He looks like the man"—before I went up to him I hesitated and then looked till I was certain, but directly I saw him I knew him.</p>

Brown—I put it in my pocket and said "I will accompany you as far as Mr. Brown's and see him"—he spoke to me on the way and asked how business was, and we went in—the prisoner said "Give me the cheque, Mr. Brown is in the parlour"—I refused—I heard the door swing and the prisoner was gone—I saw him next at the police-station with eight or nine others, but could not pick him out; I say now that to the best of my belief he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a barrister, of 1, Brick Court, Temple—on the 18th December the prisoner called there and gave me this card, "Miss Walker, Wooller, Northumberland"—she said she was the sister of Dr. Walker, who I have known some years, and had come up with him a few days ago and he had left town, and she had gone to see an old servant who was living at Kichmond, who was in difficulties, and an execution was in the house for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; she had got 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and wanted 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a few shillings, and if the money was not paid the goods would be sold at 2 o'clock that day; that she had written to her brother, who had sent her a telegram saying that the money would be sent, but could not arrive till next day, which was too late, and she showed me a distress warrant—I gave her this cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am a military draftsman in the War Office, and have been there nearly thirty-four years—in March, 1882,1 wanted a small sum of money, as my wife and family were ill—the prisoner, whom I knew, said he could get me a small amount, he said he had been a surgeon in the 40th Regiment—I gave him this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to get discounted for me, it is drawn by him, and I accepted it on the 17th of March—he was to bring the money to me—he took it away and I saw him a few days afterwards—he said he had not been able to discount it yet, but he expected every day to have it—on the 28th March I went with Mr. Burber and saw him at his house; I asked him about the bill, he still said that it was not discounted; I told him I heard that it had been discounted—he said that it had not—Mr. Burber said he heard there had</p>

               <p>been a cheque for the amount—he still said that it had not been dis<lb/>counted—this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) does not bear my endorsement, nor have I received any portion of the proceeds—I said "If you have put my name at the back of that cheque you have committed forgery"—I also I gave him another acceptance for 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated March 28th, believing his statement that he had never been able to get the first discounted—he said he could let me have a little money, and produced a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and asked me to let him have 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of it, which I did—that was on the 23rd or 24th, before I gave the second acceptance—I was subse<lb/>quently sued on both those acceptances by Mr. Davis, and was made bankrupt in consequence of this matter—I then applied to a Magis<lb/>trate at Marlborough Street and was told to give him in custody—the police said that I ought to have a warrant and I went to Bow Street and got one.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I received certain information and accused the prisoner of forging my name to the cheque, and he denied it—I then gave him another acceptance, because he said it was not done—about three months afterwards I gave him a third acceptance, but I could not say the date—every time I saw him he said it would all come right, he would do everything—he has paid me money from time to time—he said "I can let you have a few shillings to-day," and I took it, but nothing on the bill—Captain Burber brought me the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that is the only sum he brought me from the prisoner—I have no recollection of his giving me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in April, 1882, or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 15th April—he gave me no money—the prisoner gave me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I do not know the date—I have had various small sums from him—when I was sued I took the cheque to the prisoner, and he said "You need not worry, I will see Mr. Davis," and so I thought it was all right—I did not defend the action—I applied for a warrant for felony at Bow Street—I told the chief at the War Office that I was served with a bankruptcy notice—he said "Can you prove it is a forgery?"I said "Yes."</p>

               <p>solicitors, of Gray's Inn Square—I came into possession of a considerable sum of money, and Mr. Emerson brought the prisoner to our office early in May last, who said that he wanted to borrow 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him what security he would gire—he said "Some property which my wife is coming into"—I said "She being a minor cannot charge it"—he then said that he would deposit as security some deeds relating to 3, Weymouth Terrace—I said that if the title proved satisfactory the money should be ad<lb/>vanced—he said that the house belonged to his mother, but he was the eldest son, and he should come into the property after his mother's death—he produced the deeds then and deposited them at the same time—Mr. Bird looked into the title for me, and in consequence of a communication he made to me I advanced the money—the prisoner kept on calling several times as to obtaining the money on his wife's security, but we could not do anything with that—I got the memorandum of deposit with a declara<lb/>tion attached to it—he brought an old lady and said "This is my mother"—Mr. Bird acted for me, and said to me, "I think you had better leave the room while we explain to the mother what she is signing"—Mr. Bird said to the prisoner "If I had known the state your mother was in we would have had nothing to do with the business"—the prisoner came back into the room after the matter was explained to her, and then she said "I wish my son to have the benefit of this property," and then signed the deed without assistance in the presence of Mr. Emerson, a solicitor, but she was very feeble—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the receipt for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is in the body of it; it says "In consideration of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. advanced"—I paid the money to the prisoner by small instalments, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time—when I applied for interest he kept putting it off, and saying he would call, and when he did call he had not got any money—I received these letters and telegrams from him, but never got any interest—I after<lb/>wards received this letter from Messrs.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Emerson was acting for the prisoner—he used to act for Bimmer and Brother, money lenders—I did not tell him to take the prisoner to them, as I don't believe they have much to lend—this money was payable on 14th July—I did not find out the forgery till December or January—I wrote to the prisoner many times and was put off by his answers—I have been a solicitor's clerk seven years—that was my first investment in money lending—he afterwards wanted to raise 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on his wife's title deeds—this is the cash account (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of the amounts I paid him.</p>

I consented, and took the cloth to Byford, who bought the cloth"—I asked him to accompany me to Goldstein, whose place was 54, Marshall Street—I asked him to point me out the shop that Goldstein used to keep in Little Windmill Street—he did so—I could not hear of Goldstein, and I then left, saying I should see Goldstein in the evening—I gave instructions for the apprehension of Goldstein, and the same night saw him at the police-station at 9.40—I sent for Abra<lb/>hams, who came, and in his presence I said to Goldstein "34 pieces of cloth were stolen from a tailor' shop in Argyle Street on 21st August—I find on the 24th, 32 of these pieces were sold to a Mr. Byford, a tailor in the Edgware Road, by Abrahams; Abrahams said he got them from you, and sold them for you, and you gave him a commission of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it is still open for you to give an explanation"—he said "I only deal in remnants"—I said "I am not talking of remnants but of pieces 6, 4 7/8, and 1 1/2 yards long"—I said to Abrahams "You had better say to him yourself what you say about them"—Abrahams did so—Goldstein said "Yes, but it was only remnants I bought, I only deal in remnants"—Abrahams did not mention the amount of money, and he could not remember how many pieces—Byford's, the tailor's was mentioned—the case came on next morning before the Magistrate, and I went to Mr. Byford's and took possession of the 12 pieces of cloth, the remainder of the 32—I took Abrahams in custody, and said "From what I hear this morning you alone sold the cloth, and Goldstein, if it was Goldstein, took it into the shop; I shall charge you, and take you before the Magis<lb/>trate as well as Goldstein"—he said "I did not know it was stolen"—he was charged, and repeated the same remark—Abrahams carries on business as a piece broker, &amp;c, at Gower Street, St. James's.</p>

Goldstein had a shop some years ago in West Street—there is a distinction between remnants and pieces of cloth—Goldstein said he dealt in remnants—he also carried on business in Windmill Street—it would be the ordinary business of a piece broker to deal in remnants—it was not quite on Abrahams's statement that I ordered Goldstein to be arrested—I had heard nothing from anybody else with reference to this charge except Abrahams—Abrahams said to him "I was talking about the pieces of cloth you brought to me and asked me to sell for you, and I took to Byford in my trap and sold them there, and you gave me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it"—that was all he said—Goldstein then said "Yes, it was remnants I bought; I only deal in remnants"—the subject matter of this charge was not understood to be remnants—I have some accounts taken from Goldstein showing he has purchased from time to time from different persons cloth to the amount of some 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are some of the invoices.</p>

I was an ordinary seaman on board the Alice Holden on the voyage from Tobago to London—the cook's name was Louis Buonaparte—we left Tobago about two weeks before Christmas—on one Tuesday this year, about 12 o'clock midday, we were wearing ship, and the prisoner said 'All hands go forward to stand by the braces'—the cook and myself were at the 'preventer brace' aft, and the prisoner was at the wheel—I left the preventer brace, leaving the cook there, and went to the fore top<lb/>gallant brace, and the cook asked the prisoner if he should lay the table, and the prisoner said 'No'—the prisoner told the cook to come up and haul in the spanker-sheet; the cook did so—the vessel lay on the port tack and the cook had finished hauling in the sheet, and I saw the prisoner take hold of the cook by the foot and throw him overboard—I didn't call out that there was a man overboard, as I was afraid he might do the same to me—I told the mate five minutes afterwards—there was no effort made by any one to save the man—it was not blowing hard and a boat could have been put out—from the day we left Tobago the prisoner was in the habit of chastising and beating the cook—the cook was a coloured man—after the death of the cook the prisoner called me into the cabin and said When you get to the shipping-office, and they ask you about the cook, you must say that the foresheet knocked him over, and I didn't treat him badly'—this morning the police gave me a letter to take to the prisoner, I gave it to him, and he said 'If it is anything concerning the cook you must say "No"'—the crew con<lb/>sisted of nine men—the cargo was sugar and rum, molasses, and hides." <hi rend="italic">Further examined.</hi> When I was at the foretop-gallant-brace I heard the boom flapping about, and that called my attention aft—I heard the wheel, spinning round and I looked and saw no one at the wheel, and it was then I saw the prisoner throw the cook overboard—the cook was sitting on the railing of the poop, he was holding the spanker sheet in his hand—the cook's face was towards me—there was a stormy breeze blowing—the deck of the ship was wet amidships, but aft it was dry—it was about 10—after this happened the prisoner spoke to me about it—it was amid ship, and the prisoner came to me and asked me if I had seen the cook—I said "Yes"—he called me into the cabin and told me that if I was asked about the cook when I went to the shipping office I was to say that the flapping of the mainsheet knocked him overboard, and I said "Yes"—I shipped in Tobago—I remember the dav after we left Tobago—on that day I saw the prisoner beat the cook with a stick and break it over him—it was a good hard stick, a walking stick like iron—I saw the cook go into the galley, and the prisoner followed him into the galley, and I saw the prisoner kick him with his sea boots and say "You son of a b——, I'll kill you before we get to London"—he kicked him in the privates, which were swollen—between that day and Christmas Day the prisoner was continually flogging the cook with a</p>

               <p>when doing this for the captain to take the wheel and for all hands to attend to the sails—I do not know where the cook's proper place was, but I know the prisoner called him aft—we have tacked in the same way before, and the cook was at the foresheet—the spanker sheet is not furled before we begin to wear the ship—on that day the trysail was furled as in the plan produced, and it remained furled all the time we were wearing the ship—the spanker sheet is to let the boom out—the prisoner generally attended to the spanker boom, but not on that day—it would be the cook's duty to be on the port side of the foresheet—the ship was not rolling at the time we were wearing ship—the ship was not under water at all during the time we were wearing ship—the prisoner said the port affray was two feet under water—the boat<lb/>swain rope's-ended me once, he said I was stealing part of the cargo—I did not steal any sugar, I took some to sweeten my tea—I went down into the hold to get it, there was a hole ready made—I did not take out a knife to the boatswain and say I would use it—the boatswain did not say he would rope's-end me again if I did such a thing—I took out a knife to him and he took one out to me—I put my cross to the log—the prisoner told me it was accounting for how the cook was missing—we arrived in London the week before last, on a Tuesday—I went outside the docks—I went to the Board of Trade office to be paid off the day after we came to London—I heard them there asking the mate whether the entry in the log of how the cook went overboard was correct—the mate said "Yes"—all the crew were present—I did not say anything—the person at the Board of Trade asked the mate whether it was heavy weather, and whether a boat could put off; the mate said it was heavy weather—the men belonging to London did not say anything about the cook having been thrown overboard, end so I did not—the prisoner told me the Saturday after we arrived in London that if I did not work better I would be discharged—I was discharged oh the Monday and it was after I was discharged I gave information to the police—it was after I had been threatened to be discharged from the ship that I made the complaint against the captain—I think I was discharged on the Tuesday by the over looker—when the cook was thrown overboard I was hauling the foretop-gallant brace—when I heard the wheel spinning round I turned my head. <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I spoke to the police about this they first came to me—I was carrying something from the shore to the ship when the police first spoke to me—I had not then been dis<lb/>charged from the ship—I had not been discharged on the day when I came here to give evidence; I was discharged the day after I had been here to give evidence—I gave my evidence on a Monday—my friends live in Tobago—I shipped for the voyage from Tobago to London and back the prisoner told me the day I signed that he could take me back.</p>

I live at Glasgow—I was first mate of the Alice Holden, a vessel sailing under the English flag—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the certificate of her registration—I joined her at Greenock on 16th July, 1883—the prisoner was the captain—the crew consisted of eight persons besides the captain and myself—we left Tobago, one of the West India Islands, on 27th November for London—Louis Buonaparte, a coloured man, was cook and steward—he shipped at Surinam—Thomas Coker was an ordinary seaman, about 18 or 20 years of age—I heard the captain</p>

               <p>frequently complain of the cook about the un cleanliness of the food—on Christmas Day, shortly after breakfast, between 8 and 9, the cook was going from the cabin to the galley; the captain took a dish out of the cook's hand and threw it at him; there was a piece of beef on the dish—the dish broke, and it cut the cook on the eye and on the cheek; he bled—he afterwards went over the bowsprit on to the bowsprit shrouds; the captain followed him and ordered him in again, and when he came in he gave orders to make him fast—I and Coulson made him fast to the fore<lb/>starboard rigging, and the prisoner took a stick and struck him several times with it; it was an ordinary walking-stick; he hit him with the big end of it, on the head and shoulders, several times—in a short time he was let go; he was still bleeding from the wound on the face; he was then taken to the lee-scuppers, and the prisoner washed his wound and put some plaster on it—between Christmas Day and the 10th January I saw the prisoner frequently striking the cook with a stick, it was a daily occurrence—the stick was kept in the cabin—the captain struck him on the arm, sometimes on the head, and on the left side—his left arm was disabled; he showed it to me a few days after Christmas; it was all swelled down the arm and wrist—he was beaten with the heavy end of the stick—I spoke to the captain about it once or twice; I said that I didn't think he would do the cook any good by thrashing him with the stick; I don't recollect his answer—they were very hard blows—on Thursday, 10th January, I was on the watch from 8 o'clock in the morning till noon—Coulson was at the wheel from 10 o'clock till noon, when the prisoner went to the wheel and relieved him—we wore going to wear the ship; we were on the port tack, and we were going to wear to starboard; ill hands were wanted for that—Coulson, when he was relieved, went forward to assist with the braces—this model (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a correct model of the vessel—I was at the fore-end, before the fore-rigging, on the starboard side, at the cathead; I was letting go the starboard jib-sheet—the rest of the crew were at the starboard fore-rigging—I didn't see the cook or Coker—nobody was aft the fore-rigging—it took us about a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes to wear the ship; during that time I didn't see anything of the cook or Coker—the captain then left the wheel, and Coulson went and took it—I asked the captain if I should make the mainsail fast; he told me to do ho—he then asked me if I had seen the cook; I said "No"—he told me to look round and see if I could find him—I searched everywhere, but could not find him; I told the prisoner I could not find him—he said, "Most likely he has gone overboard"—I then went up the rigging to assist in making the sails fast, and then came down again in about a quarter of an hour—the captain then asked me to take another look round to pee if I could see the cook; I went round the decks and searched, but could not find him—it was not extra bad weather at this time, an ordinary gale of wind, a moderate gale—the height of the bulwarks amidship was from three to four feet—later in the evening the captain asked in to write a copy of an entry, to enter in his official log-book; he gave me a copy to enter in my book—this is the official log-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is the captain's writing, I think, and this is my signature—besides this I had to make an entry in the mate's log-book, that is the ship's log; I keep that, and the captain keeps the official log—I made my entry from the copy the captain gave me; I worded it a little different, but something to the same effect—afterwards the crew</p>

I was a seaman on board the Alice Holden—I shipped at London for the voyage out and home—I remember the cook, Buonaparte, he shipped in Surinam—on the voyage from Surinam to Tobago I saw the cook bleeding in the face, but I didn't see what the captain did to him; he was sitting in the cabin at that time—three or four days after we left Tobago I saw the captain beating the cook with his open hands—I saw him many times beating him between that time and Christmas Day: he beat him with sticks—I don't know what kind of a stick it was; I call it a bamboo stick; he beat him with both ends—I call a common walk<lb/>ing-stick a bamboo stick—on Christmas Day, at seven bells in the morning, I was in my bunk; it was my watch below; I heard the captain say to the cook "To-day is the day Christ was born, you son of a b——; I will put some sense in you," and he was beating him—I could not say what he was doing to him, because I was on the other side of the forecastle—when I came from there I saw the captain with a stick in his hand, beat<lb/>ing him on the head and shoulders, body, arms, and all parts where he could get to strike him—I heard the captain after that say "I am not going to bring you along with me to London; before I bring you to London I am going to chuck you overboard, you son of a b——;" the cook was going to jump overboard, and the boatswain got hold of a be-laying-pin, and jumped over the bulwarks after him, and brought him on deck again; then me and the mate lashed him to the rigging by the captain's orders, and I saw the captain beat him with a stick and a rope—on the day the cook disappeared I was at the wheel from 10 in the forenoon up to 12 o'clock; the cook went aft where the cabin was—the captain relieved me from the wheel, and I was going forward—about a quarter of an hour after I came to the wheel the cook came out with some beef on a plate; the captain called him out of his name, and said that he had too much beef on the plate, and said "You black son of a b—; you take that back"—the captain made him take some of it back—after that the cook brought some water to the cabin to make the soup with—there was no cork in the bottle, and the captain told him to look for a cork, and while he was doing that I saw the captain kick him in the face with his sea-boots—I should say that kicking lasted for three or four minutes—when the captain relieved me at the wheel at 12 o'clock the rest of the crew were wearing the ship—I went forward to the main<lb/>braces on the starboard side—I saw the cook on the port side going after that I heard a shouting aft, and I said to Andrews "There is the captain and cook fighting again"—the shouting came from the port side—I could not say whether it was the captain or the cook shouting, be<lb/>cause it was blowing—after the ship wearied the captain called me to take the wheel again—I helped to slack in the foresheet—after I had taken the wheel about 20 minutes the captain asked me if I had seen the cook—I said "No; only when he went along with you"—he said "Don't say that you saw him along with me aft, say that you saw him going forward," and he told me that he had sent him forward to the foresheet—he said nothing more to me then—he went to look for the cook—he went to the galley and fore cabin—at 2 o'clock it was my watch below—I was in my bunk, and the captain came to me and told me to turn out and sign a statement—I was naked, lying in my bunk, and I didn't want</p>

               <p>to turn out, and he said "Never mind till 4 o'clock"—the captain then came to me to the forecastle door, and told me to go aft and sign the statement, and he read it out to me in the official logbook, and all hands were signing it except me and Andrews—I didn't want to sign it—I told him that the man was not by the foresheets—I said "I don't like to sign it; when we get to London there will be more about it, and I shall tell the truth"—he said "Do you want to put some nails in my coffin?"—I said "No, sir;" and he said "Would you take me up for manslaughter?"—at 7 o'clock that evening Coker made a statement to me, and I made a statement to the mate at 1 o'clock the same night.</p>

About a quarter to 2 o'clock on the afternoon of Monday, 11th February I saw the prisoner in the West India Docks—I asked him if he was captain of the Alice Holden; I said "I want you to accompany me to the police-office"—he went with me to the office in the docks—I told him I was a police-officer and said, "You are accused of murdering the cook by throwing him overboard and also assaulting him on various dates, more especially Christmas Day, 25th December; I must caution you that if you make any statement I shall take it down in writing and it may be used against you"—I then put down a statement which he made—I read it over to him, and he signed it—this is the statement: "On 10th January at noon in a moderate gale, wore round ship on the starboard tack, master at the wheel, steward coming aft to lay the table; master told him to never mind the table and go and gather in the slack of the lee foresheet—a man Coulson coming to relieve the master at the wheel meets him going to the foresheet at the time when Coulson took the wheel. I saw the man (<hi rend="italic">Buona-parte</hi>) at the foresheet, also several of the crew. As the master got to the fore part of the house the ship gave a heavy lurch to leeward, putting her taffrail about two feet under water; and I was up against the fore part of the house on the weather side. All the crew were on the weather side bracing up the main yards. I saw no more of him (<hi rend="italic">Buonaparte</hi>), and no one said anything about a man being overboard. I surmise that that sea took him afloat, and the flap of the sheet took him overboard. About a quarter of an hour afterwards I missed him, and he could not be found. That is the statement which was entered in the log</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188403170046"/>
               <p>and signed by all my crew." On the way from the police-station to the police-court he said "I did beat him on the legs on Christmas Day, but that was because he spoilt the dinner I had got for the men."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Frenchman by birth—for 31 years I have been accustomed to sea-life—I shipped A.B. on this ship—in going down the river the captain asked me if I would go boatswain, and I said "Yes"—there was a good deal of complaint on board from all the crew with regard to the food and the cook's mode of cooking it, and his care and attention; I have heard the captain reprimand him several times for it; he tried to teach him how to cook, and to get him to be cleaner and more careful in the food—the ship's last voyage was longer than usual; her usual time is 45 days to 50 days; she was about 70 days coming home—I have seen the captain chastise the cook—on Christmas Day I remember the cook went over the bow, and Velasquez told me to go and fetch the man in—he said, "Are you going to jump overboard?"—he said, "No, I am not going to jump overboard"—I said, "No, don't, come in," and then he came in and went towards the galley—the captain said to Dobbee, "Make him fast there"—a bit of rope was put round his waist for a minute or two—Velasquez said to him, "Are you going to jump over-<lb/>board?"—he said, "No, I was not going to jump overboard, but I was frightened you were going to strike me with that cane you had"—it was a small bamboo cane, somewhere about the size of my finger—Velasquez said, "Why did not you come to me when I called you?"—the captain had called him and he didn't come—he was set free in about two minutes; he was not lashed at all; I don't recollect that anything else was done to him that day—I was told he cooked the dinner after it as usual—I never saw him lashed on any other occasion; I don't know of the captain striking him with the bamboo cane—I have seen him talking civilly to him several times and teaching him how to do his cooking—I have only seen him use the bamboo cane which he used on Christmas Day—I don't know of any cane being broken—I never knew anything about his being kicked with the captain's sea-boots—my berth is in the same place as the cook's—I saw no signs of suffering about him or any marks as if he had been kicked, but I knew him to complain of rheumatics; I knew of no complaint of injury to his person—I remember at one time that he had a swelling of his wrist, but that was from rheumatism—he rubbed on paraffin oil for his rheumatics; the captain told him to use it, he said—I never saw any signs or heard any complaints of his being kicked with the boots—when the ship was wearing on 10th January I went to attend to the mainbraces on the port side, as that was my duty—the captain was at the wheel—I stood at the braces till the captain sang out "All's well"—I did not see the cook, but after the main was squared when I went on the starboard side I saw the cook and told him to go to the foresheets, and he said, "All right, boatswain, I will go to the foresheets," that would be on the port side, because I was slacking away the starboard forebrace—Coker was supposed at that time to be at the lee braces, but there were not too many hands on board, I cannot say exactly where he was—he and the cook and all of them would be on the same side, because there was only me, the mate, and the man along with him at the jib-sheets on the starboard side—I cannot say whether the cook would be by the other men; I ordered him to go to the foresheets, so that he would be 8 or 10 feet from the other men—each man was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188403170047"/>
               <p>doing his separate duty at the time—I did not see or hear anything to indicate that the captain left the wheel—before the ship began to wear the spanker boom was on the starboard side because we were on the port tack—the cook would never be required aft—after we began to wear the captain always used to attend to the boom himself when he took the wheel; he used to unhook the boom to keep it from swinging—I never knew any<lb/>thing of the captain going aft on that occasion until I was clear from the ship—there is a piece of timber called a cleat near the foresheets, where he used to make the foresheets fast to—I have heard that the captain told the cook not to stand on it; I have seen him standing there getting the fore-sheets over the rail—the ship gave a very heavy lurch on that day just when the captain was relieved from the wheel by Coulson, and he was knocked against the harness cask—the ship used to give a heavy lurch—the crew all signed the log one after another; Dobbee signed it first, then I signed it, we all signed it—before we did so we went and looked round to see what had become of the cook, but we could not find any trace of him; I looked, I don't remember whether Coker did, some of the crew did—I went to the boat on the captain's house, but I could not crawl in because there were some ropes there; I sent Coker in, saying "You are smaller than me, you crawl in there, you go in there and see if the cook is there"—he went in underneath the long-boat, and when he came out he said, "There is something in there; I think he is in there"—I said, "Make sure he is there"—he said, "I will crawl away aft and see if he is in there," and he went underneath the long-boat again, and came back and said, "No, he is not there"—he was on the top of the house all the time—we all searched, we went all round.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I last saw the cook when I ordered him to go to the foresheets on the port side, and he went across—at that time the fore-sheet on the starboard side had not been let go; Dobbee let it go, I suppose not more than a minute after, because I was going to let go the lee brace myself to bring the yard round—all the men except the cook, Coker, and the captain, were on the port side; they had gone over there when Dobbee let go the foresheet on the starboard side—I was slacking the lee brace on the starboard side—when the cook was braced up and struck with the cane, it was because the captain had been calling him and he would not come—it was after he was annoyed with him for trying to jump overboard; he tied him up that he should not do so—the cook said he intended to jump overboard—I do not remember his face being cut on Christmas Day—I remember the captain put sticking-plaster on his face one day, I could not say when—I don't know how has face was cut, he did not tell me, I did not ask him; I heard it was done by the captain, I did not see it done—I do not know that his arm was disabled; it was swollen; I have seen him rub it with paraffin—I have not seen the captain constantly ill-use the cook; I have seen him use the cane to him several times, but not constantly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> That was a small bamboo cane—it was for not having dinner and the grog ready, and spoiling good grog, and wasting the stores, and so on—I did not see him do it every day and every hour during the voyage—I have seen him do it several times—before Christ<lb/>mas the captain was ill, I believe with some sort of fever—when the braces were let go on the starboard side Coulson was attending to the hauling-in of the slack on the port side, and Lundguist and Coker were</p>

               <p>supposed to be there, and the cook was supposed to be at the fore-sheet—they would be all at various parts of the ship on different duties—the cook's place is at the fore-sheet, and the other men at the other sheets.</p>

He stated that his brother had told him he was going to write for articles advertised in the "Bazaar" pay for them, and then pawn them, and asked him to call for the articles, which he had done twice.

I carry on business as builder and decorator at Shepherd's Bush—I did some fittings for a Mr. Fitch at the premises, 10, Shepherd's Bush Green; that was not the prisoner—I never got paid—Fitch never occupied the premises; Ferguson did—Fitch gave the order in December—Fitch had not just sold the business to the prisoner; he has not sold it to him to my know<lb/>ledge—I have no claim for money against the prisoner; he never gave the order—when Fitch gave the order the prisoner served in the shop; I don't know if he was his managing man—the shop was then empty, and Ferguson pointed out where he wanted the fittings; that was in Decem<lb/>ber—I commenced them then, and finished in January—I have seen Fitch write—I don't recognise his handwriting on this agreement (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>)—I saw him write this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with his signature—I don't think these are the same writing—an interpleader summons is coming on about this to-morrow—Ferguson and Morgan have claimed these goods, and the Sheriff has interpleaded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Gross-examined.</hi> This shop had been used for many years—I received some instructions on behalf of the landlord, Thomas Jackson, Park Villas, Ealing, as to some repairs—I have never known the Mr. Fitch, not the prisoner, before—he came to my shop with the prisoner Fergu<lb/>son, and I went back to the shop with them—Fitch gave me the orders to fit up the shop, and said he was going to carry on the shop—I did not hear the prisoner's name at that time, and did not know who or what he was—I put the fittings in—I saw the prisoner several times while doing so; he was constantly on the premises—after putting them up I sent in my bill to Fitch; he did not pay it—I could not see him—I have seen him once—I didn't get my money—I saw Ferguson once, but had no conversation with him after the writ was served on Fitch—I saw him many times before that, and asked him about the premises—we had conversations about the account—he said I could not get at Fitch—I asked him where he was—on several occasions he made proposals for me to go with him to see Fitch, but it was put off every time—he told me I should find him at Brewer's Quay, but there was no Fitch there—then I got judgment against Fitch, and put in the Sheriff's officer, and I am now claiming the goods in this interpleader.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">W. T. STURGES</hi>. This agreement is in my writing—I know Fitch as signing that name here, and I saw the prisoner sign the name of Ferguson, and Morgan signed it also; that was 1st February I think—it was executed at Chancery Lane—I am a business agent, and made a valuation of the fixtures for the transfer—the amount specified here is 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which includes which goodwill and everything. (<hi rend="italic">This agreement was for the sale of the business by Samuel Fitch to Ferguson and Morgan, and was dated 1st February.</hi>) The shop had been closed for some time, and then Ferguson acted as Fitch's shopman up to the time he bought the business—the name of Fitch remained up after the shop was sold—the shop is closed now.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have seen the person who signed Samuel Fitch before, walking about, and in the shop, before 1st February—I swear the shop was opened about Christmas time, and foods being sold there,</p>

               <p>and I saw Fitch there—the prisoner was there sometimes, from the commencement of the year, acting as shopman.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have lived about there eight years—I drew this up—I saw Morgan sign it; he was not frequently at the shop, but I think I have seen him there on the Saturday.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Streatham, and am general manager to John Gibbs and Co., at 16, Mark Lane, chemical manufacturers—James Ford is a partner in the firm—they did business with the defendants for two or three years, and in September, 1882, they entered into a con<lb/>tract for the delivery of super phosphate in August and September, 1883—the terms were cash in 14 days—on July 19th Lisner called at our office to know whether we would give him the 14 days' credit named in the contract, as he would want the delivery of the goods towards the end of August; his buyers were waiting for them, and if he did not deliver them he should have to make other arrangements—I said that I should have to consider it (we had heard a few months previously that Lisner had had one of his bills returned, and we led them to believe they would have to pay cash)—I made inquiries, went to their place on 31st July, and saw Lisner, and, I believe, Hooper too, and said that we were pre<lb/>pared to give them 14 days' credit—I believed that they had buyers waiting for the goods—we then received instructions from them to deliver 1,000 tons of super phosphate on Hamburg steamers, which we did in four parcels between August 21 and 28, 1883—the invoice price was 5,482<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we have been paid nothing in respect of that—the defendants were present at the meeting of creditors on 24th October, and I took a shorthand note of Lisner's examination by Mr. George Lewis—this is a transcript of it. (<hi rend="italic">This was put in and read, and in it Lisner stated that they had lost </hi>7,000<hi rend="italic">l. in Stock Exchange speculations.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Our transactions with Lisner and Co. amount to nearly 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was incorrect when I said that it was 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I corrected it afterwards—most of them were strictly cash transactions, but some were on 14 days' credit, and they were met—the 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. extended over about two years—two contracts were made in 1882, and a third for delivery in</p>

               <p>February, which we refused to deliver by March unless they paid cash, and there was considerable correspondence between us—there was a great demand for super phosphate at the time we refused to deliver it, I do not remember that Mr. Lisner told me he was rather aggrieved at it, but his firm brought an action against us for the non-delivery and breach of contract—that action was pending in July, 1883—the contracts were for delivery in August and September, 1883, with 14 days for credit—I heard that Lisner and Co. had returned one of their bills, and Lisner told me they had been advised to dishonour it by Messrs. Hollams and Co., their solicitors, because it had been obtained by fraud—I had made bank inquiries between July 19th and 31st about their position, and it was entirely on those inquiries that we delivered the 1,000 tons of which we are complaining to-day—those inquiries were made entirely independently of either of the defendants—superphosphate is dealt in very largely in Germany, and all these purchases were for shipment directly or indirectly to Germany—we know that these 1,000 tons went to Germany—their ordinary course was to send us shipping notes indicating the ship it was to go by and the dock, and they had to be shipped on board—we had not been in communication with the defendants prior to the 19th July in reference to their taking up the 1,000 tons—I had not seen them for some time, in consequence of the action, nor had we communicated with them—the market for superphosphate was just as good then as it was in February; I know that—I know nothing about the market in Germany—we were able to effect sales readily in July—we are in a very large way—I have no doubt we sold superphosphate in July, but I don't remember the details—I had the conduct of the business with the de<lb/>fendants almost entirely—Mr. Ford took bills of the defendants after the 14 days had expired for the full amount of the 1,000 tons, all of which I believe fell due after the filing of the petition—I was not present at that interview—I heard something said about Mr. Lisner being in negotiation with a gentleman for a partnership who would bring in a large sum of money—I heard at the meeting of creditors on 24th October that some of the proceeds of the 1,000 tons had gone to Messrs. Rothschild, but I am not sure that that was the first time we heard of Messrs. Rothschild having anything to do with it—I did not learn till that date that some of the proceeds had gone to take up bills, but we heard about a fortnight after the filing of the petition that our superphosphate had been pledged and money raised on it—I saw Mr. Barber, Messrs. Lianer's solicitor, about it before 24th October—I never heard what the superphosphate realised; I do not even know whether it is sold yet—the market has been quiet for the last two or three months; contracts made in 1883 at a price per unit could be bought now at a large profit—there has been a fall of from 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per ton in the article—there has also been a fall in sul<lb/>phate of ammonia of about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per ton since September, but the super-phosphate business is not conducted in that manner, because ii a man made a contract last September he would have bought the stuff; you buy it at the same time—the defendants had large contracts this year—I negotiated once with Mr. Saffery when he was receiver, to purchase this contract; we said rather than let it go at a sacrifice we would take it at so much—all the contracts in Paris are being worked—I asked Mr. George Lewis to attend the meeting and cross-examine the de<lb/>fendants, and if the facts justified it, to prosecute them—he was to</p>

               <p>extract from them whatever he could, and then use it against them—whether that was fair had nothing to do with me—at a first meeting of creditors the petitioner is bound by Statute to be present and answer any questions his creditors put to him—Mr. George Lewis cross-examined Lisner for about an hour, and so did Mr. Crump, a solicitor—Mr. George Lewis talked about duffing bills, and said "Now, mind what you are about, sir, a Judge and Jury shall settle this"—we have proved for this debt against the estate—the defendants had not contracts on hand showing a profit of nearly 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think that is double the amount—I should say it was 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If any profit was arrived at that would go in reduction of the 35,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Lisner was represented by a solicitor—there was no difficulty in effecting sales in July—we are the manufacturers, and the Germans are the consumers—we sell to middlemen who ship it—as in any other business, the produce market is influenced by the consumers' market—there was nothing on the shipping notes forwarded to me to show me what was going to be done with the bills of lading—it was in consequence of Lisner stating that he had customers waiting that I made the inquiries—we believed it to be a <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> transaction for customers.</p>

I live at Lewisham, and am 25 years old; I am now articled to a firm of solicitors—I am a creditor of the defendants for 12,900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have known Mr. Hooper intimately for seven or eight years—in January and February, 1882, I was living in Langham Street, and Mr. Hooper called on me and said that they wanted to do business in palm oil, or rather that they wanted capital, bat were otherwise perfectly solvent, and I believed him—he mentioned palm oil as the business he wished to develop, and said that there was very little risk about it—I trusted him, and the arrangement was that I should deposit certain securities with their bankers, or rather give them the scurrile to deposit with their bankers, so that they should raise a loan on them—I was to receive the interest as before and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent, on the money they had at the bank—on 10th February I took to their office some Gape of Good Hope Stock, Portuguese Stock, Alleghany Railway Co., Baltimore and Ohio, and East India Railway Stock, total value 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I left with them, and they gave me a letter with a stamp on it—I redeemed them on 5th September by paying 6,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was a further amount of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. held by some brokers; the defendants sold them and paid me the margin—in the beginning of 1883 they induced me to join them in the purchase of a steamer, and then some of the securities were realised or changed, and I deposited some fresh ones and had another letter from them; 12,900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was made up thus, 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the steamer and the remainder for the loan and interest—I obtained judgment for that amount and the interest, and all together amounted to 6,900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not authorise the defendants or either of them to use my securities to protect themselves on the Stock Exchange, or to deposit them with brokers, I knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was an old friend of Hooper and knew his family—I was under the impression that they were going to employ my money in palm oil—they were to use this additional capital as they pleased in their business—I cannot say that I knew that up to the last they were using it in their business—I was very often there—I did not know till September, 1883, that negotiations wore going on with a foreign gentleman to join them in their business, who was to bring in 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; either Hooper or Lisner told me so—I brought an action against them through Mr. Crump, my solicitor, for the amount of my debt before they filed their petition, and I got judgment for the full amount—originally I was no party to this prosecution; at the time they failed I did not contemplate prosecution, nor did I ever do so of my own accord—I had no communi<lb/>cation with Mr. Saffery before the prosecution was started; a gentleman was acting for me, I was away from town—I don't know whether any one communicated with Mr. Saffery on my behalf—after judgment was signed I entered into an agreement with Lisner and Hooper for 'the payment of my debt by instalments—the Tirgo was the steamer which was bought—an attempt was made to turn her into a limited company, and I was one of the proposed directors—after they had raised a mortgage</p>

               <p>on her they turned the remaining interest over to me—I do not know that the defendants sold palm oil largely in 1881.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I knew nothing about their business except what they told me, and being an old friend I believed it—I have not got 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. Under my judgment—they turned the steamer over to me with the mortgage on her, and virtually uninsured, because the policies of insurance were unsaleable—that was in September, when I knew the state of their business—I am taking no part in this prosecution, but I am subpœnaed as a witness.

                  </hi>.

                  </hi>. I am the principal of a college at Chatham House, Ramsgate, where I reside—on 28th January last Herbert called on me with some one whom I have not seen since—he sent in this card: "Sidney Franklin, 36, York Place, W."—he said he wished to put a nephew of his to school, and would I show him round—they introduced one another as brothers—Herbert said it was their sister's child and she was in Paris—he spoke with a little broken accent—he wrote the name of the sister Madame Blanchoux on the back of the card in my presence—I showed him over the school; altogether they were there about an hour or more looking over it—as they were going away he said "By the way, can you tell us anything about stocks, and recommend us whether to sell some Egyptian Unified?"—I said "I know nothing about them," and that they had better ask their friend who they said told them to come to me—both of them spoke; Herbert did the principal talking—Mr. Gwadella was mentioned as the name of the friend who they said had introduced them to me—I knew a Mr. Gwadella—after that they left, and I heard nothing more of them or of the sister's child until 15th February—on that date I received this letter referring to the call which they had made on me. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 36, York Square, and stated Sidney Franklin had written to his sister advising her to send her son to the school, and that she had written stating that she left Paris that week, and would call at the school; that he wanted another prospectus to give to a friend who wished to place a boy at boarding-school; that he was unable to see Gwadella, as he was away from town, and that he would esteem it a favour if Mr. Banks would send him a line of introduction to some City firm who could advise him as to the reinvestment of his Egyptian Stock, which he was desirous of realising.</hi>) I replied to that, enclosing one of my own visiting cards, with the words "To introduce Sidney Franklin" on it—I addressed the letter to York Place—I did not see or hear anything more of the prisoner until I went to the Guildhall and saw him in custody—I did not see the sister or her child.</p>

Gripper Banks, "The College, Ramsgate, to introduce Mr. Sidney Franklin.</hi>") He said "I want to sell 4,000 Egyptian Unified Bonds, and reinvest the proceeds, and to buy Great Western, I think, with the proceeds"—my partner said "Have you the bonds?"—he said "Yes"—my partner said "Have you them with you?"—he said "No, but I can let you have them to-morrow"—I was sitting at my desk and I wrote out this</p>

E. Gripper Banks, of Ramsgate"—I asked him to initial the altering and he initialled it "S.F."—he said "You will sell the stock to-day"—I said "Is the contract to go to this address?"—he said "Yes, you will sell the stock to-day," and I again said "Is the contract to go to that address?"—he said "The contract has to go to that address"—he then left—I knew the Rev. E.G. Banks by name as an intimate friend of my father—after Hurwitz had gone I made further inquiries, and eventually received some communication from Messrs. Crews and Lichtenstadt, and after that I wrote a letter on the same day, the 18th, to Sidney Franklin, at his address, making reference to the Egyptain debate in the House of Parliament, and saying as it was so uncertain we should like the bonds before we sold them—I had no answer to that and no bonds—I did not sell any for the prisoner—I did not see Hurwitz again till the 25th February, when I saw him in the detective office, Old Jewry, and recognised him as the same person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carriage-builder of 43, Crawford Street, Bryanston Square—about the middle of January a messenger came to me from Mr. Hawkins with a memorandum—I wrote a memorandum in reply, enclosed my card, a similar one to this, with it, and sent it back by the messenger to Mr. Hawkins—about half an hour afterwards two men whom I cannot recollect called with the memorandum which I had sent to Mr. Hawkins—they placed a card, I don't know if it was their own, in my hand, I took very little notice of it, and put it on one side—I am certain Hurwitz was not one of them, and I question about Herbert; he seemed to me to be a much younger man, 19 or 20 at the outside—I had some conversation with the persons, I did not give them any recommendation to anybody—I destroyed the memorandum they brought from Mr. Hawkins—Mr. Hawkins asked me to recommend him a respectable stockbroker, and I in my memorandum recommended Messrs. Crews and Lichtenstadt as respectable stockbrokers—these persons brought my memorandum and wanted to know if Crews and Lichtenstadt was a respectable firm, as so much had been said in the newspapers lately about stockbrokers—I confirmed their respectability—some arrangements were made—I saw no more of them—I do not believe I gave them any card like this, if I did it was simply for the address for them to come again, as they appointed to come again on the following Monday.</p>

I said I should be pleased to make an appoint<lb/>ment to go down—you asked me if you could go, and I said "No" I had not given you the card as an introduction—I did not say if I had given you my card as an introduction I should have written my name on the back of it—I did not write on the one I sent to Mr. Hawkins because I knew him, and my card was sufficient.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Recalled</hi>). (<hi rend="italic">The letter was dated 7, Portland Terrace, Regent's Park, 16th January</hi>, 1884. "Gentlemen,—You are recommenced to me by Mr. Fairbridge, who gave me his card to enclose. I wish you to sell out for me 5,000 Egyptian Unified Stock at the opening of the market in the morning. I shall feel obliged if you will let me know at what price you can purchase Metropolitan Board of Works Stock, as I wish to invest part of my Egyptian Stock in same. Trusting that you will do your best on my behalf, yours faithfully, Sidney Franklin.") I knew Mr. Fairbridge, and believed the statements contained in that letter—in consequence of it I gave instructions to sell 5,000 Egyptian Unified Stock to Mr. Blew Jones, and it was sold at 66 1/2—on the same day I sent a telegram to the address, Portland Terrace, and received this letter, signed in the same handwriting: "7, Portland Terrace, Regent's Park, January 17th, 1884: Gentlemen,—I am in receipt of your wire of to-day, and letter confirming the sale of my 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Egyptian Unified Bonds. As Mr. Fairbridge's introduction is not sufficient I can refer you to a friend of mine, Mr. Jackson, manager of the Bayswater Investment Company, 131, Inverness Terrace. I may add that I do not require any credit from you, as I shall not ask you to deliver me any stock that you may purchase for me until I give you my bonds in exchange. Yours faithfully, Sidney Franklin"—after that I received no bonds from the person—30th January was the settling day—on the 30th I had to comply with the bargain, and on the 31st, not having received the bonds from Sidney Franklin, I purchased 5,000 Egyptians in the market in order to carry out my contract; the price had gone up to 68 5/8, and I thereby incurred a loss of 112<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on the 31st January I sent to 7, Portland Terrace the contract notes with this letter and account. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that having heard nothing Mr. Bullet had bought 5,000 Egyptian Unified for cash, to cover the amount sold on 30th January, and that according to the account enclosed the amount due was</hi> 112<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.)—the letter was returned marked as it now appears on the envelope "Gone away in the night without paying rent or tradesmen"—when I sold the Egyptian Unified I certainly believed Franklin had the bonds or the order would not have been executed—I should not have done business for a stranger supposing some stranger had simply written to me, it was in consequence of Mr. Fairbridge's name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Herberi.</hi> I sent you a telegram and letter on the</p>

Egyptian—I sent no contract then, I kept that till the 31st because of inquiries I made on the 17th which were not satisfactory, and we did not care for our contract being shown about by you—your reply showed you were aware the stock was kept open from the 17th to the 31st—this is a copy of our letter to you (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>). (<hi rend="italic">This stated that agreeably with instructions Crews and Lichienstadt had sold that morning </hi>5,000 <hi rend="italic">Egyptian Unified at </hi>66 1/2, <hi rend="italic">and that they had acted on the assumption that the prisoner was personally known to Mr. Fairbridge, that they found on inquiry he was not personally acquainted with him, and that they should require London references before completing the transaction. The letter of 30th January expressed surprise at the non-delivery of the </hi>5,000<hi rend="italic">l. Egyptian, and stated that unless received before one to-morrow the amount would have to be bought on the market and the prisoner held re<lb/>possible for any loss</hi>)—I saw Mr. Fairbridge after the transaction, and after telegraphing, I asked him if he had given you his card—he said he had not, and so I withheld the contract—it is the practice on the Stock Exchange to send the contract at the same time as the sale is made—I did not send it for the reason stated—the contract is not a necessary adjunct, it is not more binding than my letter—we were morally certain of the matter, but not legally, till three weeks after, and then sent the contracts with a view to the ultimate proceedings we have taken—I had suspicion on the day you called after the transaction—at 4 o'clock Mr. Fairbridge called and aroused our suspicions—a telegram from Mr. Fairbridge's son induced us to do the business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Mr. Fairbridge said he had no knowledge of giving the card, and positively denied having given it as an introduction—I believed the letter which enclosed the card as to facts—I believed the statement in it that "Mr. Fairbridge gave me the card as an introduction to you"—if I had known it was not true I should not have carried out this transaction—I believed his statement that he had the bonds, and that he would send them—I sent a telegram to Mr. Fairbridge to know if the introduction had been given, that was answered by Mr. Fairbridge's son, and afterwards Mr. Fairbridge called, and in consequence of our conversation I did not send the contract note that night—the contract note is merely a memorandum to our client that the stock has been sold.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By Herbert.</hi> I did of not sell the stock when it remained stationary two or three days afterwards, because you might have brought the bonds at any time and completed the transaction—we had no reason to believe you would not effect your bargain on the 30th—I have never neared of any one canceling a contract because he has not received the contract note; that is never done—the contract is no good in a legal sense—I should not have asked for that contract back if anything had been wrong—the contract is only a memorandum between the client and myself.</p>

Yours, Sidney Franklin. "That was on the 16th—they came again on the Thursday, the following day, about 10.30, and took my drawing-room apartments—this is the address they had given me on a previous occasion as a refer<lb/>ence, "47, Hamilton Gardens, St. John's Wood"—they came in on the 17th, bringing a large trunk, and left on the following Wednesday, the 23rd, in the night—I did not know they were going—I found they were gone—my servant brought down a key and this note to me on Thursday morning: "Wednesday night. Madam,—I regret that owing to dis<lb/>appointment I am obliged to leave you without notice. I am sure that you would let my bill go on if I wished it, but in case no better luck turns up, I do not wish to put you to a further loss; directly I am in a position to settle the small amount I am indebted to you I shall call upon you. I leave the latchkey with this on the chest of drawers. Yours truly, Sidney Franklin. "This was all I saw of him till he was in custody—the box was gone—Sidney used to call his brother Herbert—the day after they came in I spoke to them as they went out—I said "Good morning; you gentlemen are going out early"—they said "We are going out early into the City; my brother has some stock to sell in the Greek funds, and as it is not very safe just now, and he wishes to sell out and buy in again; we want to find a respectable broker"—I said "Of course that is quite necessary that they should be respectable"—as I was moving round he said "We have been told the name of Crews and Lichtenstadt"—I think it was on the Wednesday on which they left I had been to 47, Hamilton Gardens, to make inquiries, and I told them I had been there, and they left the same evening—a letter came for them; I don't know the date—I wrote this upon the back "Gone away in the night without paying rent or tradesmen," and after<lb/>wards gave it to the postman—in consequence of the conversation I had had about a respectable stockbroker I looked in the directory, and called on Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am a stockbroker, of 21, Threadneedle Street—I know Richard Garland—on the 12th of January Herbert called on me—he gave his card similar to this—he said his name was Lawrence Polham, 31, Warwick Road, Maida Hill, and he wanted a stockbroker, and his friend Mr. Garland had recommended me to him—that he had 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to invest, and wished to buy some Pestornier shares and some Ottoman Bank shares—it came to about 80 Ottoman Bank and 160 Pestornier shares—I think he wanted more Pestornier and I could not get them—I went down to the house and bought the Ottoman and Pestornier, and before he left told him I had done so and rave him the contracts—afterwards, in consequence of information I had, I wrote to him; I could not swear to the date. (<hi rend="italic">Herbert here stated that the witness did write a tetter, which he had destroyed. The letter was dated January, 13th, and stated that Mr. Taylor would have declined to do business with Herbert without further reference had he known that Mr. Garland only knew him as having once called; that he must ask for a satisfactory reference or 20 per cent. on account, and that he would close the account if he had no answer before 4 o'clock on Monday.</hi>) I received an answer in a lady's writing—I or my clerk wrote to him on the 18th.

Grand Trunk Preference Stock—he was very particular that it should not exceed the sum of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he was anxious that the business should be done immediately—I went into the market and purchased the stock as nearly as possible to the value of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., giving him the contracts—I was not satisfied with my client's appearance, and rather pointedly asked him if it was his first Stock Exchange transaction—he said "Yes," and in course of conversation he informed me he had the money, and would probably bring it before the account day—he took the contract note away with him—I immediately called on Mr. Startin, and in consequence of what he said I went to my solicitors and gave them instructions to act—I am not quite clear whether he said he had this money before I purchased, I certainly believed at the time he had the money for investment—I should not have done the business if I had supposed it was a speculation—I afterwards received back my contract note with a placard, "Brokers Beware," which I posted in the Stock Exchange—it created a mob, and was torn down—as far as I recollect the letter was to the effect that as I did not care to be a stockbroker, he returned the contract note, and the only Question he raised was, he told me he did not represent himself as Mr. martin's friend—the prisoner led me to believe that Mr. Startin had personal knowledge of him—the same post that brought back the contract-note also brought this letter, signed E.

I was with the last witness when the two prisoners were taken into custody—at the station I searched Herbert and found on him some blank cheques on the City Bank, Ludgate Hill Branch, and these memoranda; one, a notice, is from the City Bank to close Mr. Sidney Franklin's account—this is a letter from a gentleman with a school at Margate who expects a visit from the sister, and wants to know when the boy is coming—I also found two pawnbrokers' duplicates, one for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a table cover, pledged by Mr. Hurwite, and one for a coat and vest for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., pledged by Mr. French—there were some cards with the name Sidney Franklin, 36, York Place, and three keys—I afterwards went to 36, York Place, and with two of the keys opened a drawer and a box, where I found thirty-six pawnbrokers' duplicates,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and clerk to the West Ham Local Board—the defendant has been in their service some time and he was appointed on May 29th as collector by this minute (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for the Plaistow Ward—I also produce a minute of February 10th, 1880, relating to his remuneration. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that his remuneration was to be </hi>8<hi rend="italic">d. in the pound, but was never to exceed </hi>350<hi rend="italic">l. a year</hi>)—he was paid at that rate after that time—on 19th December, 1883, he was suspended by the Finance Committee at their monthly meeting, after which he came to my office, 5, Fen church Buildings, and said "I am deficient in my accounts with the Local Board"—I said "I shall be obliged to use against you anything You may say in the event of a prosecution taking place"—he said "Yes, I suppose that will be so, but I intend to throw myself on the mercy of the Board; I have been using the money I collected to pay a rate which I am also collecting for the Dagenham Commissioners, but of which I have collected very little, but when I have collected the</p>

               <p>whole there will be 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to me; I have plenty of money to meet the amount due by me to the Board, which is about 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. over that"—that conversation was on December 22nd, when the books were in Mr. Macdonald's hands for investigation—on the 8th of January the Board instructed me to give him into custody—I was present at the meeting of the Finance Committee when he was suspended; he was asked to give any explanation he liked, but did not do so—as a clerk to the Losal Board of West Ham it was no part of his duty to be collecting the Dagenham rate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been living in the same neighbourhood of the last ten years, and have known him living there during that time—I have understood that he collected rents for private clients—I have been to his private house and seen this address card of his (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Mr. Hollington is a client of mine—I know as a matter of notoriety that the prisoner was employed in collecting for private individuals and for the Dagenham Commissioners, and for building societies—I know of a reward being offered three years ago for the restoration of a bag containing a number of receipts which I understood was lost from the top of an omnibus—when this matter turned up on the 19th De<lb/>cember, the auditors were engaged in their audit up to March, 1883, and would require the receipts before March, 1883, not after—the next rate would be dated the first part of April, they were made every half-year in two instalments, which renders it a quarterly payment—the auditor said that he should be obliged to surcharge Mr. Ashdown for a considerable sum which he had not collected out ought to have collected before March, 1883—here Are three cheques for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., paid to my clerk—there was nothing wrong in his employing my clerk to help, the Chairman knew it—I do not remember his telling the Finance Committee on the 19th that he was muddled in his accounts through having too much to do, or that he was embarrassed by the loss of the receipt-book; he was in a highly nervous state, and offered no explanation that I recollect—I only had one interview with him in the private office—Mr. Enett was the chairman, I do not think he is here—immediately on his suspension he was asked to hand over all the books he had to Mr. McDowall, and he did so—all the receipt books are printed at the expense of the Board, and supplied by them—I do not suggest that he surreptitiously procured a receipt-book to be printed—Plaistow has increased enormously of late years, it doubled between 1860 and 1870, and since then has doubled again, and that would double the amount of work—the maximum of 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was first put down on the 10th of February, 1880—the work had increased then, but there were a large number of factories—before that some of the collectors were getting nearly 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I do not think 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was exceeded—he told me he had been paying over to the Dagenham Commissioners about 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as if he had collected it, when he had not—he said "When I have collected the 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which belongs to me I propose to pay it to the Local Board for the amounts I have collected and not accounted for—I did not hint that he should make a payment as early as possible; I said, "I can't advise you in any way"—he did not say, "If I make a payment at once will they assist me?"—he said he could mortgage his property, or sell property, and he might get something from his brother and collect the Dagenham Commissioners account, and</p>

               <p>so make his accounts all right—he said he had plenty of money to pay the amount due to the Board, and he showed me a statement; I have not got it—he put down his house in it as having cost about 1,150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he said he had mortgaged it for 650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he had some cottages at Plaistow which would come to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he had 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. invested in a building society, and then this 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the Dagenham Commissioners', and he said, "I can pay all I owe and leave a large surplus"—I had a bond of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the Guarantee Society, and it was leaving that out, I understand, that he paid 345<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the Board's credit on 4th January this year, and about 10th January they got the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the Guarantee Society—I don't think that was before he was in custody, but here is the banker's account (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I paid in the money on 18th January—I made no note of how long it was in my possession—I did not know that anything would turn upon it—I don't think I paid the Guarantee Society's cheque in to my own account—the receipt shows that although the cheque of the company was drawn on 30th October it was not handed to Ashdown till 2nd November—a cheque for 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid to the credit of the Local Board on 3rd November—my clerk knows more of the business of the office than I do—the prisoner bears the highest possible character in the neighbourhood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the prisoner at the Town Hall, Stratford—he has to deal with the rate-book, the receipt-book, and the monthly statement—the rate-book shows the amount of the assess<lb/>ment, and therefore the amounts it was his duty to collect, and when he had collected them it was his duty to enter them in the deposit book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here is a column for "Date when received," and then the amounts received—he made entries in this book from time to time, and he ought also to enter in it the amounts he paid in to the bank account—printed receipt-books were supplied to him for each rate in this form, and lately there has been a double counterfoil for the first and second moiety of the rate—there used to be separate receipts for each quarter—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is for the rate made October 23rd, 1883; it is the receipt given by Ashdown for 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Spencer, Chapman, and Co., which sum has never been entered in the collector's deposit book—he paid the bank on the 12th 319<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which purports to be money received by him and entered by him as received—the next sum is 243<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 13th October, and a country cheque for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the same date—there are subsequent payments on the 15th, 16th, and 17th—the sums are under the heading of "Receipts for rates," and the whole added together ought to make up the sum—the book is balanced every week as a rule—he might apply the payments of the cheques under the heading of "Receipts"—when the book is balanced it is in the sense of paying over to the bank the amount he has received, and only that amount—if he has not acknow<lb/>ledged that amount he has not charged himself with it—the cheque for 73<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is dated 19th October, 1883, and the receipt by Ashdown is 23rd October; that sum in not entered in his book as received, or included in the amounts paid over, nor this cheque of 30th October for 807<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from the London and St. Katherine Docks either—this letter of application</p>

W. A.," on the cheque are his—the cheque for 73<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bears his signature—345<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was required to be paid in oh 3rd January; the prisoner told me he had paid it in on account of the surcharge on empty houses—that had nothing to do with these matters—the amount of the surcharge was about 395<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was charging him with what he said he had not received, and he paid the 345<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon it—he has not paid any other sum with regard to those deficiencies to my knowledge—he employed me to go through the books long before the auditor made the surcharge, and I rendered him assistance and was paid for it by him.</p>

Edwards and Charlton, of 44, Queen's Road, Holloway—after he came I missed some goods, and in consequence of something that was told me I gave him in custody on the 25th—he made a statement to me in consequence of which I went with Mellish next day to Edwards's house, and saw Mellish take some gloves from the pocket of a coat—I found my private mark in them—I had bought them of Dent and Allcroft—this is the invoice—these are the gloves and here are fourteen pairs more which were found on Taylor—they all have my mark "b. m. l."</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my brother, the prisoner, at 5, St. Helena Road, Rotherhithe—on 4th February we had a few words about my child being taken away by its father, Vincent Coleman—I did not want it moved, and slapped the prisoner in the face, and then threw a glass at him and hurt his eye; I am very sorry for it—he then hit me back again; I really forget what with—he has been a father to me—I have been examined before. (<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition before the Magistrate was hers read to here which stated:</hi> "I had a few words with my brother, the prisoner; he hit me on the head with the hammer.") I cannot say whether that is true; I was excited at that time. (<hi rend="italic">The witness was cautioned by the Court that she had sworn to tell the whole truth.</hi>) I have no recollection of the prisoner hitting me over the head with a hammer—I said before "I don't remember if I did anything to the prisoner," but now I say that I slapped his face, and hit him with a glass—I was a good deal excited; I had just come out of the hospital, and my two brothers came in—I was taken to the hospital that night; I had blood on me, but I did that myself falling downstairs—I jumped out of the window because I threw a glass at him, and I wanted to get away—I said nothing before the Magistrate about falling downstairs; I said that my brother was mad drunk—I have no recollection of his hitting me with anything.</p>

She said, 'Yes, he is, and mother is living at home'"—I said to the prisoner, "Have you another wife?"—he said "No"—I told him I should take him to the station—from information I received from the second wife I went to 107, Cable Street, St. George's-in-the-East, where I saw the first wife.</p>
