               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long had Loate been in the shop? - About twenty minutes; she came in after the prisoners were brought back; Miss Parnell served her, she was in the shop about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes; she sold her a half shawl.</p>

               <p>Did you know him before? - Never saw him before.</p>
               <p>What did you do in consequence thereof? - I called out stop thief, and in consequence some people brought the man back in the course of a quarter or half an hour.</p>
               <p>Had you such a view of him as to know he was the same person that stole the cloaks? - By three men coming in, I cannot tell which it was till he was brought back.</p>
               <p>Where was you? - In a room by the shop, and sat in a chair opposite the door, where I could perfectly see them, as the door between the shop and parlour was open.</p>
               <p>Do you know it was the prisoner, or might it be somebody else? - I do not know, it was one of the three; the cloaks and the prisoner were brought back together, but whether he was the man that took them or no, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would wish to ask the lady whether she saw me come out with the cloaks under my arm? - No, I did not, but I can positively recollect, he was one of the three that was in the shop.</p>

Smith;" he told her if you will send your girl with me to the Excise Office, I will give you the 3 s. in change, the girl followed him so close, he tried to get rid of her; at last he gave her the change, he gave her three shillings, the girl went home, soon after this Beardmore applied to the Excise office, and upon producing this receipt, it appeared to be very manifest it was not any person belonging to the Excise office, or that was entitled to receive it; Beardmore desired therefore that Mrs. Palmer might attend; they attended, and when they came, there was some suspicions arose on the prisoner at the bar, from his known character and situation in the office; and being shewn among other persons, Mrs. Palmer, together with the girl, immediately pitched on the man, as the man who had been there pretending to be a clerk of the Excise, intitled to receive the money for this six weeks duty, and had given the receipt in the name of Smith; upon this the prisoner was committed for the offence, and having given a receipt for the payment of this sum of 18 s. You may well conceive that the Excise office would not on the consideration of so small a sum have taken up this prosecution, but it is a very material question to the revenue, and to the public in general, if persons employed under that office, who by being employed easily learn the different sums due, either from publicans, or other persons, liable to pay duties, by this manoeuvre of theirs, knowing, as they must do frequently, that the sums are in arrear; if, by going to persons that owe the money, they get it, it becomes a very serious thing to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178907080011"/>the public; you see in this case, his having been an officer in the Excise he knew how to commit this fraud, because he knew very well that in general these publicans were sometimes in arrear in their payments, he knew likewise what was very true, that carrying these receipts in his pocket, would forward his design; says he, you see there are three receipts of the same kind; when persons are employed in this way it is necessary they should be careful of what is entrusted to them; he knew perfectly well the whole manner of conducting this business, he knew he could by an artful tale impose on the publicans, and by that defraud the public and the revenue; he knew perfectly well that the Excise office always give receipts with particular caution on the back of the licences, he to avoid that gives it on a distinct piece of paper; if there was any doubt of his not knowing the fraud, why go by a false name? his name was not Smith, his name was Sutton; he had represented himself as an officer of Excise under that name, that name was made use of to avoid detection. Gentlemen, the facts I have opened to you lie in a very narrow compass: his going and his pretending to be an officer; his writing a receipt: for it is not left as a vague uncertain point, who wrote the receipt; he himself wrote the receipt in the name of Smith; so I shall prove that his name is not Smith, but Sutton; where then can be the doubt but he was conscious at the time of being guilty of forgery, and endeavouring to defraud the publican of 18 s.? Gentlemen, in this great town, these frauds amount to very large sums indeed. The revenue is defrauded by a number of tricks by those persons that ought to protect them, and when found out it becomes a serious question indeed, because that confidence that is placed in them makes an exemplary punishment necessary: Gentlemen, I shall prove these facts, which seem to be very short, and when I have done that, it will become your duty to pronounce the prisoner guilty of the charge, as laid in the indictment.</p>

               <p>What passed? - He asked me if Mr. Beardmore was at home; I told him he was not; he asked me when I thought he would be; I told him it was uncertain; he told me that our six weeks licence was deficient, and the payments were due, it was not paid up; he said he was sent from the office, that he was a clerk there, and if it was not paid, it was one hundred pounds penalty, and five pounds if it was not paid that forenoon; I told him my uncle said that it was of no consequence, for it was to be paid up when he renewed his licence, all together; he said it was no such thing, for it was dangerous if it was not paid then, or something of that kind. He asked me if he could see the licence; I told him I could fetch it; I fetched it down, and wished him to write on the back of the licence; he shewed me his pocket book, and told me I need not think he was a deceiver, for by that I might know he was come from the office; so I fetched the licence down, and gave him the money; I wished him to write on the back of the licence, but he refused; I gave him two half guineas, the money due was 18 s. for three payments; he said it was of no use to write on the back of the licence, so he wrote on a bit of paper, and said my uncle might take that when he went to the office, and it would answer the same; that what was wrote on the back of the licence must be done at the office.</p>
               <p>Look at that paper? - That is the paper he wrote, which I afterwards gave to Mr. Law.</p>
               <p>After you had given the two half guineas, and he wrote that, what did he do afterwards? - I told him I had no change, and he said he had none; I had a little girl in the room going of thirteen, and he said if I would send her with him, he would send the change back.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am entirely innocent of any forgery whatever; and there is no person in the office whatever that is authorised to receive any licence, which I believe Mr. Law will acquaint you and the honorable Court.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Silvester. You have taken upon you in the indictment to describe this house by the sign of the Bunch of Grapes, and the licence is by the sign of the Grapes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. It only states it is known by the sign of the Bunch of Grapes, it does not state it is so.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Law. Do you know this house? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, the only evidence to serve me on this business, I subpoened today, and he will not be in town till tomorrow, which is one Mr. Davidson of London-wall; I have a wife and four children, and I hope for the mercy of the Court in my situation.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, the prisoner seems to wish to point out to you that there was no person in the office of the name of Smith, entitled to receive the money, and that if he had signed Sutton, she would have paid him. To dispose of the first question, it does not in any degree alter the nature of the crime; the crime of forgery consists in making a false writing with intent to deceive or defraud another; and it is perfectly immaterial, considering this offence, whether the name that is written be that of a person in existence, or of a person that never existed in the world; if the name be false, that is all that is required; then upon that fact, and in order to see whether the name is false or not, it was necessary for them to prove that this receipt given by him, was given in a false way; in order to do that, they have proved to you, by two witnesses, that the prisoner's name is Sutton; if his name is Sutton, and he assumed another name, and signs this receipt by the name of Smith, it is a false receipt, it is a false writing, any name that he had made use of, which was not his name, makes it a false writing, and the very purpose for which a man makes use of another name, and not his own, is to deceive and to defraud; for it is to prevent detection; and if they had not known him by person, they never could have found out that he was the same man; he thinks fit to sign this receipt with the name of Smith; therefore there is no question, but that in point of law it is a false writing, which will constitute the offence of forgery, if it is done with intent to deceive. The next article is that it was immaterial whether he had used the name of Smith or his own name, namely that of Sutton; but that would make no difference in the offence, whatever his name had been, she said she would have paid the money, because she referred to that authority with which he pretended to be cloathed; for he came to her in the character of a clerk of the Excise-office; and if he was a clerk in that office, she giving credit to his report that he was so, it was perfectly immaterial whether his name was Sutton, Smith, or any thing else; therefore these two points will not serve the prisoner at all, if you believe the evidence, and are satisfied upon it; with respect to the intention it is laid in the indictment in different ways; first to defraud the King; secondly to defraud Mr. Beardmore; it is not worth an observation to state any distinction between them. The prisoner by means of this receipt did obtain the eighteen shillings; of which sum, if the receipt had passed genuine, the King would have been defrauded; if it turns out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178907080015"/>afterward, and is detected as a forgery, the case is that Beardmore is defrauded, and must pay it over again. Gentlemen, if upon these facts you are satisfied that the prisoner gave this receipt in a false name, with intent to defraud, you will find him guilty; if not, you will acquit him.</p>

               <p>How came you to know it was a capital offence, to steal these articles in this way? - I know I was a sufferer by what I lost.</p>
               <p>What instructions did you give the officer about this indictment? - I told the gentleman that I had lost three gowns, valued at 40 s. a gown; a petticoat, value 5 s. another petticoat, value 5 s. a pair of laced ruffles, and a black silk petticoat.</p>
               <p>What did the officers say to you? - They said nothing to me, they asked me what I valued my things at? - I valued them as low as I could.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the things would sell at the value you put upon them? - A great deal more.</p>
               <p>Are there any other lodgers in your house? - No, I have nobody else, but myself and my daughter; the prisoner appeared like a gentlewoman, she locked the door when she went away; and took the key with her, which was about six o'clock.</p>
               <p>But during the time you saw your things last, in the morning; after the time you saw your things, was not your door left open occasionally, as it used to be before? - I used to shut my dining room door.</p>
               <p>But did not lock it? - No.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I do not know the prosecutrix; about an hour ago she came with a gentleman to the Bail dock, and a person was standing at the window; she said, is your name Smith? She said, No, this is Mrs. Smith. Very well, says the prosecutrix, then we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178907080019"/>shall know her in Court; and the goaler knows it.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Is this true that you went to the Bail dock? - Do you think she will not say any thing? No, my Lord; a Gentleman enquired for her.</p>
               <p>Was it in your presence, and at your request? - No, he came to me, and told me she was there, it was a gentleman, I stood upon the stairs, her name is on the list; I had no occasion to go to see her, I knew her face very well.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that is the woman? - I wish I was as sure of entering the kingdom of heaven.</p>
               <p>PRISONER.</p>
               <p>I am quite a stranger; I have no witnesses, but there are women in the Bail Dock, that heard the prosecutrix make mention of these words.</p>

               <p>I am Surveyor to the Chelsea waterworks Company.</p>
               <p>How do you make it appear that these are a Company? - They are a body corporate; they are known by repute, to be the Governor and Co. of the Chelsea waterworks; this lead was lost on the 10th of June, I was sent for and informed the two prisoners were in custody for stealing of lead; I never saw them till I saw them at the Public office. I first saw the lead at St. George's work-house, it had a day or two before been taken off some iron railling that I had surveyed, which was round a bason in <placeName id="t17890708-15-crimeloc75">Hyde park</placeName>

               <p>When you last saw it, was it separated from the railing or not? - It was quite separate from the railing; taken and put in a stable. I believe I saw it the day before; I did not see it on the prisoner; I can safely swear it belongs to the Chelsea water works, it was cut off in a particular manner; there is no particular stamp, I should have known it at York.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman of St. George's, Hanover-square; the corner of Park-street; I stopped the prisoner Delany, at half past four in the morning, on the 10th of June; I perceived him coming from the top of Park-lane, which is a very little distance from where the lead was brought, very near the stables, he had it on his back, he did not perceive me, I let him come up to me, I was standing against a post, then I crossed and met him; I said, my friend, you are heavy loaded; yes, said he; says I, what have you there? he said it was immaterial, it did not signify; says I, it does signify to me, I insist on stopping you; he seemed very much agitated; he said if I would go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178907080023"/>back with him, he would convince me, that such a gentleman gave it him: meaning Mr. Bonniface, collector of the water tax; then again he deviated from that, and mentioned the turn-cock, whose name is Waddingham; I took him to the watch-house, and fetched the other prisoner from his master's house, the Collector's house; I understood he was a hired servant, there was no lead upon him, but I saw it in the stable, I offered to serve Delany the prisoner, to go to any friend to assist him, in my power; by that, he desired me to go into the Park, to stand against the rails, and to call John the Trunk-man; I thought this person might be an accomplice; I went into the Park, it was early between four and five in the morning; I saw a gentleman fishing at the bason, and I enquired for John the Trunk-man; I received intelligence of him. I called, he did not answer; presently I saw the stable door open, and he was sweeping the stable, this was about a quarter of an hour after I took the lead from the other prisoner; I called him by the name of John the Trunkman; he answered by that name. I am upon my oath, and I trust I know what the nature of an oath is. Mr. Bonniface lives in the house, the prisoner did not acknowledge he was a servant of his; I cannot say I ever saw him act as such.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is Lilley a house-keeper? - Yes, he is; I asked Lilley to come with me to the watch house, he went then, when I was shewing him down stairs to Delany, and coming to the place where he was generally confined, he drew back, and said you want to lock me up; Delany called me up, I cannot recollect the conversation; but he said before the watch-house keeper, he gave me leave to take a little bit; upon that the watch-house keeper thought fit to lock him up; Mr. Bonniface asked the prisoners how they could do such a thing; and they said it was the first time, and they hoped he would forgive them.</p>
               <p>Had you offered them any favour? - No, none, he only said, they must take the course of Justice.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I went to Mr. Spratt's, shoemaker, No. 9, if my memory assists me right, where I lived very retired; I went there in the name of Smith, coming to a long law-suit I had; I lodged at Mr. Anderson's; I went to be retired intirely till I had sold my estate, which is in America, General Wade is my brother; I told them I was a person come from the country; and had ten pounds a year, and would do some needle work; one night at Mr. Spratt's I was met by an elderly gentleman, I had a few sprats in my hand, I was very ill at that time with St. Anthony's fire in my face, that no person who saw me then could know me again; the gentleman came and spoke to me, and said, my dear, will you have a glass of wine? I knocked at the door, I never was at Mr. Spratt's from Easter Saturday till the day I was taken with this gentleman; I sat down on Monday morning and made a little frock, I thought I would go to Mr. Spratt's, and tell him the alteration of my name; I every day attended Mr. Plowden, who was going to sell my estate, and I thought I; might be met with at Mr. Spratt's; I know nothing or the gowns, I was going to Mr. Spratt's, I was never there before; I left this gentleman in the street; he says to me; will you go and drink a glass of wine? I do not drink any wine, Sir, says I; I have no business with you; he followed me; when we got to Long-lane, he took hold of my hand; I have been ill since I have been in Newgate, I have sent to my friends; Sir

               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury,</p>
               <p>As I was coming from my work, to go home to breakfast I was overtaken by two young men, whom I knew; as they were going my way, we agreed to go together. but when we came to Mr. Holcomb's house, the young men said they must call for some things; one of them took a key out of his pocket and opened the door, they went in, and desired me to follow them, saying they should not stay a minute; so I went in with them, not thinking any harm, they went up stairs, and I followed them, but soon after we were up stairs, the two young men ran away and several people came up and took me into custody, saying I was going to rob the house. My Lord and Gentlemen, I gave information who the two men were, that took me into the house; I live with my father and mother, and always work hard for my living, and ever bore the character of an honest lad. As that is the truth, and I am totally innocent of the affair, I hope your Lordship and the Gentlemen of the Jury will take<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178907080033"/>it into proper consideration, and not suffer me to come to any further trouble.</p>

             were at home, when I came home, I met the prisoner Parrot coming out of the house with the things in his apron; I asked who he had been to, and he said he had been to a lodger; I went in directly, and saw the parlour door open and the plate was gone, I came out again and made an alarm, but the prisoner was gone; I did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178907080034"/>not see the other prisoner there; I have never seen my things since.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you lock your door, when you went out? - Yes, I locked the door of the back parlour, these things were lost from the front parlour; I put the key on a cupboard close by the back parlour door, there is a way from the back parlour to the front parlour; the key was not visible to any person.</p>
               <p>Did you see him come out of the parlour? - No, out of the street door, he had a brown apron on. He was taken three hours afterwards, and taken to Justice Wilmot's office, the door was not broke, nor the lock; it was opened with my key; it was in the door when I came back, and the door open, I knew him again directly, his hand was bound up; I observed it when he came out of the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You was alarmed? - Yes, I trembled very much, I could hardly contain myself; I went to Justice Wilmot's, and saw Armstrong and Shakeshaft.</p>
               <p>Did not they tell you they would not seek for the prisoners unless they had two guineas? - Yes, one of them did.</p>
               <p>How was the man dressed, when he came out of your house? - In a greenish striped great coat very long; he had a brown jacket on when he was taken; the officers sent for me, and said they had got the persons I wanted, and I must come and swear to them.</p>
               <p>When you went out you left Mrs. Thomas and Mrs. Newman; did you leave any body else? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>How does your door open? - By a latch and a brass knob, the cupboard where I put the key, is a good way down the passage.</p>
               <p>Are your other lodgers here? - No.</p>

He stood at the door some time afterwards; I went away, and saw no more, till Mrs. Brookes came and told me the house was robbed; he was dressed in a striped green coat, and his hand bound up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow.

I heard the prisoner say somebody gave him the skin; I took the skin and delivered him to the constable there were one hundred and sixty-six skins, I told them again, and there was only one hundred and sixty-five.</p>

            , I saw a person leap over the fence into the street where I was, which I am very much acquainted with; I was about eight yards distance, I took him to be

             at that distance; I saw a light, but did not know the barn was on fire, there was a six foot paling that parted the sight, that I could not see so well, it was about half past ten at night, when he got over the pales, he ran about fifty yards, I stooped myself much, he was soon out of my sight, he ran a back way that goes into the church-yard, I called to the watchman; seeing a smoke in the barn, I judged it was on fire, the watchman and me went over the pales into Dr. Chandler's yard, I saw the fire very plain; at the front part of the barn, in the middle of the barn, away from the pales, there was a hole opposite, I handed three or four hats full of water.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever observe whether there was such a hole as that, before you saw the fire? - I cannot tell, the hole was very low down.</p>
               <p>Did you put out this fire? - Yes, we did, me and the watchman and the neighbours.</p>
               <p>Was any part of the barn burnt? - Yes, the bottom of the barn was blacked very much, there was a bit of wood that was among the rubbish.</p>
               <p>Was it a bit of wood that lay on the floor or a part of the floor? - The other witness knows more than I do, I do not take upon myself to say, from my own observation, whether any part of the barn was burnt; after we had extinguished the fire, we came out of the barn; I went and caught hold of the prisoner, and I said this is the coat, and this is the man, or else no man is him.</p>
               <p>You say you saw him eight yards from you? - Yes, at that time I thought it was the prisoner and no other man, I have known the prisoner 13 years, when I saw him come over the fence, I thought he was the man, afterwards when I saw him, I supposed him to be the same man that got over the pales; I challenged him with it, and caught hold of him; we apprehended him about a quarter of an hour after; he got over the fence, he ran fifty yards, he then got out of my sight, in turning the back way into the church-yard, which is a thoroughfare, the church-yard was a little better than fifty yards off, I challenged him with the fire; I did not hear him say any thing, he was about Hampton all the night; I did not take him into custody that night.</p>
               <p>Can you now, take upon yourself to swear that he was the man, that you saw leap over the fence? - He was to the best of my knowledge, not having hold of him, I am not so clear; I have known him thirteen years, but yet I cannot say whether it was him or not.</p>

I dare say it is 200 years old; I secured the barn when I left it, and every place was locked up, and there is an old fence, and the outside gates were locked up, it was perfectly safe, we never carry a candle there, not for many years, our horses are always done by day light: I took Denton to the magistrate, and he ordered me to take the prisoner, we went before Justice Taylor, the prisoner owned being in the yard and jumping over the pales, he owned that he saw the fire in the barn and he jumped over the pales and run into the church yard.</p>
               <p>Did the Magistrate take it in writing? - Yes.</p>

I asked him who directed him to my house; he said he could not tell me; I found the pocket-book on Ford, I suppose he hove it away, for I never saw it afterwards; Ford desired the other prisoner to go and fetch the trunk, but he was not very willing to go, and Ford went himself and brought it; in the watch-house after they were committed, I found a pair of plated shoe-buckles.</p>
