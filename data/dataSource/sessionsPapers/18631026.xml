                  </hi>. I am a wholesale milliner, of 64, Bartholomew-close—the prisoner has been in my employ from January—I took the business from him under a bill of sale, having advanced him money, and have carried it on from that time to this—I continued on, the prisoner in my service—I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week regularly—his duty was the general management of the concern—it was part of his duty to collect orders and get in money, which he was to pay over to me immediately he received it—on 26th June I gave him instructions to go to Messrs. Vyse's and to Messrs. Morrison's to receive money—he accounted to me on that day for the money he received from Morrison, and I said "Where is Messrs. Vyse's money?"—he said, "The buyer was very busy taking down stock, and had not time to pass the account, and will leave it till next week"—he has never accounted to me for that sum of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and on 10th July I dis<lb/>covered that it had been paid by Messrs. Vyse—I did not say anything to the prisoner about it, as I had discharged him before that, but not for that amount.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did you first become acquainted with the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw him first about twelve months ago, at 87, Queen-street—he was in business for himself at that place—the change in the management took place on 19th January—the first letter that passed about negotiating for the business was in August, 1862—some of the letters he wrote to me about it, are in my attorney's hands—we finally arrived at an agreement on 19th January, when I took the business under the bill, of sale, as the prisoner was unable to return me the money I had advanced him—I first had a bill of sale for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was to secure to me the goods, chattels,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186310260004"/>
               <p>and fixtures at 87, Queen-street, Cheapside, for twelve months—if that was repaid at the end of twelve months the goods and fixtures were to be released—that is dated 27th December, 1862—we entered into another one on 9th January, 1863—that was for 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I advanced 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, and the former was merged in that—that bill gave me the right, at twelve hours' notice of taking the goods if the 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not paid; if it was paid the right would cease—on 27th December it was agreed between me and the prisoner that he should pay me 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and I should act as his servant—I had sup<lb/>posed that he was in difficulties, and asked him the question, and he said he was—the second bill was given because I was not satisfied with the security of the first—a change took place in that agreement on 19th January—I gave the prisoner a written notice on 17th January that I required the repayment of the 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. within twelve hours—I knew nothing about judgments against the prisoner—I know that he was in Whitecross street; I visited him there—he did not give me any money there—I never sold any pony for him, and never saw one—his wife put about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into my hands—when I first went to the premises in Cheapside, Farnham's name was on the doorposts, and also on a glass inside—that name did not con<lb/>tinue up until the prisoner was arrested—my name was put on the office door on 20th January—his plates were not removed from the door, they were covered over with my plates about a week afterwards—I gave instruc<lb/>tions to the prisoner to order the plates to be written—I first made a claim to the goods under the bill of sale, on 19th January—I entered into posses<lb/>sion then—a claim was afterwards made by a sheriffs officer under an execution against the prisoner; that was some time in February, I think—I had to try an interpleader issue in the Exchequer—I kept the goods—the hands who made up the goods were engaged by the prisoner by my instruc<lb/>tions—he knew the business, I did not—I ordered some of the goods and the prisoner others—I never told any person that the prisoner was my partner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What became of the interpleader issue? Did you establish your claim to the goods? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the prisoner was examined as a witness on my behalf, and I heard him state that he was in my service as an assistant, at a salary of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, which was correct—it was not upon that that I established my claim to the goods; it was partly, of course—if he had said there was a partnership I should have lost my goods—the prisoner had no right to order goods on his own account—he had general instructions from me to buy what was necessary for the business—I was for many years in the grocery business—I had a little money to invest at the time, and unfortunately I invested it in this business—the first distinct account I have of paying the prisoner 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Saturday, was on 14th March; I paid him every Saturday—previous to that time I had advanced him sums 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at a time—from 14th March till he ceased to be in my service, the wages were paid regularly—I have regular entries of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. every Saturday—the bill produced is made out in my name—the prisoner did not carry bill heads about with him—this was made out at the warehouse—it is part of Messrs. Vyse's system to make out their own accounts—it is made out in my name, only without any "Co." and is receipted by the prisoner—that was the ordinary practice.</p>

I am inspector of weights and measures at Guildhall—I first knew the prisoner in April or May last—he applied to me to take a house at Stratford—he gave me a card, which I have destroyed, referring to Dr. Bruce and Mr. Hannam, of Bartholomew-close—I went there, saw the prisoner, and he introduced me to Mr. Hannam as the person he was about to take a house of—I said to the prisoner, in Hannam's pre<lb/>sence, "The reference to Dr. Bruce is satisfactory, and so is what I see here, and I let the house to you, and you only, for your family"—he said to Mr. Hannam, "The fact is, I have had these girls sleeping at the house, but I shall discontinue that and keep the house to myself," and Mr. Hannam said, "Very well"—I saw Mr. Hannam afterwards and received some rent from him for the prisoner's house—he at the same time told me to look to him for the rent, that he wished to assist Farnham, and likewise to keep a house and home over Mrs. Farnham and the family's heads—that was about 27th or 28th June.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, residing at Monkwell-street—in February of this year I applied at 87, Queen-street, Cheapside, for a situation—I saw Mr. Farnham and Mr. Hannam—Farnham said to me in Hannam's presence, that he would look at my references, and if he was satisfied I was to come on the following morning—I went there and continued in the employ about four or five months—I always thought the prisoner was a partner with Mr. Hannam—I supposed so by the way the business was carried on—sometimes Mr. Hannam kept the key of the premises, and sometimes Mr. Farnham—I have often known Mr. Hannam come late—to the premises when he had the key—I cannot say that I have heard the prisoner say anything to him upon those occasions—during the time I was there persons called to inquire for the prisoner—he was sometimes in and sometimes not—they have frequently made inquiries of Hannam, and he had said that Mr. Farnham was not there—I remember an officer calling there in February, he saw Mr. Hannam and inquired for the prisoner, and Hannam said he was not there—he just then came to the door—they removed from Queen-street, Cheapside, to Bartho<lb/>lomew-close—Hannam and Farnham carried on business there in the whole<lb/>sale millinery business—I left a week after they were in Bartholomew-close—Farnham acted there as he had done before—I went from Bartholomew-close to Wells-street—Farnham had the business there—Hannam used to come hack wards and forwards occasionally—the prisoner took some goods from Bartholomew-close to Wells-street when he moved—that was a week after I left Bartholomew-close—I left there before June—the goods were cloths and lengths of cloths, and several other things—there were two or three sewing-machines—I should say one would be worth about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. another about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and another about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was one piece of cloth of forty yards, another of twenty, and another, a shepherd's plaid, of about thirty or forty yards.</p>

I have known the prisoner since the year 1860—he was a wholesale milliner in Old-street at that time—I travelled for him—I first know Hannam at the end of 1862, November or December—I have seen the prosecutor and the prisoner together in Queen-street—I was in business at Uxbridge, and I did business with Mr. Farnham prior to his having any connexion with Mr. Hannam—I bought goods of him occasionally—at the time I saw Hannam, in 1862, I understood that he was clerk to Mr. Farnham; so Farnham represented—I saw them several times after that when I came to London on business—when I came to London in the early part of 1802, to buy some goods, I saw the name of "R. Hannam" on the door, and I immediately asked Mr. Farnham about it—I don't think Hannam was there at the time we had some conversation about that—I called there several times and saw them in the shop—Farnham took the leading part in the business, and he attended to the orders, goods, and so on—on one occasion Farnham came into the back room when Hannam and I were there smoking—Farnham said, "Well, gentlemen, this is not business, smoking"—I have seen Farnham bring in sums of money and pay them over to Mr. Hannam several times—I recol<lb/>lect him bringing in Morrison's account, and I heard him also say that he had been to Vyse's—I heard nothing pass about Vyse's account, more than that he had been there, and I saw money on the desk, and a book—I don't know what money it was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed by Her Majesty's Mint—on 15th October, in the forenoon, I went with Inspector Fife and some other officers to Commercial-street, Spitalfields, and placed myself in a position to watch the White Hart public-house—I saw the prisoners enter the house one after another (I knew Gray and Abbott before)—I followed them in with Fife, and found Gray sitting down, and the other two standing in front of him—as I entered, Watson's and Abbott's faces were towards Gray, whose back was towards me—I proceeded towards Gray, but was pushed back by Watson—Fife then laid hold of Watson, who threw these two paper parcels on to the seat, between Gray and the wall, who sat about a foot from the wall—I then saw three packets go from the woman's cloak to the same spot—Fife pushed the two away, and I pulled Gray away, and found five packets near the seat, and a calico bag containing five packets of shillings—I put my hand into Gray's trousers pocket, and asked him what he had got—he pulled out a paper parcel, and said, "You will see"—it contained twenty counterfeit crowns—he pulled another packet out of his coat pocket, and placed it on the table—I opened it, and found three small packets, each containing ten half-crowns, and four others containing ten florins each, making forty—I found a counterfeit shilling in his trousers pocket—the five packets that I took from the seat each contained ten bad shillings, and the five packets in the bag each contained ten bad shillings—the coins were all wrapped up in the usual way, with tissue paper between them to prevent their rubbing—I cannot identify the two packets that Watson threw, but</p>

               <p>the five packets contain shillings corresponding in date with some of those found in the bag—when I asked Abbott for her address at the station, Gray said, "If she was my wife, I should refuse," and then she refused.</p>

I am the wife of the last witness—the prisoner was at our house the day before she was taken—I make bonnet stocks and gentle<lb/>men's collars—she came to me about half-past 4 to get a bonnet, and I asked her if she would have something to eat—I had got a knuckle of veal; no; pork, in the place, and I asked her if she would have that—she said, 'Well, we will have a drop of beer and a little gin, where do you get your beer?"—I said, "If you will go to the large public-house you will get a good drop of beer"—she said, "Will you come with me?"—I said, "Yes," and left my husband at home—I said to him, "I have got no money in my pocket, you must give me some"—he said, "Here is a two-shilling piece—he gave it to me, and I went out with her to the Marquis of Hastings, and gave a good two-shilling piece, the same which my husband had given me—went into the house with the prisoner and gave that young woman (<hi rend="italic">Harriet Marsh</hi>) the same florin that I received from my husband—we took the gin and beer with us, and both went back home—it was about a quarter or half-past 8 on Thursday that we were in the public-house, but I did not take</p>

               <p>particular notice—we did not go for a shape for a bonnet that night—my attention was called to this matter on Friday night—I have not been examined before—early on Friday afternoon the prisoner came to me, and said, "I am going to buy the shape, and we will have a little drop of gin"—that was by ourselves—she said, "Will you go with me?"—I said, "I cannot," and she went alone—she had it purse, and I saw some money—I do not know whether it was silver, I should expect it was—it was produced in my husband's presence, shortly before she went out—I did not see her again—No. 97 came and told me that she was in custody about 6 o'clock on Friday night—I thought she had got lost, not knowing the neighbourhood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, and reside at 42, Weymouth-street—I know the prisoner—I first attended her on 4th April last, prior to her confinement; she was confined on 30th April—I saw her on 29th April—my friend Dr. Byam attended her in her con<lb/>finement as I was called out of town, but I saw her the next day; I was in the habit of attending her daily subsequent to her confinement, up to the</p>

               <p>period of her committing this act—on the morning of Friday, 31st July, I saw her at her lodging in Marylebone-road about 12 o'clock—that was a visit in consultation with Dr. Byam by appointment—the prisoner had told me prior to that that she was not friendly with Mr. Chappell, and that she should be led to do something wrong to herself and her child if she was not on friendly terms with him—when I went there on the Friday she was lying on the sofa with her Bible in her hand—I told her I had brought Mr. Byam to see her, as she was in a nervous condition, and I had some conversation with her regarding her treatment of Mr. Chappell—our conversation and consulta<lb/>tion altogether lasted about twenty minutes—she promised me to be calm and also to give up all annoyance to Mr. Chappell—I left after her promising me that she would give up all idea of doing anything to herself or child—she had told me three or four days before that she should be obliged to do something to herself or the child if she was not friendly with Mr. Chappell, and I tried to argue the point with her, and to convince her of the impro<lb/>priety of such an act—she said she would try and think well of what I had said—I told her I was sure if she would only try and be comfortable and happy, I could get a handsome settlement made upon her—I wished her to give up all annoyance of Mr. Chappell—I alluded to her excessive and numerous acts of jealousy—she told me she was jealous of Mr. Chappell; she was jealous of one particular woman, a Welsh woman; she said that Mr. Chappell showed that Welsh woman all his kindness and affection, and neg<lb/>lected her—that was not a person in the house, but another woman that she told me Mr. Chappell was keeping—I believe that was the truth—Mr. Byam and I left her on the Friday about half-past 12—a little after 4 that same afternoon the prisoner's sister, Elizabeth Mitchell, came to my house in a cab—I returned with her and went up stairs to the prisoner's room—I found both the doors locked—I asked for a hammer or poker to break open the door—a poker was brought and I broke open the panel of the door, and tried to get through, but could not, and I pushed the prisoner's sister through, and she opened the other door and let me in—I then saw the prisoner lying on the floor by the side of some drawers, all over blood, with the exception of her knees and feet—I saw that she had a very long jagged wound in the throat, extending four and a half inches—the child was lying on the right side of the bed, covered wholly, with the exception of the left leg with a pillow; it was then alive—a razor was lying on the bed—when the child was stripped I found a small incised wound between the fifth and sixth rib, just under the left nipple—I dressed the wound—the child began to be sick, and vomited until its death, which took place about half-past 12 on the following Sunday, the 2d August—I afterwards made an ex<lb/>amination of the body, at the Coroner's request—death was caused by the wound, the dagger having entered the lungs, the cavity of the thorax, escaping the heart, and going through the diaphragm—a dagger was found in my presence on the Sunday evening by one of the policemen—at the time the child was found on the bed I considered that the wound had been in<lb/>flicted by the razor; but the wound through the chest and diaphragm per<lb/>fectly corresponded with the width of the dagger, and the blood on the dag<lb/>ger was about three and a half inches up it, just corresponding with the depth from the rib to the diaphragm—I gave notice to the police directly the child was dead, on the Sunday evening—the dagger was found accidentally by the policeman; he put his elbow against the shutter and it dropped from behind it—it was in a sheath; it had been put back again into the sheath—the wound in the prisoner's throat was inflicted by the razor—I first</p>

               <p>attended the prisoner on 4th April—from that time up to the time this act was committed, I always found her excessively nervous—on the first visit I paid her she said her husband did not behave right to her; she was always excessively jealous, and occasionally attacked with hysteria, not of a very severe character—I believe the jealousy was well-founded—I attended her after this act was committed until the day I came with her to Newgate; I do not know what day that was—it was in September—she remained at the lodgings till then—Mr. By am saw her two or three times for me after the day of consultation; he saw her for me I dare say ten times, because I was obliged to be out of town, and dressed the wound—after this act was done there was always a vacant stare about her, and there was so little apparent sorrow for the loss of her child, that made me think that her mind could not be in the proper state that it ought to be—she repeated that her jealousy was very great, and she complained greatly of her head aching and of dizzi<lb/>ness, which is another proof of insanity—a nurse attended her all this time.</p>

               <p>entirely lost her memory; she would tell me a thing two or three times over and forget that she had told me—I went several times to Mr. Cathrow, and told him I was very much distressed about her strange and odd manner, and I told him there was a bottle of laudanum which made me very uneasy; I was afraid of her taking it, as her manner was so strange; I believe it was bought for her in her last confinement, and she had kept it in her possession—I should not have known that she had it only she gave me a little for the toothache—on the morning of Friday, 31st July, I went out with the child for a walk in the Regent's-park—I returned about 12—I saw my sister when I came back—I gave the child its dinner, and put it to bed in its cot about half-past 1—I then had my dinner, and went to Covent-garden Market for a peach—my sister had desired me to get her one—I returned at five minutes to 4—I went up stairs and found the drawing-room door fastened; it was always kept open—there are two doors; they were both fastened—the other door was always fastened; that was the bed-room door—it was one large room, divided by a curtain—the bed-room and sitting-room were together, but there were two doors—I went for Mr. Cathrow—he came back with me and broke open the door—I got in, and then let him in—when I went out in the morning I left the child in the care of its mamma, in a room above the first-floor, which we had as a nursery—it was in its cot—it used to sleep sometimes a quarter of an hour, and sometimes half an hour, but never more—it had been brought down from that room when I got back—it was exactly in the same dress in which I had left it, and was lying on the bed covered with a pillow—I had never seen a razor or dagger in my sister's possession before this; I did not know of either.</p>

               <p>expenses were so heavy that I understood he could not afford more—we were supplied by him with the common necessaries of life—it was not on account of money that my sister was distressed; it was her ill health and other causes—her ill health commenced very shortly after we had been in London; she became very much changed and altered for the worse—she was altered in her mind as well as in her bodily health—she became very low indeed, which was quite unnatural to her, she was so lively; and she could not sleep; she said she did not know how it was—that was after we had been in London about three months; just at the end of February—she was always extremely kind to the child; more devoted than I had ever seen any one; in fact if she had had it she would have ruined it; she was too kind to it—she showed more maternal tenderness to it than I had ever known—if it cried in the night she would rush up stairs and feed it herself when she was not able to do so, as she was so ill—she became more and more affectionate to it up to the very last moment—I remember her con<lb/>finement in April—I noticed a great change in her manner after that—I thought her quite deranged—she spoke and acted so strangely; sometimes I would speak to her, and she would not answer at all; and at other times she was very much excited without any cause—it was after her confine<lb/>ment that she had the fancies I speak of—they wore frequent—she fancied there were people in the room at night, and that a policeman was there to take her away—she did not say what for—she was very suspicious—at one time, towards the latter part, she thought Mr. Cathrow's medicine did her more harm than good, and she thought we were all conspiring against her to poison her—I don't know whether that suspicion extended to Dr. Byam she told me on several occasions never to let the dear babe go out of my sight, for she was under the impression that Mr. Chappell, or some one, would take it from her; she was quite sure something was going to happen, and they would take it from her, and she would never be separated from it—she did not say anything about any apprehension that they were going to put her into an asylum—after her confinement in April, Mr. Chappell's visits became less frequent—about three weeks before 31st July, I remember receiving a letter from Mr. Chappell; I delivered it to her—I never read it—she tore it in shreds, and put it away—about that same time I received a letter from Mr. Chappell—I spoke to her about it—I did not show it to her—I am not quite sure whether I read it to her, for she was so distressed about the note that she had herself received that it almost seemed as if it had driven her mad—I told her the contents of it—I am not quite sure as to the time, but I think it was about three weeks or a month before she stabbed the child—at times after that she became very much excited, and at times sobbed and cried, and I could not cheer her up at all—the fancies increased—I don't think she slept at night for seven weeks before this occurrence—I have listened, and heard her of a night, for I was so distressed and alarmed about her—this is the letter that I received from Mr. Chappell.

Dear Elizabeth, I am very sorry to have to tell you that from what has occurred between me and your sister the last few days, her violence has been such that I have become hopeless of our ever getting on comfortably together, and that I have written to her to say that a separation must take place between us, for I am</p>

               <p>convinced that is the best thing for her as well as myself. With this view my solicitor will call to-morrow morning to confer with her as to my making a proper settlement for you all, for I am resolved neither your sister nor yourself shall ever want for anything. If you would like to see me again on any matter, I should like you to come to the office, and if you will let me know previously I will take care to be in the way to receive you, and talk matters over with you. You and your sister, with baby, will be enabled to live wherever you like, though it should be somewhere where I should be able to see baby occasionally. I am sure you will never forsake poor baby, and that you will do your duty to the poor child; give her a kiss for me, and believe me, yours sincerely, H. Chappell. It will not be so bad, but your sister is now provoked. I think you will be able to go on more comfortably, particularly as far as you are concerned, and you might live at some nice healthy place, such as Brighton.") From that time till the child's death she was excited at times; more so than before—I remember Mr. Wilson the solicitor calling—he addressed her as "Madam," and with that I left the room—shortly after I heard the bell ring; I entered the room, and found my sister fainting, and Mr. Wilson supporting her, and giving her a little brandy-and-water—that was two or three weeks previous to the child's death; between 25th June and the child's death she went to Liverpool for a few days—I did not go with her—on 31st July, when the door was broken open, and I entered the room the child had its day-clothes on in which I had left it—my sister had taken off all the clothes that she had on when I left the house, and had put on her night-dress, and a clean pair of stockings, and had laid out on a chair another night-dress, and some stockings, and a robe for the baby—she had put up her ordinary day-clothes, and locked them up, and the keys were hidden—I believe Mr. Chappell came once to the house after 25th June, after Mr. Wilson's visit, but not again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and reside at 34, Welbeck-street—I was called on by Mr. Cathrow on 30th April last, to attend the prisoner for him—I had not seen her before—she was confined the same evening of a six months' child—I found her suffering more pain than is usual on such occasions, and very nervous and excitable—I did not perceive anything wrong in her state of mind—I attended her until her delivery, and remained with her the usual time afterwards—I saw her again a day or two afterwards, I think twice—she was nervous and excitable, and suffering great pain—the last time I visited her was about the third or fourth day after her deli<lb/>very—on the morning of 31st July, I was requested by Mr. Cathrow to meet him in consultation, with a view to ascertain the state of her mind—that was the professed object of my visit—I found her calm and collected, but a good deal depressed in spirits—she became apparently much more cheerful while we were there—the result of the interview was that I did not think there was any necessity to put her under restraint at that time—I had previously learnt from Mr. Cathrow that she had threatened to destroy herself and her child—that, and the annoyance that I understood she had been to Mr. Chappell were the subjects of the conversation that I had with her—I saw her again the day after the deed was done, Saturday, 31st—at that time she had lost a great deal of blood—she was in a very exhausted state, and I did not talk to her—I thought she was too weak to be spoken to—I have had very little experience of cases of unsound mind—I could not form an opinion from what I saw of her as to the state of mind she was then in—I considered that the pain she was suffering from after her delivery,</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 87, Harrow-road—I have been about twenty years in practice—in the course of my practice I have had my attention directed to cases of persons suffering under aberration of mind—I attended the prisoner in her first confinement, in June, 1862—she had a very tedious labour, and suffered very much indeed from hysteria after<lb/>wards—I attended her up to the middle of July—a few days after her delivery I had a consultation; she was so bad—she was suffering from hysterical peritonitis, which is an attack of hysteria that imitates inflamma<lb/>tion—I got her well by giving her large doses of opium—the remedy was given at the right moment—Dr. Chowne, physician of Charing-cross Hospital, saw her at the time, and we persevered with the opium treatment until we got her calm and comfortable—her mental condition at that time was just in that position, that I fully expected it to go—she was wavering, and I expected the mind to give way—I had some conversation with Mr. Chappell with regard to the state of her mind at that time—I suggested that the child should be put away to nurse, and that she should be sent home to her friends, and that advice was then followed I meant that she should not cohabit with him any more—I was positive that if she was again in the family-way, either her mind or her body, or both, would give way—I next heard of her when I was called to see her on 2d August, after this act had been committed—the child had then just died—the prisoner was then de<lb/>cidedly, in my opinion, maniacal—she did not recognise me, until I told her who I was—I attended her until she was removed to Newgate—up to that time she was decidedly in a state of suicidal mania—a nurse was constantly with her night and day—she told mo many very strange stories, which were all illusions, more or less—she thought she was to be taken away to an asylum, and that her child was to be taken away—after the loss of blood a certain amount of reason was restored in the course of a few days, and she then told me her motive, or her apparent motive, for what she had done, that her child was about to be taken away, which was not the fact—when I first saw her she did not seem to be aware of the death of the child.</p>

I am a draper, at 16, Manchester-street, King's Cross—on the night of 26th September, about half-past 12, I was in my kitchen and I heard some one come in at the front door with a latch key—I then heard some one walking overhead, in the room above, and I ran up stairs without my boots—there was a lamp on the staircase, which was alight—it threw a light all along the passage and into the parlour—when I got to the top of the stairs, on to the landing, I saw the prisoner and another man come out of the parlour—the prisoner had two shirts, a pair of trousers, and some handkerchiefs on his arm, and his companion had a piece of cloth and a coat—I thought they were my two sons at first, and I said, "What are you taking the things out for,"—the prisoner turned round and said, "All right, governor"—I said, "It seems all wrong," and I caught him by the collar, just by the street door—I distinctly saw his features—we struggled together</p>

               <p>for some time—they opened the door in the struggle, and got outside—I still held the prisoner—his companion took the piece of cloth which was rolled on a flat board, and struck me violently on the head several times, in fact be broke a few inches of the board off—he held it in both hands, and par<lb/>tially stunned me—my wife then came up to the door, and he ran away—I still kept hold of the prisoner—his coat gave way at the sleeve, he gave me a violent push, I slipped, and he ran away—I jumped on my feet as soon as possible, and followed him—he went down Liverpool-street—I was only a few yards behind him—I raised a cry of "Stop thief" all the way down—I lost sight of him for about a second, when he turned the corner of Abbey-street, and then I saw him caught by a fire-escape man—a constable came up at the same time, and I gave him into custody—I have not the slightest doubt that the prisoner is the man who was in my house—it was a moon<lb/>light night, and I saw his features plainly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a costermonger, of 4, Rose and Crown-gardens, Chelsea—on 2d October, I left home with my wife about 6 o'clock in the evening, and returned a little after 12—in consequence of a communication made to me, I went to the police-station, and found the prisoners there—I went home and found the door of my room burst open, and the window quite open—on leaving home, I had locked my room door; the outer door was open—the house is let out in rooms—I found the drawers open and the key in them, which, when my wife went out, she had put into the pocket of her dress behind the door—I found this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) under the table—it does not belong to me—the prisoner Copplestone is my brother-in-law—I had seen White before, but I had never allowed him to come there—I do not know what he is; I never saw him do anything—he is not a costermonger.</p>

I said, "Come round to my sister's; they promised me some money to pay for a lodging when I got there." I said to Williams, "We must get in somewhere, because the police hunt us about seeing us out so late at night." He said, "What is the use of going there?" I said, "I am going to try and open the window, and stop there until they come home." I was partly drunk; I had been drinking all the afternoon.</p>

I was standing next Darton, and my wife was next me—he immediately laid hold of my wife and began pulling her under the window where the prisoner was—he was kicking her and pulling her by her hair—I caught hold of her to try to get her away, and the prisoner leaned out of the window and caught hold of me by my hair—she lifted me off my feet down into the yard, which has two steps to go down—she then picked up a wash-hand basin and heaved it with great force, and cut the top of my head—I was attended at the police-station by the divisional surgeon.</p>

I had a daughter, Elizabeth Evans Cross<lb/>ley, who was born on 18th July, 1845—in consequence of some communica<lb/>tion I called on the prisoner and his father on the 18th August last in Ely—I said I understood the prisoner was engaged to my daughter; that it was very much against my wish, an my daughter was only eighteen years of age the 19th of last July—I told him that if he did not break off the engage<lb/>ment I should take my daughter home—she was then living with her grand<lb/>mother—I am a widower—I have two other daughters, of the ages of sixteen and seventeen—I permitted my daughter Elizabeth to live with her grand<lb/>mother because the old lady was left alone, and we thought it would be com<lb/>pany for her—I saw her frequently, mostly twice a week, sometimes three or four times—the prisoner said nothing to me as to whether the acquaintance was continuing or not—the only reply he made was, "I love her"—I did not give my consent to the marriage; it was very much against my consent—I was not aware that she had left her grandmother's house—she is entitled to one-third share of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that becomes absolutely hers when she is twenty-one years of age.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon in Jermyn-street—on Saturday morning, 3d October, about thirty-five minutes past 9, I was called to the Hand-in—Raquet, and saw the deceased in his room—he was lying on his back on his left side, partly undressed—he had then been dead about four or five hours—he had vomited, and he had also been purged—I made a post-mortem ex<lb/>amination on 6th October—there was a slight contusion over the left eye<lb/>brow, with a small piece of plaster—the under lining of the scalp was very much congested with blood, and thickened posteriorly, as though from a fall—the dura mater on the left side was distended in front with a large mass of dark coagulated blood, weighing about four ounces—the vessels of the brain generally were very much congested—the brain substance itself was healthy—the cause of death was the extravasation of blood on the brain, from a rupture of one of the veins of the anterior portion of the membrane—that would probably result from some act of violence; that corresponded to the injury over the loft eye-brow: a fall or blow would be likely to cause that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186310260047"/>
               <p>—if the man was of intemperate habits, and in a state of intoxication at the time, that would considerably facilitate such a result.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> From the appearance of the brain when blood is ex<lb/>travasated is it not very difficult to ascertain whether an injury is caused by a blow or a fall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is; either might cause it, or it might result from a combination of both—the deceased was about twenty-five or twenty<lb/>six—I heard when I reached the house that he had been fighting, and that they found him dead in bed—my assistant was with me at the post-mortem examination—I made notes—I have not looked at them since—the heart was rather softer than it ought to have been—the liver was healthy, and also the stomach, but quite empty—I could not draw any conclusion as to his habits from the appearance of the stomach—the organic structures were exceedingly healthy—the wound on the forehead was about half an inch in length—it was a contused abraded wound, very superficial looking—I do not regard the wound as the cause of death, but the shock received in the blow or fall ruptured the veins—I have heard the evidence—I do not think death could have arisen from apoplexy, in one so young—extravasation of blood on the brain may be caused by vomiting alone—stupor, always accompanies effusion; in this case it must have been gradual—the probability is, that his intemperate habits brought on chronic congestion of the brain, and then, after the fall which caused the injury, the excitement, and probably the act of going up stairs might have in<lb/>creased the escape of blood, and he was seized with a sudden kind of stupor; nausea and vomiting supervened; and then, in all probability, he fell bock in a fit as he was undressing.</p>

From information, I went to the prisoner's lodging, accompanied by a constable, Perry, of the <hi rend="italic">D</hi> division—I went up to his apartment, and asked him whether he had been dealing with any jewellery—he said, "No"—I told him I knew he had, and I must take him into custody for being concerned, with others not in custody, in com<lb/>mitting a robbery at No. 100, Oxford-street, on 19th September, and stealing some jewellery to the value of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he knew nothing about it whatever—I then ordered Perry to take him down to the station—I re<lb/>mained in the room until Perry returned—during his absence I said to his mother, who was sitting there with him, "Mrs. Weston, you have some brooches that your son gave to you"—she made no answer—I repeated the question, and she took from her dress this brooch, and said it was the only article she had, and her son had given it to her—I afterwards went to Sarah Plummer, and obtained from her this brooch, and these things from Mrs. Beverley—the prisoner said at the station that he had found all the jewellery behind a cab in the stable yard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clergyman of the Church of England—in November last, when I was curate of Woodchurch, Birkenhead, I saw this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>: ("<hi rend="italic">Advowsons for sale, with immediate legal possession; one for</hi> 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">Principals only, may direct, Zeta, Bedford's</hi>, 8, <hi rend="italic">Sloane-street</hi>, S. W") At that time I was wishing to purchase the advowson of a small living about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I wrote an answer to the advertisement, and received this letter in reply, which I believe to be in the prisoner's writing: (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi>, 22<hi rend="italic">nd November</hi>, 1862, 15, <hi rend="italic">Hans-place, Belgrave-square, and signed George Turner. It stated that the property belonged to a friend of the writers, and was in Northampton shire, about two miles from a market town. Rent charge and glebe</hi>, 275<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; <hi rend="italic">endowment</hi>, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; <hi rend="italic">rates and taxes</hi>, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Price, with immediate legal possession</hi>, 2,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">without a house, or</hi> 3,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">the vendor building one forthwith; that there were many applications, but that the writer would meet Mr. Cox at the station, to show him the place, on payment of railway fare, and one guinea for time; and, if this did not suit, to let the writer know, who, as an old Cantab, now and then heard of such property.</hi>) I am a M. A. of Trinity College, Cambridge—I wrote this answer to it (<hi rend="italic">This was addressed to the prisoner, stating that Mr. Cox did not wish to lay out so much, and inquiring whether his client would take less</hi>). In answer to that I received this letter, which is in the prisoner's writing. (<hi rend="italic">This requested Mr. Cox to make an offer, but stated that</hi> 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">had been refused, and gave the name, in confidence, as Hardwicke, near Wellingborough, Northampton<lb/>shire.</hi>) This is my reply. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 26<hi rend="italic">th November, requesting to know whether there was a suitable piece of glebe for a house. To this there was a reply from the prisoner, stating that it would be absolutely necessary for him to meet Mr. Cox, to show him the place and give him information, without making the whole matter known, but that the guinea should be returned if Mr. Cox bought the advowson, and that he would point out a piece of glebe present<lb/>ing a capital site for building, and explain how</hi> 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">might be saved</hi>). There are one or two other letters, arranging the time of meeting, and on 3d December I went down to Wellingborough with Mr. Bowring, a friend of mine—we met the prisoner at the station, and he took us to the Hyde Hotel there—we had some refreshment—he said that that was the principal hotel in the place, and the people seemed to know him very well—we then walked to Hardwicke together, two miles and a half, accompanied by Mr. Bowring—the prisoner pointed out the various pieces of glebe land belonging to it—then he went to a cottage in a very dilapidated state, which he said was the only house on the glebe; where a labourer and his wife lived, and where the key of the church was kept—he appeared to be very well known there—he procured the key, and took us into the church, and showed us all over it—I said, "I see by the <hi rend="italic">Clergy List</hi> that this advowson belongs to the heirs of a Mr. Hughes"—the prisoner said, "Yes, it has appeared so for years, but it is now vested in one person; it has never been altered"—I asked him the name—he said that he was not privileged to give it, but it was a great friend of his—he also said that the present rector, Mr. Greenway, was a great friend of his; he had known him for years—I said, "Then you only</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186310260058"/>
               <p>have the absolute power to dispose of this property?"—he said, "Yes; I only have the power to dispose of it"—nothing was said to me at that time about a deposit—I left it in Mr. Bowring's hands, and Messrs. Simpson and Taylor's, my solicitors—the prisoner gave me this memorandum—I find my endorsement upon it. (<hi rend="italic">This was a calculation of the particulars of the living, producing</hi> 280<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">net</hi>). After that I still continued my inclina<lb/>tion to buy it, and received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">th December</hi>, 1862, <hi rend="italic">from the prisoner to Mr. Bowring, stating that the prisoner was empowered by his client to close with Mr. Cox at</hi> 2,625<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and pay him</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">for the repairs of the chancel; that a draft of agreement was enclosed, with a request that it might be approved and returned at once, as the prisoner was going into Devon<lb/>shire.</hi>) This letter was written to Mr. Bowring, and forwarded by him to me. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 9<hi rend="italic">th December</hi>, 1862, <hi rend="italic">from the prisoner to Mr. Bowring, stating that he could not consent to the deposit being paid into a bank in joint names, as on a former occasion it had led to trouble and expense, but that the prisoner had no objection to make the deposit</hi> 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">instead of</hi> 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">if paid into his own hands</hi>). Mr. Bowring and my solicitors, Simpson and Taylor, managed the matter for me after my visit, and it was by my directions that the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid as a deposit—I was induced to direct it to be paid because the agreement was sent to me by my solicitor, who said that he believed it to be quite correct—I parted with the money because I believed Mr. Wilson to be the real owner of the advowson—this is my signature to the agreement—I signed it, believing Mr. Wilson to be the owner, and that the prisoner had the right to deal with it for him—I had not heard of James Wilson before I received the agreement—I should say that this sig<lb/>nature, "James Wilson," to the agreement, is the prisoner's writing, and the attestation, "George Turner," also—I have not been able to discover any James Wilson—when the agreement was signed I could not get the matter completed—there were various excuses made to me, not to Mr. Bowring; sometimes he was going to see a dying friend, and sometimes he was on the Continent—I have never got the title completed, or got back my 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after these matters had gone on some time, I handed the matter over to Mr. Leach, who is very well known in Derby in criminal matters, with instruc<lb/>tions to sift the matter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Gamble, as solicitors, at Derby—prior to 24th March, this matter was placed in my hands by Messrs. Simpson and Taylor, and I came to London and waited on the prisoner on 26th March, at his house in Hans-place—he was at first denied, but I even<lb/>tually procured admission, and saw him, I believe—I gave him a letter of introduction from Simpson and Taylor to the effect that they had deputed me to take up the matter—he said that great delay had arisen in conse<lb/>quence of numerous obstacles in respect of title and so on, but they were all removed—I said that a general assertion of that kind would not be satisfactory, I must know distinctly and specifically how the matter stood, and as nearly as I can recollect, he said that Mr. James Wilson, of Clapham<lb/>common, was a client and personal friend of his; that he, for Mr. Wilson, had purchased the advowson from Messrs. Craddock and Shelley, of Nun<lb/>caton, for a nephew of Mr. Wilson's, but the nephew had changed his mind, and was going into the Army instead of the Church; hence the reason of Mr. Wilson seeking to sell the advowson—I asked him if it had been conveyed to Mr. Wilson—he said, "It has not, but I hold a contract with Mr. Wilson, and he has paid a deposit of 235<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but Mr. Shelley has taken a personal dislike to me, and refuses to go on with the matter. I then employed Mr. Cook, of Wellingborough, a solicitor, to endeavour to carry the matter out, but Craddock and Shelley detected that he was acting for mo, and refused to have any dealings with him; I then put myself in communication with Mr. Dawson, a clerical agent, at Malvern Link, and instructed him to effect a new contract with Craddock and Shelley"—I think he said that Mr. Dawson was a clergyman—he said, "Dawson has told them that he wants the living for himself, and that draft of the contract was drawn;" showing me one between the trustees of the living and Mr. Dawson—I asked him what security he had for Mr. Dawson making over the living to Mr. Cox, in case he became the purchaser—he said, "I have not any"—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)is the document he showed me, and he showed me at the same time a letter of Messrs. Vallance and Lewis—I said, "Why have you not filed a bill or done something to compel a specific performance of Mr. Wilson's contract with Craddock and Shelley," and I said that it seemed strange that he was opening negociations with new people—he said, "The course I am taking will cause the least delay"—I said, "The matter has assumed quite a new phase;" I had believed that Mr. Wilson was the real owner of this living, but under the circumstances you have related I shall advise Mr. Cox to have no more to do with the matter, and I may as well ask you at once whether you are prepared to return Mr. Cox's deposit of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or to deposit it in a bank in your name and my own"—he said, "I cannot do either, for I have already paid Messrs. Craddock and Shelley 235<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I will deposit the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186310260061"/>
               <p>balance of 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "I cannot understand why Mr. Wilson should seek or want to use Mr. Cox's money, and I will be no party to such an arrange<lb/>ment, in fact you may take it from me at once that Mr. Cox will have nothing more to do with this advowson; there is an end of the matter"—he said, "I have just thought of a plan by which we can get out of this difficulty; a gentleman came here this morning who was desirous of pur<lb/>chasing a living like this; I will see him to-morrow morning, and endeavour to conclude the bargain, and I will meet you wherever you please in the afternoon, and hope then to be able to satisfy you"—I named the chambers of my agent, Mr. Dubois, then in Coleman-street, and fixed 2 o'clock—he promised to keep that appointment, but instead of doing so I received this letter about the time he was to have arrived (<hi rend="italic">This stated that the prisoner had received a telegram, which obliged him to go to Exeter, and offered to com<lb/>plete the contract within twenty-one days, or give up Mr. Cox's contract</hi>)—I communicated with Craddock and Shelley that day, and next morning re<lb/>ceived a reply from them; in consequence of which I applied at the West<lb/>minster Police-court for a warrant for the prisoner's apprehension, which was placed in Luby's hands to execute, but the prisoner had absconded, and was not taken till 1st September—I endeavoured to get him to come to my agent's chambers, where I had an officer waiting for him, but he did not come.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If he had come would he have been arrested? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly—I was laying a trap for him; he required one—he told me that letters had passed between him and Craddock and Shelley, which he con<lb/>sidered, in point of law, a binding contract—from what he said I imagined he had a contract besides the letters; he acting for Mr. Wilson, and Crad<lb/>dock and Shelley acting for the assignees of the living—he did not say that they knew that he was acting for Mr. Wilson—I do not think he entered into the particulars of the contract, and said that he had had the opinion of Counsel upon it—he did not open a drawer and produce a letter in which it was stated that a gentleman of the bar had stated that letters upon one side and acceptance on the other, constituted a valid contract—he said that when Craddock and Shelley had broken off the negociation with him, he put himself in communication with Mr. Cook, of Wellingborough, to negociate, which failed, and then applied to Mr. Dawson—I said, "And suppose you were to carry it out in that way what security have I that Mr. Dawson will hand over the living to Mr. Cox?"—he did not show me a letter from Mr. Dawson undertaking to convey it to him—I am pretty sure he did not show me any letters from Mr. Dawson—he says in this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) that he has written to Mr. Dawson, for such a letter; that negatives it—he said that Mr. Dawson would assign the living to him, and he would assign to Mr. Cox.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in partnership with Mr. Craddock, a solicitor, of Nuneaton, at the time of this matter, and was acting as solicitor to the proprietors of the living—the assignees are Mr. C. T. Monk, the bar<lb/>rister (not the Q. C.); Mr. Daniel, Q. C.; one of the co-heiresses, and a Mr. Mahon, of Paisley—I know there is no Mr. Wilson who has anything to do with it—I acted as solicitor for all those gentlemen—everything that was done came through my office; nobody else had any power to act—I have never given power to John Wilson or anybody—I became acquainted with the prisoner in September, 1862—I advertised the living for sale, and re<lb/>ceived this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Mr. Turner, dated 9th September, applying for particulars—(<hi rend="italic">This letter was signed "George Turner" and stated</hi>;—"I am seeking to buy such a property for a client, and if it is, as you say, in a healthy locality, we shall have no difficulty if you will give me the par<lb/>ticulars")—I sent him the particulars on the 12th, but the letter was lost at the police-court—I have a copy of it—it describes the place, the population, and the income, and states the price to be 2, 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 18th September I received this letter from Mr. Turner—(<hi rend="italic">This applied for the refusal till Monday, and stated that he would go and see it on Saturday morning, and requested to be informed by telegram to whom to apply</hi>)—I sent a telegram, as requested, replying to it, and referring him to Mr. Archibald Sharman, a farmer, residing in the parish of Hardwick—on 22d September I received this letter—(<hi rend="italic">This was signed "George Turner." It stated that his client, a lady, had been with him that afternoon, having seen the parish, and desired to treat for the purchase, and instructed him to make inquiries as to the income and outgoings; it also requested an appointment for Tuesday or Wednesday</hi>)—on 23d September I sent an answer to that, fixing for him to call at my office—he did not do so, and I wrote this letter on 26th—(<hi rend="italic">This expressed surprised at not seeing the prisoner, and requested a reply, there being other application</hi>)—on 27th or 29th I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">This was from George Turner, dated Chan<lb/>cery-lane, and stated that he was not able to leave town till the Wednesday morning, and then went down and found the church in such a dilapidated state that he thought it necessary to send to his clients</hi>)—here is another letter (<hi rend="italic">This was dated October</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1862, <hi rend="italic">and stated</hi>:—"My client is Mrs. Murray, of Kemp-town, Brighton")—I made inquiries about Mrs. Murray, of Kemp-town, but could not find her—On 4th November, in consequence of the arrangements not being completed, I went to town and saw the prisoner at 15, Hans-place; he asked me to address my letters there—I was shown into a room, and in a minute or two he came in apologizing for being in confusion from painting—I said I had called about the advowson of Hardwick; he said, "I have some grounds of complaint against you; I have not at present full evidence, but I believe you have been sending a party or parties up to my private house, as if I was hiding myself"—I said, "You are entirely mis<lb/>taken; I have not even mentioned your name to any one, nor has any body asked me for it"—he said, "Why have you delayed sending me a draft con<lb/>tract as you promised?"—I said, "My reason is that we have not been able to find your client, Mrs. Murray, of Kemp-town, and I ask you for her address"—he said, "You have kept me in the dark as to who your clients</p>

I am a sailor—on the morning of 22d September, I was standing against the Red Lion, at the corner of St. George's-street, Rat<lb/>cliff-highway—the prisoner came along and butted me in the breast with his head—I said to him, "If you want fighting, I will fight you fairly"—we went into the Back-road to fight; we had a blow or two, and the policeman came along and stopped us—the prisoner struck me in the nose, that was all and we parted—I asked him to have something to drink with me, to make good friends, but he would not—about 7 o'clock the same evening, I saw the prisoner in Neptune-street, standing talking to a woman who was outside the door—he got hold of both of my hands—he had a knife, and he out me down my cheek; I have the mark here—he then cut me twice in the back of the neck, and once in the left arm—he also bit me in the chin—I cried for mercy, and after that I became insensible, and did not know where I was until I found myself in the London Hospital—I saw the knife in his hands as I was coming along Neptune-street, before he struck me—it was a clasp knife—he was sober.</p>

               <p>Oxfordshire, on 20th September last, and inquired from house to house if Captain Mitchell had lived or resided there in 1859—I was informed that no such person had lived there—I went to the rate-collector, who knew no such name, then to the post-office, and inquired if any letters had been received for him, and the answer was, "No"—it is a small place, quite a village.</p>

I am a hackney carriage driver, of 62, Union-street, Clarendon-square—I know the prisoner—I met him in a public-house four or five months ago—I was speaking to a Mr. Jewson, and the prisoner said that he wanted to borrow or purchase two cabs, in consequence of which, I took him to Mr. Stephens, knowing that he had two cabs which he wanted to let on hire—I said to Stephens, "This party wants to purchase two cabs"—the prisoner saw them—he said that one was too heavy for him, and asked Mr. Stephens how much he wanted for the other—he said 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner said that it was too much, and asked Stephens whether he would let it to him on hire—Stephens said, "Yes;" and that he should require twelve shillings a week—Dancer said that it was too much—Stephens said that he would not let it for less, but that if he liked to purchase it in two or three months, he would deduct the twelve shillings off the purchase-money—upon that Dancer paid a half-sovereign down—when I first went to Westminster, previous to giving my evidence, the prisoner offered me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to say that he had purchased the cab of Stephens; and one morning, about a quarter to 7, as I was about to go to bed, having had a job all night, he called, and began talking to me about this matter—he said that it was a bad job—I said, "You have got to thank yourself for it; you have got me into sad disgrace about the matter"—he said, "What do you mean?"—I said, "I</p>

I am a grocer and cheesemonger, at 84, John-street, Hoxton—on 19th October, Smith came to my shop with a white apron on, and represented himself as a coffee-house keeper—he chose a piece of bacon, which weighed 8 1/2 lbs. and 3 lbs. of butter—he requested me to send them home by the boy, and he would return him the money—I sent the boy, who returned soon afterwards, without the money, for some lard—I gave directions to the boy, when I sent him, not to give the goods without the money.</p>

I am shop-boy to the prosecutor—on 19th October, I took some bacon and butter from the shop—my master told me not to leave it without the money—I went with the prisoner Smith, to the Rose of Denmark beer-shop in Hoxton; not a great way from my master's shop—Smith asked me which I would have, beer or ale—I said, "Beer"—I had the beer, and he then sent me back after some lard, and said he would pay me when I came back—I left the bacon and butter with him, and went back for the lard—when I came back to the public-house he was gone, and the goods too—I went in search, and saw both the prisoners coming from John-street—they went into the Red Lion public-house—I then lost sight of them, and saw them come out from the Britannia—I saw a constable, and gave them into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a foreman in the Royal Arsenal, where the prisoners were employed—Ferguson is an assistant foreman, and Wilson also, in my department—they were employed at the Arsenal on 2d October—I saw them in "Dial-square" all day, more or less—they passed out about one minute after 6, and had left work for the day—the prisoners would have access to gun metal and copper of the description produced—the value of this gun metal is about 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the copper about 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the whole of it is Government property—the gun metal formed the "dead head" of a model gun; it was cut off as waste, and would go back to the foundry to be cast over again—the copper is employed as vents for old guns—the prisoners had no authority to take the metal away—Ferguson has been employed in the Arsenal upwards of twenty years, and has been four years assistant fore<lb/>man—Wilson has been nine years in the Government service, and about the same period as assistant foreman.</p>

I am not going to do you any harm"—I pushed him and he went back to his seat—my husband came back from the cellar directly after that, and said to the prisoner, "Come, we must go to bed, we are tired"—the prisoner then said he should not sleep there—before that he had agreed to take a bed in the house—he said he had particular money on his person, and he would not sleep in a room with an Irishman, because he should have his pockets searched—he shortly afterwards left the house, and my husband went to his coat pocket, put his hand in, and pulled it out again, disappointed and empty—he stood still, frightened for some time, and then went out, and was absent for some ten minutes—at the time the prisoner took the bed I told him that other people were sleeping in the same room—nobody else came into the bar after my husband went down into the cellar.</p>

On 31st August I was a lieutenant in the Royal Artillery, in quarters at Woolwich—the prisoner Anderson was my military servant, and Brown was the servant of Lieutenant Augustus Lavie, an officer in the same service as myself, and having quarters at the same barracks—on 31st August I went away from my quarters, and returned on 12th September—I did not find my place in charge of my servant as I had left it, he had gone—I had to gain admission through the window, and on getting in I found some of my property gone—I missed a tunic, two jackets, a pair of overalls, a gold-lace pouch belt, and sword belt, several spoons and forks, and a tea-pot, a regimental frock coat, a suit of clothes, a coat and waistcoat, several shirts and collars, two pairs of boots, a pair of shoes, a finger ring, and several other articles, with a large uniform tin case, value together about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have seen a few shirts and a coat since—Lieutenant Lavie is on his way to India—I did not see him sail, but I know he must have gone, he was under orders to go—he is no longer in Woolwich or in London—my name was on my tin case, on a brass plate—I am not sure about my Christian name, but my surname was on in full—the suit of clothes mentioned were used by Anderson as my servant, but they were my property.</p>

I saw them at the station—they are mine—this bag of coppers was kept in a drawer, which it had been wrenched open—here are two brooches and other things; I can swear they were all secure in my shop the night before—I believe the prisoner had managed to secrete himself in the house; he did not break in—the shop had been closed at a quarter to 10—there were two glass doors broken; one leading from the sitting room into the hall, at the back, and another from the hall into the passage—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man I saw breaking through the window; I never took my eyes off him.</p>

I am a waterman, at 6, Wellington-place, Deptford—on 2d October, about 4 or 5 in the morning, I was in a coffee-shop, next door but one to Mr. Pulley's—I heard cries of "Police!" and "Stop thief!"—I and three more ran out—we shoved open the passage door leading to Mr. Pulley's house, and saw the prisoner moving about—Mr. Pulley was looking out of the window—he said, "Secure him till I come down"—I and another man went to catch hold of him, and he struck one of us in the month—we caught hold of him—he said, "What do you want"—we said, we did not know"—he said, "Wait a minute; let me go," and he stooped down and dropped these articles—I picked up almost all of them—I am quite sure that he dropped them—he continued pulling things out of his pockets, and chucking them about—I saw this bag of half-pence lying on the step of the door—the window was broken all to pieces, and the prisoner's hands were bleeding—he said to me, "What did you cut my hand for?"—I had not done so; I had no knife—by this time a policeman came up, and he was given into custody.</p>

               <p>"Oh, if you will not, I will press the charge, and lock you up"—that was within a few yards of the station—I went into the station with them—no one made a charge against Brian at first—Davidson asked several of them, "Who charges this man?"—he said to several, "is it you?"—they said, "No," and then he came to Daley, and said, "Oh, you have got your coat torn, what is your name?" and so then the charge was made out in Daley's name, and Daley did not know what he was doing—he was not sober—he was not very drunk, but he was drunk—he did not know the nature of the questions put to him, or why he signed the sheet—he confessed that on the following day, and said he was sorry for what he had done—Brian wished to explain his case, but he was not allowed, the prisoner pre<lb/>vented him—then another of the witnesses, Sullivan, wished to make an explanation, and he was not heard—the prisoner shoved him so that he went down on his hands, his hat fell off, and the prisoner kicked the crown of it in—Sullivan picked his hat up and the prisoner ordered him out—Sullivan said, "I will go out if the inspector orders me"—ultimately the inspector said, "You had better go out for a while," and he went out—the black man assisted to take Brian into the cell, and then I went away—Brian was quite sober—I do not think he was exactly clear—I believe he had had liquor, but he was sober—he was very much excited by the fighting and the ill—usage he had received; he was panting for breath—on the Monday after, I went before the Magistrate—I was not asked by anybody to go, neither did I know Brian at all—I had never seen him in my life before—the charge was made of assaulting Daley—Daley did not appear, and the prisoner knew that he did not intend to appear, he was told so—I was called in after the prisoner had made his statement—Brian was remanded till Friday, on his own recognisances, in 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went again on the Friday of my own accord—the prisoner and Daley were there then—the Magistrate inquired of Daley why he did not appear on the Monday, and he said one reason was that his father did not wish him to, another reason was that he did not want it known that he had been out so late, and another thing was, he said, that Brian had never assaulted him—he said that he did have a fall, but it was in the struggling to support one of the combatants—Mr. Trail asked him why he signed the charge—sheet, and he said because they asked him to sign it.</p>

               <p>they got him away from the railings; another constable asaisted the prisoner in Cross-street—as they were going up towards the station, Brian tried to stumble two or three times—when they got there he was charged by Daley—not a word passed between the prisoner and Brian on the way to the station—I was there from the beginning to the end of the <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I saw a black man there—money was not mentioned by the prisoner, or by any. body else in my hearing—I was close to him, and must have heard if it had been so—Sullivan was drunk—he had had plenty of drink, I know—he would not have been put out of the station if he had not been drunk.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I am a porter at the Arsenal Railway-station—I was on duty there on 20th September at midnight—about a quarter to 1, I heard some<lb/>thing which attracted my attention—these railings are, I suppose, about fifty yards from the railway station door—I went there, and saw Brian clinging to them—he was drunk—there were persons round him; one struck him, I don't know who it was—at that time the prisoner came up and asked what was the matter—a man, I don't know who, told him that Brian had been striking him, and he wished to give him into custody—the prisoner then took hold of Brian's arm and shoulder, and endeavoured to get him away; find<lb/>ing he could not, he called me to his assistance—I went over and took hold of Brian's left arm—I had Been the prisoner before; he knew me—a man, who stood behind me, then struck Brian four or five times in the face, over my shoulder—the prisoner did not strike him—the man struck the blows over my shoulder—I pushed the man out of the way, and the prisoner told the man not to strike him—I saw no more of the man—when we got Brian away from the railings, another constable came up—the prisoner did not strike Brian between that time and our getting him away from the railings—he did not put out his feet to throw him down—I saw a black man there—I followed the policeman and Brian about 200 yards, towards the station, close to them; as far as Green's-end—one had hold of his right, and the other of his left arm—as far as I went, I did not hear anything said by the black man or the prisoner about two shillings or money—Brian appeared mad drunk—that was the impression he made upon me, when he was at the railings.</p>

"None whatever"—"Do you still gather funds from the public for this society?" "I do"—"Do you fund them?" "No, we do not"—"What do you do with them?" We keep those funds that we gather for the purpose of paying our own personal expenses in gather<lb/>ing them"—"Then you are hopelessly insolvent?" "Yes, we are hope<lb/>lessly insolvent"—I then asked him if he could not obtain funds from some of his friends, or from some source or other—he said that that was hopeless, for they had already all of them exhausted their friends.</p>

               <p>think that is a contradiction to what I stated just now—I told the Magis<lb/>trate when he began to question me that if he would permit me to speak it would almost be in a nutshell—he told me to go on, and I told him the whole facts as far as they occurred to my memory—I did not refer to my notes at that time—I certainly did look at them, most decidedly, to remind me of the dates; I don't deny that—I find in my notes, under the date of 15th April, "Mr. Verrall, the surgeon attending, gave Mrs. L. two certifi<lb/>cates to prove that at the latter part of 1861 there was no sign whatever of the disease of which he died. Mr. Hill, M. D. also gave two certificates, the latter of which more distinctly proves that the particular form of con<lb/>sumption of which ho died was not hereditary, showing that the society's excuse was utterly without ground. About three weeks after that meeting"——these were recollections—this was written at the same moment as the other—it is not headed—these pencil memoranda have no heading at all—it goes on, "About three weeks after that meeting of 15th April another meeting was held at Mrs. Littlejohn's at which Dron attended for the first time, when, after a very stormy meeting, they resolved that they would not pay her demand, and that Mrs. Littlejohn might proceed to action, when they would defend it, as the law gave them all power to act as they pleased, and if persons did not carefully read the book of rules, it was their own fault"—That was taken as a memorandum of the conversation which took place between us—there is not a word there about their not paying their liabilities—I did not put that down, because I had it in my memory—they did state that they should leave her to her action, and that they should defend it, and that it was not their fault if people did not read the rules—if I did not state that in my evidence I am saying it now—it is impossible for any soul living to be able to remember the whole of conversations taking place at various meetings—here are some words which have been struck out—they are, "Mr. Oxford, senior, states that his Society would at all times take money payments from the children of a deceased person, who died of a pulmonary complaint"—after he had stated that, which he did, I again put the question to him pointedly, "Now, Mr. Oxford, recollect the question I put to you, will you receive money payments for the children of a deceased individual who died of a pulmonary complaint?" and he said, "No, no, I won't say that;" that was why I struck those words out—Oxford told me that they were paying none of their liabilities, because they bad no funds to pay them—I cannot say that I remembered that at the time I was taking these notes; if I had, I should have stated it there—it did not occur to me, although it be the fact—I was never connected with a loan society in the Strand with a person named Reynolds—I don't know of a person of that name connected with a loan society in the Strand, or any loan society at all.</p>

Saunders"—here is "Groves' van" in my writing—it-was originally "cart," and I altered it to "van"—I was present when the barrels were delivered, both in the morning and in the afternoon—I counted them both in the vans after they were delivered—Wood, I believe, is the man who presented the order for the last fifteen barrels, and signed the receipt for them—on that occasion Wood's van was mentioned, and he signed, "H.

I took Day into custody at his own stable—I told him I was a police-constable, and I had come to make inquiries respecting some flour that had been obtained by means of forced orders, on 27th March last, from Mr. Bovill of Shad Thames—I cautioned him as to what he might say—he said, "Very well"—I asked if he recollected receiving any flour on that date—he said, "I might have done so"—I asked him if he remembered Mr. Wood, his next-door neigh<lb/>bour, bringing him fifteen lands of flour on that date—he said, "Yes, I do"—I asked who he purchased it of—he said, "I do not know, for I often buy things in that way"—I asked if he had got any invoice, or any entry of it—</p>
