Gourley—there is a notice on the file dated July, 1893, giving the address of the company, 53-4, Chancery Lane—there is a minute of the articles of association—there is a file kept at Somerset House with an official index—I find no registration of the Brighton News Company, Limited.</p>

               <p>that was the only one I know of—there were no books of account for me to look after; there was only a very small one about Sells' business for two weeks; it was a very small, thin book, about a sixpenny one; that was the only book I saw—about the end of September the defendant spoke to me about another company; he showed me dummies, and said he was getting up an article for a Brighton paper, called <hi rend="italic">Brighton Life</hi>; he said it was to be started by the Agency, guaranteed by the Press Agency, and he suggested that I should become secretary to that company, with a rise of pay; he would give me the first opportunity of becoming secretary—he said the paper would be published in the first week in October; that he had been to Brighton and seen some people, and he had made arrangements with Mr. Baker, a solicitor, and one or two private gentlemen, that I was to be the secretary, and my salary was to be £80 a year in addition to the £120, bringing my wages up to £200 a year—he asked me to invest £100 in 10 per cent. preference shares in the Brighton company—I think I told him that I had not sufficient money, that I had not got £100—he asked me to give him a few days to think it over—I told him I had £25, and I would try and raise the balance—he said he had taken an office at Brighton, and he had made all the arrangements with the local printers—I only saw this pro<lb/>spectus of the Brighton Newspaper Company; it passed through my hands—it seemed to be in type; there were only two dozen of them—I had seen it before I parted with my money—the capital was to be £2,000 in preference shares, guaranteed by the National Provincial—there is a list of directors of that company, Mr. Chester Dawson for one; I knew him as holding that position; Mr. Evan Jones, I have seen him at Chancery Lane; I never saw Mr. Crawley—on the 23rd September I paid the prisoner £25, receiving in return this receipt: "Received from Thomas Hewitt £25, being the first call of 5s. per share"—after that I endeavoured to raise the balance, £75, but I could not do so—I was out of health, and remained at my lodging till 13th October—the prisoner paid me a visit on that day—he told me that the Brighton Newspaper Company had been registered at Somerset House that day by himself, accompanied by Mr. Lewis; that he had been to Brighton, and had caused Brighton to be plastered all over with bills with a large "B. L."; that was the <hi rend="italic">Brighton Life</hi>, and there was £100 in the bank after I had put mine in—he was very anxious to get some more from me, in order that the new capital might be used to come out clean—it was upon that that I paid him the £25, and received the receipt—my salary was not regu<lb/>larly paid; I had received none up to that date—on the 25th October there was some salary due to me, and I said I was out of funds, and should like my first month's salary—he said he would give me back £10 of the money I had paid, him, and he would send on the balance by the company's cheque, which I was to return to him—I got that cheque, endorsed it, and sent it back to him—two or three days afterwards I went back to my duties—I found no work to do, less than before—I said I thought it a great pity that these things of G. A. Sala's had not gone out—he said he was paying Mr. Sala a lot of money, but he could do the same thing himself better—Mr. Sala wrote an article for two weeks—the Wednesday I was at home ill I spoke to the prisoner about it, and he said he had dropped those of Sala's and should write them himself, but</p>

               <p>that was never done—my salary did not continue to be paid; he said he was waiting for the directors, and made various excuses—in November, 1893, I had to go to Plymouth—he promised me money for the journey—on 20th November I wrote to him from Plymouth, asking for money—I got none; I got a telegram—I kept on pressing for money until about the middle of December, and on the 29th I got this letter from him.

               <p>a day after the Royal wedding in 1893 I went into his office as clerk, and I was to have £1 a week—I addressed envelopes and sent off letters, and cut columns out of the <hi rend="italic">Echo</hi> and old newspapers—the cuttings were threaded together in long strips and put on one side; I saw no more of them—I only got £1—I remained there for seven or eight months—I asked the prisoner for my salary once, and he said when he had some money which he was expecting he would let me have it—I did not see any work done by the National Provincial Press Agency while I was there.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know on what day it was, but Dr. Reynolds wrote me a postcard saying that he had bought a horse at Southampton—you went with me to the doctor's place; he was out—I put my horse up and returned at 1.30 and saw him and came away, and coming along you said, "What sort of a horse is it?"—I told you, and you said it was for your business; you were a butcher—I wrote to you to send you some money—I did not ask you to buy the horse—I did not tell you my friend lived at. St. John's Wood; I never saw you—I did not give you a sovereign to go to the doctor's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's defence.</hi> I wrote three times to Detective Davidson to come here and he is not here. He is my principal witness. Mr. Russell told me to buy the horse; he said he would have it for himself. I should not have had anything to do with the horse had it not been for Russell. I took it to the stable and he gave me £4 for it. I was sent to Chelms<lb/>ford Gaol for nine months, and on my release the detective took me again I told him what I knew, as I had suffered so much for other people. I met Mrs. Nicholson in an omnibus and we got out and had some refreshment; she took me to her house. She said she did not live with her husband; she allowed him 10s. a week. She asked me to lend her some money and I gave her the cheque. She took the ring out of her purse and gave it to me. She employed a lawyer to write to me, and I told him where the ring was.</p>

A man says to me, 'Abraham, have you work?' I say 'No.' He say, 'I give you 1s. to pull the barrow. I walk behind.' He afterwards say, 'Meet me at the corner of Black Lion Yard.' I know not the man who asked me to pull the barrow"—the safe was afterwards shown to Mrs. Saratowski, when she came to report its loss, and she identified it—she opened it with a key—it is about 20 inches square and 30 inches high, and weighs about 2 cwt.—it was as much as I and another man could do to lift it.</p>

On December 31st, about ten p. m., I went to 13<hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi>, Broad Street, Bloomsbury, which are gaming rooms, and saw the prisoners there—Muscovitch lives there—I said to him, "I believe you have passed two stolen notes"—he said, "I never had them"—I said, "You passed one at the Alliance Club"—he said, "I was never there"—I saw Leftcovitch stooping down endeavouring to conceal himself—fifteen or sixteen persons were playing with cards—I told the officer to bring him to me; he did so—I said, "I believe you are Muscovitch's brother-in-law?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "You have also changed a note?"—he said, "No, no"—I took them to the station—this bottle was found in a cupboard in that house—the Alliance Club is two miles and a half from Mr. Cohen's house—Leftcovitch Jives at 79, Ellen Street, Backchurch Lane, Whitechapel—I have followed him there several times—that is about three-quarters of a mile from Mr. Cohen's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fishmonger, of 343, Caledonian Road—I have known Holloway a number of years—he kept a hairdresser's shop, and before that a tobacconist's two doors off—I have known Mr. Giles a number of years, and have lately made bets with him—I was connected with him under his code name of "Shrimp, London"—I was "Ben"—about seven or eight weeks ago he said he often heard of some<lb/>thing good when he was in the City, and if I did not mind sending it to Mr. Giles he would settle with me each night whether he won or lost—I gave him authority to use my name, "Ben, to Shrimp, London"—I have had betting tronsactions with him for several years—I had no benefit for the use of my name—he acted as a commission agent—I have heard of</p>

               <p>the mare Lady Normanton—this "Shrimp, London. £3 Lady Normanton. Win. Ben" was not sent by me—I cannot tell you whether Lady Nor<lb/>manton won—I think I received a small cheque from Giles, something like £3—I gave it to Holloway—Giles sent it to me—I had no bet myself that I am aware of; I should not like to swear it—I handed it over because any horse that Holloway backed, if he came in that name and told me he had backed such a horse, he would receive the money which had been won, and if the horse lost he would give me the money or give it to Giles—I was not the go-between—I did not send this telegram, "Shrimp, London. Mandragora to win. Ben"—Holloway told me he had backed Mandragora with Shrimp, and Giles paid me £48; no, not so much; the account for the week is in Court; it was about £40—I gave it to Holloway—I don't think I could read the account—I am no scholar in horseracing, only just a shilling or so I have done through Mr. Giles—I do not understand adebtor and creditor account—to the best of my belief I had paid Holloway no money I received from Giles besides the Lady Normanton and the Mandragora money—the horse on Wednesday was Sweet Auburn—I cannot tell you whether that was a bet I made; it is not my writing; my man used to write them out—Holloway took away the receipts of horses which had lost £6 and £3—this document (<hi rend="italic">Found on Holloway</hi>) is "Giles won"—I received that from Giles, and gave it to Holloway, who said he would come and pay me in respect of those two bets—the account also states "C. Giles. Queen Bess. Stephens. 3, 6, 9"—I do not know the writing of that—I did not send those two messages; my man might have—I gave it to Holloway because he came and asked me for it—they both lost, and Mr. Giles had the money for it—this is one of Mr. Giles's accounts furnished to me (3 X <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 4 X)—here is "Mandragora, £48"—that does not mean that I received £48—there was a balance—I deducted £8 from the £48 and handed Holloway £30 1s.—these were horses which I had sent independent of Holloway—I sent £200 because he owed me a debt—there are no other transactions which do not relate to me—Sweet Auburn has nothing to do with me—I did not send "W W," and "X X" relating to Imperialism and Sweet Auburn, nor do I know who did—the account deals with two items, a loss of £2 on Imperialism and £6 on Sweet Auburn—R. Rose was one of the horses I backed—I lost on that.</p>

"Wilde, Trafalgar Road, Greenwich. Rabicano to win"—I understood by that that it was a bet—I stood to lose £30—I had an application by Holloway two days after that, but declined to pay the amount, by the authority of the Post Office—I had used my name Wilde for betting purposes before November 20th, and the name of Ward—the address to which telegrams in the name of Ward were sent was 19, Cree Place, Greenwich—this telegram (V V) is addressed to "Ward, Cree Place, Belfast"—it is" £6, J.

W.," and "C B P.," the code for the Camden Road Post-office, where those forms would be sent—on November 16th, in consequence of instructions I received, my attention was called to form No. 373, bearing the words "West Strand," the date stamp, and the code time, 12.44—I put the registered number and time of receipt on "V V"—I copied the telegram—it was to "James, P. O., Belfast," and the text was, "Back Grey Leg"—it was written faintly in red pencil—I then sent it up to the Irish divi<lb/>sion gallery at 12.52—I next saw it some time that afternoon—I found it amongst the messages that had been despatched—it then had on it the code letters "C.

I had sent that message to the Irish department at 2.59—supposing by some mischance a telegram for Greenwich found its way to the Irish department, and was put on the check-table, it would be put on the green table and marked "Not N.

I am assistant superintendent of the A division of the Central Telegraph Office—Sturman was employed in that division—on November 16th he was on duty—I made observations, in conse<lb/>quence of instructions I had received, as to his movements on that day—at 12.54 he was sitting at the Belfast prefixing table—132 on the plan indicates that spot—his duty was to mark a telegram with the dis<lb/>tinguishing letter S if it were for delivery in Belfast, or with an X if it would have to be retransmitted on from Belfast—he had no business to leave his seat at all—messages would be brought to him by a man called a distributor, who would get the messages from the south eastern check table, just to the right of No. 135—there are tubes from that table com<lb/>municating with the central hall—messages come up the tube into the hands of the check clerk, who would place them all in the distributing-box, and then the distributor would sort them out—at 12.54 I saw Stur<lb/>man leave his seat and proceed to the check table, where he stood for about a minute—he then went back to his seat and prefixed some mes<lb/>sages for Belfast, and placed some at each of the three Belfast wires, ready for the operators to send on to Belfast—he then left the A division at 12.56 without permission—I am the person from whom he would get</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189501280040"/>
               <p>leave—he left by a door opposite the check table leading into the lava<lb/>tory; by going from the door down a passage, and through a swing door to the left you get into the racing division—I lost sight of him for about five minutes, and then at 1.1 he returned from the direction of the racing department, and to his seat—he prefixed some more messages for Belfast, and distributed them, as he had previously done, to the Belfast wires, and then he again left the division without leave at 1.2 and walked back into the racing room, where he stood, with his back towards me, at table 045—I was standing by the Waterford circuit 201—I remained there till 1.4, and then left the division, leaving him standing in the same position, at 045—Mr. Culmer, a supervising senior attached to the A division, was in the division at the time; he returned from dinner at one o'clock—I had a communication with him before I left.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. TAYLOR</hi>. There are three wires to Belfast—one operator was working on each wire, and at some parts of the-day there were two to each wire probably—Sturman had to prefix messages and then hand them to the operator—there was nothing to prevent the operators from intercepting a message; they would have done it less easily than Sturman—I watched him carefully—check clerks were at the table—if a check clerk had seen Sturman take up a telegram discharged by a tube and put it in his pocket it would have been his duty to com<lb/>municate with me—I made a note of the times in my pocket-book—when the telegram was received at 1.3 I was about eight yards from Sturman when he was prefixing—it was a breach of duty for him to go to these places without permission—he was so placed that I was visible to him all the time—it was most unusual for clerks in that department to go to the lavatory or elsewhere without my permission—he could see me very plainly in the same way that I could see him—he committed a breach of duty right under the eyes of the supervisor—I don't know if he knew that I was looking at him—the check table was about six yards from Sturman's seat—I could see the movement of the distributor as he took papers to Sturman—probably I should have seen if Sturman put anything into his pocket after the distributor handed it to him—a person might approach a tube in the provincial gallery and send a message through it to the metropolitan gallery I think; that is not my department—the tube at the point of discharge communicates with the check table, and that table is under the supervision of the check clerk—he could not speak to any particular message—of course the tube is in constant use—he should or would be able to say whether any message was sent up from below or down from above—there is a centre tube from the provincial gallery communicating with the metropolitan gallery—Sturman was not near that, but in the S. E. wing—a communication from the pro<lb/>vincial to the metropolitan gallery would be discharged on a check table, where there would be a tube attendant, and he would be able to say whether on a particular day a message had been received—that tube may be used when a mistake has been made, and a message sent to the pro<lb/>vincial instead of the metropolitan gallery, but it is used in the ordinary way—several tubes lead direct from the provincial gallery direct to the metropolitan gallery, and the ordinary purpose for which they are used is transmitting ordinary telegrams; they are in constant use throughout the day, and thousands of telegrams would pass through it—among other</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189501280041"/>
               <p>things it would be used to correct mistakes, and to send to the metropolitan gallery a telegram which by mistake has been sent to the provin<lb/>cial gallery, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>—it is suggested by the prosecution that certain telegrams were sent to the provincial gallery, and afterwards sent away from the metropolitan gallery—a tube attendant is on duty in the metropolitan gallery, and he stands by the check clerk and hands him, folded up, the wires as they come down—I don't know if the tube attendant and check clerk from the metropolitan department are here—if the prisoner received at the Belfast table by mistake a telegram for London, he should return it to the check table by the distributor, who would give it to the check clerk, and point out that it had been wrongly distributed, and it would be sent down the tube to the metropolitan division—the check clerk and distributor would be in possession of the telegraph form before the prefixer—I cannot say that any of these telegrams ever reached Sturman's hands, or that they were not handed on to any one of the six telegraphists—if they had been handed to one of the telegraphists they ought to have gone to Belfast—when a tele<lb/>graphist leaves his seat he may leave behind him a number of forms which he may have signed or initialled—possibly they very often sign a number of forms in advance and they may not be exhausted when they go off duty.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. There are a number of tubes between the provincial and metropolitan departments, in addition to the one I have spoken of—I have been many years at the Post Office—I should not call it a rare occurrence for a telegram to be sent to the wrong department—it happens every day—a message for the London department, if delivered at the Belfast table, could be sent upstairs to the London department by hand, but that would not be the ordinary course—if it were taken upstairs irregularly by hand the messenger would probably take it to the person in charge of the division, or he could place it in a rack—a large number of persons are walking about—a person could take a telegram up<lb/>stairs, and put it in the rack without necessarily attracting attention—messengers are constantly going up and downstairs from the provincial to the metropolitan division; we call them transfers; they transfer messages that require correcting or inquiry about; such messages go by hand rather than through the tube, as it is quicker; they are constantly passing from one division to another throughout the building—a dishonest person could take a telegram upstairs without attracting attention, and when he got upstairs all he would have to do would be to place it in the rack, and it would them be placed on a circuit and sent off without attracting atten<lb/>tion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a supervising telegraphist of the A division, the division in which Sturman was employed—on October 31st he was on duty between noon and four in the afternoon to receive telegrams from Cork—he was an operator at 223 wire, that was his proper position—noticed him about twenty-six minutes past three, he changed his position from receiving telegrams to that of sending, that is, he was dealing with forwarding messages—he took the opportunity, in the absence of the sending clerk, Montgomery, to take his place—Montgomery had gone out on permission—he was sitting at 223 (Cork)—two men sit at the wire, side by side, one to send, the other to receive, working simultaneously—from</p>

               <p>noon till 4 Sturman was receiving messages for Cork—he had no authority to alter his duties, it was quite irregular—the result of his change would be to bring into his possession telegrams addressed through the office to Cork—after that I saw him leave the division at 3.48, that would be with permission obtained from Mr. Phillips, I believe, from the superin<lb/>tendent in charge—he went out at the door opposite the table which has been mentioned—the doors are swing doors, leading to the lavatory—he returned at four p. m. and took up his proper position, sending telegrams to the proper wire—his duties would change then—he would be receiving from ten till four and then change to sending till five and then his duties would cease, that would be his proper duty—On the 16th November I returned to the division at one o'clock—Mr. Phillips was in the division—I was there when he left—I then saw Sturman; I had seen him between those two intervals; I saw him return from the receiving at two minutes past one, which he did without leave—I missed him from his seat at two minutes past four, but I did not see him leave his seat—he returned at 1.6, he came from the direction of the racing-room—on the 20th November he was on duty between ten and three—his duty during that time was prefixing for Belfast—his seat would be at the end of the table—at three he should have taken the key for the sending telegrams, passing to 132—the pre<lb/>fixing terminates then, and he should then have taken the passing of telegrams to Belfast—he then went to the check table—he had no business to do that—I saw Ray, a distributor, there at that time—he was at the table—he had telegraph messages in his hand ready to distribute—Sturman snatched them from Ray's hand, placed some of them to the key of the Belfast wires, No. 135, and hurriedly left the division through the same doors—that was at one minute past three—I saw him again at 3.5—he then handed a substitute paper to the superintendent, and he obtained a substitute for the remainder of his day's duty, at one minute past three, he requested permission to leave duty, and left the division at 3.6.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. TAYLOR</hi>. I attached very considerable import<lb/>ance to his leaving the division hurriedly on November 20th—I believe I have mentioned that before—possibly I have not mentioned it in evidence before—I don't think I used the word "hurriedly" before the Magistrate, but there is a letter written on that date—Ray was the distributor who in the ordinary course would hand the telegram to Sturman, but not at that time; his duty terminated at 3.10—Sturman would not be prefixing after three—he snatched the messages from Ray at three—at three he would take up the distribution of telegrams to Belfast—he did not do so, but snatched them from Ray—he placed some of them on a Belfast wire, and then left the division—he did not prefix the messages that he snatched from Ray—no prefixing took place after that—at three he should have taken up the telegraphic communication to Belfast—I do not suggest that he did that instead of prefixing—his duty was to send the messages himself—Ray's duty was to supply him and others with tele<lb/>grams to the other wire—he ought not to have taken them from Ray—some of them he ought to have sent; some he gave to the other man—if he had put one of them in his pocket, I don't know that I should have seen it—I am not omniscient, I was observant—I was standing in close proximity to the superintendents desk—he went to the check table and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189501280043"/>
               <p>took the messages from Ray—he did not return to the check table, he went to 135; he had no business there—he would have his back to me, or sideways—I think I was three or four yards from him—after 3.10 it was no part of his duty to hand messages to any other telegraphist—it was not the duty of any other telegraphist to receive from him—he would not necessarily know that I was three yards from him—I don't think it possible or probable, he would see that I was engaged on my own duties—I had other duties besides watching him—I was attending to the wire from 2.4—I am an operator—that was my regular duty at that particular time, to sit at the table 234—I was observing; I might have been operating and observing—the instrument was at my side—my position would be some<lb/>thing like it is now with regard to you—I doubt if it would be ten yards; it would be about five yards—when he turned to get the messages at the check table he would be at right angles—he would get nearer to me—his breach of duty was leaving his position and not taking up his prefixing, but taking the messages from Ray—I have seen cases of excessive zeal, but I should not say that I have seen that—I am not a prejudiced witness—on November 16th I was observing, as accurately as I could, what Sturman did—I was not placed exactly in the same position as on the 20th—at that particular time I was rather nearer him—I was not operating at the time, not at one o'clock—if he put anything in his pocket perhaps he did it clumsily—he is a very smart young fellow, probably he eluded me—when he returned from the racing room it was 1.4, and he went to his seat at 2.6—he was under my observation during that time—I should say he was ten or twelve yards from me—I was acting under instructions to observe his actions—if he had handed any message to a clerk at that time I should have seen him—I may have talked over this case with other Post Office authorities—I do not make the slightest suggestion against Montgomery—on 31st October Mont<lb/>gomery changed his position from receiving telegrams to sending them, and Sturman took his place—I make no imputation on Montgomery, or of any collusion with him—he left his place at 3.26 with permission; he was relieved by another operator—a telegram for Cork would arrive at the Central Office at 3.35—Montgomery should have been operating from three to four—he was not there at 3.48—he would have been able at that time to commit a fraud; I do not suggest anything—Ward took his place for two minutes—Montgomery was away from his seat for twenty-two minutes—Sturman was operating at that time—for two minutes of that time Sturman was there, acting in Montgomery's place—he did not volunteer to take his place, but he did it without any permission—he was only there two minutes—twenty-two minutes is a long time for being absent—if a man merely left to relieve himself, he would not be away so long—I can't say for what purpose Mont<lb/>gomery left, he was away from 3.26 to 3.48—at 3.26 Ward took his place at sending telegrams—at 3.28 Sturman changed places irregularly with Ward at the sending wire, and remained there till 3.48—Ward did not go there by my instructions—sometimes an operator asks another to relieve him and gets permission of the superin<lb/>tendent—at another time a man is instructed to relieve him—he would not get another to relieve him unless he wanted to leave the division—a</p>

I am a clerk to Mr. Kent, a solicitor, of 97, Cheapside, who was acting as solicitor for Sturman—I was present at his office when Ray called—I either handed him the letter or read it to him, I forget which—I received it, with instructions for the defence, from Sturman, in Holloway Prison—it was written on foolscap paper—I did not see Sturman write it—he wrote it in his cell, with the instructions—there were about a dozen sheets of paper, and this letter was one—I destroyed it in Ray's presence, to the best of my recollection.</p>

When he took it from my hand he fixed it, and I should in another minute have handed him the very package I had in my hand—I cannot say that I saw him prefix that particular message, but I saw him prefix messages which he took from his pocket—I was five or six yards from his seat when he took the message from me—he had seen me prefix messages before, and I was continually bringing him messages to prefix—I did not see him do it—I do not know whether I saw Culmer outside, but he sits near there—he is an operator—at the time Mr. Culmer took the message from me, he was prefixing, and after that—I read the letter myself—I will not pledge myself to the exact words—but the clerk was in the A division—I am quite certain the words were not "addressed to Cork, you were asked for"—the letter was dated the 21st, but I did not get it till the 24th; I have the letter now which arrived on the 21st—the letter was only in my hand the time it took me to read it, and I handed it back at once—I received it a little before twelve, and on leaving the office I went straight to the Post Office on duty from twelve to eight—I was from twelve to three distributing, and from two to three distributing, the next hour I was distributing, and two hours afterwards—I made this note between one and two—one clerk would speak to another if he wished—if you went into the office when they were busy you would hear the clicking of the instruments, not con<lb/>versation—the first date was October 6th—I have no recollection what the address was, I never found it—there would be another messenger with me from one to two, but from two to three I should be by myself—I was on duty on October 1st if it was a week-day, I have not been away at all, but my hours vary—if I am not there another official takes my place—I am not there earlier than eight—I was probably on duty on November 16th, but cannot recollect being asked for any information—I may have heard conversation about betting amongst the clerks but I should not take notice of it, not that it is so common, but I do not speak about betting myself and I do not notice what they say—I go to the metropolitan gallery three hours a day to practice; they are nearly all young women there—I do not not know any of them personally—I sometimes go into the racing gallery but cannot say whether they indulge in conversation about betting there; I only go there to qualify—I am not afraid of contamination.</p>

The eight hours would be specified on the Thursday before—the week begins on Monday, and he would know on the Thursday before exactly what his duty would be in the coming week—on October 31st I was in the A division between three and four o'clock—I had received instructions in Septem<lb/>ber 1893, to keep special observation on Sturman, and on this day, between three and four o'clock, I watched his movements—he took</p>

               <p>charge of case 223, Cork circuit, instead of acting as receiver, which was his proper duty at that time—the key is the instrument by which you send more signals, it works in two directions—it was his duty to be at the receiving wire, and I saw him change over to the despatch wire, with Montgomery—I made this note at the time in the divisional diary: "October 31st, 1894, three to 3.18 p. m. writer 223 Siemen Key"—"writer" means receiver, he has to take down the message received from Cork—again at 3.26, "223 Diamond Key"; that is the second change; "3.48, outside with permission," appears in the lavatory diary—he returned at four o'clock—I noticed at 3.36 that Sturman had again taken up the key notwithstanding he was told that he was in the wrong position—Ward, who is not now in the service, was at the key when he changed the second time; he was there for one month—the change was made a minute after Ward took the position—Montgomery was absent from 3.26 to 3.37—that does not appear in the diary—Mont<lb/>gomery took up a position by the side of Ward, who was receiving till 3.48; Montgomery took up the key when Sturman went outside and took his proper position at 3.48—Sturman changed his position in my presence without authority—I did not speak to him about it be<lb/>cause I had instructions not to interfere with him—on November 27th at one o'clock, I was on duty in the division as general superintendent of the room, and at that date I had verbal instructions from my superior officer to let Sturman do as he liked—he should be a puncher at one o'clock, a man who prepares messages for the Waterford circuit 201—his duty was to perforate the messages to send by the automatic translator, and I saw him doing so at one o'clock, but at 1.2 he got up from his seat, passed out through the south<lb/>western door, and returned through the racing room at 1.4—he had not permission to do that—he was exactly two feet eleven inches from the check table, in fact he could have reached it.</p>

Smith, gave him his instructions—he retired on a pension about March last; I acted with him—he was the person who gave me instructions to let this man do as he liked, but his mantle descended upon Mr. Headland—I received many instructions from him; in fact, I have been under cross-examsnation for twelve months—continual questions were asked me with regard to the movements of Sturman—I can tell you as much more about him as you like.</p>

I have devoted my time to examining handwriting for nearly the last eleven years—my experience during that time has been my training—I took it up as a profession to get my living by it—I began to give evidence in this Court five or six years ago—the first case I was engaged in was eleven years ago, and I believe Mr. Nether<lb/>clift died about three years ago.

                  </hi>. I am employed in the Confidential Inquiry Office of the General Post Office—on November 27th I saw Sturman at half-past one—I had a conversation with him—I showed him this tele<lb/>gram "Q Q," and said, "Look at this mutilated form which is now addressed to "Shrimp, London," and consists of a bet of £3 on Lady Normanton. When the message, No. 227, was handed in at the West Central Office, it was addressed to Cork; that message was torn off and the lower part of this form substituted. On the day this happened, the 31st October, you were properly engaged in receiving</p>

               <p>telegrams for Cork, but at the time this message was due to arrive at the Central Office, you changed with another clerk, so that you should be sending messages to Cork. Now at 3.48 p.m., at which time this message would have reached the Cork division, you left your place and the gallery. You did not return until four o'clock, at which time the result of the race won by Lady Normanton was known in the office, and this message to Shrimp was transmitted"—he replied, "I did not do it, that is all I can say"—I then showed him the telegram "VV," and called his attention to the time he was on duty and to the time the form was handed in, as I did in the other case—he replied, "I can't explain the message either"—I adopted the same course with regard to "YY"—I detailed to him the evidence of Ray, and then detailed to him the circumstances—he said, "I may have got out of my seat, I shall have to deny that I tampered with the message"—I said nothing to him about "ZZ" that is the tele<lb/>grams of 27th November—"VV" and "YY" were spoken to by Mr. Woodward—on the following day I went to the Offord Arms, Caledonian Road, and saw Mr. Hurdle and had conversation with him—the prisoner Holloway came to the house; Mr. Hurdle told me it was Holloway—I told him who I was and said, "I have just been making inquiries of Mr. Hurdle and the name of Gough and Mr. Wilde. The telegram backed Rabicano for £6; Mr. Hurdle tells me that it was sent by you, and that you had previously obtained his permission to use his name"—he replied, "I did not send the message"—I said, "But you called on Mr. Hurdle yesterday for the money won on that bet"—he replied, "Yes, but I did not send that message"—I said, "Who did?"—he said, "Someone from whom I have received big sums of money at different times"—I said, "Who is he?"—he replied, "I don't know why I should say"—I then produced the telegram "Y Y" and said, "This telegram is a forgery, you did not send it, who did?"—he made no answer—I said, "You understand your position; the telegram is a forgery, and you appear to be responsible for it, unless you say who sent it, what is his name and address?"—he replied, "I don't know"—I then fetched Mr. Burman, and on his arrival I saw him in the presence of Holloway—I said to Holloway, "I have been seeing Mr. Burman in connection with this tele<lb/>gram," which I produced to him, "Y Y," "which the man sent in the name of Ben to Mr. Giles, whose registered address is 'Shrimp, London.' Burman says you sent that message, and he had one-sixth of the winnings while you had the remainder"—he said, "I did not send the message"—I said, "This message is a forgery. Who sent it? You received the greater part of the money. How do you account for it?"—he said, "I handed it over to the man"—I then asked him if he sent a betting message on the previous day to Shrimp—he said "No"—I asked Mr. Burman if he had authorised any other person besides Holloway to send messages in the name of Ben—he said, "No"—I then told Holloway he would have to go to the Post Office—I saw him there in the afternoon, and said, "Do you feel disposed now to tell us the name of the man who sent this message?"—he said, "I don't know the man; I don't know where he lives"—he was then given into custody.</p>

I was present at the Police Station on November 28th—after Holloway and Cooper were arrested, Sturman, nod<lb/>ding towards Holloway, said, "You have got hold of the wrong end of the stick here, whatever the other may be"—I think Holloway was too far off to hear it.</p>

Sturman was on duty on Saturday, November 17th, from twelve noon to eight p. m.—on October 31st Sturman left the division with permission at 3.48, and Montgomery left with permission at 3.26—Montgomery only left once I am sure; it is re<lb/>corded in this book—Montgomery made the entry himself—he left his seat twice—he should properly have taken charge of the key of that circuit at three o'clock, and instead of that Sturman took it from 3.0 till 3.18—then Sturman and Montgomery were told by Mr. Testor that they were out of their places and they took their proper places till 3.26, when Montgomery went outside and was relieved by Ward, and immediately after Montgomery left, Ward and Sturman changed places, Sturman taking charge of the key, and he remained there till 3.48, and at 3.48 Sturman went out—Montgomery sat beside Ward from 3.37 to 3.48, Ward doing the receiving work and Montgomery doing nothing till 3.48, when he took the key from Sturman—I speak of this from memory and from a note I made at the time—the note is "Sturman's key 30-18, ditto, ditto, 3.48 outside," and immediately below is "3.26"—it means he was at the key from three to 3.18—I did not intend it to be understood by other people—other assistant-superintendents would have access to it—the "26" was blotted at the time by accident—the entry was made for official purposes, and was abbreviated so that others might not understand it—Mr. Testor witnessed my making that entry—I called his special attention to it—there are no alterations in it—I cannot speak definitely to November 16th, about 1.6, no doubt I had just come on duty—Mr. Culmer, I believe, can speak to that.</p>

I live at No, 6, Devonshire Square, City—I am a turf commission agent—I have a registered telegraphic address "Cernentia"—I have a betting business with a man named Steadman, the arrange<lb/>ment with him was that he was to send me £5 up at the time of the race starting, and if he wanted more he was to send me more—he is a gas engineer in Bethnal Green Road—I received a telegram marked "H," dated 14th September, 1894, backing a horse called Amiable—there was something I thought wrong with it, and I sent to Steadman about it—I did not send the telegram to him; I did not pay at once—next day another telegram came that was unsatisfactory, and I went to Steadman about it, and asked if he could account for the delay—on the 15th I received this telegram "B B" relating to a horse named Queen's Evidence, and I communicated with Steadman about that—that was something like an hour after the race had been run—Steadman after that came to see me—I had some conversation with him, and a few days afterwards he came bringing the defendant Hatchman with him, and in his presence he said that the messages were not sent by him (Steadman), but by Hatchman, and he introduced Hatchman to me—I had never seen him before—I asked Steadman how he accounted for the long delay—he referred to Hatchman, and I said to Hatchman, "I have no business with you, but I will hear what you have too say"—he</p>

               <p>said, "I sent them, that is all I can say about them"—I said, "Where do you live?"—he said, "At Hackney"—I said, "How do you account for these messages being put in at Balham?"—he said he was there look<lb/>ing for business—I said, "How do you mean, the other one came from Balham the next day; were you there two days?"—he said, "Yes"—we had some more conversation and Steadman said, "However, I will not allow you to send any more in my name; I will settle up the business and I will pay you"—I told him I did not feel inclined to pay him until the delay was fully accounted for—he said, "Will you pay me half the money then, divide it with me"—I went and saw my partner on the matter, and then came back and gave him half the money, and closed the account—I lost on the Amiable transaction £5 13s., and on Queen's Evidence I lost £15 12s. 6d.—that was the full amount—I paid half—I had other business with him—I paid it to Steadman—I did not know the other man.</p>

I had not given authority to anyone except Hatchman to bet with Dipple or Tynan—I betted myself with Tynan—in all the bets with Tynan I used to put figures in the telegrams—there were three settlements with Hatchman, two he won on, one he lost—two were with Dipple and one with Tynan—I have known Hatchman a considerable time, being my first cousin—he was manager of a public-house in Aldgate, and he had the Duke of Kent for about twelve years—at this time he was out of business and was looking for a house, where he could find one—I had every reason to believe that he had money—the letter I received from him was not written by himself—I believe he cannot write, and I don't think he can read—I have always been given to understand that he cannot read or write—any letters that I got from him I supposed were written for him by somebody—he told me that he knew Roberts when he kept the Duke's Head, but I do not remember him—my cousin says that I knew him—I was on intimate terms with my cousin—I very often saw him—I fitted up his house for him—in all my dealings with him I always found him honest, otherwise I should not have allowed him to use my name for £10.</p>

I am chief clerk to the sub-postmaster at Balham High Road—I have been there twelve months; during that time Cooper was temporarily employed in the office for seven weeks, from 20th August to 6th October, as a telegraphist—when a telegram is handed in at our office it is first stamped with a dated post-mark, and then the time of handing in is inserted in code letters and then the name of the office to which it is to be sent—these three telegrams, "X, Y" and "B B" bear what purports to be our post-mark, and the code time, and "W.

               <p>at 2.2 p. m., I see it was handed in at Balham, and "Q T S" and "W.

I am a supervisor of the I group in the metropolitan gallery, which includes the wires from Balham High Road—this telegram, "X 1," purports to be a message received at the Central Office from Balham at 2.3—it is part of the practice for the person who receives a message from a place like Balham to initial or sign it as having been received by him—this is signed "C. H. R." as the initials of the receiving telegraphist—I have no telegraphist in the group who signs "C. H. R.," and I had not on 14th September, or before or since—I do not recognise the initials—this telegram "Y 1" "Hackness," addressed to Tynan from Steadman, purporting to have been received on the Balham wire at the Central Office at 2.2 on September 14th bears the same initials "C.

First horse," informing me that the next message will give me the name of the winner—it is just to put me on my guard so as to be quick—at 2.11 on that day I received and took down this message "Y 2" addressed to "Diocles, London," the London telegraphic address of the Exchange Telegraph Company—the message is "Amiable"—it is supposed to be the name of a horse—just before I received that message I had received the signal</p>

               <p>not write them, who did write them?"—he said, "A fellow named Roberts; he went over with me from Bishopsgate to Balham; they were written in a public-house at Balham, I don't know the name"—I made a note at the time—I showed him another message "Y," addressed to Hackness, London, and said, "Do you know this message, addressed Hackness, London?"—he said, "No, I don't know anything about it"—I said, "The full address of it is, Mr. Tynan, 246, Bethnal Green Road. Do you know it now?"—he said, "I must, according to that"—I said "The telegram is a forgery, and the money won over it was obtained by fraud. Were you the sender, and did you obtain the money?"—he said, "Yes; I sent it, and obtained the money off of Mr. Steadman"—he also said, "So far as I know these were sent by me. I cannot read them, but they are the same as sent by me"—I said, "Where is Roberts to be found?"—he said, "I don't know; I don't know his address"—I asked him when these various messages were written out—he said, "Between ten and twelve minutes before the races were run in respect of which they were sent"—I quite understood they were written in his presence—I said he would have to be given into custody—he said, "This is a pretty thing."</p>

On 27th December I was on duty in Deptford High Street—there was a disturbance, some men were about to tight, we parted them, and they left—the prisoner remained and used very bad language—he was the worse for drink—I told him he could not be allowed to use such language—he went away, and returned and made a blow at me with his fist—I went on one side and Knight closed with him, and called out, "I am stabbed"—I saw blood on Knight's neck behind his right ear—I seized the prisoner, threw him to the ground, and held him, with an open knife in his right hand, an ordinary pocket-knife—he struggled very violently, and my little finger was cut—I had to leave go of his hand, and lost the knife—it was found closed in his left vest pocket at the station—I blew my whistle, and assistance came—he said, "I will kill every f—policeman in Deptford"—I was present when the knife was found—there was blood on the blade and on the handle too.</p>

On December 27th, about 11.45, I was in High Street, Deptford, and saw the prisoner and three others quarrelling and wanting to fight, and causing a disturbance—Winfield and I tried to get them to go, and three left, but the prisoner remained—we again re<lb/>quested him to go; he used very disgusting language and walked about five yards and turned round, rushed at Winfield, and attempted to strike him—I closed with him; he seized me round my neck and said, "Take that"—I felt a severe blow behind my ear; I staggered and fell—I got up again and saw Winfield struggling on the ground with the prisoner—I found blood rushing from my neck, and said, "Mind the knife, George; he has stabbed me"—the prisoner said, "Yes; and I will kill every b—policeman that is in Deptford"—I went to Winfield's assistance as well as I could, and saw a knife in the prisoner's hand—I held his wrist and tried to take it away, but I fell back exhausted and had to be carried to Dr. Du Cane close by—I have not recovered yet; I have only returned to duty this morning—I still feel pain when I turn my head—this is the knife (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am a postman, of 8, May Bank Cottages, Lewisham—on December 27th, about 10.45 p.m., I was in High Street, Deptford, and heard a police whistle—I went to see what it was, and saw Knight with his hand to his ear, which was bleeding—he had the prisoner on the ground, with a knife in his hand—I did not see it, but it cut my finger, and I was kicked on my back—I went with the prisoner to the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The cut was across my little finger—it could not have been produced by a nail or a pin—it was clean—I did not see a pipe or the remains of a broken pipe on the ground—when I tried to get hold of his hand it was closed; there was blood on his hand, which caused it to slip—when I went up Knight said, "I am stabbed," and Winfield had the prisoner on the ground—the struggle lasted three or four minutes, but I saw no knife—a lot of constables came, but they could not find the knife—I went to the station and saw this knife found in the prisoner's breast pocket with blood on it, which is there now—they went to look for the knife before they searched him, and were away about half an hour; I do not think it was an hour before he was searched—I remained at the station the whole of the time—he was not put in a cell, he was in the room—Winfield searched him, and a sergeant was</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Directly the charge was taken the prisoner was searched—he was held by two constables and the knife was found in his breast pocket—I had a search made by two constables while he was being con<lb/>veyed to the station, but I was at the station as soon as he was—as soon as I came back the charge was taken—I mentioned about the blood before the Magistrate—the stains are there now; but they were different then—Newnham is wrong if he says that half an hour or more elapsed before the knife was found.</p>

                  </hi>, M. B. I am a bachelor of surgery of the Royal University of Ireland, and practice at Evelyn Street, Deptford—Knight was brought to me on December 27th about midnight, bleeding severely from a wound behind his right ear, an inch deep at least—I probed it—it was in a very dangerous place; it severed one of the branch arteries—without medical assistance death might have happened—I could not tie the artery and had to place a ligature round it—it penetrated to the bone—it was inflicted by a sharp instrument—his right ear had a small cut on it—I saw the knife; it was bloody, and a small portion of bone was adhering to it—the blow must have been inflicted with considerable force; it had penetrated the muscle before it wounded the artery—it may paralyze his sight, and probably his hearing.</p>
