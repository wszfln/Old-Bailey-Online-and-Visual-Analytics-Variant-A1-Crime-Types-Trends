Bodier then rushed up followed by the prosecutrixâ€”she said in French three times, "<hi rend="italic">C'est lui</hi>" which is "That is he"â€”in the prisoner's hearing a French boy who was there said that it was the small prisoner (<hi rend="italic">Bellanger</hi>) who stole the prosecutrix's purse, and that the other had knocked her downâ€”the prisoners made no answer, and I directed the constable to take Bellanger to the station, while I took Bodierâ€”I only remained a short time at the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a French polisher, of 8, Trifina Place, Bow Laneâ€”I was formerly a Reservist in the 18th Hussarsâ€”I was discharged from the Colours on August 10th, 1902, and went to 14, Abbey Street, Plaistow, where the prisoner, who is my aunt, livesâ€”I only stayed a few hoursâ€”on August 11th I decided to leave that address, and told my aunt that letters might come for me, and that she was not to open themâ€”I went to Bow Laneâ€”I did not tell her the addressâ€”about three months after August 11th I went to see my auntâ€”I asked her if she had any letters for meâ€”she showed me these opened envelopesâ€”one contained my discharge, and the other a money order for Â£10â€”the postmarks are November 15th and 17th, and both are addressed to Private B. Meacham, 14, Abbey Street, Plaistowâ€”I told her that she ought not to have opened them, and it was quite likely she would get into trouble over itâ€”she said, "Don't make a fuss about that," and that she had already changed one order for Â£9, and would pay it back at Â£1 a week after Christmas, and that a man came into the shop who said he had been a soldier for fifteen years, and had shown her the way to change the order, and that she had paid Â£4 rent, and bough herself a pair of boots with the moneyâ€”I reported the matter to Aldershotâ€”the signature "Benjamin Meacham" on this order for Â£9 is not mine, nor written with my authorityâ€”it is dated December 1st, so that the inter<lb/>view with my aunt must have been subsequentâ€”I never told her that she could use money coming to me.</p>

               <p>if there was a depressed fracture of the skull, that might be so; assuming that to be so, the thickening of the bone might lead to atrophy of brainâ€”pressure of the brain might possibly lead to insanity, which you might discover by symptoms, or the X Raysâ€”I do not think you could discover it by touch or feelingâ€”insanity sometimes skips a generationâ€”I know the facts of this case; from my experience, I should not say that many of the acts in it are those of a person of unsound mindâ€”I do not know that I should consider the weapon with which the murder was committed is a very extraordinary oneâ€”it is a very effective oneâ€”I should think a weapon of this kind is a very easy thing to obtain, as they are to be found in every houseâ€”I cannot say that I have ever heard of a sash-weight having been used before for such a crimeâ€”looking at the case from an ordinary point of view, one would say that to commit these wholesale murders would be scarcely worth the whileâ€”I should not say that the doing of it is an indi<lb/>cation of insanityâ€”I have been connected with similar cases, where over-anxiety about detection has not been noticed in persons who were described as sane, and who were never found to be to the contrary; in those cases insanity was set up as a defence, but two of them were not successfulâ€”a sane person is not always over anxious, it depends on temperament, many people are callous without being insaneâ€”I do not think it is an indication of insanity to commit wholesale murder, there is no reason why a man who does so should not be insane, but I should like to know the facts of the case before I decidedâ€”it is decidedly exceptional to meet with a case of wholesale murderâ€”I can recollect a case in which there were two murders committed, but never three in my personal experienceâ€”it is very common in cases of insanity, for an insane person to be controlled and influenced by the same motives which actuate persons who are sane, but 99 per cent of the cases of insanity are not insane altogether, they have got many sane sidesâ€”violent impulses to acts of murder or homicidal attacks may be dormant in an individual for a long time without showing outside expressionâ€”a person may not show to the outside world evidence of the conflict going on inside his mind, and there may not be any such conflictâ€”those people may have uncontrollable destructive impulses, but whether the person knows' the difference between right and wrong at the time is the debatable pointâ€”there are some eminent medical men who hold that insane persons may commit an act knowing it to be wrong, but are unable to control the impulse to commit itâ€”there are some cases in which the act itself is the chief evidence of mental disorder in the individualâ€”in the majority of eases of homicidal mania, the person who commits the act does not seek to obliterate all traces of the crime, they are quite indifferent to the tracesâ€”my experience of criminals is that indifference as to concealing the act is a characteristic of insanityâ€”I should say that in the majority of undoubted cases of insanity persons are indifferent as to obliterating traces of the crime when acts of this sort are committedâ€”persons do not always show great calmness, but they do show absence of fear; they sometimes show great cunning and ingenuity, but at the same time they may be quite indifferent in effecting concealment and indifferent to the number of lives they takeâ€”I do not say that that is evidence of insanity,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190302090051"/>
               <p>but it is a frequent consequence; it is more likely to be associated with an unsound mind than with a sound oneâ€”I should say it is probably the case that an insane person committing a murder would not have accomplices, however colossal the scheme may beâ€”an insane person suffering from a homicidal paroxysm might kill any number of persons, but so might a sane personâ€”I do not say he would do so without a motiveâ€”I cannot say what is sufficient motiveâ€”a sane person committing an act which might forfeit his life, might not have a sufficient motiveâ€”I have known a few pounds be sufficient motive, and where there was no evidence of insanity; both the cases I was thinking of were murders done in trains, I believe both on the Brighton line: the murderer might not know the amount of money the victim had, but a person probably would not be carrying much moneyâ€”I believe one was in a first class carriage.</p>

death was due to injury to the heads in the cases of the man and woman, and in the case of the child to strangulation, there was a handkerchief tied tightly round its neckâ€”there were extensive frac<lb/>tures to the skulls of the man and womanâ€”there had been three or four blows deliveredâ€”the face of the woman had been smashed in, and there had also been a blow on the back of each of their headsâ€”the serious blows had been struck from the frontâ€”the blows on the back of the heads were not of a serious nature, they might have been done in fallingâ€”the bodies had been dismembered by means of a saw.</p>
