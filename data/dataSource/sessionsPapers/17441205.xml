            . The Prisoners came next morning to me at Mr. Dunbar's, and Philpot said, I have got your brother's watch, but I did not take it with a design to keep it, but to return it again - she came voluntarily. Butler was very sulky, and said but little. Philpot said to Butler, Deliver the watch to the gentleman of the house; but she would not deliver it. And Philpot said, Hussy, you have got the watch, deliver it. Said Jane, Christopher, don't let

               <p>Prisoner. I went to see my cousin Tom, as he had been abroad a great while, and he was glad to see me, and asked me to drink with him when he was going away. I saw he was very much in liquor, and I desired him to leave his watch with Mr. Dunbar; but he would not leave it. And I said, Tommy, we will have another pot of beer; he said, he had no money. Said I, I'll go and pawn your watch for a trifle; for I was willing to get it from him, for fear he should lose it, as the times were very dubious. I took the watch and gave it to Butler. Next morning I went to her, and desired a quartern of gin, and asked her what she had done with the watch. She said she had pawned it. I went to Kit Audrey, and desired him to go with me to Butler's, to get his brother's watch; but she would not deliver it.</p>

On Saturday morning last, about half an hour after two, the Prisoner came running along as fast as he could: hearing the watch call out, I stopped him at Scotland-Yard Gate, and kept him till the watchman came up. The Prisoner was charged by the Watchman for stealing an iron bar, but he said he knew nothing of the matter; the bar was drawn out from under the gate, and a hammer was found in the street, a little way off the gate. <rs id="t17441205-4-verdict28" type="verdictDescription">

            . On the 19th of September, about 8 o'clock at night, my house was broke open. I lost in money and goods to the value of 20 l. there were about 3 or 4 pounds in money, most of it was gold, there were some half guineas among it. The money, rings, and those things that were most valuable were in a bugle worked box, which stood in the back parlour; the door was forced open, and the box was taken away.</p>

            . On a wednesday or thursday night, two or three days before Croydon fair, Leekey, Robinson and I, went out as usual, and going by Mr. Thompson's door, we saw it upon a jar; Leekey went in, and broke open the parlour door, and Robinson brought out a bugle box, then I went in and brought out several things, and Leekey came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174412050006"/> out with a bundle up to his chin; we carried a candle in a dark lanthorn, which we bought for that purpose. - Robinson carried the candle in, and stuck it upon the drawers, and we left it there.</p>
               <p>Q. to Thompson. Did they leave a candle there?</p>
               <p>Thompson. Yes, and it had like to have burnt the house; it was stuck upon some drawers. I forgot to mention the candle.</p>
               <p>Uptabake. There were about three or four pounds in money, chiefly in gold, most of it were half guineas; there were rings, a snuff-box, and several things I can't remember.</p>
               <p>Leekey. They ought to be separated; their hearing one another corroborates one another's evidence.</p>
               <p>Uptabake. We broke the shell out of the snuff-box, and sold the silver with the rest of the things to Cane, for 4 l. 4 s. The money was equally divided between us, and with the money we shared, Leekey and Robinson went to Croydon Fair in a chaise and pair -

            , John Hill, and I, robbed Collison of these things about nine o'clock at night - it was done at the upper end of the King's Road, by Red-lion-street. Hill put his hand before his eyes, and said, D - n him, he looks; Gascoign put his hand in his pocket, and took out some keys, and I took the tea-chest, &amp;c. from him, and went off with them.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174412050008"/>Q. Did any of you hit him over the head?</p>
               <p>Waters. We hit him but one blow over the head, and that John Hill hit him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you carry the things?</p>
               <p>Waters. I carried them to Saffron-hill, and left them at a coffee house: the woman asked me how I came by them. I said, I was going on an errand into Cheapside with them - I think it is Will's coffee-house, it formerly was a brandy-shop; but the woman never bought any thing of me, and never knew that I went a thieving. When I was before Justice Fraser, I sent for the things, and she delivered them up directly.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Waters. About two years - we did not live together - Gascoign brought me acquainted with him, and we used to meet at Gascoign's house in Jack Adams's Alley (I think it is.) Gascoign was brought up near me almost all his life-time.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had the Prisoner, Gascoign, and you been that night?</p>
               <p>Waters. We had been upon other things, to see if we could get any thing: after I had left these things at Saffron-hill, we went to an alehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. How had you money?</p>
               <p>Waters. I had a great quantity of money - I deal in hard ware, and keep a house in Hare-street, in Cold-bath-fields; and these fellows used to say, if I did not give them money, or go along with them, they would hang me; and when I heard that John Hill was taken up, I voluntarily surrendered myself, and gave an information; and I would have done it sooner, only these rouges would not let me alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you surrender yourself to?</p>
               <p>Waters. To one Quaite. - I believe he is a bailiff.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to think, that he was a proper person to surrender yourself to?</p>
               <p>Waters. Because he took Hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Hill's being taken, frightened you?</p>
               <p>Waters. No, I was not at all afraid, for if Hill had not been taken, I would have surrendered my self that night.</p>
               <p>Q. But that made you go and do it directly, did it not?</p>
               <p>Waters. It did, Sir.</p>
               <p>- Prestage. These are my property, I sent my servant with them that night to one Mr. Peacock's.</p>

            . I took John Hill about twelve o'clock at night. - I was sent for to Justice Fraser's to take Hill into custody, for I did not take him up; Hill was there. Hill acknowledged Waters, Gascoign, and himself to be guilty of several robberies; - (this was the night before Waters made the discovery) and Hill desired the constable to intercede with the Justice, that he might be admitted the evidence, and he promised that he would make an ample discovery; I carried Hill to the Gatehouse about eight o'clock in the morning. After that Waters was brought to me, and he begg'd that he might be admitted the Evidence. I said, Hill has impeached both you and Gascoign; and when he was before the Justice he said he could impeach nine people, and he said he had left the things at a brandy-house and coffee-house on Saffron-hill.</p>

Not before that night; he was in two or three robberies with me that night, - we robbed one man in Gray's-Inn-Lane by the alms-houses, and another man of a coat and a bottle of gin, and old Hill said he would have the bottle of gin for his own drinking; though he never went out with us before, he knew what his son did, we have told him what we went about, and he bid us take care of ourselves. - I was taken up the very night this robbery was committed.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know old Hill?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see him in your life?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. I might meet him in the street, but I never saw him in conversation.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him in your life to be told his name?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know him any otherwise than as Waters told you?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. No - I was robbed of my coat off my back, and in my coat pocket was a bottle of gin, and two ounces of tobacco.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of men were they that robbed you?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. One of them had his own hair.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you that?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. I saw that myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man that had his own hair a tall man or a short man?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. He was much about my size [a middle size.]</p>
               <p>Q. Was he an old man?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. I believe he might be turned of fifty.</p>
               <p>* The description that Dorrington gives of Edward Hill is pretty just, he wears his own hair, is a middle sized man, and appears to be turned of fifty years of age.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him to be of that age?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. Only from what the evidence said.</p>

I went with her into a broken house, there are several old houses which are uninhabited, and being pretty much in liquor, I fell asleep, and slept I believe for about half an hour. When I waked, I missed the things and my money; it was about three o'clock in the morning before I came out of the broken house - I know I had the stock on, and I had the money, when I came from a publick house that I had been at; and there was no other person that I had any thing to do with.

She said, Watchman, as you are coming this way, I desire you would go with me in here; for Jemmy is got drunk, and will not go home without a dram, and may be you may get a dram. When I went there, Mr. Robertson, the Prosecutor, as standing at the door, and the Prisoner said to him, it is a cold morning, let the watchman have a dram. We went to a house, and she filled a cup, and gave it me, and she would have given the Prosecutor some, but he would not have any. He desired me to stay a little, and the Prisoner said, let us have another dram, for I have another three halfpence left. When that was drank, she was going away, and the Prosecutor said, I charge you with this woman for picking my pocket, and upon searching her the knee buckle and snuff-box were found in her pocket, and some other odd things of the Prosecutor's were found by her direction in the empty-house. She said, she had not the money; and as to the other things she picked them up, and did not know whose they were.</p>

I was a nurse in Mr. Edwards's house; the Prisoner came in at a back alley, between three and four in the afternoon, and broke the door of the room open - She burst the door open by breaking the lock, which made a louder noise than a pistol can do. I listened and heard her feet go cross the room: I went up stairs, and saw the door on a jar. I was afraid of going in for fear there should have been men with their cutlasses. I went to the door, and she bounced out upon me - I know her from one of an hundred, a brazen faced jade: I laid hold of her, and it came off in my hand; I laid hold of her another time, and a second piece came off; I hold of her a third time, and she got away: I went after her, and cried out, Stop Thief. and she was taken in the alley. Mr. Edwards had desired me to give these shirts out to wash, I had laid them upon the table, and when I went up to look for them, they lay upon the ground, between the stove and the wall: nobody had been in the room.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know it was those two women?</p>
               <p>Artwell. I took one of them directly - the farthest of the two [Jackson,] I don't know their names, how should I know their names? this gentleman [Mr. Capel ] came and knocked them off me, with his stick.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever tell Mr. Lloyd of it before the Prisoner was taken up?</p>
               <p>Welldy. I never saw Lloyd till I was sent for; I have said many a time, that it was a lame-footed man that took hold of me.</p>

               <p>Harvey. That was what he did at first, and then he took my money; I run after him, and desired he would give me the money, for it was not my own; and I was only entrusted to pay it - it was Mr. Dean's money.</p>

            . I am a constable; on the 17th of Sept. one Blaker came to me to let me know, there had been a robbery committed, and wanted not to take the man; he said Mr. Littlewood knew him very well, and that he was a fighting man, and was at the fighting booth, and there I saw him; some people said it was an improper place to take him, for he would be rescued: I said the best way will be, to take him when the fight is over, for I will not spoil the gentlemen's diversion, nor spoil the house. Littlewood shewed me the Prisoner, I said let them part the money first; then the Prisoner came into the room: Mr. Blaker and Mr. Littlewood said he was the man, and some of them thought it dangerous to take him then. The Prisoner run away, and the man that keeps the booth said, push; Littlewood and some others ran, but the Prisoner run so fast that they could not take him. I heard he lived in Wych-street, and I took him about three weeks after: I think it was on the 25th of October. Is not that Crispin's day, my Lord?</p>

               <p>Q. You say you was down upon the ground, then you think he took the money out of your pocket, when you were upon the ground?</p>

She told me, the Prisoner had. I went in pursuit of her, and found her at a disorderly house in Beech-lane, on the 7th of Nov. between one and two in the morning. I asked her, what was become of my work? She said, she knew nothing of it. I said, yes, you do; you are a thief. At last she owned she took two bobbins weight nine ounces, and twelve penny weight of gold thread, and Stevenson delivered ten ounces of silver waste to me; but she had burnt a good deal of it - She said at first that she found it; but she said afterwards she had carried it back again, and hid it under a bench by my shed door.</p>

               <p>Panton. Because when our people had done work, I locked up the warehouse door; and I am sure these goods were in the warehouse at that time, for I had but just made an end of them.</p>

I asked him, how he came to do it? He said, he could not tell why he did it, for Anderson was a good friend to him.</p>

I am coachman to Mrs. Hawes, I went out of town with her the 24th of May last, and left my linen and clothes in my chest, and did not come to town till the 8th of Nov. when I missed my things; I thought it must be the Prisoner that stole them, because he used to be about the stable; the Prisoner said he was glad to see me; I said, I am sure you are not glad to see me; he said, why should not I, for I know nothing of your things; and then I had not told any body that I had lost them: he denied it a great while, at last he confessed that he had robbed me, and that he was one of the vilest rogues in the world, to rob one who had been so good a friend to him; he said, he opened the outside door of the stable by picking the lock, and when he got into the room, he broke open my chest with a poker, and sat upon the bed, and ripped the gold lace off the furniture of the saddle, and that he had sold all the things to an old clothes man in the street, who he did not know, but believed he should know him if he saw him. I carried him before a justice, the justice asked him what he had to say for himself; he said nothing, and the justice said, did you rob this man? he said, yes I did, and sold the things to an old clothes man, he did not know. After he had been there some time, the justice asked him whether he would sign his confession, and the Prisoner said he could not write; then the justice said, you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174412050019"/> can make your mark; he said, but I will not do it to day : the justice said, you confessed it yesterday, why can't you sign it now? he said, what I did yesterday I can't help, but I won't do it now.</p>

               <p>Howel. A carpenter said that the price of old iron was sometimes a farthing and sometimes a half-penny a pound.</p>

               <p>Howel. I can't say I should - Cornish is a carpenter; I have known him between eight and nine years, he has the character of a very honest man.</p>

               <p>Q. How was this done?</p>
               <p>Sandford. The girl-that is dead, said, the prisoner struck her with a smoothing iron, - the wound was given the 2d of November, and she died on the 21st day after she received the wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the wound given?</p>
               <p>Sandford. I was washing my hands then, I did not see the blow given. - I did not hear the blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they been quarrelling?</p>
               <p>Sandford. They had been quarrelling all the morning, but the deceased owned she had struck the Prisoner before.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say she struck her with?</p>
               <p>Sandford. With her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the quarrel about?</p>
               <p>Sandford. About drying a gown; the deceased had put a gown to the fire, and the prisoner pushed it away, and that made the deceased angry?</p>
               <p>Coun. Did the deceased do your business afterwards ?</p>
               <p>Sandford. She did the business for ten days after as well as usual.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she complain of any thing?</p>
               <p>Sandford. She complained of a pain in her head, and that she could not stoop very well.</p>
               <p>Mr. Westbrook (Surgeon) About the 2d of November, I was sent for to the deceased; I found her in the kitchen; this lady, her mistress, was there, and the person who, as she said, had given her the blow, (the prisoner was then ironing) there was a small wound a little above the forehead (they scolded very heartily at one another, and I thought they were very much to blame.) The wound being done with an iron, I examined it very carefully, and it appeared to be no more than a common simple wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the skull hurt?</p>
               <p>Westbrook. The skull was bare, but it was not at all affected: before I leave the kitchen I would observe, that Mrs. Sandford reprimanded them both for scolding; and the Prisoner said, Madam, I cannot bear such usage from a fellow servant, for she has struck me twenty times, at least, to my striking her once.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the deceased deny it?</p>

               <p>Westbrook. Not at all. My Lord, where these unlucky things happen (for I should be pretty well acquainted with these things in forty years practice ) it is always my practice to wash very carefully : I attended her twelve days, and had very little complaint, and thought it would end well; and to save charges she came to my house to be dressed. On the 15th day I saw the deceased with a brush in her hand, scrubbing a very large-room; I advised her in matter of prudence not to do it, though I did not see any necessity for that direction at that time. The Prisoner quite scolded with the deceased, because she was so work-brittle, as they call it. The day after the 14th or 15th day, the Prisoner lay in bed, and did not rise (whether it was out of fullenness or not, because the other was not turned away, I can't tell) and would not take her food.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the wound again?</p>
               <p>Westbrook. The wound was very near quite whole, and no farther search could be made, but the symptoms increasing, I had a Surgeon joined with me, and we thought proper to make the operation of the Trepan, for I thought possibly I might find something remarkable upon the brain, but there was not the least mark of injury upon the skull; the symptoms still increased, and about the 21st or 22d day she died; I opened the head, and found in the middle of the brain, to my great surprize, a very large imposthumation, which I apprehend might be occasioned by the blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think the imposthumation was occasioned by the blow?</p>
               <p>Westbrook. I cannot help thinking so, but I cannot be positive but that it might be occasioned from an inward cause, for she had frequently very great pains in her head.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chiselden said, that he was sent for to the deceased; that about a day or two before her death the symptoms began to be very severe, and he thought there might be a fracture in the skull, and that there might be some blood settled under the wound, and therefore proposed the Trepan: he was not there at the operation, but he could not conceive how a blow that a person could go abroad with for a fortnight, and do their business as usual, and no blood underneath, could be the cause of her death; and how that could affect the brain, he did not know: but he said, these imposthumations do happen sometimes to those people who are very much troubled with head-aches: and could not comprehend that this blow was the immediate cause of her death. <rs id="t17441205-33-verdict217" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Who assaulted you?</p>
               <p>Underwood. I can't swear to the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. What number were there of them?</p>
               <p>Underwood. I compute the number to be about nine or ten, but I can't tell the number because it was dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say there were seven or eight?</p>
               <p>Underwood. There were seven or eight at the least, but there were more to be sure, because there were a great many about me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any women among them?</p>
               <p>Underwood. I did not see any.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any boys?</p>
               <p>Underwood. Yes, there was one boy, who hit me prodigiously about my back and sides.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he hit you with?</p>
               <p>Underwood. I believe it was with a bludgeon; it was a pretty heavy weapon, - it was a stick.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that it was the boy that struck you?</p>
               <p>Underwood. I turned about, and saw a boy who was prodigious busy with a weapon.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they take from you?</p>
               <p>Underwood. They took my watch, hat, a stick, and a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there were two or three ladies with you, did they see this?</p>
               <p>Underwood. I don't know; one of the ladies was hit a prodigious knock (as I believe) with a bludgeon?</p>
               <p>Q. Were the ladies surrounded by them?</p>
               <p>Underwood. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first give it out that you was robbed?</p>
               <p>Underwood. I told the ladies of it then.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the people that robbed you?</p>
               <p>Underwood. They turned off towards the cloysters.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the boy go with them?</p>
               <p>Underwood. I think he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see your watch, or any of your things afterwards?</p>
               <p>Underwood. I saw my hat afterwards - at a gentleman's house in Long-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How were you informed of it?</p>
               <p>Underwood. I was informed of it by Mr. Jones the City-Marshall, about three months afterwards, - I believe I can swear to the hat, I had it but 2 or 3 days, I know it partly by the putting on of the button. - I think this is the hat, but I can't swear to it, I bought it of Mr. Huntley the hatter.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174412050023"/>Q. Did they take any money from you?</p>
               <p>Underwood. To the best of my knowledge they did not take any?</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the Prisoners, and see if you know any of them?</p>
               <p>Underwood. I can't swear to any of them; the boy was much about the size of Gadd. - I am cook to the Duke of Montrose.</p>

            . I was with Mr. Underwood at Bartholomew fair, but I can't say on what day of the month, but it was between nine and ten at night; he was between his sister and I, handing me cross a channel; there were several fellows came, and parted us, and pushed us into the crowd. - I believe there were seven or eight of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a boy among them?</p>
               <p>Wells. I can't say whether there was or not; when Mr. Underwood came out of the crowd, his head was broke in a terrible manner, - he was in a bloody condition.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Underwood, you did not mention that, were you knocked down?</p>
               <p>Underwood. They knocked me down and broke my head.</p>
               <p>Wells. When they had got Mr. Underwood into the crowd, I squawled out, and one of them gave me a blow across my back, but they did not hurt me; whether it was done designedly or no I can't tell. There were several gentlemen came to our assistance, but none of them would go to Mr. Underwood's, there were so many of the fellows.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any hat on when he came out of the crowd?</p>
               <p>Wells. He had none, I think he had his wig in his hand when he came back.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say then?</p>
               <p>Wells. He said, they had robbed him of his watch and hat - that he mentioned directly, and some time after he mentioned his stick and handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a watch when he went out?</p>
               <p>Wells. Yes, he had; he looked what it was o'clock, just before he went out - I don't know any of the Prisoners.</p>

               <p>Harper. - I have known Roberts about six or seven years, Billingsly about four years, Page six or seven years, Brister six or seven years, Gadd about four years,

             about four years, and Potbury about four years.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of knowledge had you of them?</p>
               <p>Harper. Billingsly and I were old acquaintance, and went picking of pockets together for about four years; and sometimes Potbury and I used to go picking of pockets by ourselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you born?</p>
               <p>Harper. I was born in London.</p>
               <p>Q. Give an account where you was last summer.</p>
               <p>Harper. Billingsly, Potbury, and I, lived in St. Giles's, and the others lived in Black-boy-alley; we used to go and see them, and they used to come and see us - I lived at one Spencer's in Thomas-street; Billingsly and Potbury did not live in the same house with me; they lived in Cross-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live before?</p>
               <p>Harper. I lived in Black-boy-alley, before I went to St. Giles's.

             and Popes had the house, and let it out to us; Billingsly lived at Pope's, and Potbury and I lived at Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lodge with Potbury?</p>
               <p>Harper. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to move to St. Giles's?</p>
               <p>Harper. And please you, my Lord; I went there to live with a young woman, I am almost ashamed to speak, but that was the occasion of my going there.</p>
               <p>Q. Now give an account what you know of robbing Mr. Underwood?</p>
               <p>Harper. It was in Smithfield, the first day of Bartholomew fair.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any appointment made among you to meet there?</p>
               <p>Harper. No, we met by accident; when I went there I found Potbury and Billingsly together.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go?</p>
               <p>Harper. About four o'clock in the afternoon - I met them about dusk, and then I met Roberts and Page.</p>

               <p>Harper. I met Bannister, Morris and Lippy (who are not taken) Brister, and

             - and I believe there was Gadd; there were ten besides myself, and I made the eleventh, that robbed this gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were got together, what did you do with yourselves?</p>
               <p>Harper. We walked about the fair, hitting people over the head, and picking of pockets, till eight or nine o'clock; and then a little on this side the George Inn they were coming along, and two or three of them took hold of a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you talk of what you were to do, or of robbing people, before they attacked that gentleman?</p>
               <p>Harper. No, not that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Now give a distinct account what you know of the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Harper. I think I should not know the gentleman again, because it was in the dark. They all got round him, Billingsly got hold of one arm, and Bannister and Morris took hold of the other arm, and Potbury took his watch out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they take any thing else from him?</p>
               <p>Harper. When Potbury took his watch, the gentleman went to catch hold of the person, who he thought took it; and they fell a laying him over the head with their sticks: in the skirmish the gentleman's hat came off, and Roberts took the hat and stick up, and run away with them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Gadd do?</p>
               <p>Harper. Only laid the man over the head with his stick, as the others did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go after that?</p>
               <p>Harper. Into Smithfield Rounds, stealing of gingerbread, &amp;c. and staid there till I believe eleven o'clock at night; then Billingsly, Gadd, and I, went to St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the watch?</p>

            , who is in custody, bought it of us for twenty eight Shillings - he lived in Sharp's-Alley by Cow-Cross.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he?</p>
               <p>Harper. He is a pick-pocket, as well as we, he used to buy things of us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he buy all the things you got?</p>
               <p>Harper. No, there were some Jews used to buy of us sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the disposer of these things?</p>
               <p>Harper. Potbury and Billingsly were.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the watch sold?</p>
               <p>Harper. In Cross Lane towards St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go there?</p>
               <p>Harper. Because we were always complaisant to one another; sometimes they came to us, and sometimes we went to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the hat?</p>
               <p>Harper. Billingsly had the hat for four shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you divide the money?</p>
               <p>Harper. Ten of us had three shillings a piece, but they would not give the man with the scratched face [Page] any thing - the overplus was spent among us.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the boy Gadd 3 s.?</p>
               <p>Harper. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it that Page had not any part of the money?</p>
               <p>Harper. They made a fool of him, and would not let him have any.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to that?</p>
               <p>Harper. He was a little angry at first, but he went away, and did not make much noise about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the hat again?</p>
               <p>Harper. That is the hat, I really believe, but I can't swear to it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Billingsly. Had the watch a chain, or a seal?</p>
               <p>Harper. I don't know that, though I saw the watch opened - the outside and inside cases were silver.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Billingsly. If he knows the man lost a watch, he must know whether it had a chain or a seal.</p>
               <p>Harper. If we got any watches with chains or seals, Billingsly and Potbury would take them off, and cheat us of them, so I could not swear to chains or seals.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the chief managers?</p>
               <p>Harper. Billingsly and Morris used to do what they would. I always had my fair Part, but they used to cheat Page.</p>
               <p>Q. How often was Page with you?</p>
               <p>Harper. Never but twice.</p>
               <p>Q. What business is Billingsly?</p>
               <p>Harper. I believe he is a <rs id="t17441205-34-deflabel222" type="occupation">lamp-lighter</rs>

               <p>Billingsly. Was there a chain or a string to the watch?</p>
               <p>Harper. I can't say which.</p>
               <p>Billingsly. What time o'night was this?</p>
               <p>Harper. About nine o'clock, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174412050025"/>Billingsly. I ask you, whether you did not say in the Compter, that Mr. Broomer and others would put you into the cells, and would not give you either victuals or drink, if you would not turn Evidence?</p>
               <p>Harper. I never said such a word.</p>
               <p>Billingsly. Did not you say that Mr. Boddy, &amp;c. made you swear what you knew nothing of?</p>
               <p>Harper. No. I did say that Mr. Boddy and the thief-takers, brought a Man to swear a robbery against me, that I knew nothing of.</p>
               <p>Q. What robbery was that?</p>
               <p>Harper. A man came to swear that I robbed him of a silver mounted pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the man's name?</p>
               <p>Harper. I can't tell, 'tis a tall man* who came to take the boys out of Black-Boy alley, and they cut him terribly.</p>

               <p>Harper. You never was much, unless it was now and then: for the others thought themselves above you, and would not admit you into their company.</p>

             was in Bridewell when I was taken up. Billingsly, Morris, and I, hearing that Gadd and Roberts were in custody, went on board a ship at Shadwell Dock, which I believe is a privaseer. I came from on board the ship, and left those two there. I staid there about two days, and there was a man coming on shore, and he said, I might come on shore with him: I thought they wanted to get rid of my company, so I came on shore on Lord Mayor's day, the very day that I was taken.</p>

               <p>Harper. Lord Mayor's day was on the Monday. and I gave my information on the Tuesday night - of this, and several other robberies.</p>
               <p>Billingsly. Ask the gentleman whether it was the first or second day of the fair, that he lost his watch.</p>
               <p>Harper. You know it was the first day, for you was afraid of going to the fair the second day, and we went to the other end of the town, and robbed a gentleman of a gold watch.</p>
               <p>Watson. Was not you put into the cells the first day, and confined in order to make you give evidence?</p>
               <p>Harper. I was put into the cells to be sure, but I don't know that it was to make me give evidence; I was not above two or three hours in the cells, and then, I was carried before two magistrates in Newgate, and gave this information before them.</p>
               <p>Watson. Why did you not give your information the first day, after you were taken up?</p>
               <p>Harper. Because I was charged with a thing I knew nothing of, and therefore I hoped to get off - I was carried to the Counter on Monday night, and the next day before the Alderman at Guild-hall, who committed me to Newgate.</p>

               <p>Mackinley. He measured me at five o'clock in the morning</p>
               <p>Coun. Measured what?</p>
               <p>Mackinley. A peck of coals - I can't tell the day of the month, it was on a Monday, and he carried them home for me. I asked him if he would read my husband's letter for me, which came from on board a ship, and he sat down and read it - I keep a house of lodgers in Cross-lane by Graves's - I don't sell any thing.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you do with them?</p>
               <p>Harper. We took coach in Holbourn, and went to Duke's-place, but Morris walked there?</p>
               <p>Q. Where does the Prisoner live?</p>
               <p>Harper. I don't know, but I have heard them say he lives in Houndsditch, for only Morris went in with the things, and he met us afterwards at the Plaisterer's-arms in Duke's-place - this was about nine o'clock at night, there were three other Jews looked over them before the Prisoner, but did not bid so much for them by a guinea.

               <p>Q. Was it in the Prisoner's presence?</p>
               <p>Harper. I can't say that, but he sat and drank three or four pots of beer with us afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Prisoner discourse with Morris before you about buying of them?</p>
               <p>Harper. No otherwise than between themselves; I saw Morris and him go out of the house together, Morris had the plate in his pocket, and the rest of the things in a handkerchief when they went out; Morris said he had got nine-pence a yard for the cloth, four shillings and six-pence an ounce for the silver, and twenty six shillings for the cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the Prisoner give the money for?</p>
               <p>Harper. I can't tell, only as Morris informed me, to be sure he would not give us the money for nothing; Morris said he wished he had money enough, and he would have bought them himself, for he thought them worth more money.</p>

I found he was for turning back, and I took fast hold of him, and took hold of his breeches, and said, Lawrence, cock your pistol: Lawrence said, I design to do it; Levi took hold of me, and tore my waistcoat and shirt almost to pieces; then one of the women took hold of him, and we secured him. <rs id="t17441205-36-verdict234" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Clinton. I enquired after him, and got scent of him; I was directed to go to one Macguire's at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174412050031"/> Golden hart in Parker's lane. I went into Parker's lane, but it was not my business to tell them what I wanted with him; so I enquired after one

             that he was a proper man to assist me: so I asked him to go and drink a pot of ale with me, and got him out of Parker's lane; I had another along with me, so we went all together into Drury lane; I got him up into the club room and secured him; when I got up stairs, I said, Do you know me? he said, he did not: said I, You robbed me last Friday night, and you had this coat on with the yellow lining; and he said, Da - n this yellow lining: I am a dead man.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason you could not apprehend him in Parker's lane?</p>
               <p>Clinton. I would not pretend to do it there, I should have been afraid of my life, there are such a pack of villains there; and at the Golden Hart in Parker's lane, there was such a crew singing and making a noise, that I was afraid to stay there.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago is it since you saw the Prisoner last?</p>
               <p>Clinton. I believe, to the best of my knowledge, about 8 or 9 months.</p>
               <p>Q. What has been his way of life?</p>
               <p>Clinton. I can't tell his way of life, he has a very bad character - that he has no visible way of living.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear that he followed any business?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am a gentleman's servant.</p>
               <p>Clinton. The Constable said, he had not been in any service these seven years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If I knew there could have been any thing against me, I would not have gone with them to drink.</p>
               <p>Coun. I think you said you had known the Prisoner for a considerable time?</p>
               <p>Clinton. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray had you ever been in his company before ?</p>
               <p>Clinton. No, I don't know that ever I have been in his company, only in a public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you frequent the same public house amiss did?</p>
               <p>Clinton. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been in the same public house that he was?</p>
               <p>Clinton. Yes - not often, but I have been with him so often as to know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you think then, that he would have known you?</p>
               <p>Clinton. No, I don't believe he did know me.</p>
               <p>Q. You said at first that the public house that he frequented, was a house that you used to go to, which gentlemens servants frequented.</p>
               <p>Clinton. I did say so; but I found that he had quarrelled with the man of the house, and he would not let him have any liquor, so he did not come there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it that the Prisoner first attacked you?</p>
               <p>Clinton. Just by the wall by the Sardinian ambassador's chapel.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you see so as to distinguish his face?</p>
               <p>Clinton. There was a lamp against the wall; and when he stood before me, and unbuttoned my breeches, I saw him very perfectly; I know him perfectly well; and I took notice of the colour of the lining of his coat, and the cape was lined with the same. I swore to the colour of his coat, and the lining before, that it was either yellow, or of a yellowish hue.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you by such a light as that, swear to a yellow from a white?</p>
               <p>Clinton. No, I will not, but I took it to be a yellow.</p>

            . On Friday the 23d of November, the Prosecutor came into my house between seven and eight at night; when he came up stairs, he seemed to be very much surprized, and could not speak for a minute or two. I sent for a dram, and asked him what was the matter. He said, Master enough; that he had like to have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174412050032"/> lost his life within this half hour; and told me he had been robbed, and was very much frightened, but he said he had a mind to put it up, though he knew the man very well: for the charge of prosecuting such a villain, and losing his time, would be more than the loss he had sustained. I said, If you don't prosecute him, you ought to be served so the next night you go out; for that is the way to have men cut to pieces. He went home, and advised with some of his friends; and they advised him to prosecute: he desired me to go with him to Sir

            's; he got a warrant, and had information that he might be found at the Golden Hart in Parker's-lane. We went to Parker's-lane, and as the Prosecutor has said, pretended he wanted a person who he did not want; and he went to the woman of the house again on Monday night, but we had no weapon neither he nor I. While he was talking, in comes the Prisoner - I was not there when the Prisoner came in; I waited just by, and the Prisoner and the Prosecutor came together to me without any body with them. When we came out of Parker's-lane (by the Prisoner's talk I thought it must be him) I took hold of his coat, and we all went to a public house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when you took hold of his coat?</p>
               <p>Pewterer. I told him I had a warrant against him for an assault, and he said, at whose suit? for he did not know that he had struck any body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any resistance?</p>
               <p>Pewterer. He made no opposition, and I told him, I would treat him with all the civility he could desire.</p>
               <p>Q. What house did you go to?</p>
               <p>Pewterer. We went to the Duke's head in Drury-lane; I told him I would treat him with a tankard of beer, and asked him what he would have for supper; I sat down on one side of him, and the Prosecutor on the other, and when the Constable came in, I gave him the warrant, and the Constable said he knew him, (but that is not material) the Prosecutor said to the Prisoner, do you know me now; the Prisoner said, I never knew you before; the Prosecutor said, I wish I had never known you, for you robbed me last Friday night, and this is the coat you had on then.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How should he know the lining of my cape, when my coat was buttoned up to my chin?</p>
               <p>Pewterer. Then the Prisoner said, D - n my yellow lining, I am a dead man. The Prosecutor said, Why should you think you are a dead man if you are not guilty. The Prisoner said, If you swear it, to be sure I am; and he was for knocking every body down as he went along, but there's nothing in that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw the Prosecutor nor that Gentleman before.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the Prosecutor say he was going that night?</p>
               <p>Pewterer. He said he was going to Capt. Hayes at the Rainbow coffee-house in Fleetstreet.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with your bag and stretchers?</p>
               <p>Clinton. I had been that day at Bloomsbury market, to a Gentleman in order to try his pumps on, but I did not meet with him, and I was to call again in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go there that evening?</p>
               <p>Clinton. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What! after you had been at Cow-cross?</p>
               <p>Clinton. No, before that, and from thence I designed to go into Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go by the way of the Sardinian ambassador's chapel?</p>
               <p>Clinton. I thought that was as ready a way as any.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go as far as Cow-cross?</p>
               <p>Clinton. Because Mr. Pewterer was a particular friend of mine, and I had a mind to tell him my misfortune. - I live in Richmond-street by St. James's park, joining to the great blanket warehouse, the back side of St. Ann's.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you, when you were very bad with your fright, and ready to die, to go there when it was a dirty way, and as far as if you had gone home?</p>
               <p>Clinton. I was as near there as I was to my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. But was it not as far again back?</p>
               <p>Clinton. Yes, but I was afraid I should frighten my wife more, than the value of all I lost.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dunn. This Mr. Pewterer came to me about six o'clock in the evening, and asked me if my name was Dunn, I said, yes; he asked if I was a constable, I said, yes. I asked his business, but whether he said it was about a thief, or a street-robber, I can't say; he had no warrant, so I told him I should much rather have a warrant, and go according to law, than to have to do with a man who may prove himself to be an honest man; he said he believed he was in the custody of the prosecutor at such a place; I told him I would be with him in a few minutes, and desired the prosecutor to have a warrant ready at the street-door, that I might have that to shew if I took the man; when I went there I asked the landlord if he had any body<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174412050033"/> there that had any occasion for me, he told me he had; the Prosecutor gave me the warrant, and when I went up, to my great surprize, I saw that unfortunate fellow there, but I did not know then that I had received any warrant concerning him. Hey, hey, said I, here's a street robbery sworn against you, what is this the case after all this course of life? he clapped his hands, and said he knew nothing at all of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose custody was he in then?</p>
               <p>Dunn. He sat between the Prosecutor and Mr. Pewterer.</p>
               <p>Coun. Did you hear the Prosecutor say any thing about the colour of the cloaths?</p>
               <p>Dunn. I believe the words did pass, - he insisted upon his innocency to the last; for he was pressed to make a discovery of his accomplices, but he said he had none, and insisted on his innocency.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him he was entitled to his pardon, if he discovered his accomplices?</p>
               <p>Dunn. Yes, and I believe every body told him so. I have known him between ten and eleven years, and I was a little startled, that a street robbery was sworn against him, because I always took him to be a pusillanimous man, and a man accustomed to drinking, which used to unfit him for Gentlemens business.</p>
               <p>Q. The Prosecutor said you told him that you had not known him in a place these seven years?</p>
               <p>Dunn. That I take to be quite owing to his being given to drinking.</p>
               <p>Cha. Regan. I am servant to Alderman Gibbon.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you so now?</p>
               <p>Regan. I have not been these twelve months; I am ill now, and have been so some time: I lived last with the Alderman; I have known the prisoner between eight and nine years, he was a servant all the time I knew him, till within these few years.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him last before he was taken up?</p>
               <p>Regan. I lodge at the Red horse in Bond-street. On the 23d of last month, I came into the taproom, which I very seldom do, and there were two person talking of one of Commodore Anson's men being arrested; I went into the room between five and six, and staid with these people till seven o'clock. - There were, besides those two, the Prisoner, one Carrol, and another, who I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the time?</p>
               <p>Regan. Because I generally go to bed between eight and nine, since I have had this illness. I went to bed immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Prisoner in company with the other two who were talking of the arrest of Commodore Anson's man?</p>
               <p>Regan. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to bed, who did you leave in that company?</p>
               <p>Regan. The two men I found there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave the Prisoner there?</p>
               <p>Regan. Yes, I left the Prisoner, and the other two.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure the clock had then struck seven?</p>
               <p>Regan. Yes, I am sure of it - the clock of the house had.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the Prisoner to be so long out of place?</p>
               <p>Regan. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be so long out of place as a year?</p>
               <p>Regan. Because I have been ill almost over since, and I don't drink any strong liquors now.</p>
               <p>Coun. How have you supported yourself all this time?</p>
               <p>Regan. By my own industry before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Commodore Anson's man arrested that day?</p>
               <p>Regan. That very day.</p>
               <p>Lyn Mc Cray. I was tapster in the house; the Prisoner came this day fortnight; I had been out, I went at three, and came in again at five; and staying longer than I should, I had not done my business, and my master was angry. I gave him some saucy answers, and he spoke to the Prisoner, and I thought he was going to send him for a Constable. The Prisoner came with his beer into the tap-room at five o'clock - there was one

               <p>Footman. Yes, but what could I do when there were twenty people about him?</p>
               <p>Coun. Where have you seen him in the day time, and never took him up?</p>
               <p>Footman. In Lincoln's-inn-fields - about six o' clock in the afternoon (he had somebody with him) and he asked me how I did; I said I would do my self and him justice, and would let him know how I did.</p>
               <p>Coun. Had he the impudence to speak to you, when he had robbed you?</p>
               <p>Footman. If he had the Impudence to rob me, he would have the impudence to speak to me - I had my child with me, a little boy about nine years of age.</p>
               <p>Coun. Was it broad day light?</p>
               <p>Footman. Yes, 'tis broad day light in summer time about six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Coun. When did you see him again?</p>
               <p>Footman. A great many times.</p>
               <p>Coun. And you had not courage to take him up?</p>
               <p>Footman. I question if he had robbed you, whether you would have had courage to have spoke to him or no. I saw him one night where he cut three ladies pockets off.</p>
               <p>Coun. Why did you not discover him?</p>
               <p>Footman. I had a greater regard for my life.</p>
               <p>Coun. When did you see him besides?</p>
               <p>Footman. At other times, with twenty people round him with cutlasses - twenty together - may be it might be about four o'clock, when I saw him with twenty.</p>
               <p>Coun. I desire you would answer my questions.</p>
               <p>Footman. I am very willing to answer a gentleman any question.</p>
               <p>Coun. What time o'night was you robbed?</p>
               <p>Footman. About half an hour after ten.</p>
               <p>Coun. And could you remember his face from that time to this, at that time of night?</p>
               <p>Footman. Yes, and so I could your's, if I should see you seven years hence.</p>
               <p>Coun. This man's life lays at stake, you ought to be very careful what you say.</p>
               <p>Footman, 'Tis himself is the occasion of it, 'tis not me, if he would let me alone, I would not meddle with him.</p>
               <p>Coun. When did you take out a warrant?</p>
               <p>Footman. As soon as I heard he was to be taken with ease.</p>
               <p>Coun. 'Tis for the sake of the great reward, I suppose that you do this?</p>
               <p>Footman. No, Sir, you are mistaken; this thing was done before the time of the reward being promised, if you please to look back.</p>
               <p>Coun. So you say you have seen him frequently, and yet would not take him?</p>
               <p>Footman. Yes, so I have; but I have so great a regard to my own life, and the life of my friend, that I would not venture to take him; for no body would run into the mouth of a lion, with twenty thieves round him.</p>

            . I came down to Mrs. Footman's house on the fast day, the 11th of April last: and she said, she was robbed by such a man, and knocked down; she said, she was sure to the man, and that she should know him again if she saw him. I said, I knew them all, and I would go and see; and he was one of them that were there, when the pressed men were rescued.</p>

               <p>Langdell. Yes - he was taken up Wednesday was fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not take him up sooner?</p>
               <p>Langdell. I went to Mrs. Footman and told her, I knew where he was, and I said come and see him being it's a dangerous case for the man's life is at stake, and she was positive to his person.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you knew him, and saw him three weeks before, why did you not take him up?</p>
               <p>Langdell. I did not know I could take him up without a warrant, and I thought it was the safest way to take him with a Constable.</p>

It was on a Sunday night, there was a great disturbance in the Strand; there was a gentleman had lost his watch; there were several robberies committed in half an hour, and the Prisoner was among the rest : there was a boy about ten years of age, who was very Cute in that.</p>
               <p>Coun. When was the Prisoner taken?</p>
               <p>Footman. I think it was the 21st of November, at Mr. Smith's brewhouse; he thought it had been an arred: he had an adze in his hand : and when they told him it was not an arrest, it was for a street robbery, for robbing Mrs. Footman; then he swore he was a dead man : and going along he desired not to be carried before such a Justice, because if he went before him, he said he should soon be committed. So when we went in, the Justice said to him, Oh my old Friend, where have you been all this while; what an't you hanged yet?</p>
               <p>Coun. Did not you know of the reward which is promised for taking of street robbers?</p>
               <p>Footman. I did not take him for the sake of the reward, but to justify my wife and my country. I shall call at your chambers one day or other, and let you know whether I keep a night-house or no: you have done business for me, and I have paid you very honourably.</p>

I asked him at that time, what else he had robbed me of; and as fast as he told me, I wrote them down - the buckle is worth ten pounds at least. He said he had robbed me of a fifty pound bank note. Then he told me of the clothes which he had taken and pawned: he said he did not know the peoples names, but he would go with any body, and shew them where they lived. The clothes have been found, and I have received every thing again that I know of, except the fifty pound bank note.</p>

When my husband came home I told him this, and I was advised to go to a Counsellor in the Temple, and I went on step by step by his direction, and he advised me to go to his master.</p>

               <p>Augier. Because my husband had pawned some things, and the prisoner's saying he was obliged to make off, I was afraid we should come into trouble: I met Mr. Masham at White's Chocolate-house, and I said there were several things in pawn which were his Honour's, according to the Prisoner's declaration to me; on Saturday morning the Prisoner came, and said he believed his Master had a suspicion of it; I desired he would throw himself at his Master's feet, and implore his mercy; he said, I shall be too much dishonoured by that; he shewed me the buckle, and said, where he had that, he might have taken a great many more, but his heart misgave him: so I went to Mr. Masham's house, and acquainted his butler with it.</p>

            . In March last Mr. Augier came to Mr. Orton's, and brought a brocaded waistcoat to pawn. My master, knowing it was not Mr. Augier's, he enquired whose it was. Mr. Augier said it was a Gentleman's that lodged at his house; my master sent me to enquire; when I came there, I saw the Prisoner dressed like a Gentleman. I asked Mrs. Augier whether the Prisoner was a Gentleman, and lived upon his fortune; then she talked to him in French, and she told me that he traded from France to England, and that he was a person of a good fortune, [there was one of Mr. Masham's waistcoats produced, which he said he saw the Prisoner wear].</p>
               <p>The Gentleman, who was sworn interpreter, informed the Court that the Prisoner said he had no intention to wrong his master, but he had lost some money at gaming, and in order to pay (that which he called) a debt of honour, he took those things of his master's, and pawned them with a design to replace them; he said, there are two houses in Covent-garden, one that goes by the name of My Lord's, and the other, My Lady's, but which it was he lost the money at, he can't tell; that he pawned those things in order to retrieve himself, but could never do it: he said he had served his master honestly and faithfully for a considerable time; and when he came over with his master from France, he had a gold watch, and had saved money in his service: he had no body in England to appear to his reputation but his master. He asked his master's pardon, and assured him he had no intention to rob him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Masham. Till this discovery, I had no reason to think him a rogue, or to suspect him to be dishonest; for I have trusted him with things of great value, and I never mistrusted him. <rs id="t17441205-42-verdict273" type="verdictDescription">

            . I was employed about six weeks ago by Mr. Smith to take the Prisoner, and I took him by the Hermitage; he desired to go to a friend's house, I went with him, and in going along he made his escape from me, went over some pales, and got into an empty house, where there was only one inhabitant.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you said it was an empty house?</p>
               <p>Pickersgill. There were some women came into the house and threatened to kill me, and one man with a carpenter's saw threatened to knock me down.</p>

            . I am subpoena'd both by the king and the Prisoner. The Prisoner indicted the Prosecutor for an assault, it was tried in the Sittings after last Trinity Term, and there was a verdict given for the Prisoner at the bar; I was with him in Old Palace Yard, and he appeared publicly with his witnesses, while he was carrying on the prosecution against Smith. The Prosecutor (Smith) had spoke several hard words against the Prisoner, and he was advised to get out at the window to avoid being abused, and he did go out at the window.</p>

            . I am the Prisoner's mother-inlaw; a man came to me the 7th of March last with a search warrant to search for these birds, the birds had been at my house a year and an half, and Mr. Smith has been at our house twenty times since, and my son has sent for him to look at the birds when they were not well; (indeed he did keep from my house, because Mr. Smith threatened to arrest him for twenty pounds for board) he has taken the cages down twenty times, and looked at the birds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever complain of their being stolen?</p>
               <p>Marshall. No, never.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I would only ask in what manner the Prisoner has lived these three or four years last past?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174412050039"/>Marshall. He has worked sometimes wit h his father who is a carpenter, and if he had not spent so much time with Mr. Smith, it would have been better for him.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Rogers. Mr. Smith used to come frequently to the Prisoner's father's, and there were three or four cages hanging up, and he saw them; he came in a friendly manner.</p>
               <p>Barbara Rogers I live at Lambeth. Last good Friday, Mr. Smith came to my house with a search-warrant, to look for birds and bird cages; he found one bird and two bird cages, which he said were his, and he said he would indict my son, for receiving stolen goods, and that he would prosecute, and persecute any body who dared to entertain the Prisoner, or take his part, even to death; and as for the old rogue his father, and the jade his mother-in-law, he had not done with them yet, as they should find; that he would make that villain [the Prisoner] run his Country, and if he got him in goal, he would take care to keep him there. Mr. Smith bid me not be frightened, for he did not intend to do me any harm; if I would produce the Prisoner; and make him give him a general release, which he knew was in my power to do: he said, Marshal had put him in the crown, and he was resolved to have his life for it, without he came to an agreement, and acquit him from the indictment; and he said he would be the ruin of me. He insisted upon my finding the birds out, and if I did not, he would swear they were stolen out of his house, and he would prosecute me. I believe the Prisoner to be a very honest man, and if I had not thought so, I would not have let him have been in my house. I am certain he has had opportunities, that would have been more advantageous to him, than these trisling affairs. He did keep out of the way, not on account of this indictment of Mr. Smith's, but only for fear of being arrested. <rs id="t17441205-43-verdict279" type="verdictDescription">

            . I lost these things in April last, the Prisoner lodged in my house; I had other lodgers, but missing several things, I turned them away; when they were gone I looked over my things, and missing more I charged her with them; said I, no body can have them but you; she sell a crying, and said, if I would forgive her, she would bring me my mob in a very little time; she brought the mob, and said she would bring the rest the next day. I missed a tea-kettle the day following, and before I came down she had put on my cloak, apron, and shift, and went away; I found her that night near Bond-street, and she had all the things upon her back; when I asked her for the things, she run out into the street, and said, D - n you, you b - h, if you offer to touch me, I'll swear a street robbery against you, and buy twenty times as much with the reward. I found her afterwards in Covent garden, with the apron on, but she had made away with the shift; I asked her what made her take the things, and she said she took them to dress herself up to be a whore, called me b - h, and used me very ill; I never went after her any more, for she belonged to a gang that I was afraid of; one who lodged in my house saw her come into a pawn broker's, where she had pawned my tea-kettle, and borrow six-pence more upon it.</p>

               <p>Q. By what number of people?</p>
               <p>Jones. Eleven or twelve people husled me, and pinned me up against a wall, and a little youth, about as high as my navel, took my watch out of my pocket - It was a lad about the size of the little boy at the bar [Gadd] I am pretty well assured it is him, but I can't be positive. There was one little fellow (I think it was Jack the Sailor), who said, You dog, or D - n you you Dog, I'll peg you; and gave me a little blow, but did not hurt me - I can't be positive to any of them, because it was in the dark. I was sent for to Bridewell, and they informed me there was one they called, the Old Man, who was turned evidence; I went to him to the Poultry Compter, and he told me who they were that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Field. I desire he may be asked what circumstances he has to know that any of us were concerned in the robbery.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was Field the person that struck you?</p>
               <p>Jones. That little chap, [Potbury] I saw something of his face by the light of the lamps, and I believe he is the person - they husled me up, and I said, Gentlemen, what do you mean by husling me? and I cried out, Thieves, and murder! Then one of them cried out, Coach; one called out one thing, and another another thing: they made a noise like a parcel of ravening wolves. I did not imagine that a robbery was committed; it was done in a quarter of a minute, and then they went about their business. I thought they had been a parcel of srolicksome young sparks; I did not think they were street robbers.</p>

               <p>Harper. He had not one then; I believe he never carried one, for he used to tell them it was wrong to cut and slash People after they had robbed them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a cudass ?</p>
               <p>Harper. I never carried a cutlass or pistol; Billingsly, Potbury, and Wells, used to cut and abuse People, and threaten to murder them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you heard Field complain of their cruelty in cutting People in that manner?</p>
               <p>Harper. Yes, I have; and I have heard him say they were worse than Blewitt and Frasier, to cut and slash people in that manner; and told them, if they did so, he would not go with them, and he often persuaded them from it; they were angry with him because he would not buy a hanger, and he used to tell them he had no money; when he had money they told him, you have money now, why don't you buy one? but he made some excuse, and would not buy one, because he did not approve of their proceedings. He frequently told them, is it not enough to rob people without cutting and hacking them? We went that night into Goodman's-fields, and took another Gentleman's watch, but they did not strike him because the man was pretty easy, and went away about his business; then we came up Rosemary-lane, and coming towards Aldgate they attacked another man, but they did not rob him because some people came out of their shops, and we were pursued. Wells had a horse pistol that belonged to Jack the Sailor; he said, shall I fire at them, he turned about and fired, and they all left us.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Field. I said to the evidence Harper, how came you to put me into the information, when you know I am not guilty? He said, he had given his information, and he could not help it. Said I, would you send your soul to the devil, to take away the lives of so many poor innocent People? the Thief-takers make a trade of it, and do it for the sake of the reward.</p>

             (Beadle of Portsoken Ward) on the 28th of September, between nine and ten at night, hearing a noise in the street, and a cry of Stop thief, I went out, saw several fellows, and catched at one of them, upon which he cut at me two or three times; I got my hat and staff, and called out, Thieves, murder, Thieves, murder; one of them, a tallish Person, presented a pistol at me, and fired; I stooped, and it happened to miss me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Harper. Who fired the pistol?</p>
               <p>Harper. Wells did.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had any of the others a pistol?</p>
               <p>Harper. I believe Jack the Sailor had one, but it was a pocket-pistol, the pistol that Wells had belonged to Jack the Sailor.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was this?</p>
               <p>Harper. It was on a Friday night.</p>
               <p>Day. It was on a Friday night; there was one Rosse stopped that night, and I hearing an outcry went after them; Mr. Rosse was not robbed, but there was one Mr. Winwood robbed that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any conversation with Harper?</p>
               <p>Day. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be here?</p>
               <p>Day. I am here upon a subpoena upon another account.</p>
               <p>Q. Ask him what circumstance he came upon to day?</p>
               <p>Day. There was a watchman killed in August last, and I understood that the person who is charged with that fact, was to surrender himself to day. I attend upon that account.</p>
               <p>Harper. Billingsly and Jack the Sailor were generally very cruel; for if a person did but turn about to look at them, they would knock them down: there was a piece of a skull taken out of a man's head, occasioned by a blow that they gave him, which would surprize you if you were to look at it.</p>
               <p>Wells. I don't know any thing of him.</p>
               <p>Harper. What, don't you know me?</p>
               <p>Wells. No, I know nothing of you.</p>
               <p>Harper. Don't you remember when you went to the Windmill in Cow-cross, in order to kill Mr. Jones the City Marshall, and Mr. Broomer?</p>
               <p>Wells. No.</p>

            . I know the prisoner very well, - he lives in Sharp's-alley.</p>
               <p>Q. What business is he?</p>
               <p>Harper. The same business as we are.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that?</p>
               <p>Harper. A Thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go out a thieving?</p>
               <p>Harper. Yes, but not along with us; but I have seen him with others, they did it in a more genteel manner than we did.</p>
               <p>Q. What! was he above you?</p>
               <p>Harper. Yes, a great deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any dealings with him?</p>
               <p>Harper. Yes, about eleven weeks ago we got in one night seven watches, three gold ones, three silver ones, and a Pinchbeck: we got one in Charter-house-lane, one in Aldersgate-street, two in King-street, another in Fenchurch-street, and that man got his arm cut. - We sold these watches to Turbutt the Prisoner the next day, we went to him in the morning, and he bid us thirty-two guineas for the seven; we thought it was too little, so we went to three Jews in Duke's-place (I don't know their names) and they would give us three pounds an ounce for the gold, but they would not give us any thing for the work; so we went back again to the Prisoner, because thirty-two guineas were better than thirty pounds. We went to one

             (one who is not taken yet) and it was divided in Cross-lane in Holborn; we divided three guineas apiece among ten of us, and the rest of the money was spent at the Horse and Groom in Crosslane.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he gave you a good price; do you think he knew how you came by them?</p>
               <p>Harper. He knew what we were, and how we came by them; for he went a picking of pockets with me two years ago: when he paid us for the watches, he said we were very hard with him, and ought to give him a bottle of wine.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you appeared like gentlemen?</p>
               <p>Harper. We appeared as we could; sometimes we had a shirt, and sometimes ne'er an one.</p>
               <p>Q. How were you dressed then?</p>
               <p>Harper. Some were dressed clean, and some were in a ragged dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any difference between a Sunday, and a working-day?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174412050045"/>Harper. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any other time sell him any more?</p>
               <p>Harper. The Sunday following we sold him six watches more, four silver ones, a gold one, and a Pinchbeck; we sold them for twelve guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. This was a good week; how much money had you left out of this?</p>
               <p>Harper. Perhaps never a peny the next morning. Some had money left, and some had none; and may be never a shirt - we used to play with one another; and if we lost, those that won would not give the losers a drop of gin to save their lives, unless they liked them very well. There was a sword among these watches, and the Prisoner said, as he gave us twelve guineas for the watches, we must give him the sword; but I think at last he gave us two shillings, or half a crown for the sword: he said he would wear that himself - There were all ten of us present at the selling this parcel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask one another's leave who should take the money?</p>
               <p>Harper. We did not use to rob one another in this way; we used to sink upon one another sometimes; that is, wrong one another privately.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never bought a watch of them in my life, and never concerned myself with any of them. I know them no otherwise, than by their going by my door.</p>
               <p>Harper. I have known him four years, and used to go with him picking pockets privately in the streets, and at the playhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there a watch stolen on Bartholomew day?</p>
               <p>Harper. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that sold for?</p>
               <p>Harper. It was sold for twenty-eight shillings?</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that sold to?</p>
               <p>Harper to the Prisoner - The watch we took from Mr. Underwood we sold to the Prisoner, on the 28th of August.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I keep a house in Sharp's-alley by Cowcross, and pay seven pounds ten shillings a year, and deal in horses. I go to Smithfield every Friday, and work as hard as any young fellow in England. I have a stable in Sharp's-alley that holds two horses - I have had but two or three lately.</p>

I had no suspicion of them because they were well dressed; she took it into her hand, whispered two or three words to him, and then found fault with the plate: he said he was a Hamburgh merchant, and exported a great deal of plate, and desired I would give him a direction where I lived; the woman went away in about two minutes, and the man desired I would come and drink with him in the neighbourhood; I desired him to drink at my house, but he refused it; when I had put the salts up I missed the skillet of silver, and no body had been in the shop but them; I got information of them that night, and found them the next night at the Black Boy and Trumpet on Tower-hill; they denied that they knew any thing of the matter;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174412050046"/> the woman owned she was in the shop, but the man denied it.

Mr. Barbe told me he had lost a skillet of silver, and desired I would go with him to see after the Prisoners; he, his man and I, took a couple of daggers, or swords, or cutlasses, and went to the Black Boy and Trumpet on Tower-hill: Woolf was there; when Mr. Barbe spoke to him, he said he never saw him before with his eyes; I left Woolf in custody, and found the woman [Moses] at her own lodging about seven or eight at night; her landlord at first denied that she was at home, and did not care to let us in, but I said I had a search warrant, forced open the door, and went up stairs: she was unwilling to open the door at first; when I went in I asked her whether she was not at the Seven Dials; she said, yes, she went to buy a pair of salts; she denied that she knew any thing of the silver; she said before the Justice she did not know but she might be there, or she might not be there.</p>

I delivered them to the man [Woolf] and he delivered them to the woman. My husband was abroad: Woolf asked me what time he would be at home; I said he had ordered dinner to be ready about two o'clock, and I expected him home then; they desired I would lay them by, and if there were any that suited them, they would come again at two o'clock; they hung some up, and I hung some up. - I did not miss any then, for I was so inadvertent as not to mind how many I shewed them, but I found afterwards that I had lost one.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body came into the shop till you missed the watch?</p>
               <p>Higginson. No, no body I am sure, for I was not out of the shop; I never heard of the watch again till it was advertised by Sir

                        targets="t17441205-53-off343 t17441205-53-crimeloc346"/>, in the Middle Park, before you come to Buckingham-house, I was met by a person who called himself Brown to the best of my memory.</p>
               <p>Q. What time o'night was it?</p>
               <p>Church. When these fellows light of me, it was not above half an hour after eight.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Brown say to you?</p>
               <p>Church. I don't know that he said any thing, unless that it was a fine evening. I did not much like him, and I walked the breadth of the table from the path, because I did not like him. In about a minute and an half, or two minutes time, I heard somebody running, and saw two persons running towards me. When they came up to me, I believe I could have thrown a stone to the bottom of Buckingham green-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the persons that were running?</p>
               <p>Church. The two Prisoners were both running, I think I can be sure to both of them, but I am sure Ruggles was one; and I could swear to the other, but I don't choose it. There were three of them came up to me; they never said, Stand, and deliver; but one of them, which I take to be Shaddows, stooped, and took hold of my two legs, and threw me down.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Ruggles do?</p>
               <p>Church. I will not be positive what he did, but they threw me down upon my back, and beat me in a most violent manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they make use of sticks, or their fists ?</p>
               <p>Church. They made use of nothing but their fists, and I found them heavy enough, for they beat me so, that there was not such a spectacle seen: I had not an eye to see out of; nor could I open my mouth to take in my victuals: and one of them choked me: I can't be positive who it was, but I think it was Ruggles. Then they laid hold of my side-pockets, and tore them off. After they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174412050048"/> had done that, they fell backwards, but did not fall quite to the ground. The man that was choking me, took my stock and stock-buckle off, and ran away to the rest; they took a silver watch from me, and two shillings and two-pence halfpeny, which I had in my pocket, and went directly to Hide-park-corner - I have not had my watch, or any thing again.</p>
               <p>Shaddows. Do you know what day of the week it was?</p>
               <p>Church. Yes, I do; it was on a Monday.</p>
               <p>Shaddows. What time o'night was it?</p>
               <p>Church. I have told that already.</p>
               <p>Shaddows. Do you know any thing of me?</p>
               <p>Church. Only what I have said.</p>
               <p>Rowling Brown. The two Prisoners and I met Mr. Church, not where he says, by Constitution-hill, but in the park; he was sitting upon a bench in the park, and I sat down by him, and falling into conversation, he said it was pleasanter walking than sitting, and asked if I would not take a walk. We walked in the middle of the park till we came to Buckingham wall, pretty near the ice-house, and then he began to meddle with me, and pulled out what he had, and put it into my hand, and wanted to feel what I had. I said, I believed there was a Molly. Shaddows and Ruggles came up, and we took him to the guard; he can't deny it, if he tells the truth; but I believe he was ashamed of it. We asked for his money, but he would not give it us; and so thinking he would be ashamed of the thing, we took his watch and money from him - we knew it was an ill thing; but we thought we had better take the watch and money, than expose him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you go there for?</p>
               <p>Brown. I did not go there for that purpose as some people go - we go to see who is there, and if we meet with any of these sort of people, if they have any money we take it from them.</p>
               <p>Church. I have received a threatening letter from them.</p>
               <p>Brown. You said you had received a threatening letter, but you said you believed it was from Jews.</p>
               <p>Q. If he offered such a thing as that to you, are you to rob him?</p>
               <p>Church. Ask him if he knows whether I am a girl or a boy?</p>
               <p>Brown. Yes, I do; for you put what you had into my hand: I think I should know.</p>
               <p>Church. Do you know what I am?</p>
               <p>Brown. I believe I know very well, and if you were to be searched, I could prove that I do.</p>
               <p>Q. When you adverticed your watch, why did not you advertise where you lost it; for you advertised it to be lost in Germain-street.</p>
               <p>Church. I could have had half the parish of St. Giles's to my character.</p>
               <p>Brown. He told me he was a joiner, and lived at Westminster.</p>
               <p>Church. You are such a rogue and a liar, that no body will believe you. He has made himself an evidence, I did not call him for a witness.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury said he had known Mr. Church three years, and that he was a man of a good character.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure Shaddows took you by the legs?</p>
               <p>Church. I don't chuse to swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. You have sworn to Ruggles; can you swear that Shaddows is the man?</p>
               <p>Church. I believe as much one as the other, but I thought one was sufficient, so I would not swear to both. I verily believe he is the man. <rs id="t17441205-53-verdict347" type="verdictDescription">

Mr. Pepys, at the Crown and Sceptre in Fleetstreet, advertised it, with twenty guineas reward, and no questions asked. My wife and I went and received the twenty guineas for the watch: Cheworth was sent to the Savoy, and ordered to go to Flanders; I found neither Ruggles nor Smith knew any thing of writing or reading, so as I ran the risque of carrying the watch, I saved<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174412050049"/> eight guineas for my self, and divided the rest of the money. Smith, Ruggle, and I had three guineas and an half apiece: Cheworth had one guinea; he was to have had half a guinea more, but I said my wife should have that for her trouble.</p>

               <p>Rowling Brown.

               <p>Brown. I don't know but I might be dressed as I am now, or in a light coloured coat, or a blue grey coat.</p>

            . On the 17th of October, Rowling Brown brought a watch to me, and pawned it for a guinea.</p>
               <p>Brown. On the 7th of June, Meakins helped me home with some cloaths which I had made for the company: he was very drunk, and said himself down; I took hold of the ribbon of his watch, and pulled it out; Doe desired I would not keep it; I said he was drunk, and I would keep it, he should never have it any more: I put it into a tub of flour. Meakins enquired for his watch, and Doe and I said we did not know any thing of it, I pawned it for a guinea, (it came in very good time, for my wife lay in) and gave the prisoner ten shillings. I was taken up for it, and was obliged to give my information against the prisoner.</p>

I said I was resolved I would go and see how my new cousin lived, and I went home with her. I asked her what she would drink. She said she would have a pot of hot, and she asked for the money beforehand. I gave the Prisoner a shilling for the hot pot, I drank once, and she bid me drink heartily, but I would drink no more. Then I was talking of going home. When she heard me talk of going home, she let the bed down, and the bed's feet touched the chair I sat upon. Then I got up, and thought I had better<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174412050050"/> have got into better company than this, and insisted upon going home. She asked what it was o'clock. I pulled out my watch, and said it was just turned of five. I put my watch into a deep side-pocket, string and all: then I insisted upon going home, and I said I would go home. She said, No, I should not; I should have another full pot of hot. I said, I would not have any more. Then she said herself down upon the bed, and pulled her clothes up; and I laid myself down upon her. I was no sooner upon her, but her hands began to be at work; they were soon in my pockets, and that soon cooled my courage, for I had not much then. Said I, Madam, what business has your hand in my pocket? Then she drew her hand out, I took hold of her hand to open it, to see what she had got; and while I was seeing whether she had got the watch, she drew the watch out with her left hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel the watch going out?</p>
               <p>Parke. Yes, I did; which made me look that way. I saw a bit of the string in her left hand, but I can't say I saw the watch: she took my money with the right hand - the money was in my left hand pocket, and my watch in my right hand pocket: as soon as I saw her hand draw back, I took hold of her right hand, and endeavoured to force it open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel her hand in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Parke. I can't say I did, but I felt it groping about my breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was drawn out first, the watch, or the money?</p>
               <p>Parke. The money was drawn out first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you wrench her hand open?</p>
               <p>Parke. I got one of her fingers open so far, that I could see the edge of a half-crown, and touched it; but before I could get the money out of her hand, she with her left hand took my watch - I had half a crown and two shillings in my pocket; one of them I gave for the hot pot, and then I had three shillings and six-pence left. I asked her where my watch and money were. She said my watch was dropped down by the side of the bed, and my money was upon the bed. She said, let me get up; and as I was in a strange place I was afraid, and let her get up; and she being cunninger than I, and more roguish than I, and a strong lusty woman, she pushed me down upon the bed; I had my breeches to put up then, and while I was doing that, she made off both with my watch and money - the door was shut, and a chair set against it - it was at the desire of her servant that I prosecuted her; for she said, it was a pity she should not be prosecuted. I did not design to have fought after her, but if I had met with her, I would have taken her up.</p>

            . I was servant to the Prisoner in East Smithfield; she gave me a shilling a week to go out with her with earthen ware. One Thursday night, about six weeks ago, she brought the Prosecutor into her own house; I went for a pot of hot, and sat it down upon the table: the man said he must go, she desired him to stay a little longer, and asked him what it was o'clock. He pulled his watch out, and said it was between five and six. Then I went out of the room, and left them by themselves; he shut the door, and set a chair against it. In a little time I heard the man cry out; he said, she had got his money and watch. She said, she had not. Said he, Huffs, you have got the money in your hand now. I see the glimpse of a half-crown, says she; let me get up, for your money is upon the bed, and your watch is dropped down by the bed-side. I was frightened, and went to the end of the court. I staid there about two or three minutes, and she came running out with her hat and cloak in her hand. I asked her where she was going. She said she was going to the Blue Anchor for a pot of beer for her cousin and she. I asked her whether she had given the man his watch and money. She said she found the money upon the quilt, and the watch was by the side of the bed. She went away, and hid herself somewhere; and between twelve and one she knocked at the door, her husband was along with her; she asked me whether the man made a noise about his watch. I said, Yes, he did. She sat down by the fire-side, pulled the watch out, and gave it to

I heard the girl [Spencer] say on Saturday in this yard to her uncle that she was afraid to go into court about this watch, and he said, don't be afraid for if I receive the reward you shall be cloathed from head to foot, and I heard the prosecutor say this day that he bought her shoes and stockings on purpose to come here.</p>

               <p>Dadley. And please your honour, as to the murder of Sparkes, I can give no account; for I was not present at the time he received his wounds. - I have nothing to say any farther; I don't know the Prisoner, nor I can't say I saw him there - The first beginning of the fray was this, on the 21st of August last, as I was beating the hour of eleven, about eight or ten persons came along, and one of them struck my lanthorn. I asked him why he struck my lanthorn; and then another of them came up to me, gave me the cross buttock, and hove me down backwards: some of them, but I can't tell who, hit me with their canes or sticks. I called out for the watch, being just at the watch-house, and they came to my assistance. Cartwright (one of the watchmen) said, there's one of them gone up <placeName id="t17441205-60-crimeloc390">Checquer-yard</placeName>

               <p>Lancelot Howlett. After the blow was given to Sparkes, I went down almost to Mr. Rawlinson's door, and saw Mr. Morgan flourishing a watchman's staff - I do presume he took it away from some of our men. As Mr. Rawlinson was standing at his door, two or three of our men went towards him, with a design to hit him a blow. I said, don't strike him, for I know who he is. We enquired if he knew any of them, and Mr. Rawlinson said, don't be in a passion, and I'll tell you who they are: one is Morgan, who lives in Whitechapel; and another is Harding at Stepney - I know no more of the matter, only that

               <p>Ebenczer Cartwright. On the 21st of August I was in the watchhouse, and heard an outcry of watch. I went out, and saw Dadley just by with several people striking at him; I can't tell whether it was with sticks or cutlasses; several of the sticks came over my head. I said to Dadley, there is one of them gone up Checquer-yard; we will make sure of him. When we went up the yard, several of them came after us with staves and hangers, and knock'd us both down: my head was cut in several places, and one

               <p>- A kinswoman of the deceased. The deceased was my uncle, I went to visit him in the Infirmary, he was sadly wounded, I asked him how he came into that miserable state, he told me he was wronged and abused by a parcel of men, who came in a riotous manner as he was upon his watch. I asked him if he knew any of those men who wounded<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174412050054"/> him; he said he knew three of the company; I asked him who they were; he said, Mr. Rawlinson was one, Mr. Harding at the Spring-Garden at Stepney, and Mr. Morgan in Whitechapel. I asked him if he could tell which of those men wounded him: he said, Mr. Morgan and Mr. Harding were the two nearest to him when he was wounded, but he could not tell which of them did it - he said this about six days after the thing happened.</p>

He says to me, Marcroft, do you know Harper? I said, I thought I did. He said, Do you believe he lives in the alleys? I said, I believe he does live in the alleys: but if you are not sure he is the man that robbed you, it would be hard to swear his life away.

Forfar had information of Collier's being at Lambeth, and desired we would go and help him to take her; I never saw her before that time - I never heard any thing amiss of Forsar in my life - he did not say any thing to me about the reward - there was some discourse among them at the castle in King-street about the reward the City gave.</p>

               <p>Mr. Perkins being called upon by Mr. Forfar, said, he has known Mr. Forfar seven or eight years, and never heard any thing amiss of him; believes him to be a man of veracity and truth, and that he would not assert any thing upon oath that is false upon any account whatsoever.</p>
               <p>- Jackson. Mr. Forfar impressed me in my own house the 16th day of June at noon - I believe he was drunk; he said he was a lieutenant, and I should go along with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I do allow I have been guilty of folly, and have been very bad, but I have not done any thing of that kind lately; and 'tis hard I should be punished now for what I did formerly. Mr. Forfar subpoena'd Mr. Pope to give me a bad character, I desire he may be called.</p>

So Betty Brotherton and I went with her. She took us into Rag-fair. I asked where her cousins lived. She said, they are gone to h - ll, to cry brooms. She took me up an alley, and said, D - n you, you b - h, pull your stays off. I won't want while there's any thing to make money of. And because they did not come off easily, she broke the lace. She said, if I cried out, she would run her fist down my throat. And she sold my stays for three shillings and six-pence - I had not a farthing of the money. The other girl [Brotherton] had five shillings of what she sold her things for. The Prisoner took me to a two-penny lodging in <placeName id="t17441205-62-crimeloc401">Church-alley</placeName>

I am coming into my 13th year; Cliff and I were going out, and the Prisoner would have us go with her to her cousins, who, she said, kept their coach: and she said, D - n you, it does not signify talking, for you shall go. When she went she could not find her cousins. I asked her where they were. She said, Oh d - n them, they are gone to h - ll to sell brooms. She took me up a passage, and said, I must strip; and before I could get my stays off, she tore them open. - I was not sick then, I was sick afterwards at a house she carried me to. Then she took my gold bobs - she had the money for them: she said, she had sold my stays for a shilling. What, in the name of G - d, said I, did you sell my stays? She said, I must have more than your stays; I must have your ear-rings. She hit me a blow on the stomach, and said, she would send me to h - ll: and she said, If you don't let me have them, I'll get a porter, and send you where you shall never be heard of - I had no wine; the Prisoner had wine, and a rabbit, a French cook frigafeed it - I did not taste it, I had nothing but a bit of bread and butter.
