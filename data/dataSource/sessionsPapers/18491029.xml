                  <hi rend="smallCaps">RICHARD JAMES</hi>. I am a cheesemonger, and live in Victoria-road, Pim<lb/>lico; it is my dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square. I have known the prisoner five or six years; he was in my employ about three years ago—he has since then visited at my house—I knew him to be in difficulties, and have lent him money, and he borrowed money for his mother—I recollect his calling at my house on Thursday, 16th Aug., I was then counting my money in my back parlour—he came into the parlour to me, and asked what I was going to do with that gold—there were 363 sovereigns, and I had 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my cash-box—I told him that would be sufficient to buy 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the Consols, which I was going to do, as I did not want it in the business—he asked me to take a glass of ale with him—I put the money into the cash-box, which I locked up in the cupboard in my parlour—I put the key of the cupboard into my pocket, and went to the public-house—I looked at a newspaper to see what Consols were—he said they were very high, and he would not advise me to buy in, as they would be lower—I parted with him then, and returned to my own house—I took the cash-box out of the parlour cupboard, and went up to my bedroom with it—I had a small bag, which just contained 200 sovereigns—I counted 200 sovereigns, and put them into that bag, in a corner—I then put the other money, 160 sovereigns, on shelves in the corner of the cupboard, in piles of twenty sovereigns each—I saw the prisoner again on 17th Aug., about ten o'clock in the morning—he came, and said he would finish the kitchen (he had given it one coat of paint, and whitewashed the ceiling, about six weeks before, and I had applied to him to finish it—he had promised to do it, but did not); he walked through the shop into the hall—it was a voluntary act of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184910290007"/>
               <p>his to do it—when he had been there a little time, I went down to see bow the work was going on, and he was not there—I went to the water-closet, and he was not there—I went into the shop, and asked my young men what had become of Somers—they said they did not know—in about ten minutes he returned through the shop again—this was about half-past ten o'clock—he came again about six, or half-past six—he passed through the shop, and said, I will go and finish the kitchen"—he did not return through the shop—I had been all the afternoon busy in the shop, I was not away from it—when the money was in my cash-box, I was in the habit of taking it up-stairs at night and locking it up, bringing it down in the morning, and putting it into the cupboard in my back parlour; but when I had taken these sovereigns out, I left the cash-box down stairs, except on Saturday night—on 20th Aug. a traveller called for an account—I went up to my cash-box, and found two loose sovereigns on it—I put them into the cash-box, and brought it down—I had had 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it before—I did not know where these two sovereigns came from—I meant to count the money, but did not—on the following Saturday I took up my cash-box, and on Monday, the 27th, I missed my cash, 163 sovereigns—I saw the prisoner in the afternoon of that day—I told him I had had a <hi rend="italic">slice of luck</hi> that day, that I had lost 163 sovereigns—he asked me to come out, and we went to a public-house together—I there told him what I had lost, and he asked me how it was—I said that only he and my two shopmen knew that I had the money—he said, "Well, I should advise you to say nothing about it; it may go forth to your tradespeople's ears, and they will be afraid to send you in goods; and you cannot swear to the money if you were to find it anywhere, as it is all gold"—I told him I was quite independent of any tradesmen—he then said perhaps my lodger might think I suspected her, and she would leave, and that would soon amount to more than that sum out of my pocket—he then asked to go and look at the lock on the cupboard—we went up-stairs, and he pointed out to me some marks, where he thought the lock had been forced back—I was not aware that he had any money in his possession at that time—I continued to go about with him—I met him on 31st Aug.—we went into a public-house, and called for a pint of ale, and he pulled out of his pocket two sovereigns—he cast his eye on me to see whether I saw it, and when he saw I did, he said, "I have just received 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for some meat, of Miss Webb, at Davis's coffee-shop"—on 6th Sept. the prisoner called on me, about ten or eleven o'clock, and I asked him for a sovereign that he had promised to give me on the previous Monday—he said, "I cannot give you a sovereign, I will give you half a sovereign in half an hour"—he returned in half an hour, and tendered me a half-sovereign—on receiving it, I identified it as part of the money I had lost—when 1 was counting the money I saw that it was very dull, and I bit it with my teeth, and broke my tooth in biting it—I bit in more than one place, and I particu<lb/>larly remarked the marks I made on it—the half-sovereign the prisoner gave me was the identical half-sovereign that I had marked; I have no doubt in my mind on the subject—I did not make any remark to the prisoner, but I gave the half-sovereign to the policeman the next day—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I marked it exactly opposite the letter D, and I observed there was some dirt on the next letter—I have no doubt that this is my half-sovereign—I bit this piece out.</p>

               <p>me two years and a half, and the other six months—they are still in my. employ—they sleep in the same room with me—they knew I had the money but they did not know where I kept it: I never told them—they do not have their meals in that bedroom—they leave the room every morning before me, and do not return till they go to bed at night—I always kept the cup. board locked, and kept the key—when I brought the cash-box down, I put the key of the cupboard in the cash-box, and locked the cash-box in the parlour cupboard, and kept the key of the cupboard in my pocket—the pri<lb/>soner knew where I kept my money—I have a private door to my house<lb/>we have no right to go out by that door in the daytime, it is left to the lodger and the lodger's visitors—the prisoner knew that that was the rule—I never went out of that door myself—the prisoner still owes me money—I have received 305. out of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that I lent him—I had lent him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. two days before the robbery—I lent him this money for his mother—I never knew the prisoner to go out of the private door—he had no right at all to go up-stains since he left my premises.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Miss Evans, who lodges in the prosecutor's house. On the 17th of August I was coming up stairs, about half-past six o'clock, after tea, and I heard a foot on the stairs coming down on tiptoe—I was so near that if a person had walked in the ordinary way I must have heard him—he made a slight noise; he was walking down very slowly, and holding his pockets—his footsteps could not be heard easily; there was a carpet on the stairs—I looked, and saw it was the prisoner—I said, "Is the governor in bed"—his confusion was so great he could not answer me—he coloured up, and went out at the hall door—no person uses that door, only on Sunday.</p>

I was at home all the morning—I left home soon after two o'clock in the afternoon, for an appointment I had to take a walk with the prisoner—we went to Battersea; the prosecutor went with us—I remember it was on 17th Aug., because I had been very poorly some time, and it was the first day I had been out—it was on a Friday—I went to the prosecutor's about three o'clock—the prosecutor was at home, dressing—I went into the shop and waited till he came down—the prisoner was directed by the young man in the shop to go to the prosecutor—the prisoner and the prosecutor came down together—in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour we left there, went to the water-side, and took the boat at Pimlico Pier, to go to Battersea—we got to Battersea at a quarter or half-past four—we went to a skittle-ground; the prisoner and the prosecutor played, I think for 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a game—I did not play—they played three or four games—we did not leave Battersea till past seven—we all left together, and returned home by the boat from Battersea to Pimlico Pier—we all three got out about a quarter or twenty minutes past seven—I parted with the prisoner and the prosecutor at the corner of Gillingham-street—I saw the prosecutor at his door the next morning as I was passing the shop; he told me he took the prisoner home to have tea with him—he told me he had picked up a woman the night before, he did not say the exact spot, but he said he went home with her, and stopped there all night—I do not remember that I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor together after that.</p>

I went out of town—I returned on Thursday, 6th Sept., by the late train—during the time I was away the prisoner managed the business—the receipts during the day were 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., early in the week about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a day, and on Saturday more—when I left the prisoner, it was his duty to receive such sums—I arrived by the late train on 6th Sept—he had not accounted to me for any money—he appointed to look over the books on the next morning, but Mr. James came and took him out—that prevented his reckoning on the Friday afternoon, and on the Saturday he was taken into custody—he is twenty-five years old—he has always been a good son and an honest young man—he never gave me a moment's trouble in my life—my husband is in very bad health.</p>

About eight o'clock last Wednesday evening I was in the parlour—a looking-glass hung opposite, and I thought I saw a dog in the shop—I went in, and found Rye coming round the counter on his hands and knees—I followed him to the door, and he threw four shillings and four six-pences from his hand, and said to Lewis, who stood at the window, "Halloo, master, you are dropping your money"—I picked up two sixpences and a shilling, which were by my side, and said to my husband, "Take this thief!" pointing to Rye—Lewis ran down the street—I followed, and lost sight of him—there were four shillings in the till and four sixpences, ten minutes before, and some copper—I missed the silver.</p>

On Friday evening, 12th Oct, about half-past seven, I was on duty with Brett in King William-street, in plain clothes, and saw the prisoners—Stewart was about twenty yards in advance of Smith—I knew them both before, but had not known them to associate—I followed them into the Poultry to Cheapside, and back through the Poultry to Gracechurch-street, and through the principal streets for two hours—Smith sometimes spoke to Stewart, but was never more than thirty or forty yards from her, sometimes on one side of the way, and some<lb/>times on the other—Stewart accosted at least twenty gentlemen, all of whom shook her off—whenever she did so, Smith placed himself in a doorway, or some dark spot, watching them—he always stopped when she stopped—about half-past nine she accosted Mr. Hall, in King William-street—they crossed the street, went down Clement's-lane a short distance, and turned up a dark court—Smith followed them almost immediately—they remained there about ten minutes; then Smith came down, turned to the right, and went towards Lombard-street—directly afterwards Stewart and Mr. Hall came down, and went into a public-house opposite the court—they remained there a short time, then went into King William-street, and separated—I went after Mr. Hall, and in consequence of what he said to me I went after Stewart, and saw both prisoners standing together talking in King William-street—I told Stewart I was a constable, and she was charged with stealing a penknife and a shilling from the gentleman she had just left—she said, "I have got no penknife;</p>

               <p>the gentleman I have just left it a friend of mine"—I took herto the station, and asked her to produce what property she had—she produced this purse, a shilling, sixpence, and fourpenny worth of coppers—I asked if she bad anything else—she said she had not, in an angry manner—I saw her hand moving in the bosom of her dress—she took it away, and put it up the front of her dress, stooping down—I was taking her to the searcher's room—in going along I heard something drop, and saw this knife on the floor—she said, "That is my knife; it was given to me by the gentleman who has just left me,—Colonel Perrin, a friend of mine; he is gone to Scotland; he will be back in two days, and will punish you for making this charge"—Hall was perfectly sober—Stewart used a slight force to get him into the public-house, but he was not obliged to go in.</p>

I was with Hay don, and watched the prisoners for two hours; I had seen them in company before, and therefore looked for Smith, and saw him behind her—Stewart altered her shawl three dif<lb/>ferent times, which made it a different colour and shape—she stopped under a clock in Cheapside, and Smith came up to her—they were in conversation ten minutes—she went with Mr. Hall up Clement's-lane—Smith followed them, and stood at the corner of the court—he came out, passed me, and went towards Lombard-street—directly afterwards Mr. Hall and Stewart came out—Stewart appeared to pull Hall into a public-house—they came out together, and went as far as Nicholas-lane, where she left him—I went after Smith and took him in charge—he said, "I have never seen the woman before; she came up and asked me to give her a glass of ale, but I had no money to treat myself"—I had seen them in company in the same way on Wednesday.</p>

               <p>believe we had a pint of porter there, and he brought part of it in his hand—I believe it was about one in the morning when we came home—we bad been drinking together for about four hours—we both lodge in the same house—I was intoxicated, but not beastly drunk—my judgment was that the prisoner was considerably soberer than I was—we had drunk from the same glass—when we got home he went up-stairs before me, and I followed him immediately—he sleeps in the front-room on the top floor, and I in the back-room—we pro<lb/>ceeded up-stairs, and as far as my recollection goes, when I got within one or two steps of the top landing, he struck me with some blunt instrument, which sounded hollow on my head, five or six times—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Ben</hi>, you will murder me in cold blood; what is this for?" and I cried out, "Murder!"—I was stunned, and what happened afterwards till I got to the bottom of the stairs I cannot say—I had given him no provocation whatever—we had had no angry words—I did not stumble on the stairs as I went up—as far as my recollection goes we might have been into three public-houses that night—I believe it was four.</p>

On Wednesday morning, Oct. 17th, I heard the prisoner and prosecutor come up to the door—Sault refused coming in—the prisoner said, "Come on, old fellow, let us go in doors"—he said, "I shan't"—a policeman came up, and asked what they were doing there—the prisoner said, "We live here"—the policeman said, "Get in doors both of you"—with that they got in and closed the door—Sault refused going up-stairs—the prisoner said, "Oh, non-sense, old fellow, come along up-stairs, and let us go to bed"—he said, "I won't, I shan't, I shall be <hi rend="italic">done brown</hi> if I do"—with a great deal of per<lb/>suasion he went up-stairs—I heard them walk up the first flight of stairs and along the first landing—I heard them go up the second flight, and then heard a great lumbering—I considered they had fallen down—Sault cried out, "Oh, <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi>, you have done it, you have murdered me"—with that he ran down—I heard him come about half-way down the last flight of stairs, crying out, "Murder!" and he <hi rend="italic">pitched</hi> against the partition of my room—I got out of bed, and putting on my trowsers, I heard the prisoner halloo out, "Mrs. Jones, do pray get up, for Sault is murdered"—I then opened my bed-room door, and saw Mrs. Jones, the landlady, standing on the top of the stairs with a light, and Sault standing with his face and head covered with blood—I asked what he had been doing—he said, "Baker, it is <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi> that has done it; <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi> has been trying to murder me"—the prisoner came down stairs—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Ben</hi>, what have you been doing to the man?"—he said, "Baker, I have been doing nothing; here has been some strange man come into the house, trying to rob us"—I said, "If you did not do it, go and call a policeman in, and he will see who did do it"—he went, and three policemen came—the prisoner produced a pint pot, bent and bloody, and his hands were bloody, and he said that was the thing that did it—one of the policemen said, "Then you struck the man on the head with that pint pot?"—he said, "No, it was some strange man that came in to rob us; he likewise struck at me; I caught it with my two hands and wrenched it out of his hand, and I struck him on the head five or six times as hard as I could strike him, and he has not got</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouse foreman to Messrs. Figgins, type-founders, in West-street—I was in West-street on the Sunday afternoon, and saw Smith and the prisoner struggling together—while so struggling I saw a knife—it came down just against my left foot—it came as if between some person's legs—Jonas Such picked it up—there were a good many persons collected, and a great disturbance going on—I saw the prisoner secured.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the constables of the West London Union. On the afternoon of 7th Oct. I was standing at the door of the Union-house, at the corner of West-street, and my attention was drawn by a yelling and hooting at the corner, and I saw the constable struggling severely with the prisoner, surrounded by a mob of from 120 to 150 persons—he called me to his assistance—I got hold of the prisoner—he said he should take half-a-dozen to take him—another constable came up, and I went to fetch some more constables to convey him to the station, and he was taken—I saw that the constable was hit in the knee—I was kicked by the prisoner myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and a fellow of the College, and am surgeon to the City police—I examined Smith on 8th Oct.—he had received three punctured wounds, which were simple in themselves, but very important in regard to their locality—one was situated behind the angle of the left jaw, immediately over the most superficial part of the external carotid artery—one between the second and third ribs, on the left side, close to the breast bone, and the third immediately over the left knee-joint—I consider it a miracle that the man escaped with his life—I only had to attend him a day or two—it was not necessary for him to lay up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The wounds were so slight? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very slight—the wound in the neck was a punctured wound, it could not be done with a nail—it was about one-eighth of an inch in depth—my impression is, that the thickness of the covering prevented the wound in the chest from taking serious effect—I think the injuries were inflicted with the large blade of the knife—they were all wounds, the skin was divided. (The prisoner received a good character.)</p>

On 7th or 8th Aug. the prisoner applied to me to take a house of mine in Saville-row—they I asked him for what purpose he wanted it—he told me he was an engineer, and wanted it for the purposes of his profession, that he was surveyor to the Indian Rail-road, and had just returned from Egypt, where he had been two years, and I should see his survey, but he had lost it in its transit from Egypt to England; that his father was Godfrey Wentworth, of Woolley-park, near Wakefield, and as his father was so well known, he expressed his great sur<lb/>prise that I did not know him; that his name was Wentworth, and in all probability I knew his relation, Lady Augusta Wentworth, who was my neighbour in Connaught-place; that he was also engineer to the Northern County Coal Company, No. 10, Agar-street, Strand, and that he had just returned from Sunderland, where he had been making surveys of their mines, and if I inquired at any banker's in the City they would know his name well, and I should be perfectly satisfied with him—I went into the City, and made inquiry of a friend who was well acquainted with commercial persons—I heard that what he said about his father was correct, that his father had failed in 1825, but the family was quite respectable—I let him my house—theyhe took possession of it on 15th Aug.—he was to pay, for fixtures and im<lb/>provements, 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which he gave me two promissory notes; this is one of them—they(read)—"London, 10th Sept. 1849, 31, Saville-row. One month after date I promise to pay Mr. Henry Reynolds 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for value received. J. Wentworth."—I did not see him sign this note, but I have seen him sign his name—I am sure this is his writing.</p>

               <p>was Wentworth, and he was the son of Godfrey Wentworth? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>, Yes—the fixtures were to be paid for on the day he took possession, the 15th Aug., but he made an excuse that he was short of money, in consequence of having paid his sister's milliner's bill, his sister having gone to Ireland with the Queen—he said he was a father to his sister—from that time till he gave me these notes I made many applications to him—I do not recollect that I asked him to give me these notes—I pressed him to give me some security—I will not swear that the first proposition respecting these notes did not come from me—from 15th Aug. till 8th Sept. he remained in possession of the house—I found afterwards, from the "Court Guide," that Lady Augusta Wentworth was my neighbour in Con naught-place—I knew nothing about it before—after three weeks I sent there to inquire whether they knew such a person as the prisoner, and the servant's reply was that they did not—the prisoner had resided in the house before I made these inquiries—I had inquired in the City of Mr. Whitton, of Crosby-square, a gentleman connected with com<lb/>mercial affairs—I have never been on intimate terms with the prisoner, I received him as a gentleman—I did not ask him to dinner, but he has taken tea at my house two or three times—I think I did not give him any supper—he remained with me till two in the morning once—I introduced him to Mrs. Reynolds—he spent more than one evening with me—I am a homoe<lb/>pathic practitioner—on those occasions that subject was introduced, and that was what detained him so long—there was no discussion—I explained the science—I do not know that the conversation got so warm that I forgot altogether the subject on which the prisoner called upon me, or that he was obliged to recall it to my recollection—at the first interview I had with him he complained of a sore throat—I gave him two globules, two decilions of paregoric, it cured him—he thanked me, and I felt further encouragement to speak on my subject—I did not make any proposition to him about enter<lb/>ing into my speculation—he was asked to attend a meeting of the Homoepathic Association, of which I was not then a member—I do not recollect whether that was the only proposition I made to him—I do not know that I have entered into any other speculation—I once lent a man 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have never drawn bills on tenants of mine, or received bills from them—I may almost swear that I never received a promissory note from a tenant of mine—I will not swear that I have not—I do not know Mr. Brandon—to the best of my knowledge I never did—no one of that name ever took a house of me—I swear I never solicited a former tenant to give me a bill of exchange—the prisoner entered into possession on the faith of the representation he made to me—he did not give me these two notes at my request—I objected to take them—I had requested him before to give me security because I had my doubts about him—Messrs. Cubitts called on me to make inquiries about him; that first raised my suspicions—I told them I had considered him a respect<lb/>able man, but it was true he had not paid me the 135<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on the following Saturday I urged him to give me the means of identifying his respectability, or security for the 185<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he then offered me two bills—he referred me to Mr. Vill, to Jones, Loyd, and Glyn and Co.—he said, "They will identify my name, and discount the bills"—I went to Mr. Vill, and he said he did not know him—I afterwards got the bills.</p>

Gregory and Faulkner's offices, Bedford-row, nearly ten years—Davy was in the habit of leaving his parcels on a seat in the hall of a morning, sometimes—he did so on 27th Sept.—they were strapped together by a leather strap—soon after he left, George Barton came, and said, "Has my fellow-servant from the Great Western Railway been here?"—I said, "A young man from the Great Western Railway has been here; those are his parcels; he had nothing for us this morning; perhaps you have got something for us?"—he said he had nothing for me—he had a book and a small parcel in his hand, in brown paper, with seals on it, and some red tape—these are them—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said, "The young man has got the wrong bundle; give him this parcel (laying the book on it), and tell him to deliver it as soon as he can, and meet me at the George and Blue Boar, for I am in a hurry to deliver my parcels"—he took Davy's parcels on his shoulder with his strap, as though he was going to deliver them, and went down Brownlow-street—in about ten minutes Davy returned, and I told him what had happened, and what the young man said about meeting him at the George and Blue Boar—next evening I saw Smith, the officer, and described George Barton to him—I did not then know that he was in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker. I have known William Barton nearly four months, and Hanbury eight or nine weeks—about the middle of Aug. I was engaged with them in making up these parcels—about six or seven weeks before 27th Sept., Barton and I met in the morning by appointment—he pointed out to me a man who carried parcels, who had left a van at the corner of Brownlow-street, and took the parcels to Gregory and Faulkner's—he left them there while he went elsewhere—Barton said, "Do you think you can make up anything like that, Tom?"—I said, "I don't know, I will try"—he said, "If you can, there will be at least 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a piece for us"—I went with him to see that, fourteen or fifteen times, to see whether he would continue to leave them there or at any fresh place—he did not explain what it was for until the last time—I afterwards met him by appoint<lb/>ment at Lee-street, Burton-crescent, and went to Hanbury's lodging in Hart. street, Covent-garden, to make up some parcels—he gave me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to buy some cartridge-paper, I bought two damaged sheets, which came to 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they had plenty of brown paper—(the day before that Barton gave me 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to purchase a piece of lawyer's narrow tape, I got it at Howitt's in Holborn, and gave it to Barton, we then separated, and made the appointment for the next day)—I had never been to Hanbury's before—he lodges in the first-floor front room—directly we saw Hanbury, "William Barton pulled out a book, like this produced, and said, "I think this will do, Harry, will it not?"—Hanbury said, "Yes, this is something like it"—he had given it to me to write on, and I wrote on it, "Great Western Railway-office, 1849, packet-book"—we then proceeded to make up parcels—Hanbury cut a piece of wood shorter, which was rather too long, and Barton pulled some list out of his pocket to make it look larger; this is it with the list on it (<hi rend="italic">opening it</hi>)—they were folded over and made into parcels by each of us; these are the <hi rend="italic">dummies</hi> I made—five or six parcels were fastened together by string, three with the red tape, and one was sealed with this seal, which Hanbury produced, and at Barton's suggestion I directed it to Evelyn and Louth, civil engineers, Guild-ford-street—these two dark seals were put on it, in my presence—Barton melted the wax—here are two seals on it which I know nothing about—this is the piece of wax which was used (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was joined together by Hanbury, in my presence—Barton produced a strap like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and gave it to Hanbury, who strapped eight parcels together, and one was kept loose—they were then put away, and Hanbury was to meet me and Barton at the Robin Hood in Holborn on the following morning, when Hanbury was to bring them to me to be changed for the parcels which would be left at Gregory and Faulkner's—after we had made up the parcels, we three went to a public-house in Long Acre, next to King-street, I do not know the sign, and had a pint of porter and half-a-quartern of gin—on the morning the tape was purchased, and on the next morning also, we called at the Hand-in-Hand public-house, at the corner of Hand-court, a very little way from Gregory and Faulkner's—on the first morning the man did not leave the parcels; Barton looked out, and said he had seen three or four policemen about, and he thought it would not do—the parcels were brought in a basket, which Hanbury brought, with a saw and a hammer peeping out at each end, to make it look like a tool-basket—I was taken to the workhouse that day, having no means of providing for my wife and family, and I wanted to carry on this thing as far as I could, and then go to the workhouse—I have seen Barton twice since; once in the workhouse, about a fortnight afterwards, and once in the street—I was afterwards taken in the workhouse by a policeman, on suspicion of stealing some things from my furnished lodgings—about a</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">gave judgment as follows: It appears to me that the statute of Victoria is an answer to the application. I forbear going into the other answer offered, on the authority of the decision in the Exchequer. I should not like to adopt hastily, and without much more consideration, the decision there given, as applicable to the present case; and if it rested upon that alone, I should certainly desire further time to consider; but it appears to me that the statute of Victoria is a complete answer to the application. By that statute, the wife of a natural-born subject becomes naturalized. The expression of the statute is, 'any woman married,' that is, already married, or 'who shall be married to a natural-born subject, or person naturalized, shall be deemed and taken to be herself naturalized, and have all the rights and privileges of a natural-born subject.' The obvious, plain, and natural inference from that, appears to me to be, that she should be considered exactly as if she had been naturalized by Act of Parlia<lb/>ment, or as if she had been a natural-born subject; and the question then is, whether she can now claim a Jury</hi> de medietate linguae <hi rend="italic">for herself, it being clear that her husband, who is a natural-born subject, cannot be tried by a Jury so constituted. The reason of the Court pausing for the moment, was for the purpose of obtaining what appeared to be a precise authority upon that point. There is, in Bacon's Abridgment, an authority to this extent: 'It hath been holden that denizens, so made by letters patent, are denizens within the meaning of this statute.' If that case had been before us, with that authority, it appears to me</hi> a fortiori <hi rend="italic">a person made a denizen, or rather naturalized by Act of Parliament, would be, within the intent of the statute, a natural-born subject. The language of the Statute of Edward</hi> (<hi rend="italic">and all that the modern statute does, is to leave the rights created under that statute unimpaired</hi>) <hi rend="italic">is,"that in all manner of inquests and proofs to be taken or made among aliens and denizens, although</hi>
               </p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184910290043"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">the King be party. "Well, now the question is, whether this be an issue to be taken between our Sovereign Lady the Queen and two persons, one of whom is a denizen, or natural-born subject, and the other an alien? The statute says, that Maria Manning is a natural-born subject, is to be deemed and taken to be naturalized; and I find it laid down in Hawkins in these words: 'It is holden that by denizens in this state, are meant not only those that are born within the King's dominions, but also those that are made denizens by the King's letters patent.' It is said that the statute intended to confer privileges, and to create new rights, but not to take away any privilege which existed before; and that was the whole scope of Mr. Parry's argument, not unentitled to some attention; but it appears to me that the answer to it is this, the status of the party is altered; all the privileges that were intended to be preserved are personal, as the learned Attorney-General pointed out with reference to the 14th section of the statute; there, all the personal privileges belonging to an individual are pre-served, but the privilege of being tried by a Jury</hi> de medietate linguae <hi rend="italic">is not the individual personal privilege of the prisoner; it is the privilege of the status to which the prisoner belongs</hi>,—<hi rend="italic">it is being an alien: ceasing to be an alien, she ceases to have that privilege, and it is not necessary to take that privilege away by express words; it is sufficient to alter her status: the moment she ceases to be an alien, the inquest to be taken, ceases to be an inquest between our Sovereign Lady the Queen and an alien; it is now an inquest between our Sovereign Lady the Queen and two persons, her natural subjects, and therefore the trial must be conducted in the ordinary way by a Jury of the country."</hi>

In consequence of information I received on Friday, 17th Aug. last, I went with Burton to No. 3, Miniver-place, Bermondsey—the house was empty—I examined and searched it—Burton had opened the door with a key which he had in his possession—in the back kitchen my attention was attracted by a damp mark be<lb/>tween the edges of two of the flag<lb/>stones—I had heard that O'Connor was missing at that time—with Burton's assistance I removed the stones—there was mortar first under the stones, and then earth—the two stones appeared to have been recently removed—I proceeded to remove a portion of the earth—when I had got down about a foot, 1 discovered the toe of a man, and when I got about eighteen inches down, I discovered the loins of a man, the back of a man—at that time I had sufficiently removed the earth to ascertain the position in which the body was lying—it was lying on the belly, and the legs were brought back and tied up round the haunches with a strong cord, such as I should think was used as a clothes-line, about the size of a clothes-line—it was quite naked—I proceeded to remove more earth, and at length found the head and other parts forming the entire body—the body was embedded in slack lime—whilst I was doing this, Mr. Lock-wood, a surgeon, came in—I had then removed sufficient earth to show him the loins of the man—whilst the body was lying on the earth, Mr. Lockwood removed from the head a set of false teeth—the head was lower in the ground than the other parts of the body—I did not examine the bead closely, and did not see whether anything had happened to it—I removed the body from the hole, and removed it into the front kitchen—it was then examined in my presence by Mr. Lock wood and Mr. Odling, another surgeon—a person named Flynn came in before the body was removed from the hole; he also had an oppor<lb/>tunity of examining the body—the body remained in the front kitchen on the night of the 17th and the day of the 18th, until an inquest was held—on the same day, the 17th, I went with Mr. Flynn to 21, Greenwood-street, Mile End-road—I there saw a box—it was sealed, but not locked—it had</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, residing in Winter-terrace, Newington. On 17th Aug. I went to the house, 3, Miniver-place, in con<lb/>sequence of something I had heard in the course of that morning—I found the constables Barnes and Burton in the house—I went into the back kitchen—Barnes was there, I am not certain of Burton—there were two slabs removed, and he was taking away the dirt from the hole—a portion of both the feet were uncovered at the time I arrived—I saw the body entirely uncovered—the heels were bent back to the haunches, and tied down in that position, not across the loins, but across the thighs—before the body was removed from the hole I took from the mouth a set of false teeth—the body was removed into the front kitchen—Mr. Olding, another surgeon, was there at the time—he afterwards cut the cords with which the body was tied—that was at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi>—when the body had been removed into the front kitchen, I examined the head; there was a small protuberance over the right eye, it was hard and moveable, I cut down upon it, and found it to be a pistol-bullet or slug, which I produce; there was an aperture in the skull under the bullet, a little to the right of it, it was directly in the middle over the right eye, over the frontal bone; the bullet was perhaps an inch, or not quite so much, under the integuments, it had not come through—at the back part of the head I felt some very extensive fractures—I could not trace the course of the bullet on account of the extensive fractures behind, and also on account of the decomposition of the brain; in fact, it was nearly fluid—I am not aware what number of fractures there were on the head—there were sixteen pieces of bone removed—there were a great many wounds on the head—the wounds, I should suppose, were not produced by a blunt instrument, it must have been something sharp—they were incised wounds—they might have been produced by the end of a crow-bar or chisel—they were contused wounds as well as incised—they would be produced by such an instrument as I saw produced at the Southwark Police-court—that was a round bar of iron, with one end of it made like a chisel—the fractures were quite sufficient to have caused death, and no doubt the wound from the bullet would eventually have caused death—Mr. Olding made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination in my pre<lb/>sence—he examined the intestines and other organs, and they appeared perfectly healthy—the brain was perfectly decomposed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Payne, of 2, Miniver-place. On Monday evening, about six o'clock, after the rumour of the murder, the male prisoner came to our house, said that his wife was out, and would I allow him to go through our house—he went over our garden wall—that would lead to his garden—on the Thursday before that I saw him, about a quarter to seven, sitting on his garden-wall, smoking a pipe—I entered into conversation with him, and in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes he jumped down, saying, he had an appointment that he had forgotten, and he must go and dress—he went away, and I saw no more of him—I left my house about half-past seven, leaving my husband at home, and returned about eleven.</p>

In consequence of his being absent from his employ<lb/>ment, I went to Miniver-place on Sunday, 12th Aug.—I found no one in the house, and went again on the Monday with a police-officer in private clothes—Mrs. Manning opened the door—I asked for Mr. Manning—she said he was not in—I then asked for Mrs. Manning, and she said she was that person—I then said I was a friend of Mr. O'Connor's, and I wanted to speak a word with her—she then asked us to walk in, and brought us into the front parlour, pointed to a seat, and I sat down—I asked her if she had heard anything of Mr. O'Connor? and she said, "No"—I said it waa very strange, and she said, "Yes, it was very odd indeed, as some friends of his had seen him on the bridge on Thursday evening, the 9th, "and she mentioned Mr. Keating's name as one of the friends—she then said that Mr. O'Connor was a very fickle-minded man, as he often came into her place and would stop a minute or two, and suddenly jump up and leave—she then spoke of the probability of his being at Mr. Walsh's, at Vauxhall, where she had accompanied him once or twice from her house—she then said, "Poor Mr. O'Connor! he was the best friend I had in London"—when she said that, I fancied that I saw her countenance change; get pale—I asked her if she was ill, or if she felt the room too warm, and she said "No;" but six weeks before, she was ill, she had not been very well since, she dare say she looked pale—I then asked her if she had been to Mr. O'Connor's lodgings on the 9th—she said "Yes;" and I asked what time she left her own place—she first said, "Six o'clock in the afternoon"—I asked her if she was certain of the time—and she said, "It might be a quarter-past six," and she met one or two friends on her way down—her last remark on my leaving was," You gentlemen are very susceptible"—there was no explanation of that.</p>

On 25th July I took some lime to Miniver-place—I saw who ordered it, it was Mr. Manning, the prisoner—I saw him when I took it home—I carried it in a basket on my shoulder—it was a bushel—he told me to take it down into the kitchen, and I did so—he went with me, and I went into the back-kitchen at his direction, and he showed me where to empty it, and I put it into a basket—he told me to call the next day, end he would see if he could get a couple of halfpence for me—I called next day, and Mrs. Manning gave me three halfpence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter in the employ of Mr. Evans, of King William-street—Manning came to the shop on 25th July, and I sold him a crow-bar—it was like this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was made from the same bar of iron, only it was five inches longer—we made it for him, and it was to be sent home to 3, Miniver-place, New Weston-street—I took it there on 28th July, with the bill—I think when it was ordered he was told it would be 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was in the shop when it was ordered—as I was taking it home I carried it in my hand, and just on the rise of the bridge I met the prisoner Manning—it was about a quarter, or from that to half-past four o'clock in the afternoon—he asked me if I was going to his house with that crow-bar—I told him "Yes"—he then complained of its not being wrapped up—he made some remark about paper being very scarce, and that we might have put it up in paper—that he did not wish everybody to see what he was pur<lb/>chasing, or something to that effect—he turned back, and went down Tooley-street with me, till we came to a stationer's shop—he went in there, and purchased a sheet of brown paper—I wrapped the crow-bar in it, and tied it with a bit of string—he then went with me to the corner of the Maze, and said he was not going home, but directed me to his house, and said I should find a party there who would pay for it—the corner of the Maze is about five minutes' walk from Miniver-place—he then left me—I proceeded to the house, and a stout female, who I think was Mrs. Manning, opened the door—I had the crow-bar in my hand, and it was so covered that no part of it could be seen, and the string still tied—when the door was opened Mrs. Manning</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that conclusion partly founded upon the history of the case, or from what you saw with your own eyes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I formed my opinion on it the very day the body was taken out of the ground—I then mentioned that it must have been there more than a week—I had before heard that the body had been missing—the effect of lime would be to destroy the features very rapidly,</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would the external application of the lime make any difference in the decomposition of the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The lime, I believe, might have been absorbed through the fractures, and so have caused the decomposition of the brain—the fractures were large enough for portions to go through—I examined the intestines with Mr. Olding, they were not so much decomposed as you would have thought, from the external state of the body.</p>

I remember the goods that my husband purchased being brought home to our house—among them was this shovel, which I used in the house afterwards—among the things brought, there were, I think, four women's dresses—on one of them it appeared to me as if there had been blood—it was a morning wrapper, with a cape—it seemed as if it bad been washed out in a hurry, and before it was sufficiently dry it was mildewed—(a <hi rend="italic">dress was here produced by Burton</hi>) this is the dress—the cape is separate from the body and skirt—I noticed the cape more particularly than the dress—it is dry now—the male prisoner slept at our house for two nights—he left on Wednesday morning, from half-past seven to a quarter to eight, I could not swear to the time, but it was about that—he took with him a carpet bag, and a trunk covered with leather—he went away in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he said he was going to sea-bathing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you hear him say anything about his wife's leaving? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>, He said, when I was waiting for her on the Monday night to tea, that he had sent her into the country—that was about a quarter to six o'clock, on the night our servant was sent for her—I said to him," Where is Mrs. Manning? "and he said, "I have sent her off into the country"—the goods were at Manning's</p>

               <p>house at that time—I said to him, just as it was getting dusk, that I required to air the sheets before he slept in them, and I said, "Will you sleep at your house to-night?"—he said, "No; I would not sleep there to-night for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said no more—he slept at our house that night and the following night, and went off on the Wednesday morning—there were some dresses left as a present to me—he did not pay anything for being at our house—I thought what he had given me was sufficient to pay me.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you examine that by daylight? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes. <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you any particular acquaintance with the mark which blood would make upon such a dress? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am quite sure there has been blood upon the dress.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But explain why. You have just said that you think the marks are scorches from being dried in a hurry; do you mean from a fire or a hot iron? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From the fire—when the dress was brought before me they asked me my opinion of it, and I said, "This dress has been washed out in a hurry, and put away before it was sufficiently dry, and it looks to me more like blood upon it than anything else."</p>

G. Manning (some hotel), Taunton"—I then said, "My suspicions are confirmed; put all these up"—I turned round to her, and said, "Now, Mrs. Manning, it is right I should let you know that I am superintendent of the Edinburgh police; you are charged with the murder of Mr. Patrick O'Connor; you are not bound to answer any questions I may put to you unless you think proper; you are at perfect liberty to give such answers as you like, but in the event of your being brought to trial, the answers you give may be used in evidence against you"—I then said, following up that caution," Now tell me, have you got scrip?"—"Oh yes, scrip of my own; oh yes, scrip of my own"—I said, "Well, oblige me by producing it"—she said, "Oh certainly, you will find it in the trunk"—the trunk was unlocked, if it was locked, but I cannot recollect whether it was or not—it was opened, and in the trunk, near the top, I found</p>

I was at South<lb/>ampton—I came up in the train from Southampton with Langley and the male prisoner—while in the train he asked me if I had seen his wife—I said I had not—he said, "Do you think I shall see her to-morrow?"—I said, "I don't know, but I don't think you will be allowed to see her."</p>

Wallis keeps an account with us—all the customers' books pass through my hands—I have looked through the books, and there is no such person—I should say the check came from this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there were two books of this number issued; one to Mr. Roberts, and one to Mr. Elmore—it must have come from one of them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You do not mean it came from this book; but it must have come from some book issued by your house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; our books are made from the same paper, and are printed from consecutive numbers—when a customer comes we give any number—I cannot say how many books of "No. 897" we printed; these are the only two we can trace.</p>

Daniels was in my employ about six months, it was his duty to take out the fat, go round with the meat, and assist in killing—on 6th Oct. I sent him to the City with three sacks of killing fat, to make candles—I had no more fat in my house—at six next morning I heard a knock at my door, I looked and saw it was the prisoner Taylor—after he had knocked, the shop was opened by Daniels and another man that I have, a board was put out, and Taylor went and sat un the board till Daniels went to the Basing-house for the cart, and Taylor followed him down; that was about half an hour after the knock at the door—soon after an officer came to my place, and I went to the station and saw Taylor there and a bag of fat; the greater portion of it was mutton fat, one calves fat, and part of a bullock's fat—it was like the fat which Daniels ought to have taken in the City, and I thought he had taken it, but he had not, the fat he took in was all stale fat, there was no fresh fat at all went in, what other fat I had was shop fat—I had killed seven or eight sheep on the Friday, 5th Oct.—I went afterwards to the tallow-chandler, and they complained to me of it—they wanted fresh fat, and ought to have had it—I gave both the prisoners into custody, one for stealing, the other for receiving the fat—there was about forty pounds of fat in the bag—the quantity I sent in the day before was fifty-four stone, it was not weighed before it left my premises—this is the bag, it does not belong to me—I believe, on the Thursday morning previous to the Saturday, I had seen Taylor come to my shop, and go out with a bag similar to this, loaded—I saw a basket at the station on Saturday, it was mine, and was used to carry corn down to the horse, and to carry meat—I noticed that it was greasy, as if fat had been in it—the bag was found on Taylor.</p>

I was in plain clothes, watching the prosecutor's shop, on 6th Oct., about six o'clock in the morn<lb/>ing—I saw Taylor knock at the door three times—he then went a few yards off—the shop was opened soon afterwards, and I saw Daniels go from the prosecutor's shop with a basket—I could see there was chaff in it; and from the manner of his changing it from arm to arm, I concluded there was some<lb/>thing heavier than chaff in it—I afterwards saw a basket at the prosecutor's—I could not identify it, but my belief was it was the same—I saw Daniels return with the basket empty—he then went from the prosecutor's with a horse towards the Basing-house yard—Taylor followed him and preceded him on the journey to the yard—I spoke to Haffer, and set him to watch while I waited to watch the shop—I soon afterwards saw Taylor come back in the officer's custody, with the bag of fat in his possession—I went to the prose<lb/>cutor's shop, and saw Daniels and his master—I said to Daniels, "I am an officer; I want you for robbing your master"—he said, "So help me God! I am innocent"—I said, "I saw you carry out a basket this morning with chaff in it"—he said it was nothing but chaff—the weight of the fat was 40lbs.—no other butcher has a stable down the Basing-house yard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, of 154, Oxford-street. In May last the prisoner came into my service as shopwoman—I had a good character with her—she only stayed three weeks, and then discharged herself—up to that time I had no reason to suspect her—some time after, in consequence of a communication I had with Mr. Baines, to whom I had given her a character, she was taken into custody—I afterwards saw some duplicates, which the police-man brought me, and went with him to Dobree and Tomlinson's, pawn-brokers, in the Strand, and there found a new French-embroidered cambric handkerchief and a pair of new silk stockings—such articles were in the prisoner's reach while she was in my service—I can positively swear that the handkerchief has not been sold, because it must have been reported to me, and also the mark, and the money—I cannot be positive as to the stockings, but I have no reason to believe they were sold—we remove the mark when articles are sold—the prisoner had no right to have them—I afterwards went to a pawnbroker's in Farringdon-street, and found a piece of Irish linen of twenty-eight yards; it is my property, and has my private mark on it; I am sure it has never been sold—I also found a pair of new silk stockings, which I believe are mine, but I cannot swear to them—the prisoner had no right to any of these articles.</p>

Yours, truly, R. Tuke.")—I got this note about twenty minutes after ten—most of the City banks open at ten—I think the next time I saw the prisoner was on Tuesday following, the 25th—I told him I was surprised at his giving me such a check, that there was no account at the bankers' in the name of Wallis—I do not exactly remember the answer he made, for I followed up that obser<lb/>vation by another; I was very angry; I had met with great annoyance at the bankers', and I said I would give him in charge—I moved away, and he moved away at the same time—I heard he was in custody the following morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SAMUEL PHIPPS</hi>. I am a butcher, of 36, Lower Belgrave-street, Pimlico. Drake and Hobbs have been in my service—on Saturday, 6th Oct., I was in the parlour at the back of my shop, at a little past one o'clock, and looked through a small orifice in the partition which divides the parlour rom the shop; it covered the whole of the doorway and the greater part of the shop—I saw a woman come into the shop—Hobbs advanced towards her, and, instead of serving her, passed her, and went out at the door—just outside the door he gave his head a swing, turned short round into the shop again, and went in; he spoke to the woman, and immediately on that Hammond came up—Hobbs moved his head in the direction in which Hammond came—Hammond came about three yards into the shop, with a bag in his hand—Drake had got a leg of mutton which had been moved from the other side of the shop, in hit hand, and he put it into Hammond's bag—Hammond had not had time to speak to Drake—Drake had the mutton in his hand before Hammond came in—Hammond doubled it up, and walked off directly—I went out of the parlour as quickly as I could—Drake rather intercepted my passing, I do not know whether it was designedly or not—I got past, ran after Hammond, and caught him with the mutton, about thirty yards from the door—he said what he had got he had paid for—I can positively swear no money had passed between them—I gave Hammond into custody, and in the bag a leg and part of a loin of mutton were found—I did not see the loin put in, but I have no doubt it was my property—I cannot say whether it was put in when Hammond came into the shop—they may both have been put in together—I made the hole on the Friday night, with a gimlet, through a partition not more than three-eighths of an inch thick—the hole was hot more than a quarter of an inch in diameter—the leg of mutton was worth about 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was called in on Sunday, 9th Sept., to attend the deceased—I found him suffering from Asiatic or malig<lb/>nant cholera—I saw him first about eleven o'clock in the morning, and after<lb/>wards about three in the afternoon; he was still suffering much in the same way—I saw him again about nine in the evening; his symptoms were then in some degree relieved, but I still thought him in very great danger—I found him in a state of collapse; he was in a very critical state all day on Sunday—I gave him medicines, and directions as to treatment—I thought his state one of the greatest possible danger, but not hopeless—I was prepared to go on with the case—on Sunday night, hearing that he had a brother in the profession, and finding him in such extreme danger, I asked to see him, in order that we might consult together on the case; that was entirely my request—I did afterwards see him that evening, but not professionally—I told him I con<lb/>sidered his brother in very great danger, told him what had been done, and asked if he had any observation to make upon the case, or any suggestion to offer with regard to his brother's welfare—he then said, "As regards the old system, or the alopathic plan, you have done all you can; but as we both consider the case one of extreme danger, I should like the homoeopathic system tried on him"—I said I knew nothing at all about the doctrines of homoeopathy; and, therefore, he must take the case entirely into his own hands, that I could not act in concert or concurrence with him—he then asked if I had any objection to look in as a friend on the following day, as I could not act professionally with him—I said, certainly not; I had merely given up the case in sympathy with his feelings as a brother, and I had no objec<lb/>tion to look in as a friend—I did not ask him whether he was a medical man—I had heard he was in the profession, and thought he was a qualified man—he said he had studied at the University four years—he spoke like a man that had studied medicine—I did not see the deceased after his death.</p>

death—I was vain enough to think that the measures I adopted on the Sunday had their effect on the Monday—I have no reason to suppose that the prisoner's treatment did any harm—a man in a state of collapse could not take solid food—I thought beef-tea and gruel proper for him—I ordered it, and solids when he could take them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of letter-carriers of the London District Post-office. On Monday, 15th Oct. about one o'clock, in consequence of in<lb/>tructions, I put myself in a particular situation in the Post-office, commandaig a view of the water-closets in the basements—I could not be seen by those in the closets—immediately I got there I saw the prisoner—I did not see him enter—he had a letter in his hand, open—I observed that it was sealed with fancy-coloured wax; he took a letter from the cover, which he com<lb/>menced reading—after he had read a small portion of it, he took from the inner fold of the letter a parcel, which was apparently wrapped in black or blue paper or rag, from which I saw him take what I thought was a gold coin, which he put in his mouth; he appeared then to finish reading the letter, and while so doing he dropped a piece of the letter, or the contents, on the floor—he made use of the cover, and threw it in the basin of the closet, and then made use of the other part—he got up from the seat and turned round, and as I supposed he saw the paper floating, as I saw it on the surface of the water—he adjusted his clothes, and tried to force the water fresh into the basin by pressure on the seat—the paper not going away, he put his left hand in and took out portions of it, I could not see which, and folded it up in his hand, and pressed it very tight, turned round to the window, and after watching two or three seconds, threw it out—he then left the closet, and I left the position I was in and returned to the Superintending President—on my way from the back of the building, the prisoner was standing at the back door, which I had to pass, about eighty-five yards from the window I had seen him throw the paper out of, looking towards where the paper had fallen; on passing him 1 said, "Good morning," and he nodded—I went and acquainted Mr. Robert Smith, the Superintending President, with what I had seen—the paper thrown from the window would have fallen into the Post-office-yard, or into Foster-lane—I then directed the plumber to search the closets, and he afterwards produced to me this cover porduced—I had told him to which closet he was to go—the cover corresponds with the one I saw in the prisoner's hand by the wax—I after<lb/>wards went to where I presume the paper fell—the prisoner had an oppor<lb/>tunity of going there while I went to the President.</p>

I received a letter from her to take to the post-office; it was directed, Miss Doughty, near the Hoy, Margate—I drove to Brixton Church, got out and posted the letter at a shop opposite, in the same state I received it, at five minutes before twelve o'clock—I was present, when my daughter-in-law inclosed the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., she put it in a little bit of blotting-paper—I wrapped it up—she also inclosed a little neck-tie for the baby, wrapped in a bit of tissue-paper—I have since seen one—I should say it was the same.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of letter-carriers at the London District-office. In consequence of what had occurred before, on 15th Oct. I placed myself in a situation to command a view of the water-closets, without being seen by the persons in them—it was about half-past two o'clock—some directions had previously been given to the plumber—between ten minutes and a quarter-past three I saw the prisoner enter the closet—I have known him upwards of eight years, the whole time he has been in the office—he seated himself on the seat, and took from his pocket a letter, which he broke opeo, and, in so doing, I observed that there were two postage labels upon it—he then tore the envelope twice cross ways, and threw it down the sink on bis left hand—he then unfolded the letter, took out a small portion of it, which appeared to me to be dirty paper, which he broke, and from which he took a silver coin, I could not say whether it was a shilling or a sixpence—he put it in his trowsers—pocket—he then unfolded the letter further, upon which 1 instantly saw a lady's neckerchief—he destroyed the whole of the letter by tearing it in pieces, apparently made use of it, and threw it in the basin—he then got off the seat, put the handkerchief in his left coat-pocket behind, adjusted his clothes, took the handkerchief from his pocket again, unfolded it, looked at it, then pot it into his pocket, and hurriedly left the closet—I immediately went and informed Mr. Smith, the Superintending President, of that I had seen; and, in consequence of his directions, I went to Blackburn, the plumber, and in a very few minutes I received from him these fragments of a letter, and this envelope—I had sent him to the first of the two water-closets where the prisoner had been—after the prisoner had been taken into the President's room, I accompanied Mr. Sculthorpe down stairs, and saw him take a great coat from a peg pointed out to him by a clerk—that coat was afterwards owned by the prisoner—he changed it in my presence for the one he then had on, and wore it—I saw Mr. Sculthorpe take from the pocket of that coat this handkerchief, which I believe to be the same that I saw the prisoner with in the water-closet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Will you swear positively that is the handkerchief you saw? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I will not; but to the best of my belief it is—the water-closet only contains one seat—there is another closet adjoining it—I had been watching there before a little before one, and then saw the young man who was last tried—I did not return again till half-past two o'clock—I was watching near three quarters of an hour before the prisoner came in—it was at a time when a great many collections arrive from the suburbs—the persons would not quite have finished their duty—I saw no one but the prisoner during the three quarters of an hour—I have not given evidence in other cases of this descrip<lb/>tion, only the one this morning—I had watched the prisoner before that day—I had not watched others particularly, I had seen them—I had no instruc<lb/>tions to watch anybody, until I observed the prisoner on a former occasion—I have watched the closet before 15th Oct., and seen many persons enter, but did not see anything destroyed—I have been a very short time employed in watching, three weeks at various times—I have not given any evidence with reference to those three weeks, only to-day—the place in which I was would enable me to see both seats—there is a separate door to each closet—they are parted by a partition—I was above the partition, and looked down—I looked through an aperture, not through any glass—there was space enough for me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184910290110"/>
               <p>to see with both eyes—I occasionally looked with both, and sometimes with one and sometimes the other—it was rather inconvenient for me to look with both—I watched both the seats from the same aperture—I could see both doors at the same time, but not both seats—I am an inspector of letter-carriers, and that is my duty—my duty is according to the instructions of my superior officers—I have many duties at the Post-office—it has been my duty to watch for the detection of frauds—I have been in the Post-office twenty-four years—that has not been my duty during the whole of that time—I have frequently had to do it—I believe that is pretty generally known in the Post-office—I did not go with Blackburn to the closet—I went with him within a short distance of it, and told him which it was—he returned in five or six minutes—I have no other calling besides Post-office duty, I am quite sure of that—I do not carry on any business besides—I had a son in the Post-office, he was eighteen years old—he is not there now—he was dis<lb/>charged—I live at 2, Melvin-place—I have not got a greengrocer's shop there—I have nothing to do with it, it is my son's—the same son you allude to—I have not the slightest interest in the business—he is now twenty-five or twenty-six years old—he has been discharged from the Post-office five or six years—his Christian name is the same as my own—the name of "Cole" is over the door—I receive a regular salary for my duty at the office; I receive something in addition—I have received 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for attending here to-day, for refreshment, from the Solicitor of the Post-office—I receive other additions to my salary, very trifling—I am frequently sent eight or ten miles into the country, and I have my coach-hire, nothing more—I only receive the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for my expenses here—I did not receive 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the last case—I shall receive 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day for the days I have been away from the office on this business—I have only been one day before the Grand Jury, and one day here—I shall only receive 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., nothing more, except the expense of coach-hire which I have been put to—I was sent last evening to Brixton, to order the persons to attend here—I went to Brixton in an omnibus—from there to Clapham, and from there in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to Hayes-place, Lisson-grove; I charge 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for that—I came from Hayes-place to Pentonville in an omnibus—on one occasion, many years ago, I received 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as a reward for detecting a man stealing a letter—ray salary is now 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I am not paid my additional expenses every week, it may be in the course of a fortnight or a month—I present my bill whenever occasion requires me—I may not have occasion to present a bill for a much longer period—I have not received any other sum besides the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—yes I did, I think two years ago—it was a portion of a reward offered by Government, for the apprehension of a man who escaped from the Post-office—my portion was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never received anything else.</p>

The prisoner has been in the employ<lb/>ment of the Post-office for eight or nine years—he was on duty on 15th Oct. last—the Clapham two o'clock dispatch arrived at half-past two—the prisoner opened the bag—it was his duty to check the number and amount of the paid letters, and to place the stamped letters on one side to be taken to another portion of the office to be sorted—if there were any stamped letters loose in the bag, he should place them with the bundle of stamped letters to be taken away to be sorted—I saw him that day employed in the performance ofthat duty—in consequence of something I heard, I sent for the prisoner about half-past three that afternoon—I took him into Mr. Smith, the President's private room, and said, "There is a letter missing containing a handkerchief and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and you have been seen to destroy it"—he was very much confused—Mr. Smith said, "You hear what Mr. Sculthorpe says; what have you to say?"—he answered," I have not seen such a letter"—he was then searched by Peak—he had on his office or working coat—I asked if he had another coat down-stairs; he said he had—I went down into a room where the men hang their coats up—a coat was pointed out by a man named Everett; and in the left-hand pocket of it I found this handkerchief which has been produced—I then took the coat and handkerchief up-stairs, to the prisoner—I asked whether that was his coat; he said it was—I said, "I have found this handkerchief in the coat pocket"—he said it must have been put there by design or accident, as there were other coats hanging there—he took off the coat he had on, and put on the other, and was taken to the solicitor's office.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is the witness Cole in your department? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He is; I believe he does not receive anything from the Post-office besides his annual salary—occasionally the Postmaster General has been pleased perhaps to make him a present of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his services—I remember a case of that kind about three years ago—I do not remember any other—he may hare received more—I have only been connected with this painful duty five years—I feel it to be painful, and in consequence of the painful nature of it I have declined to have anything more to do with it—the bag that comes from Clapham would be emptied on the table in the presence of a good many persons, who would be waiting to carry the letters away to other departments—they would not be standing round the table, but sitting side by side—they are porters, the stamped letters are taken by a porter—I do not know what porter took the stamped letters on this occasion; I have not inquired—one porter would not do the whole duty. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has the prisoner at any time refused to perform any duty? on the Friday before this transaction was he asked to do Sunday duty at the Post-office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I recollect on the Friday before he was seen to destroy another letter—that is the only thing I recollect about the Friday before—that was by Cole, not by me—I had the letter afterwards in my possession—I am not aware that he had been asked on the Friday previous to do Sunday duty—I did not ask him—I believe all in the establishment were asked—I believe he refused; I cannot say—he was in my department—I know the names of those in my department who refused, because evervbody has</p>

               <p>refused, and therefore I may say that the prisoner has—there were a great many coats hanging in the place where the prisoner's coat was; there were seven pegs all full—there might have been one or two coats hanging on the same peg—I did not notice—the prisoner's coat was the first I took hold of, it was pointed out to me—it is a common passage, through which a great many persons would go from time to time—the prisoner may at times have called my attention to loose money that had fallen from letters, it is frequently the case—I do not recollect his doing so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a market-gardener at Fulham—Assiter was in my service. On 19th Oct. he was sent to Mr. Cubitt's, at Milbank, to fetch some straw—in about an hour after he had left, the two horses, and the empty cart were brought back by a strange man—Assiter had been allowed to take some oats and chaff in his nose-bags, but no more—I have seen the oats and chaff which is here—I have compared it with what was in my manger, and I believe it to be the same—it is more than Assiter would be allowed for his horses.</p>

I saw Assiter in charge of an empty cart and two horses—he turned them into a lane, and stopped at the yard of the World's End public-house, where Maynard is ostler—he had some conversation with Maynard, and returned to the top of the lane and looked about—he then went back to the cart and took a bag out, and handed it to Maynard, and Maynard gave him something in return—I went and took Maynard as he was emptying the contents of the bag into the horse-trough—this is the mixture—Assiter came back to the cart, and was taken.</p>

On 21st Aug., I resided at 30, Essex-street, Kingsland-road, and had done so about a year and a half—I have known the prisoner about twelve months, and I have been in bis company I think three or four times, and have drunk with him—there is a person lodges in the same house, named Adelaide Dowdney; I have drunk with the prisoner in company with her—on Tuesday evening, 21st Aug., I was walking up the Kingsland-road, between seven and eight o'clock, and met the prisoner—he spoke, asked me if I would take any refreshment—I said, "Thank you, Sir, I will"—he asked me whether we should have it out, or whether we should walk home and have it—I said I would rather have it at home—I walked home with Mm to 30, Essex-street, and went into the front parlour—he then asked my landlady, Martha Wilton, what she would take to drink—she said a little brandy, as brandy was a good thing for the cholera—he asked her to bring what quantity of brandy she thought proper, and gave her a piece of paper folded up; I did not see what it was, he said it was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note, she must get it changed, as he had no small change; while she was gone Dowdney came through the room—Wilton went out, with the paper in her hand—she</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 30, Essex-street, Kingsland-road. Bird and Dowdney live with me—they have both been with me about two years, as near as I can guess—they are unfortunate girls—about eight o'clock on 21st Aug. I remember Bird bringing home a man—the prisoner has the appear<lb/>ance of that man—I cannot swear to his face—he sat in the parlour in a way that I could not recognise his face—he sat as if he were in pain—the cholera was then very much about—after I returned with the brandy he wished for some hot water, and I was afraid he was seized with the cholera or cramp, as he sat with his head down—I believe the prisoner is the person; I have no doubt of it—I will not swear to him by his face; he appears very much like the person by the way he stands—when he and Bird came in, they went into the front parlour—he asked me what we would take to drink—I said, "What he thought proper"—he said, "I had better go and fetch a pint, or hal fa pint, or what I thought proper and brandy, "and he handed me a paper folded up in four—he said it was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note, and he would thank me to get it changed—I left him with Bird, and went to Mr. Smith's, the Carpenters' Arms, at the corner of Essex-street—Williams, the bar-man, served me with the brandy, and I gave him the note—the potboy Stiggins was there, and Williams directed him to take the note to get it changed, and he went out with it—he returned, gave what he had got for the note to Williams, and he gave me the change 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. after deducting for the brandy—when I got back I found Bird sitting with the man in the same way as before, as if he were in pain—I counted the change, put it on the table, and the prisoner took it up and put it in his pocket—he wished to take some hot water with the brandy; I poured it out—he would not take that, and asked Bird to light a fire, and get a little water—she went away for that purpose, and I stayed with the prisoner while she was gone; and before she returned, the prisoner said he had a gentleman waiting outside for him—he thought it was ungentlemanly to let any one stand in the street—I said, it was, and he said, "I think I will go and fetch him in"—I said, "Will you allow me to go?"—he said, "No, I will go myself, and by the time the water is hot I will return"—he went outside—I went to the street-door—he walked</p>

               <p>as though he was in pain, he was so doubled up—he went to the corner of Pleasant-street, and there appeared to speak to a man rather shorter than himself, and they either went into the corner door of Mr. Smith's, or into the Kingsland-road—I saw no more of him that night—he had taken none of the brandy; it was on the table near an hour—the note I had taken to Smith's came back to me as a forged note, on the Friday week following, the 31st—on that Friday, Bird went out on an errand for me, and while she was gone, between seven and eight, a young man came with a message to me; in consequence of which, I went to the top of Basing-place, Kingsland-road, and found Mary Bird there—she made a statement to me, and I saw a policeman whose name I do not know, and I told him something in consequence of what Bird said to me—I stayed with Bird till about nine, I think, and then left her there—she waited about there till two in the morning, and I was backwards and forwards with different things—I desired her not to move at all—she was watching—I should say she came home at very near two in the morning—I was in bed, but had been in bed a very little time—on the Saturday week following I was again fetched by a policeman, and went to the station-house in Robert-street, Kingsland-road, and there saw Bird and the prisoner—I cannot say that I knew the prisoner's face again—Bird had given him in charge in Hackney-road—at the station he was given in charge by both of us, in a manner—Bird was positive he was the man—I cannot swear to him, but I think he is the man; he appears very much like the man by his way of standing, and by his build altogether.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, N</hi> 94). On Saturday night, 8th Sept., about half-past eight o'clock, I was on duty in the Hackney-road, near Great Cam<lb/>bridge-street, and saw the prisoner passing along with a female and several other parties—there was a crowd, and I went up to see what the bother was—the prisoner came up to me and said he would give Mary Bird in charge for following and annoying him—she said, "No, I will not go on; I am determined to follow him, for he gave my landlady a forged note"—the pri<lb/>soner said he did not know anything of her—she went to the Robert-street station, followed by the prisoner, who gave her in charge for annoying him—she accused him of uttering a forged note to her landlady—she requested Mrs. Wilton to be sent for; I fetched her—she said she believed the prisoner to be the man; he was very much like him—I went back to Essex-street and fetched Dowdney—she was positive of him—Godfrey asked the prisoner his same, and he gave his proper name and address, 17, Hackney-grove—he was searched, and a bunch of keys, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and two cigars, were found on him—I searched the house, which was an empty one which he had charge of, and found two pocket-books; one, a very large one, was in a writing-desk—I am not positive of the colour of them, being candle-light—(<hi rend="italic">two red pocket-books were here produced</hi>)—I believe one of these to be one, but I thought the other was a much larger one, the one found in the desk.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, N</hi> 13). On 8th Sept. I was on duty at the Robert-street station—Mary Bird was brought there by Porter—the pri<lb/>soner charged her with annoying him in the street, and threatening to follow him home and see where he lived, unless he treated her—she said she wanted to see where he lived, as he had uttered a forged 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note to her landlady a few nights previously—the prisoner said, "Me! me! how do you know me?"—she said, "I do know you, because you have been home with me before"—he said, "You are mistaken"—she said, "I am not"—he said, "When was that?"—she named a night, which I cannot recollect—he said, "Why did you not call a policeman and give me into custody?"—she said, "Because I was afraid you would do as you did the other night, when I saw you in the Kingsland-road, run away from me"—he then became very flurried, and said several times, "How do you know me? what do you know me by? I tell you you are mistaken; what night was it?"—she repeated the same night, I think it was the previous Thursday, he said, "I can prove where</p>

               <p>I was that night"—she said it was in the Kingsland-road, but did not name any particular part—I refused to take the prisoner's charge against Bird, and sent Porter for Mrs. Wilton—he returned with her—I said, "Do you recol<lb/>lect a forged note being uttered to you?"—she said, "I do"—I said, "Look round this station and see whether you see the man here"—she looked at the prisoner, and said, "That is the man I am positive; I should not like to swear to him, but I am positive it is him, I could not see his face distinctly, because he held his head down"—Adelaide Dowdney was sent for; she came, and I said to her, "Do you recollect a forged note being passed at your land-lady's house?"—she said, "Yes"—I said, "Do you see the man here?"—she turned round, and said, "Yes, that is him," pointing out the prisoner, who was standing by himself—at least there were two or three policemen and the female witnesses—upon that, I took the charge against the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was Mrs. Wilton willing or unwilling to give the charge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She was not willing until Dowdney came—I said nothing to induce her to give the charge—I did not tell her I should keep Mary Bird if she did not; nothing of the kind passed with me, because I did not intend to keep her; nor with the officers, in my hearing—I was the only sergeant there—I did not say, "Do you mean to press the charge?" or anything about losing the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if she did not; nothing was said about it in my hearing—I said, "Do you intend to charge this man?"—she said, "I don't like the man to escape, because I believe he is the man; I will do it, as my lodgers swear to him"—I do not recollect that a woman named Harriett Child was at the station-house; there was an elderly female there, whom the prisoner afterwards said was his mother—(<hi rend="italic">Mrs. Child was here called into Court</hi>)—that is the female, I believe—I did not say to Wilton, "You must lose the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and we must detain the girl if you do not"—she did say, "Well, I should not like to lose the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note"—I recollect saying, "Now, what do you intend to do? do you intend to charge him or not?"—that was after she had said she should not like to lose the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and after some hesitation, she signed the sheet—the prisoner gave his name and address—I sent Porter and Cripps there.</p>

               <p>her a piece of paper—I did not observe what it was—it appeared like a note—it was once double—there appeared to be other papers like it in his pocket-book, but I did not take sufficient notice—he told Mrs. Watts he should want change, and he might as well have change at first as afterwards—he said it was all right, for it had his uncle's or rather his employer's name on the back of it—Mrs. Watts asked him his name—he gave it, "Charles Green, 26, Princes-street, Holborn"—Mrs. Watts went out with it for the brandy, and brought the change—while she was gone I had some talk with the prisoner, and he told me he had just come from the East Indies—Mrs. Watts brought back the brandy and the change in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and gave it to the prisoner—the brandy was in a decanter—she put it on the table, and as soon as he got the change he asked her if she saw any person outside—she said, "Yes"—he said, "It is my friend; I will go and call him in to take a little spirits with us"—he went out, and never returned—he had taken no brandy—there was no connection between him and me—I received nothing from him—I should say I was with him about three-quarters of an hour altogether—I think the prisoner is the man, from what I have seen; I have not the slightest doubt about it—from the time that took place till I saw him at Worship-street I did not see him—I do not recollect what day that was—he was in the cell, with several other men—I knew him instantly.</p>

I know the prisoner—I saw him once before 11th Aug.—on Saturday evening, 11th Aug., between nine and ten o'clock, I was walking in Whitechapel-mount, Mile-end, and met the prisoner—I am positive he is the man—he asked where I resided, and whether I had apartments of my own—I said I had, and he said should he see me home—he ultimately accom<lb/>panied me to 18, John's-place—he asked if I would take a glass of anything to drink; I said I had no objection—he pulled out a small pocket-book and a piece of paper folded up, and asked if I could get change for a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note—I said I could not go myself to leave a stranger in the house—he said, "I am no stranger: you have seen me before"—I said, "That matters not, sir, you have never been into my house before"—I said I could send some one to go with the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note to get the change—I called my lodger's servant, named Sophy, from up-stairs—he said, "O, dear no, I cannot trust a strange person with my money"—I said, "Well, sir, I am nothing but a stranger; "upon which he said, "Yes, but if you run away with my money I have got your house"—Sophy asked him to let her look at the note, and she held it up to the light—he said, "I know what you are looking for; you are looking for the water-mark"—she said, "Yes, sir"—he showed it to her and she showed it to me, but I could make nothing of it; I cannot read or write—I at last went for change for the note—I believe Sophy has left my friend; I have left this house between six and seven weeks—I went and got change at Mr. Purton's, of the Bedford Arms, deducting for half-a-pint of brandy and half-a-pint of gin—the prisoner had told me his name was on the back of the note—I do not know whether he said William or Charles Green—he said he lived in Bread-street, Cheapside, at the Crown public-house—I gave him the change, and put the gin and brandy on the table—he asked me to give him a glass of brandy with a drop of water in it—he put it to his mouth and said, "Dear me, it is not sherry, "and he turned on one side as if he could not drink it—he had not told me to get sherry—he then said, "I have got a friend outside; I will go and ask him to have a glass with me"—he went outside the door, and his friend stood by the door—I said, "Will you walk in and have a glass?"—he said, "No, thank you, I don't drink brandy; I will have a glass of sherry"—the prisoner asked if I could recommend his friend to a female—I said, "No"—he then went away, and said he would be back in half an hour—he never returned—I received no money from him—I never saw him again till I came to Worship-street—I asked the policeman which was the man that had got the forged notes—he told me to go inside a room where there was a lot of prisoners and policemen—I looked right round the room, and the prisoner held his head down and</p>

                  </hi>. I was an apprentice on board the bark <hi rend="italic">Atlantic</hi>, of which the prisoner was chief mate. I joined her on 11th Sept., 1848; she was bound for the North of England first, and then we went to Naples and Malta; from there to Messina, Constantinople, and Odessa, we touched at Gibraltar on our way home, and arrived in England at the beginning of this month—I believe we got into Naples harbour, at the latter part of last Nov.; while there the prisoner ordered me to fill a cistern; while doing so, he came to me and asked why I did not fill it before—I said, "I had something else to do, and he took me by the left ear and swung me down on to the deck, and my ear has been swollen ever since; and I have lost the hearing of that side altogether—whilst at Malta, in March, I was keeping watch, and went to call one of my fellow-apprentices—when I came up, the prisoner said I had been sleeping below—I said, "I had not; I had mistaken the time; I had been to call the other apprentice," and he said, "I have caught you at last, you d—d young fellow," and took a handspike from the windlass, and gave me a blow on the arm with it; my arm fell down powerless, and it left like pins and needles in my arm, and I fell down on the cable chain on my face—my face nose and eyes bled profusely, and my eyes were black for two or three days afterwards—about the middle of Aug. we were at Gibraltar, I was drawing up a bucket of water, the prisoner came and took the bucket from me as my fellow-apprentice was in the act of taking it from me, and he struck me in the back of the neck with it, which knocked me down—I <hi rend="italic">fell</hi> on the deck, and caught my head and face on the edge of a large water-cask, which broke the bridge of my nose—the bucket was made of canvass—there was no medical man on board, and never had been—when we got to London, I had liberty from the captain on 7th Oct. to go on shore—I told the mate I was going, and he said I should not—I remained on board till the 9th, when constable Frazer came and took me to the Thames police-office—I afterwards went to Mr. Ross, and showed him my injuries.</p>

I examined Martin, and found the bone of the left arm had been broken, and the bones of the nose, and there was a slight enlargement of the left ear—such treatment as he has spoken of, might be sufficient to cause deafness—he appears to be deaf with the left ear.</p>

Martin never told me anything about the injury to his arm till a fortnight before we got to Falmouth—he then said he would have the mate up about it—the mate denied breaking his arm, and said he knew nothing about it—I saw the injury to his ear some time after he was at Naples; the lower part of it looked swelled and rather sore—I asked the mate if he had acted so brutally as to injure him—he said he was <hi rend="italic">shoving</hi> him along to his work, and he fell on the chain and hurt his ear—we left Malta about 15th March, and returned on 19th—after we left Gibraltar the mate admitted the injuries to the boy's ear and nose—he said, "The boy aggravated me and dared me to it; that I could not govern my passion"—I gave the boy leave to go ashore.</p>

               <p>till about a fortnight before we arrived at Falmouth—I know he had two fells, one of about two feet perpendicular, and the other ten or twelve feet, but do not think his arm could have been broken on either of those occasions, as he never complained to me of it—I did hear him say, about 8th Jan., that the mate struck him with a canvass bucket of water—the mate complained of the trouble he had with the boy, and I said, "Let him do what he can; it is of no use to abuse or beat him, for it will do no good."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a barrister, of the Middle Temple, and occupy chambers at 4, Brick-court. On 25th Sept. I attended the Middlesex Session professionally, and defended two men named Fisher and Garrod—there was a third, of the name of George, who I did not defend—I was not instructed to do so—I had received some communication from my clerk, who is here, but I did not defend him.</p>

Q.</hi> Do you know that the prisoner is clerk to Mr. Townshend, in Clifford's-inn? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe he is—I believe he lives in the Inn—up to this time I have always considered him a decent respectable man—I saw him in Court about an hour after the men had been tried—they were all convicted—it was a very bad case, especially as it regarded George—it is a matter of opinion whether George was in good luck, to get off with twelve months, being known before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bootmaker, and live at 123, Aldersgate-street, City. On Tuesday, 28th Aug., in consequence of a message which I received, I went to the Clarence Hotel, and in the coffee-room there I saw the prisoner, Smith, and a Mr. Collins, in his company—Captain Smith, as he called himself, stated to me that the landlord had gone out of town, or he would have given him the money for this check (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I unfortu<lb/>nately knew Smith for a few weeks before, as a customer—I looked at the check, and finding it was made payable to Mr. F. Collins, who was in Smith's company, and his companion, and knowing Mr. Collins to be a man of pro<lb/>perty, and as it was drawn payable to him, I supposed it was a good instru ment, and immediately took out my purse and gave Smith 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it; that is the amount the check is drawn for—I did not at that time perceive that the check was post-dated, the circumstance of its being crossed was the only thing that induced me to give them the money without its going through a banker—Smith alluded to its being crossed, and said, as the check was crossed, would I give him the money for it, as the landlord was out of town—I did not discover that it was post-dated till next day, when it was going to be sent to the bankers; Smith never alluded to it—I afterwards charged him with giving me a post-dated check—he did not explain the circumstance at all—the only explanation I had was, that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184910290160"/>
               <p>Fraser, the man that drew the check, had the cholera; and then that he had died—the first time I saw him after he gave me the check was on the 3d the day before it was due—he then wished me not to pay it in, as Fraser was ill of the cholera, and could not go to Gravesend—I said I certainly should pay it in, and let it go through the bankers—my brother paid it on the 3d, with other moneys, and it was returned to me on the 5th—I afterwards went to the Commercial Bank; I found they had moved from 3, Moorgate-street, more than twelve months before, and they told me they knew nothing of such parties—I afterwards saw Smith, and spoke to him about the check being returned—he said that Fraser was dead of the cholera—I told him he had given me a forged check—he said it would be paid, I could go to Mr. Lawes, his solicitor, in Moorgate-street, who gave him the check—we had a long conversation—I saw him several times—I afterwards went to Lawes, in Moorgate-street; I told him that I had a forged check, and that Captain Smith had sent me <hi rend="italic">to</hi> him; that he told me he had received it from him—I pro<lb/>duced it to him—Lawes told me that Fraser had a rich brother at Gravesend, and there had been some misunderstanding, which was the reason the money had not been paid; he did not pay it—I told him Smith said Fraser was dead—he said, "Oh!" and put it off in an <hi rend="italic">au fait</hi>, easy sort of way—he said, never mind that, "Come in and see Mr. Hall," that was a gentleman in the front office—I did so; and Mr. Hall stated to me, in Lawes presence, that Fraser's brother was a man of property at Gravesend, and it would ultimately be settled, and he thought I should get the money on the following Saturday; Hall said that Lawes should come to pay the check on the Saturday, and Lawes said it certainly should be paid on Saturday—neither Lawes or any one else came to pay it on the Saturday; it has not yet been paid.</p>

The offices are now in Lothbury—they were removed there in 1840 or 1841, I believe, but I have only been there three or four years—I know Lawes as a former customer—the last transaction he had with us was on 13th April, 1848, as far as my memory serves—this check-book (<hi rend="italic">produced; found in the desk</hi>) is one of ours—no doubt he had a check-book when he had an account with us—I have seen the writing on the counterfoils in this check-book—I believe it to be Lawes' to the best of my belief—this memo<lb/>randum book (<hi rend="italic">produced; also from the desk</hi>) is the one that was issued to Lawes when he was a customer, and this pass-book (<hi rend="italic">also from the desk</hi>) was issued to him—the entries in this memorandum-book appear to be in Lawes' writing—this check was presented for payment on 4th Sept., and was refused—we have no customer named Charles Fraser.</p>

On 4th Sept., this check was paid to us by the London and Westminster Bank—it was first paid by us to the London and Westminster Bank, but we found out our error and had it back—on searching I found that Charles Fraser, the drawer, had no account at our bank—we do business for the Gravesend Bank—I believe this check has come out of this check-book (<hi rend="italic">produced from the desk</hi>)—I cannot point out from what place, but the numbers agree—the counterfoils all bear the same number, 5676—the number of this check is 567—the last figure 6 has been removed—I know Lawes; he once kept an account at our bank—this check-book was issued by us to him—I believe the writing on the counterfoils to be his—the body of this check I also believe to be his—I mean the words that are written "Sept 11, '49. J. F. Collins, Esq., 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account of the Gravesend Bank," and the figures" 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." all the writing part, except Fraser's signature—this was our pass-book with Lawes—I believe the entries in this memorandum-book to be Lawes's writing—the last entry is "1849, Aug. 28.

                  </hi>. I have been, since Jan. 1845, a clerk in the Commercial Bank of London. On 4th Sept., this check was paid to us by the London and Westminster Bank—it was first paid by us to the London and Westminster Bank, but we found out our error and had it back—on searching I found that Charles Fraser, the drawer, had no account at our bank—we do business for the Gravesend Bank—I believe this check has come out of this check-book (<hi rend="italic">produced from the desk</hi>)—I cannot point out from what place, but the numbers agree—the counterfoils all bear the same number, 5676—the number of this check is 567—the last figure 6 has been removed—I know Lawes; he once kept an account at our bank—this check-book was issued by us to him—I believe the writing on the counterfoils to be his—the body of this check I also believe to be his—I mean the words that are written "Sept 11, '49. J. F. Collins, Esq., 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account of the Gravesend Bank," and the figures "7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." all the writing part, except Fraser's signature—this was our pass-book with Lawes—I believe the entries in this memorandum-book to be Lawes's writing—the last entry is" 1849, Aug. 28.

On 14th Oct., 1848, the prisoner was in his service, and was sent to town with sixty dozen of carrots, in a wagon, to Mr. Gregory, of Spitalfields-market—I made out a note of the quantity, and the carter's name; he was the prisoner—I left it with Cordery, the watchman, to give to the prisoner—the prisoner had no authority to deliver any of the carrots on the road, but to take them to the salesman—I did not see him start or come back—I did not see him again till he was in custody, nearly twelve months after—he was in regular employ—he never came back to his master—the carrots were Mr. Adams's property until delivered to Mr. Gregory, for sale.</p>

I know the funnel through which the tickets pass; it is supplied with tickets from a drawer, where the tickets are placed in rows consecutively—when tickets are required for the runnel they are taken out of the drawer and put into the funnel—they should be taken consecutively as they run—at the close of the proceedings, the number given, will indicate the number of tickets issued from the funnel.

               <p>used, and returned—in the ordinary course of business none of the tickets in the drawer should bear the stamp of a date—I selected thirty-one of them—these are them—on the greater part of them there is the stamp of the date—it is more visible on some than on others—on the Saturday night previous, I have no doubt that the prisoner had the issuing of the tickets for the Brighton railway by the seven o'clock train—on finding these thirty-one tickets on the Monday, I sent for the prisoner on the Tuesday morning, and for the auditor of the Company—I took the drawer and took out the tickets—I pointed out the tickets I have here now, and laid them on the table—I said to the prisoner, "These tickets have evidently been issued incorrectly out of the drawer, and you must account to me how they were issued"—he hesitated for some time, and then said it was easy to account for it, or words to that effect:" I issued them myself"—I then said he could not carry out the system of thus robbing the Company, unless he had persons to assist him at Brighton, and I named a person, Mr. Springett, a guard, and he said that Springett assisted him in carrying it out—I then said there should be a ticket-collector who was partly concerned in it—I did not mention any name, but he mentioned the name of a ticket-collector, the name of Cheeseman—I then asked him if it was the first time he had done it, or if it was the first time he had been guilty of it, and how the money was disposed of—he said then," jointly, "or that the parties at Brighton would not have joined in it without having part of the money—I then took the prisoner to Brighton, to have it investigated by a Magistrate—I found these thirty-one tickets did not run consecutively—I cannot say what was the lowest number in the drawer which had not been issued, but the lowest number on the books on Saturday was one between 400 and 500, and the funnel only contained about 250, so that the lowest number would be between 700 and 800.</p>

               <p>prisoner's duty to put them into the funnel; whether he had done so I cannot answer—when the funnel becomes vacant it is filled from the drawer—it was the prisoner's duty to fill it, and then the tickets are issued by the clerk from the funnel—it was the prisoner's duty to issue tickets from the desk when the other clerks were off duty—it was his duty to supply the funnel from the drawer—some other clerks may have done it in his absence—the drawer from which these tickets are taken, is accessible to all the clerks on duty in the office, the prisoner having the charge of it—he was head clerk—he had the key of the drawer, and was supposed to lock it when he went away—the other clerks could get the tickets in his absence, by sending to him for the key—it seldom occurred that the funnel would be destitute during one or two trains—it was the duty of the head clerk to supply it—he was the sole person who was answerable for it—he issued the tickets to the passengers for the seven o'clock train that night—he was not out of his regular line of duty—he occasionally served a train—he had the charge then both of the funnel and the train—he was well competent to do the duty—he had not more than his regular duty to perform at that time—it may be that during that train he had not to supply the funnels, or may be none were deficient—the Saturday seven o'clock train is generally a very busy train—there were other clerks there—I cannot say whether they were supplying the trains; I did not take notice—the prisoner served the first and second-class—there may be another clerk who served part of them—I have the book here, to show how many tickets are acknowledged to be issued that night; "on 1st Sept., for the second-class, thirty-eight"—I have not the first-class book here—this book would show all the second-class tickets that were issued that night, if it were correctly kept, and none but the proper number from the funnel had been issued—the prisoner kept this book that night—here is the commencing number, 45, and the closing number is 83, which makes thirty-eight—he charges himself with thirty-eight tickets that night—I have a book which tells the amount of money I received from him that night, but it is not here—the money embezzled for these tickets would not be accounted for—the money was correct to a farthing according to the tickets he accounted for—he accounted to me about a quarter before nine o'clock that night—I cannot tell how much money he paid me.</p>

I am an inspector of police—the prisoner was brought to the station, which is a quarter of a mile from the spot where this occurred—I observed this purse sticking from the breast of his coat—I think it could not have got there during the struggle, because the part the money was in, was under the coat—his coat was similar to what he has on now, but it was not buttoned up quite so high—the prisoner said he knew nothing at all how it came there.</p>

On Thursday evening, 18th Oct., about half-past nine o'clock, I went to her house to borrow a jug—I knocked at the door, she opened it—I told her I wanted her to lend me a jug—she began to make use of very improper language, and said she would beat my bbrains out—she accused me of stealing a key—I said I had not seen it—she then called me a bwh, and struck me twice on the arm with a poker, and told me to go out—I was in the pas<lb/>sage—she went into her room to get the poker—as I was going out of the house she came after me and stabbed me three times with a knife on the arm and nose, and I fell senseless into a young woman's arms—I had not offered to strike her or given her any provocation—I was taken to a surgeon.</p>

I came home that night, and hearing my daughter at the prisoner's door asking for the loan of a jug, I came out with a jug in my hand—I heard the prisoner say, "Stand back," and call her a b—wh—I then saw her strike my daughter, with what I thought was a stick, three times across the arm—I saw my daughter come out of the passage and the prisoner after her with a knife in her hand, which she <hi rend="italic">jobbed</hi> three or four times against my daughter—I ran to her assistance—she was covered with blood—the prisoner called me a b—cow, and said she would stick me with the bknife through my b—heart—she then went in-doors, and I took my daughter to a surgeon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. The prisoner was brought to me on Thursday evening, 18th Oct.—I found a fracture of the left arm, about two and a half inches above the wrist—I also found an incised wound about two inches above the elbow joint, about an inch and a half in extent, and an incised wound on the face and left side of the nose—on examining her next morning she called my attention to an incised wound in the chest of about an inch—the incised wounds were superficial, dividing veins but not arteries—there had been considerable effusion of blood—she is under my care now—the fracture might have been produced by a blow with a poker—it must have required considerable force. <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN THOROUGHGOOD</hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, P</hi> 180). I took the prisoner, and told her what she was charged with—she said she had no business in her room—while she paid her rent no one should come into her room—she had in her hand part of the handle of a knife—I searched, and found this blade of a dinner-knife in her apartment (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I found this poker in the fire-place—the prisoner had been drinking, but was quite conscious of what she was doing—I found part of the handle of a knife near the front door, near where the prosecutrix says she was stabbed—I did not see any wood in the room.</p>
