               <p>Q. Was this a full room? - A. No, it was broken into the day before; there had been a great deal of rain in the night, which gives a different gloss to the coals, and these were taken after the rain left off; they had the appearance of having been raked out with the hands.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My wife had laid in that morning, and I had no coals to warm my three children; I went on board a sailing barge, and the man gave me some coals.</p>

             sworn. - I am the brother of the last witness; I am his journeyman; I came into the shop a little before two o'clock, on Monday the 13th of December; the prisoner said, he was going to get half a pint of beer; soon after that one of the smiths came in, and I went after the prisoner to see whether he went for beer or not; I followed him through several alleys into Petticoat-lane, and saw him go into the prisoner, Robinson's shop; then I left him, and went back, and told my master he had a thief about him; the prisoner came in about a quarter of an hour afterwards, and my master asked him what he did in the shop in Petticoat-lane; he told him he had not been in any shop; I then went with the prisoner to the shop, to fetch the iron away: the prisoner, Robinson, was in the shop; I told her I had come for the iron this man had been selling; I said it was my master's property, and she said, there it is; it laid upon the floor; the prisoner brought it back in his apron.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You talk about Mrs. Robinson's shop, do you not know it is Mr. Croker's shop? - A. I don't know that it is; I saw her there.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name over the door? - A. I never looked; she paid the prisoner for the iron.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see that? - A. No; but I desired him to give her the money back, and he gave her seventeen pence halfpenny; I think she said it weighed seventeen pounds and a half, it was new hand railing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it all new? - A. No, not all; when I went to her, she said, he was the man that she bought the iron of, and she did not know it was stolen; he scrupled it's weighing seventeen pounds and a half, and she said, if you don't like my scales and weights, I will get some others.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner carried the iron home himself? - A. Yes, and I came home with him, and when I weighed it, it weighed twenty-two pounds within a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. Is one penny a pound a fair full price for it? - A. I cannot tell the value.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the Prosecutor.) Was the iron that was brought back your iron? - A. Yes, I know two or three of the pieces to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. It is worth more than one penny a pound? - A. Yes, it is worth one penny halfpenny, at least.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you know Mr. Croker is the master of the house? - A.

             sworn. - I live in Whitecross-street, near Cripplegate, in the county of Middlesex: On the 30th of December, I saw the two prisoners with a coal-waggon; they stopped opposite a hair-dresser's door, in Whitecross-street; the prisoner, Worbys, came up the court, and asked the people in my own house where the cooper lived; I told him he lived there; I was in the court at that time; he knocked at the cooper's room, and the door was opened; I saw Worbys bring a sack of coals out of the waggon, and take them up stairs; I went over to a public-house, and then I saw Worbys come back; the old man, Daniels, untied the cord, and then Worbys took another sack out, and carried it to the same place; I went over the way, and looked at the waggon; I found it was a coal-merchant's waggon; I could not read, and got my wife to read it, but I do not recollect the name; I followed the waggon to Mr. Leveck's; it stopped there ten minutes, or better; I informed Mr. Leveck of what I had seen; the two prisoners were there; they threw two empty sacks on the ground; then Mr. Leveck came out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. They emptied all the sacks at Mr. Leveck's, did they not? - A. All but the two that I saw emptied at my own house.</p>

               <p>ROBERT WARD sworn. - I am a coal-merchant; the prisoner, Worbys, was my servant; the prisoner, Daniels, I had discharged about a week before; Mr. Leveck informed me of this transaction, and I went to the yard while the prisoners were there, and I took them into custody.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You are answerable for the coals till they are delivered? - A.Certainly, I have to make up two sacks; they were in my own waggon; I gave no orders for any delivery in Whitecross-street.</p>
               <p>Worby's defence. Mr. Ward's clerk was on the craft when I went out of the yard, and how is it possible he can swear there were thirty-six sacks loaded.</p>
               <p>Daniel's defence. I was hired by the waggoner to help him that day, and there were thirty-six sacks delivered at Mr. Leveck's that evening.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you yourself miss any thing? - A. I did not miss this wood till I saw it at the office.</p>
               <p>GEORGE ASTOR, junior, sworn. - On Sunday evening, the 5th of December, I saw the prisoner in New-court, Crown-street, with some wood under his arm, going towards his lodging, I think it was between six and nine in the evening, the moon shone very bright; I called to him, and asked him what he had got there; he at first said, he was going for a light; I insisted upon knowing what he had got; he said he had got some wood; I followed him up stairs, and before I could overtake him, he had placed the wood in the room above his lodging; I took the wood, there were eight pieces, and followed him down stairs. I asked him how he could rob his master, and he said, he had been persuaded to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him it would be better for him to give an account of it? - A.No. He seemed so very much frightened, that I could get hardly any thing out of him; I took him to the watch-house, and delivered the wood to the constable; I knew it to be the wood of Astor and Company from the quality and size of it. I am in the habit of frequenting the factory; I have the management of the business of that factory; it is called aire wood, it is used for veneering.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss that wood? - A. On the Monday, I looked over the bundle, and found eight leaves missing.</p>

             sworn. - On Sunday night, the 5th of December, between seven and eight o'clock, the prisoner knocked at my door, No. 5, New-court, Crown-street; he asked for a light, and seemed to be in a hurry; he put some boards down in my room, and left them; I heard somebody on the stairs say, you villan, what have you done with the boards; and I said, here are the boards, and gave them to the gentleman.</p>

               <p>Thomas Ashton, an officer, produced the boards.</p>
               <p>Q.How far is New-court from the factory? - A. An hundred yards, or rather better.</p>
               <p>Mr. Banks. On the Monday morning, I examined, and missed eight boards out of the bundle; I have since compared them with the bundle, and they correspond in the quality and numbers. All the veneers are numbered.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. How long had the prisoner been your servant? - A. He was servant before I was in the partnership. I have been in the partnership nearly two years.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Astor, jun.) You have sworn these are eight boards, would they be called in the trade eight boards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

We then took the prisoner back to the shop, and sent for a constable, and he was taken to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Who do you mean by they? - A. The two prisoners and James Wright; they came between five and six o'clock; I got up about six o'clock, and Thompson and Wright came in; Gibbert stood about ten yards from the shop-door; I had opened one parcel, and conceiving they had been come by dishonestly, I removed the goods up stairs; the two men came into the little room; I asked them if they had measured the goods, and they said, no; they would sell them me by the lump; I asked them what they asked for them; they asked me 4l. I said that was cheap enough, I did not desire them cheaper; they then said, give us a pot of beer a piece; I said, I will; I had desired my man, as soon as they came for the money, to go for a constable, which he did; one of them went out, and spoke to Gibbert; he came in again, and said Gibbert was not satisfied with the price; I must give them four guineas, or they would have them measured; I agreed to give it them; I told them to go over to the Prince's Arms, I would come over to them; they said they were going to the Goat at Berkhampstead, to seed their horses, and would soon return; the constable came in, and he and I pursued them; we met them coming from the Goat, and apprehended them all; I asked them if they came honestly by the things, and they said, yes; I told them, I had apprehensions they did not come honestly by them, and I gave charge of them; they were taken before a Magistrate, and committed, (produces the calico); there are five pieces; I have had them ever since.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the value of those five pieces? - A. They are worth about 3l. 10s. a piece to the retail dealer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q.Jackson and Co. print for your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a great quantity of such goods at your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you don't know these from any other goods of the same description? - A. They were for shipping, and the crown mark had been omitted by mistake, and they were sent down again to have it put on, otherwise they would have been liable to be seized at the Custom-house.</p>

               <p>Q. How far had you got from Paddington? - A.

               <p>Q. Did you not expect part of the money? - A. Yes; they told me I should have part, but I did not go for that, but merely because I was walking with the horses.</p>

The prisoner asked me for a pen and ink, and a bit of paper, and said, if I had not got any he would send his man out for some; he said he wanted to make out a bill against one Mr. Potts, a cow-keeper; he then had sixpenny worth of rum and water, and asked me to give him change for a ten pound, or a fifteen pound note; I told him I would try what I could do, and went up stairs, and fetched four one pound notes, a half-guinea, a seven-shilling-piece, and a half-crown, which I put upon the table; he said that was of no use, for he wanted to give change for a ten, or a fifteen pound note, remarking, at the same time, to me, that these gentlefolks did not care how they served a poor fellow when they got in his debt; he then went away, leaving the change, saying, I will be back in five minutes; the man that was with him asked me where I came from; I told him I came from Deptford, and he seemed to be acquainted with every body that I knew at Deptford. The prisoner then came back, and said, what sum can you make up; I said, there is five pounds, as I told you before; he said, there is five take that; he took it up, and said he would be back in five or ten minutes, and told the other man to wait; some people came in to be served, and when the man saw me busy, he came and asked me if I could get him a bit of salmon, I called to my niece to get some; the man said, I will not trouble your niece, I will go myself if you will lend me a bason; I gave him a bason, and saw no more of either of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You laid the money down upon the table, and has no objection to his taking it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You expected he would return, and pay you? - A. Yes, certainly.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. He had not shewed you any note? - A. No; and I think I must have been berest of my senses to let him have it.</p>

               <p>Q. And instead of giving you a five pound note, he took up the money and walked off with it? - A. Yes.</p>

In the course of the day the other man came in several times, and said, Mr. Smith, you are wanted; after he had been there some time, the prisoner said, go to my shop, and get some chops; they had some chops dressed, and about two o'clock they went away; the prisoner came in again about four o'clock without his hat, when I was very busy, he called me into the parlour, seemingly in a great hurry, and said, can you lend me three or four pounds for five minutes, my friend Meyrick is gone out, and my mistress is not at home; I said, I am very sorry Mr. Smith I cannot oblige you, I have nothing less than a five pound note; he took the five pound note out of my hand, and said, that will do, I will bring it you back in less than five minutes; I saw no more of him till I saw him at Hatton-garden.</p>

               <p>Q. Did that induce you to go to the pantry? - A. It did, with the prisoner; I found that the edge of the door, outside of the pantry, had been scratched a little, to make it appear as if it had been broke open.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you get the key from? - A. Out of his pocket, I desired him to give it me; I fol<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180301120030"/>lowed the prisoner up stairs, and kept my eye upon him, not to lose sight of him, till the constable came.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you found any thing before the constable came? - A. I had observed the drawer in the pantry where the plate was usually kept, I found it open, and the plate was gone; the constable came, and took charge of the prisoner, and took him away to Worship-street.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. We know you are an officer belonging to Worship-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Mr. Jobson's house on the morning this affair was discovered? - A. Yes: On Friday, the 7th of January, the prisoner was brought to the office; I went to Mr. Jobson's house, I was shewn the pantry, the door, is painted chocolate, and the side of the door white; on the side of the door, by the lock, there was a little chipping on the edge.</p>
               <p>Q. By the chipping, did it appear to you as if the lock had been broke? - A. It appeared to be done to shew that.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Could it be of any use to force the door? - A.Certainly not; I then tried the lock, and found it perfect; I then shut the door, and there was no appearance at all of force against the door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Where did you go afterwards? - A. I then went to the kitchen-door, which commands the entrance from up stairs, which has nineteen steps to the kitchen-door, and there I found this box, which recieves the lock, lying upon the steps; and the screw of that door opens inwards from the house into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. In order to get that off, must it have been got off inside the kitchen? - A. It must; because I looked at teh jaumbs of the door to see if there had been any force used on the inside, and there was none.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any appearance of force as if the person had come from the area throught the kitchen? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose any person came from the area through the kitchen towards the pantry, did it appear as if any person coming from the area had opened this door? - A. No, the contrary; I was then shewn another kitchen-door, which leads to the area under the stone steps; I looked at that door, and there was no violence at all, and that door lock inwards, and opens inwards into the kitchen; after viewing that, and finding no force there, I shut the door which leads into the area, and that door locked inside and opened inside, and there was no appearance of violence whatever; from there I went to a knife-place, in the area, and that door locked inside and opened inside, and there was no appearance of violence whatever; from there I went to a knife-place, in the area, underneath the pavement, at the end of that knifeplace was a privy, upon viewing this place I saw a number of bricks, and I called for a light, I looked in the dust-hole, Vickery immediately called out to me, Armstrong, I have found the plant; I looked down the privy, and at the end of the privy, under the seat, upon the side. I observed something white; I then got the kitchen tongs, and moved a brick that lay before it, and this tablecloth was produced, tied up, and when I opened it, it contained these articles of plate, and two more table-cloths, and two towels, on the soil;(produces all the articles mentioned in the indictment); this chopper was produced to me in the kitchen, I compared it, and in the door I found the impression of this chopper, upon the sill of the door, where it had been chopped.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Soane.) Did you find this chopper? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180301120031"/>Q.What did you do with it? - A. I hung it up again in its place, and afterwards delivered it to Mr. Armstrong.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Jobson.) Are these articles of plate your's? - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. And these table-cloths and towels? - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I locked my pantry-door every night, but the lock catches; I am frequently obliged to lock it several times before I can make it lock. I went to bed that night, and did not come down any more till the next morning; but Susan came up for the tinder-box. I know nothing of any body getting into the house; I am very innocent of what I am charged with; there was no occasion for me to have broke the lock when I had the key in my pocket; there is a door at the back part of the house that is very seldom locked; there is nothing but a latch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There is a building behind the house, but it is impossible any body can come in that way; it is only a way from one part of the house to another.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q.(To Green.) Had the prisoner any candle in his hand when you saw him? - A. No, he had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there sufficient light for you to be able to see the face of a man? - A. Yes, I am quite positive he is the man.</p>

               <p>Q. Does she officiate in the shop? - A. Yes; I told her I had not taken it; I went up stairs, and there was one missing; I said it was the best tippet; it was the flank tippet that was gone; next day I was going through Covent-garden, and saw it upon the neck of the prisoner; it is composed of two different pieces of fur; I had not enough of the one sort to finish it; it is finished with a different sort of fur; I followed her the full length of the Piazza before I said any thing to her; I did not wish to make a disturbance; I laid hold of her arm and said "My dear will you go a little way with me:" she looked at me, smiled, and said "Yes, where shall we go." she had two young girls, one in each arm, and she bid them go away, saying she was going with a gentleman; we went very quietly down Russell-street; she looked very anxiously at me, and said, "Where are you going with me;" I told her "but a little way;" as we came near the corner of Bow-street, she said -"where are you going; good God, you alarm me;" I told her "to the office;" she said -"for God's sake, what is the matter? tell me if any thing is the matter? we will settle it without going there." I told her my name, and where I lived, and charged her with having the property upon her back that was stolen from my ware-room the night before; upon which the prisoner was alarmed, and said, "I bought the tippet honestly; if the woman I bought it of came dishonestly by it, here take the tippet for God's sake," and immediately put it into my bands; the Magistrates not being sitting, the officers refused to take her into custody, and said, I must have a warrant first; she was very near slipping through the hands of justice by that means; I told them at their peril to let her go; and then Macmanus desired me to give charge of her, which I did; she was taken into Carpmeal's, and I went to fetch my sister; when I came back, she wanted to have some conversation with me; she asked me the value of the tippet; I told her "to a surrier three guineas;" she said, "will you take three guineas; although I gave a guinea and a half for it, I will give you the three guineas;" I told her that would be compounding felony, and I could not do it. After the first examination, a man came and said he would give twenty guineas to make it up. (Produces the tippet.)</p>

             sworn. - I am sister to the prosecutor: On the 1st of December, about half past six o'clock, the prisoner and an old woman came into our shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner? - A. Yes, she had been frequently in our shop; I had known her five years before; the old woman she called servant; I never recollected her coming to our shop above twice without having the old woman with her; the prisoner asked to look at velvet hats; we don't keep them in the shop, and I wished her to have an inferior chip, but she said, she would not wear one; I then took her up into the wareroom, and the old woman went with her; I had myself that day made three tippets, and laid them separate by themselves on the counter in the wareroom.</p>
               <p>Q. That room up stairs is not a shop? - A. Yes, it is, where we shew several goods for sale; these three tippets I put there a little after five o'clock; no one had been in the room before they came in; the prisoner looked at several velvets, and did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180301120032"/>like them; she then returned down into the shop; I was pressing for her to buy, and she bought a black inferior chip, which she said before she would not wear; they were both in great haste to go, as they said they should be too late to go to the Play.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was she in buying that? - A. They were about five minutes in the shop below, and about ten minutes in the ware-room; they were unusually quick below, for I have known them stop half an hour when they have come to purchase; the bonnet that she had bought of me was on her head when I saw her at Bow-street; she gave me half a guinea for it; I did not suspect the prisoner had taken it, nor any one, and therefore I did not look for the tippet that night; the next morning when I came down from breakfast, about half past eight in the morning, I found the two tippets in the same place I had left them, but the other was gone; I immediately asked my brother if he had taken one away, and he said he had not; no one had been in the room that night after she left it but our own family; the tippet is my own work, and I am positive it was never sold; I finished it but about an hour before she came in.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Morhall.) Have you had the possession of the tippet ever since? - A. Yes, this is the same tippet.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.(To Miss Morhall.) Did you ever miss any thing after I had left your shop? - A. No, I never suspected ber.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I bought the tippet some time ago of a person of the name of Sarah Moore.</p>

               <p>Q. Previous to October last, had there been any money transactions between you and him? - A. There had; I had lent him 10l. he owed me, with the law expences, near 15l. I had taken out a writ against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to meet him in October? - A. Yes, upon Snow-hill; I asked him how he could serve me in that manner, by not having the bill which he had given me for thirteen guineas, drawn upon Mr. M'Connell, honoured.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the bill? (Shewing it to the witness.) - A. This is the bill. (It is read.)</p>

No, he sent me the bill in a letter; he told me Mr. M'Connell was a man of very considerable property; that the schedule of his property when taken amounted to 40,000l. he said he had been in the King's Bench, but was then out.</p>

               <p>"Mr. Hogg, Sir, I have enclosed the bill as mentioned; Mr. M'Connell had it drawn to a certainty of its being honoured, so that you may rely on the punctuality of it; I am sorry I could not get it at a shorter date, but hope it will answer your purpose. There must be a mistake as to the costs, as your attorney told a gentleman who called, that the costs were 2l. 10s. returning the writ 10s. three letters 10s. 6d. amounting to 3l. 10s. 6d. As I shall see you in a day or two, will arrange that matter to the satisfaction of both parties. The amount of the enclosed was the balance of one account between me and Mr. M'Connell, which was the reason of its being the sum of thirteen guineas.</p>
               <p>"I remain your's sincerely,</p>

               <p>Q. That bill has the acceptance of 
               <persName id="t18030112-61-person437">James</persName>
             M'Connell? - A. Yes; when I met the prisoner upon Snow-hill, he told me the reason of the bill of thirteen guineas not being honoured was, that Mr. M'Connell had gone into the country, and that he had left my account and some others with a Mr. Bateman to settle during his absence; he promised to call at my office in a day or two to settle it, but did not; he was employed by a person in Billiter-square, I think of the name of Bozeur, a foreign merchant. On the 26th of October he called at my accompting-house, and left a note, which has been lost; I have taken every pains, but cannot find it; he wrote me word, that he was in possession of a bill for 450l. drawn upon a person of the name of Dickason, which he would endeavour to get cashed, and he would then call and pay me what he was in my debt. On the 29th of October he called, and said, he had not been able to get the bill discounted; but if I would discount it, he would pay me; I told him if he would leave the bill with me for an hour, I would enquire if it was a good house; I took the bill to Mr. Dickason's, the acceptor's, and asked them if it was their acceptance; one of the clerks told me it was a very good one; I then took it to my banker's, and the prisoner called immediately afterwards at my accompting-house, and I gave him a draft upon my banker for 411l. which was deducting the thirteen guineas and the discount; he said, if it would be of any use to me he would draw a bill upon me for 20l. at a month or two months; I told him it would not make much matter, but I would accept a bill; he then 
               <persName id="t18030112-61-person438">drew</persName>
             a bill at a month, and I accepted it; that 20l. with the draft upon my banker, the money that he owed me, and the discount, made the amount of 450l.(The Bill of Exchange stated in the indictment, with the acceptance and endrosement, read.)</p>

               <p>Q. Did the bill for 20l. which you accepted, afterwards come to you for payment? - A. Yes, I paid it to a person of the name of Proctor; I heard no more of it till Mr. Parkin and Mr. M'Connell called at my accompting-house the letter end of November.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This bill of 450l. was brought to you in consequence of your first having received a letter from him, and then his coming himself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He made no difficulty of acceding to your request that it might be left with you for the purpose of making any enquiry you thought proper? - A. None; it was left with me about two hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it upon the faith of the name of Dickason, and finding those enquiries satisfactory, that you paid him the money? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing in his conduct at the time that could justify a suspicion in you that he was doing wrong? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. You know enough of the world to know, that a schedule means the schedule of a person in insolvent circumstances? - A. I did not understand that it meant a schedule of a man in insolvent circumstances; I understood it to be an account of what he was worth.</p>

On the 25th of October I called at the King's Bench Prison; M'Connell told me he had got a bill which his brother had remitted by Post from his correspondent at Dover. I told him it was too late that evening to do any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180301120035"/>thing with it, but I would call the next day. I called the next day, and carried it for acceptance. I got it accepted, and then I called upon Mr. Hogg, and he told me Mr. M'Connell had used him very ill not to pay his acceptance of 13l. I told him not to make himself uneasy, for he had received a remittance from abroad, and shewed him the bill. He told me it was a very good bill, and he would cash it for me. I told him I would inform Mr. M'Connell of it. I went to M'Connell, and he said he had got the promise of it from another gentleman, and desired me to call again the next day. The next day I went to M'Connell again (there was an account between us at that time); he desired me to get it cashed. I went to Mr. Hogg, and got it discounted. I wrote my name upon it, Oxford-street, where I then resided. I took the whole of it to the King's Bench, and gave it to M'Connell, in the presence of Mrs. M'Connell and my son. He gave me 2l. on account, which I have accounted for in my books, and then he said, he would settle the balance in a few days, and I heard no more of the business till I was taken up. I only acted as an agent. I was requested to take the bill for acceptance, which I did. I understood he had very great property, and I knew his schedule was 40,000l. when he wanted to take advantage of the Insolvent Act. I heard from a number of persons that he was a man of property; I knew he had recovered 2 or 3000l. upon the ship Hope, and I had no doubt of the bill, especially as he said it was a remittance from his brother. I did not observe the name of John, nor Mr. Hogg either.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know Mr. M'Connell, who is now in the Surrey jail, and was in the King's Bench prison? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing with respect to a 450l. bill? - A. Yes, I was present when Mr. M'Connell gave it to Captain Richards. Mr. M'Connell asked him if he would take a bill for acceptance that he had received from abroad; Mr. Richards said, certainly he would take it to oblige him, if he had no other person to send. It was too late that day; he came again the next day, and took the bill for acceptance; I was present when he returned in the evening; he gave Mr. M'Connell the bill, which was accepted, and said, if he wished to have it cashed, a friend of his in the City, of the name of Hogg, had offered to do it; and Mr. M'Connell said, he would consider of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all that passed at that time? - A. Yes. Two or three days afterwards, Mr. M'Connell gave Captain 
               <persName id="t18030112-61-person452">Richards</persName>
             the bill, to get it cashed by his friend; and he was to pay some bill that Mr. Hogg had upon him, Captain

             came again that evening, and said, his friend, Mr. Hogg, had given him the cash, and he delivered it to Mr. M'Connell, begging of him to look over it, to see that it was right; and he said, it was right; then Captain 
               <persName id="t18030112-61-person454">Richards</persName>
             received a note, which I understood to be a five-pound note, on account of what Mr. M'Connell owed him; there was an account between them, which originated in a bill that Captain

             accommodated Mr. M'Connell with.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. I observed, when Mrs. M'Connell was called, you presented yourself to the book to be sworn? - A. Yes, I have two subpoenas; one by the name of M'Connell, and the other by the name of Hawkes, which is my own name.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has M'Connell been a prisoner in the King's Bench prison? - A. I cannot tell exactly, I believe nearly three years.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he endeavour to obtain the benefit of the Insolvent-act? - A. In August last; I think the same day Captain Richards obtained the benefit of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you the lady referred to in some of these letters by the name of Fanny? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the lady that Mr. Richards desired to be sent to him when he was in spunging-houses? - A. I went once.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he removed to Newgate, or did he get bail? - A. I never knew him in Newgate at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How many days were you visiting him there, passing between him and M'Connell? - A. I don't know, it might be four or five days, or a week.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this before the transaction of the foreign bill? - A. I cannot tell.</p>

I know he is a man of very bad character and would swear a man's life away almost for a guinea. He had offered several people thereabout then guineas to take me up on suspicion. I had been round about there handy times enough. At the time that they swore to me I was at Reading market.</p>

               <p>"have a yellow one, have a yellow one," I was going to open the piece, but the prisoner would do it himself; another young man then came in, and after looking at them, the prisoner said he would call in teh morning as he could not see the colours at night. I had some mistrust, and as they went out of the door I lifted up the piece, and missed five handkerchiefs of a red piece, six of another, and we odd ones. I pursued them and saw them running, some in the horse road and some in the too road; I called out stop thief, and a gentleman stopped the prisoner, who I had not lost sight of-I have never seen the handkerchiefs since.

On Wednesday, December 22, aout 20 minutes after eight o'clock, the prisoners came in to buy a pair of shoes; Richards having a very large foot I could not find a pair very readily, I fittted him, and they were to be bound by eight o'clock next morning. Vinequez said to him he would go out and return in a few minutes. He went out and Richards then made haste out of the shop as fast as he could, I turned round and missed a pair of boots from the wainscot where they hung, and which Vivequez had fat close to; I went in search of them, but could not find them. On the Friday following I received information that a man was to be examined at Bow-street on suspicion of stealing some boots. I went and saw Richards, whom I knew, and who knew me, He said he had not stolen the boots, but would tell me where the man was who had, and would go with me, I went with him and the officer to Westminster and took the other, who I am positive is the man. I asked him what he had done with the boots he had stolen, he said they were at Wapping, Richards said he had better tell where they were, for they were not at Wapping. He did afterwards, and they were found at a saleshop in Dean-street, Westminster.</p>

             sworn. - I am a Bow-street Officer. On the 23d of December, I was going into a wine vaults in Drury-lane, and saw the prisoner Richards with a pair of women's shoes in his hand and another pair in his pocket. I asked him how he came by them. He would not tell me. I searched him and found Mr. Kimpton's card. I put Richards into the watch-house, and next morning went to Mr. Kimpton's to ask if he had lost any shoes. We went to Bow-street, and Birks knew the prisoner Richards, who said he would tell where the man lived. I went and apprehended him; after some hesitation he said he had sold them in Westminster, and would shew us where. I went to Hyams, and the boots were hanging up by the door.(The boots produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Richard's defence. I went to buy a pair of shoes and set down in the shop, what the other man did I cannot answer for; he went away and left me there; I went to Charing-cross and bought two pair of women's shoes and was taken up for stealing them, not for the boots. I know nothing of them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. She first said she had left the penny pieces on the table? - A. No, before supper I had the penny pieces out as I was settling my books, of course they were removed from the table to the desk.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Are you the beadle of Shoreditch? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sent for, on the 9th of December, to search the prisoner? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do? - A. I wanted to know what I was sent for. Mrs. Cross told me she had been robbed by her chairwoman. I asked the pri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180301120041"/>soner if she knew any thing of the book, or picked up any papers. She declared positively she had not. I searched her pockets, which she was much against, and said she would not be searched till all the children were searched, for Mrs. Cross keeps a boarding-school. I said I shall search you first, for I look upon it you are the first that ought to be searched. I then searched her pockets and found three penny pieces, four old halfpence, and two knobs of lump sugar. I told her she must pull off her handkerchief; she resused. I put my hand down her bosom, and the first thing I pulled out was this piece of paper, which Mrs. Cross said she would swear was in the pocket-book. I put my hand down her bosom again and found a bunker's check for 6l. 0s. 8d. I found also a bit of a hymn on which there was some writing in pencil, but nearly rubbed out. She said if I would go up stairs with her she would explain it, and that would tell me where the money was; but that was all a manoeuvre.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.(To Mrs. Cross). Look at that paper and check, and tell me whether they were in the pocket-book? - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that? - A. Yes, I had received the check a day or two before, it was sent by the servant of Mr. Judd when the young ladies came to school.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know his hand writing? - A. Not particularly; but I know this was a check that was inclosed in my account.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever discover what was become of the Bank notes? - A. No; I immediately sent to Mr. Judd and he sent to stop payment of the check. (The check and paper read).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had not to my knowledge any thing about me, I was searched in the morning, and Mrs. Cross bid me go to my work-again for that she suspected other people. I did, and cleaned a room out. She then asked me to go up stairs and clean some other rooms. I was called suddenly down, and just as was stooping to take the pail in my hand, I met with three papers, which I picked up and put into my bosom, not knowing what they were, but intended to take them to shew Mrs. Cross, as I had heard a great piece of work about them, the constable met me and took me into the parlour, where he put his hand in my bosom, and said, what is this you have got here. I said it is the papers which I have brought down to shew Mrs. Cross; then she said she is the thief then, take her away. I can say no more.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Black). Did she say say had picked them up? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say after you found them that she had picked them up? - A. No, she seemed very much slurried and begged of me to be as merciful as I could.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Cross). Was she searched in the morning? - A. To the best of my knowledge, she took some of her things off, I believe she turned out her pockets, and took off her gown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine her person? - A. Yes, I believe I did, as well as I was able; the business was quite strange to me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. Which went out of the house first? - A. The three men; there was another with the prisoners.</p>
               <p> - BLAND sworn. - I am a cabinet-maker: On the 28th of December last, between twelve and one o'clock, I called at the Gentleman and Porter; on going in at the outward door on the lefthand is the bar directly by the door; the passage is rather narrow; there were several people standing at the bar, to the number of four or five, which rather obstructed my going forward; the first person next the outward door was Burgess; next to him was Charles, who had a leg of pork in his hand; a third person of their company was observing, that if it was to be baked, it would shrink up to nothing; the little girl stood close to the bar, and the tray was on the bar-door; they seemed to have got some change, and moved outward, which gave more room for me to pass, and I went into the tap-room; almost directly there was an alarm that the leg of pork was stolen; Charles was holding up the pork, looking at it, when I saw it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hart. Q. It was not concealed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And what was said was loud enough to be heard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.(To Roberts.) What became of the other leg of pork? - A. The mistress took the other leg, and put it in the bar.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you miss a Bank-note at any time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you received a letter containing any Bank-notes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What day? - A. I came to town on Saturday evening, the 1st of January, and found several letters on the table, but was so very ill, that I went to bed immediately, and remained there till six o'clock the next day. On Sunday evening, I sent for the letters, and opened them; one of them contained five notes to the amount of forty-five pounds; four of them were ten-pound Bedford bank-notes, and a five-pound Bank of England note; I put the notes into the letter again, and left them in my bed-room on the table. Next day, I had not been below above three quarters of an hour to attend my physician, Sir Walter Farquhar, when I went up stairs again, and went to bed, having previously put the letters into the drawer of my secrefaire, but did not lock it. On the following morning, when I examined the letter, I found the five pound-note missing; upon which I sent for my valet, and told him the circumstance, commanding him to go to the different trades people I employed, and tell them, that if any servant of mine came with a five poundnote to change, to stop the person and the note. About two o'clock the next day, my servant, James Neale, brought me the five pound-note, saying, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180301120046"/>baker had brought it, having stopped it on one of my servants, naming the prisoner; I then taxed the prisoner with it, and be acknowledged it.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you make him any promise or threat? - A. No; he fell down on his knees, and begged for mercy.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him? - A. I asked him why he had robbed me of my money, and taken such an advantage when I was so dangerously ill. I then sent for a constable, and gave him in charge. I delivered the note to a serjeant.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you taken any particular notice of the note before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you can give no particular description of it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In what capacity was the prisoner? - A. My livery-servant, and had been one of my soldiers in the 76th regiment. He had not been with me a month as my servant.</p>

             sworn. - I was on some of my barges that lay near the Old Barge-house: On Saturday the 18th, about eight o'clock in the evening, I observed two boats coming down the river, one light, the other loaded; they made towards some sailing-boats belonging to Mr. Doe, at the Old Barge-house; I went to my boat, and rowed directly to them; there were three persons in the light boat towing the loaded one; before I made the last pull to get into the loaded boat, I saw something like a great coat in it, it was very dark, I could not see whether it was a man or not; I stepped into the boat, and found it was not a man; I then stepped into the other boat, and laid hold of the prisoner, who was standing close by the side of the loaded boat, but in the sailing-boat; I said, I have got you, where are the others? they were then running over the boats towards the shore; he said, the boat does not belong to me, Mr. Rowen; I stepped into another boat, laying along-side of the boat the prisoner was in, for the purpose of pursuing the other men, but found it useless; and, on my return, the prisoner stepped into a light boat, and made for the Old Barge-house stairs; I called stop thief, but he got away; I have known him some time, and am sure he is the man; I examined the boat they were towing, and saw nine pigs of lead, which I delivered to Mr. Gotty, the Police officer; the name of Butcher was on the boat.</p>

I heard him say also, that one of the casks was concealed in a ditch, near the Plough, covered with needs, or nettles; I then took them into custody, and the cask was searched for, and found.</p>

             sworn. - I was at plough in Bow-Common-field, and about nine o'clock in the morning of the 4th of December, I saw the prisoner, Wright, with something under his coat; as we had lost a great number of turnips, I asked him what he had got there; he said it was something good to drink, and asked me to drink; I tasted, and found it to be bitters; when I had been one round with my plough, I returned, and saw the two prisoners bury a cask in the ground. Davis was my fellow-servant, and worked in the field; I went up to him, and saw him sitting on the cask of bitters, and the cask of anniseed was buried in the ground; my master came into the field, and I related it to him; we went to the ground and found the cask of anniseed as I had told him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the men were gone before he came? - A. Yes; I carried the cask to Mr. Horn, and after that, Davis came and fetched another cask out of the ditch, which he wrapped up in his smock frock, and carried to the Plough public-house.(Three casks produced, and identified).</p>
               <p>Wright's defence. I was looking for work as a labourer, and found two casks in a ditch; I did not know what was in them, but took them into the field where that man was at work; we drank of them, and Davis came up, and said he would get me some breakfast at a public-house, I went there with him, and was taken.</p>
               <p>Davis's defence. I was at work, and Wright came by me; I saw him and the ploughman drinking, I went up and asked the man where he got it; he said he found it in a ditch.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner one of the young men who had been in the shop? - A. No; the coat was made for a gentleman in St. Paul's Church yard; I had seen it about half past seven, for I put it down on a desk about two yards from the door; no other person had been in the shop but those two young men that I saw.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen him come out? - A. No; seeing him so close to their shop with a great coat on his arm, I suspected him; as I was going into the door two young men rushed past me; directly I thought they were the two partners, or I should have stopped them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you see the boy deliver it to the prisoner? - A. No; I saw it on the prisoner's arm.</p>
               <p>Q. It was after you had taken the prisoner that the two men came out? - A. Yes; I thought they were the partners alarmed at the robbery, and running after the thief.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You knew his wife was ill? - A. Yes; she had just lain-in.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before the prisoner came to buy the pattens, had you seen that particular pair of shoes? - A. I cannot say; several pair of such shoes had been sold in the course of the day; nobody serves but myself and my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you cannot say but the shoes were sold in the former part of the day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He readily told you where he lived, and his right name? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the shoes concealed? - A. No.(The shoes were produced by the constable, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I bought the shoes of the prosecutor in his shop at six o'clock that evening; he served me himself.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.(To Elliott.) Is that true? - A. I cannot say; I don't take such notice of every customer, who perhaps I never saw before, to say I should know them again; I enquired about the prisoner's character in the neighbourhood, and received a most undeniable one.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18030112-81-verdict447" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing that happened in the house which she let to a family? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What? - A. The family left it on Friday the 7th of January, and I slept in it the Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights following.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened on the 10th? - A. On the Monday I went into the house, about half past ten; when I went up stairs to my bed-room, I was much surprised at seeing the sheets taken off my bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What else? - A. And the blanket and quilt were thrown on the floor; I went into the next room, and the cloaths of that bed were likewise all turned up; I then went down to the next floor, and on going into the back-room, I saw the bed and blanket tied up as though ready for carrying away.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me whether you had seen the bed and blanket in their proper places before? - A. Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Q.How long before? - A. About three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they removed from the bed? - A. No, they were all tied up upon the bedstead.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the sheets missing entirely off your bed? - A. Yes, off my bed entirely.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen them? - A. In the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nobody in the house with you, was there? - A. Yes, a child eight years old; I then thought there was somebody in the house, and I went to Mrs. Carlton's house.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is her house? - A. Three doors lower down; she sent over to the public-house opposite, and we got two soldiers and the landlord to go with us to search the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you accompany them? - A. Yes; there was no person in the house; but on going into the drawing-room, we found the window curtains were taken down, and the sofa cover taken off, and taken away.</p>
               <p>Q.Were they linen or what? - A.Printed calico.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the curtains up before? - A. In the afternoon; we went up to the second floor, and in the front bed-room the furniture of the four-post bedstead was taken down, except the tester, and taken away, and the counterpane; in the back bed-room the furniture of a tent bed and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180301120050"/>quilt were taken away; that was the room where the bed was tied up and the three blankets; Mrs. Carlton then employed the guards to set up in the house to watch.</p>
               <p>Q. They did so, did they? - A. Yes, but I was not there, and know nothing of what passed afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been at home the greater part, or the whole of the day; how long had you been out? - A. I went out in the morning; Mrs. Carlton was in the house at three o'clock to see all safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you or her in the house all the day? - A. No; I left it between eight and nine in the morning, and did not go into it again till half past ten at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it immediately upon your going in that you missed the things? - A. I went into my bedroom, and found my sheets gone.</p>
               <p>Q. That led you to examine the other rooms? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between eight and nine, and half past ten at night, you don't know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you had seen the things safe at three o'clock? - A. No, Mrs. Carlton had.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Carlton.) What time of day did you go into the house on the 10th? - A. At three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay? - A. I only went over the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go through all the bed-rooms in the house? - A. No; I went up to the second floor to look at the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the front room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state was the bed? - A. Every thing was safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the other rooms? - A. No, I did not; I went up stairs for a piece of green baize that I wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. Then from three o'clock till ten nobody was in the house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the house was searched? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What state did you find the things in? - A. We went into the parlour first, but found no person; nothing was disturbed there; we went then to the first floor, and found the window-curtains were taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Those you had not observed at three o'clock? - A. No, I had not, and the sofa cover was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me the room you had observed? - A. The front room forward; there the curtains were taken away, and the white counterpane off the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What steps did you take on finding the furniture had been removed? - A. We went to the public-house, and got two of the life guards, and the man at the public-house, to search; we all went over the house, but found nobody in it; then a patrol came up, to whom we gave the alarm, and he likewise went over the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he find any body? - A. No; then I left these two life guards men in the house all night, and about half past five o'clock they saw the door was open; that is a 11 know.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose any thing on the 6th of December last? - A. About five or six o'clock, in the evening, I lost a diamond ring, and several articles of value, to the amount of about 25l. in all.</p>
               <p>Q. What wre the other articles? - A. Two gold rings.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they placed? - A. In a tray in the shop window for sale.</p>
               <p>Q. How was that place secured? - A. It lay in the window loose with others. The glass was before it.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen these panes of glass last? - A. In the course of the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. How late? - A.Perhaps withing an hour before the circumstance happened.</p>
               <p>Q. They then were all secure? - A. Yes; I was at tea in the parlour, when I was alarmed by a noise in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a noise? - A. My young man's jumping across the counter made a noise; he was endeavouring to open the shop door, and on my going up to him I found it was tied. We succeeded, after some difficulty, in getting it open. The violence of our pulling had loosened the cord a little, so that we could get a hand out. On examining the cord I found it was tied to the railing of the area and to the handle of the door. I suspected the window ws broke, and found it was so, and several things were missing; a mob was collecting round the door, so that I found it necessary to shut up the shop for the evening. I went out and returned about ten o'clock in the evening, when I saw the rings, which were brought to me by the officer.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you know of this robbery? - A. I was standing, between five and six o'clock in the evening, in the shop, and heard a noise, and saw a man's hand in the window.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of noise was it? - A. The crashing of glass. I saw him taking the rings, and immeiately jumped over the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take any thing else besides the ring? - A. Not to my knowledge. I proceeded to the door to open it, and found it fast, till such time as Mr. Rogers came up, and we got it open. I observed the cord, but cannot exactly say in what situation it was on the door. I went out and assisted in putting up the shutters, but know nothing more.</p>

             sworn. - What are you? - A. One of the patrol belonging to the Office in Bow-street. On Saturday evening, the 4th of December, I was standing with my brother officers opposite Dyot-street, St. Giles's, when we heard a great noise.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of noise? - A.There was a mob collected; we went up and saw the prisoner in the coustody of a watchman, named Kelly; there was a great scuffle between the prisoner and the watchman, but we got the prisoner to the watch-house. On searching him, in his fob pocket I found those two rings (producing them) wrapped up in this bit of paper, which I have kept ever since; the prisoner was very obstreperous indeed; we had the hardest matter in the world to get him to the watch-house. I then went to Mr. Rogers and shewed him the rings which he owned.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What time did you take me? - A. Between eight and nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>ROGER KELLY sworn. - Q.What are You? - A. A watchman. Between eight and nine o'clock as I was walking about my beat in St. Giles, a boy was sent after me by Mr. March, a salesman and goldsmith. I went to him and he gave me and prisoner in charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it - in High-street, St. Giles's?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180301120052"/>- A. Yes. I laid hold of the prisoner, who asked me what I meant to do with him. I told him that by the account Mr. March gave me I would take him to the watch-house, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in company with the patrol then? - A. No; the prisoner was very desperate, and said he would not go along with me. I made an attmept to spring my rattle, and he laid hold of it; then I called Hogan, my brother watchman, who came up, and we took him with great difficulty. Going along he made several grabs at his pocket, as if to take something out; I made a grab to prevent him, and every grab I made he gave me a rap on the head for it. I was afraid it was a knife he was going to draw. Going along I met some Bow-street officers, and was very gald to see them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver him up to them? - A. No, I stuck to him as well as they did; he was very resolute. When he was searched I saw them take the rings out; I was nearly out of breath with him.</p>
               <p>What pocket was it? - A. I think the right hand fob pocket.</p>
               <p>CHRISTOPHER JONES sworn. - Q. What are you? - A. A conductor of the patrol of Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q.What do you know of this? - A. I was along with Crocker, and saw the prisoner searched and the rings found.</p>
               <p>RICHARD LIMBRICK sworn. - I am one of the patrol, and was present in the watch-house when Crocker took the two rings out of the prisoner's pocket.(The rings produed and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. As I was going up High-street, St. Giles's, I picked up the rings and went to a shop, where there was a light, to look what they were; I put them in my pocket, and the watchman immediatley came up and began to beat me with a stick without my knowing what it was for <rs id="t18030112-83-verdict458" type="verdictDescription">

             sworn. - I am a patrol; about four o'clock, on the morning of the 16th of December the prisoner and another man passed me, and went towards the prosecutor's; as I was going my rounds again, about half past five, I heard a noise, and saw the prisoner with a copper on his head, and a hank of silk in a small bag; I asked him how he came by them, he made no answer, but threw the copper down, and attempted to run away; I caught him by the collar, and we had a scuffle, in which he knocked my blunderbuss out of my hand; I got it up again, and told him I would fire upon him if he resisted; he then begged for mercy, and I sprung my rattle, at which a watchman came up; I asked the prisoner how he came by the property; he said, as he was coming along a man hired him to carry it to Old-street, for which he was to have 2s. but did not know who the man was, where it came from, or where he was to take it to; he was then taken to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there other persons in the company of the prisoner? - A. He was in company with another gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any conversation about a wager of a guinea that evening? - A. Not to my know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180301120053"/>ledge; the prisoner and another man came in, and had six pennyworth of gin and water, after that they had another, and then went away; in a very short time after the prisoner came in again, and looked round for a seat,one of the witnesses would not let him sit down by him, and I said come here, upon which he put his hand to his side and said some of you shall have the contents of this.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what is was? - A. I did not properly see the rights of the property; a little while after I got up and stood at the bar door, and there was an argument between him and Mr. Telfar, and he went up towards him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after he said some of you shall have the contents of this? - A. I think it might be about five minutes; the deceased was getting up to go out of doors, and before he could get out, somebody shoved him against Mr. Tier; he immediatlely turned round and went to the end of the settle and drew a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Goldsmith near the settle at that time? - A. No, he was going out at the door; the prisoner 
               <persName id="t18030112-85-person627">drew</persName>
             a knife, and said any body that offended him should have the contents of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner sober or not? - A. He was not sober, nor he was not drunk he was about half and half; Goldsmith then came back, went to the site place and caught hold of either the tongs or the poker, I don't know which; he immediately went round after the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no outcry in the company, upon his producing his knife? - A. No, I did not hear any body say any thing; Goldsmith went round the settle after the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the way to go into the street? - A. Yes, Goldsmith went after him; in a very short time the deceased cried out he is in me; upon that alarm one of the witnesses went to assist in getting the knife out of the man's body; he was led back into the tap-room, and said he was given me the contents of the knife; he unbuttoned his waistcoat, pulled up his shirt, and there was his bowels in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any violence offered to the prisoner before that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you mean to say no violence was offered to him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not a shove against him so violent as to make him reel against the kitchen grate? - A. It did not bruise him.</p>
               <p>Q.Perhaps your memory will serve you to say that the majority of the company were calling out poker him, poker him? - A. I did not hear any body call out poker him.</p>
               <p>Q. I should rather suspect you were not sober? - A. Yes I was, I had only had a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in the house? - A. I suppose about an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect what time you came in? - A. No; I did not look at the dial.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was that dispute with? - A. The landlord of the house, he is here; the landlord said, part of the guinea was spent in punch, and the parties must settle it among themselves for he had nothing to do with it; I know no more that passed between the parties till afterwards; Mr. Tier and me were having some words together, he was very near the table by the fire, and during that time somebody pushed Goldsmith against Tier.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had Goldsmith been in the house? - A. I did not observe, nor did I know the man. Tier made a stagge against the fire-place, whether he sell or not I do not know, but he staggered; after which Tier withdrew to the corner of the settle, and then it was I saw the knife.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a knife wa it? - A. A large knife, apparently a butcher's knife; some voices in the room then called out, knock him down, he has got a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing first? - A. He said something, but what it was I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there more voice than one called out so? - A. Yes, there were.</p>

               <p>Q. More than one? - A. Yes; upon that Goldsmith ran towards the fire, and caught up the tongs; he followed the prisoner into the passage, with the tongs before him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to him? - A. Not that I heard; in a few seconds, or a minutes, I heard the unfortunate man say, he is in me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. At this time the prisoner was in his working dress, a a butcher; he had his blue apron on, had he not? - A. I have not a doubt but he had.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are the landlord of the Cock and Bell public-house? - A. Yes; I recollect seeing the prisoner and the deceased there, about half past seven o'clock in the evening; the prisoner and a cheesemonger called for sixpenny worth, and two pipes of tobacco, which I served them with, and the prisoner addressed himself to me respecting returning him a guinea, which he had left with me to make good a bet some time before; I told him I could not say any thing to it without the other parties were present, that they had seven shilling worth of punch out of it, and if he chose ot wait, I dared to say the other parties would no tbe long before they came; just as I said that, they came in; and I said to the prisoner, here they are, settle it with them, and whatever you agree to I have no objection; the prisoner after that, had a few words with Mr. Telfar, paid the reckoning, and left the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether he had any knife with him or not? - A. I did not see any with him then In the course of five minutes, he returned into the house by himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether he had a knife when he returned? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.Before he left the house, the first time, did he say for what purpose he left it? - A. No; I conceived he was gone home; when he returned, he called for a pint of porter, and change for a sevenshilling-pieces, and set himself down by the side of Povey, when a conversation took palce between him and Mr. Telfar, respecting his going and making a complaint about having some wine at my house; Mr. Telfar accused him of having asserted it, he denied it, and a person was sent for to prove it; just as the person came in, and the question was put, the prisoner arose from his seat, went across the tap-room to continue the conversation across the table, and after some words between Mr. Telfar and him, the prisoner put himself in a position for fighting; I was in my bar, but I turned round, and saw the prisoner in the attitude for fighting, and doubling his sist.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen any attempt made by any person to offer violence to him before you saw him in that attitude? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that effort towards fighting the first attempt towards riot you saw in the room? - A. Yes; in consequence of his being in that position, somebody shoved the deceased against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body attempt to shove him, or assault him, before he stood in that position? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who it was that shoved the deceased against him? - A. No; because the settle prevented my seeing.</p>
               <p>Q. When the deceased was shoved against him, what did you see? - A. The prisoner see backwards towards the fire-place, and the deceased with him; the prisoner was next the fire-place, but neither of them fell, they only staggered with the shove against the fire-place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing on receiving the shove? - A. He returned to the corner of the settle, and 
               <persName id="t18030112-85-person630">drew</persName>
             a knife; I did not see him draw it, but I saw him with it in his hand, holding it out towards the company, and exclaiming some words which I cannot repeat perfectly, but it was, that if they came near him again, they should have the contents of the knife, or something of that kind; I think they were very aggaravating words, and holding the knife in his hand; immediatley there was a hue and cry, he has drawn a knife; the general voice prevailed.</p>
               <p>Q. That was after he 
               <persName id="t18030112-85-person631">drew</persName>
             the knife, and held it in that menacing poisition? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What else did they say? - A.Knock him down, or knock it out of his hand, I cannot say which, they might say both.</p>
               <p>Q. Did more than one person say it? - A. Yes, the general voice; more than one, two, or three; according to the best of my opinion, I think it was, knock him down; and the deceased immediately turned towards the fire-place for the poker, or tongs, I don't know which, but he took up the tongs, and appeared to me to follow the prisoner behind the settle.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you enabled to ascertain for what purpose he followed him? - A. I should suppose to knock him down, or to knock his knife down; almost instantly that he went behind the settle, I heard the deceased cry out, he is in me, or something of that sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any blows? - A. I think the deceased, after the knife was in him, made a blow with his hands.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he had the tongs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you hear any clashing of the tongs, so as to say there was a blow given the prisoner before you heard the deceased cry out? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. I think this cannot be carried further that manslaughter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. No, my Lord; and I think I cannot make less of it.</p>

             sworn. - Q.Where do you live? - A. In North-row, Grosvenor-square; the prisoner lodged with me, but not his wife and child: On Saturday, the 4th of December, she came, with the child, and slept with him at my house, and I saw them all three together on Sunday morning, when they breakfasted with me and my wife, between nine and ten o'clock; after which we had each a glass of rum, and I saw him, his wife and child go together form my house at about ten o'clock; I did not see him again til the evening, about half past eight, after I came from chapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any enquiry after his wife and child? - A. Not that Sunday, but the Sunday following he did; I had been to Highgate, and I believe he had been to Barnet; on his return he called for me at my mother in-law's at Highgate; her name is young; I believe he had called for me there once before in the summer; as the prisoner, my brother-in-law, and I were coming to town the Sunday after the prisoner's wife's death, he asked me if his wife had been at my house; I replied, no, not as I knew of, for I had been out in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did his wife usually call upon him in her course of the week? - A.sometimes on a Saturday, and sometimes on Monday or Tuesday, but generally twice a week for some little matter of subsistence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they live on good terms together? - A. It appeared to me, when I have heard his wife speak, that they were not on good terms,and from him the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they lived together at all during the time he lodged with you? - A. No; he lodged with me about half a year, or three quarters of a year; the good woman wished to be taken home as his wife, I have no doubt; and I verily believe that was the sentiments of her heart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. If I understand you, his wife used to come and sleep with him on Saturday nights? - A. Yes; she did not sleep many times at my house, it might be three or four times; she used to come about six o'clock to receive a little money, and stand in the street till such time a she left his business.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether she had been addicted to drinking? - A. I never saw her in liquor; I have seen her but few times.</p>
               <p>Q.Perhaps no at all previous to her going to the work-house? - A. I believe never.</p>
               <p>Q. What her habits of life were you don't know? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. you have said, they left your house on the Sunday morning, and he returned abut eight in the evening? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He said nothing about his wife? - A. No, not till the Sunday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there had been no rumour that she was lost? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And he enquired whether you had seen her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As she was in the habit of coming to see him on a Saturday night, he was surprised at not seeing her? - A. I cannot say whether he was or not.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his business? - A. A barnessmaker.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he went to his work regular after the Sunday you last saw his wife? - A.Exactly; he came constant to his home, and went constant to his work.</p>
               <p>Q. And as soon as he had an opportunity of speaking to you at Highgate, he asked you if you had seen his wife? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect any body asking your mistress what o'clock it was, after the prisoner was gone, and her saying it was, only half past three? - A. No; there was nobody in the house but my mistress and me.</p>
               <p>Q. Sarah Daniels came there I understand - do you recollect any observation made by your mistress, that the reason of her lighting candles so soon was in consequence of the fog? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.It is about an hour's walk from your house to town? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Taking which road? - A. If they take the towing-path road.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Is not the towing-path road a considerable round? - A.It is.</p>
               <p>Q.Did not the man and woman take the properest road? - A. There is no road at all for carriages, horses, or foot-path.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know where Mr. Fillingham lives - was not by his house the nearest road? - A. Yes; but they did not go across the fields to Mr. Fillingham's house, they kept along side the canal.</p>
               <p>Q. The way they went, was not there a path by the canl, and a paling? - A. Mr. Fillingham's paling is about ten feet from the water.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is a person who goes that way obliged; to walk inside or outside the paling? - A.Outside; but nobody has any busness along there, for there is a couple of gates put up with bushes on them to prevent any body getting over.</p>
               <p>Q.Is there not a large stump of a tree place by the gate, upon which persons step and get over? - A. No; but there are plenty of places where they may get over into Mr. Fillingham's fields, but that is not the road or path.</p>
               <p>Q.You cannot say whether they went over his fields or not? - A. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q.Which is the proper road for travellers, or which people usually take? - A. The towing-path. They had got past the path that goes to Mr. Fillingham's when I last saw them, but had not got to the gates with the bushes, which was about two hundred yardsw distant.</p>
               <p>HANNAH PATIENCE sworn. - I keep the Mitre tavern, and recollect seeing the prisoner there on Sunday the 5th of December, with a woman and child, they had been there a good while before I saw them; I served them with a quartern of rum, and they had a pint of beer after it. They left our house, as near as I can recollect, about half past four, by the grey of the evening coming on, for we have no clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of them appear to be the worse for liquor? - A. Not the least that I observed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect Sarah Daniels being in your house? - A. She came to buy a candle to take to her master; they were then gone; and the man came back for a shoe which the child had left, but could not find it.</p>

               <p>Q.Therefore whatever might be charged for a bed by any person there, you cannot tell? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.When the woman went away, did she not take her apron, and in a sort of desponding way say, she would never be there againgt? - A. she took her child on her left are, and threw the tail of her gown over its head, and I threw the other end over to her, in doing which she gave her elbow a twist, and said, this is the last time I shall come here.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe any marks of violence, either on the mother or child? - A. Not the least; I had a surgeon to examine the child.</p>

               <p>Q.What was the verdict of the Corner's Jury? - A.Accidental death.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you taken a view of the place in which this act is supposed to have been committed? - A. Yes, I know it very well.</p>
               <p>Q.Describe whether going round by Mr. Fillingham's house is the shortest way to London or not, from the Mtre? - A. A considerable deal; if you go round by the towing-path, you must go by the canal all the way; it is a very short distance from the canal to Mr. Fillingham's house; between the rail and the side of the river it is impossible to walk with safety, it is so slippery it is likde soap: it is a very little way to Mr. Fillingham's, which is a good road, and then pass the house into the Harrow-road.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.Can you state the distance from the Mitre tavern to Whetstone? - A. I suppose ten miles.</p>
               <p>Q.How fae, going by the lanes? - A. I cannot tell which way to go by lanes; there may be a shorter way through that part of the country, but I should think that would be seven or eight miles, and from Whestone back again about nine, altogether about sixteen miles.</p>

            ? - A. I did, the second day after her death.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you able to form a judgment of what was the cause of her death? - A.She died of an inflammation of the lungs and heart.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you judge what was the cause of it? - A.There waas not any marks externally to induce me to say violence was the cause of it.</p>
               <p>Q.How long had the inflammation existed? - A. I don't think it could have existed more than twelve or fourteen hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Would beating and ill usage produce that inflammation? - A. There are various causes.</p>
               <p>Q.Is that a cause to which you can ascribe inflammation? - A. Beating and bruising will occation inflammation, but there was not any external appearance at that time to make me believe it was occasioned by violence, and had I opened the body without hearing the rumour, I should not have supposed it had been occasioned by violence.</p>
               <p>Q. was it that sort of instammation that might be occasioned by drinking? - A. The very frequent use of strong spirituous liquors might produce a strong inflammation; this was more violent than any I ever saw.</p>
               <p>Q. You should not have suspected any violence from the appearnace of the body? - A. I did not see any thing to induce me to suspect any.</p>
               <p>Q. was there that appearance about the body to lead you to accunt for the infalmmation by violence? - A. no; I can only say that violence, such as is reported to have been used upon the body, would produce such disease.</p>
               <p>Q.But would it not leave some external mark? - A. Yes; but there was not the least vestige of a bruise or contusion; I cannot pretend to say what squeezing or pressing might do, but blows or kicks must leave some marks.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it could not without marks of violence; but squeezing, such as you have stated, might do it? - A. I think pressure might do it, but I cannot say what the cause of it was.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Are you a married woman? - A. Yes; my husband is a groom; the prisoner is a chip hat weaver. On a Friday evening, in December, I cannot tell what day of the month, about five o'clock, I went to the prisoner's apartment and found him lying on the bed in liquor, and the deceased was smoaking her pipe by the fire.

            ; she was also in liquor. I went there to speak to Mrs. Lilly, and she was not at home; when I had been there about ten minutes, I asked the deceased wehre Mrs. Lilly was, and she said she did not know; she expected her in every minute, and I sat down to wait for her. The deceased said to the prisoner, you dog you have hooked my child many a time, and now I will hook you.</p>
               <p>Q.What did she mean by hooked? - A. He works with a hook at his business. She then began to scratch his face. She had been sitting by the fire side; she got up and went to the bed; I went to him, and held him down for fear he should strike her. I held him down while she scratched his face. During that time his wife came in; she was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q.How long did you hold him down? - A. I dare say about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q.Why did you not take the woman off? - A.She was so obstreperous she would not be persuaded by me; then the wife came in, and she began to scratch his face as well as her sister; they were both so obstinate they would not go out.</p>
               <p>Q.Why did the wife scratch him? - A.She thought he was ill using her sister, which was the deceased. I went and fetched in Mary Clarke; I was not gone above three or four minutes, and when I came back the deceased was on the floor; the prisoner was standing on her left hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he shoes on? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.What was he doing? - A. He was standing still.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was his wife? - A. She was standing in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw no blows? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - On the 2d of January I heard a noise in the chapel, in the evening, soon after the congregation was gone. I opened the street door and looked to see if any body was on the steps. I then called Mrs. Bickley, and we both went into the chapel with a light. we saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180301120061"/>the cushions and books mislaid in different parts upon the ground. In this handkerchief I produce six prayer books which were found on the prisoner, one of which belongs to Mr. Robson, and another to Sir John Smith. (Produces them). We could not see any body below, and I thought somebody might be in the gallery. Thomas Preston went up with me, and in the second pew we found the boy, who is the prisoner, sitting upon a hassock, we asked him if there were any more. He said no, for he had just let the man out with some books. We asked him who the man was; he said he met him at the top of Swallow-street; that the man asked him to go with him to Trinity Chapel for some books, and he should have part of the money, which would be of service to him. The boy seemed very much frightened.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Miss Susman. On the 30th of December, the prisoner knocked at the door, and asked of me for Miss Cato, which is the name she goes by, Susman being a hard name to recollect. I said she was not at home, but at the play. He asked me if he could go up and write a note. I said, yes. He went up but I could not find a pen. I went down a few stairs to call a servant, and in the mean time heard the plate rattle on the side-board in the room I had left the prisoner. I thought he was very curious and looking at it. I went up again as far as the window, when I met him on the stairs with the things in his pocket, which I heard rattle. I said you are not going. He said, yes. I said you have not wrote the note. He said no, neither am I going to write it. I immediately put my hands against his breast, and said you have got something in your pocket which don't belong to you, and desired him to go up stairs, which he did, and began to pull the things out of his pocket. I heard Mr. Brown on the stairs, and called him in, and he saw the prisoner pull a part of the things out of his pocket. The prisoner said it was only a joke, and wished to go away, but I sent for a constable and he was taken to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM BROWN sworn. - I keep the house: On the 30th of December, I was called in by the last witness, and saw the prisoner pulling the articles mentioned in the indictment out of his pocket, and he was taken to the watch-house.</p>

Griffiths and I went there, and Griffiths and Baker went into a back place, while I went into a little room, where I found this small saw, (produces it); I asked Baker where he got it; he said he bought it of Mr. Mainwaring, the maker; I looked, and saw the name of Harrison on it, and took Baker into custody; in the evening, Smith and I went again, and he found a tenon saw, in a little cupboard, nearly covered with rags, as if it was concealed. On the 20th I went again, with the prosecutor, and found several things, which he owned, from among a vast number of tools which were there.

               <p>The prisoners James and Mines, declined making any defence.</p>
               <p>Baker's defence. Brown came to me on a Sunday, and asked me if I would buy some tools; being in the cabinet line myself, and having a wife, two children, and a mother, to support, I bought them for my own use, to save buying new ones; he came on Monday morning, and I gave him what he asked for them.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner, Baker.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PURCELL sworn. - I am a bricklayer, and have known Baker ten years: On Sunday the 28th of November last, I saw Brown at his house, and heard him say something about carpenter's tools that had come out of pawn, and that he had bought them with an intention of going to work, but could not get any, and wanted money, therefore wished to sell them. Baker said he did not make a practice of buying things on a Sunday, and desired him to go about his business, and I saw no more of him. Baker keeps an old iron-shop, and carries on business as a carpenter, and when he is not employed he assists his wife in the shop.</p>
               <p>Baker called four other witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. - I live next door to Mr. Carey, and Thompson lodged with me: One morning, between seven and eight o'clock, I saw him standing upon some rasters in my yard, by which he could get into Mr. Carey's lost; there had been a chamber there, but the boards were off. I asked him what business he had there; and he said he was getting a bit of dry wood. I never knew any thing amiss of him before.</p>
               <p>- CHAPMAN sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Hatton-garden, and examined the premises belonging to Mr. Carey, where I saw, that by pulling one of the boards up, which swung like a swinging partition, a man could get into the lost from the rasters; that afternoon I also searched Bentley's shop, which is an old and new shoe-shop, in Dorrington-street, near Brook's-market, and found four pair of shoes in the window, for sale, which Mr. Carey owned; I asked Bentley how he came by them; he paused some time before he could recollect the description of the man he bought them of; at last he said he bought them of a mulatto man, to whom he paid one pound and sixpence, for five pair, near three months before.</p>

               <p>ELIZABETH WHEELER sworn. - I am servant to the prisoner, Bentley: About two or three months ago, Thompson came to sell five pair of shoes, of which these four pair are part; he asked if Mr. Bentley would buy five pair of shoes, that he need not be afraid of buying them, for that he had been on board a ship two years, and could not get any money of the purser, but he let him have the shoes to make money of; then Bentley gave him one pound and sixpence, which he said he knew to be the full value of them, and said, he hoped Thompson came honestly by them; I saw him afterwards sell a pair for four shillings and sixpence, so he got four-pence three farthings by that pair. (The shoes produced, and identified).</p>
               <p>Thompson's defence. I was going to work, and found five pair of shoes in the place where I used to get a bit of dry wood, I picked them up, and sold them to Bentley. As for going into Carey's shop, I did not know which way.</p>
               <p>Bentley's defence. This man offered me the shoes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180301120064"/>for four shillings and sixpence a pair; I said I would give him four shillings; he was going out of the door, and I offered him sixpence more, which he took; and I immediately put them in the window for sale, not knowing they were stolen.</p>
