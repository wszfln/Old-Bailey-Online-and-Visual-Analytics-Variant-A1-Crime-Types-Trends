The prisoner came to our premises on Friday, 30th Oct.—I saw him—he said he wanted 10,000 bills printed—he gave me this as a pattern (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said he wanted one printed as near as possible like that, as near as my type would allow me; it is in the same condition now, except being torn in getting it off the file—this is a bill for the baking powder—healso produced another label, similar to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), for egg powder—thisis a part of it, the other is lost—I was also to print 10,000 of those in type as near as I could get it, but my type was not exactly the same as this; it was the same in words, but not in type, the words "egg powder" are a little larger—I do not think he said who he was on that occasion—he gave me his address as No. 10, Catherine Street, Stepney—after he left, I proceeded to print these labels—my apprentice, who is here, set up the type—the pri<lb/>soner called again next day—I delivered him some of each kind of the labels, all I had printed—he did not on that occasion say who he was—aweek afterwards he brought me another label to print; they were ounce packets, larger packets—I have not got that label here—he wanted me to print 10,000 more of those—on that occasion he said, "Let me have some to-morrow," and speaking of finishing the order, he said, "My name is Ready-money George"—I had received directions on the first occasion to send them</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corn dealer in Bedford Place, Commercial Road East. I know the prisoner—I had known him in the employment of a gentleman name Styles—he called on me on 3d Nov. last, and asked if I was a buyer of baking powders—I said, "No, I am not; I have only recently bought some of Borwick's"—he said he had got some that he had taken in the way of trade that he could sell to me—I said, "Whose are they?"—he said they were Borwick's, and in order to convince me that they were Borwick's he unbuttoned his coat, from which he produced a patent baking powder, and a patent egg powder—I took it from him and read it, and it was printed similar to this; they were folded up—I looked at them, and felt satisfied that I was buying Borwick's genuine baking powders, upon which I gave him an order for five gross of baking powders, and four gross of the egg powders—this(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bill he gave me—they came to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I knew him before—I did not know his name was Smith, only by the receipt on the paper—these(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are part of the packets that he sold me, some of each sort—thisis an article well known in the trade; customers when they come in ask for no one's but Borwick's, and they will not take any other, they know it is of so genuine a description—those that I bought of the prisoner have been brought back to me by parties to whom I sold them.</p>

I went to No. 10, Catherine Street, Stepney, and found the prisoner there, in the back kitchen—he was engaged in making up packets of baking powder, and some was drying before the fire in packages—I produce three dozen of the packages that I found there—I told him I took him into custody for obtaining money by false pretences—he said, "I never obtained money by false pretences in my life"—he also asked, "What is the false pretence, and who charges me?"—I said, "You have been selling a spurious article as Borwick's baking powder to Mr. Emblem, and he charges you"—he said, "I did not"—I afterwards went back to his house, and found a large quantity of labels of various sorts, relating to different articles, some thousands; some for Floyd's custard powder.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that this was not a forgery at common law; there was no doubt that the making, or alteration of another man's instrument would be a forgery at common law, but the evidence in this case hardly supported that proposition; the mere uttering of the labels could be no prejudice to Mr. Bor<lb/>wick; they were only the vehicles in which certain powder was enclosed and passed off to the public; there was no evidence that the labels were uttered as genuine papers, but only that the powder was alleged to be Mr. Borwick's; if this was to be held a forgery, the same might be held as to any compound, per<lb/>fume, or article of manufacture which had become well known to the public, the name of which was almost synonymous with the article itself, as a "Brougham," or a "Wellington," or "Morison's Pills;" if there had been any patent for the article, it would be the subject matter of an injunction in Chancery, but it could hardly be held to be a subject for a criminal prosecution; as to the baking powder, there was a fatal variance between the original and that alleged to be a forgery; in the former, there were the words, "the public are requested to see that each packet is signed George Borwick, without which none are genuine;" in the latter those words were omitted; how, then, could that he said to be a forgery of Mr. Borwick's labels; to be a forgery it must bear such a resemblance as would impose upon persons of ordinary caution, which this was not calculated to do; as to the egg powder label, there was also a difference in type. The evidence amounted to no more than a making use of the name of Borwick to indicate the use of the powder, in the same way as the names of Brougham or Wellington would indicate the articles whose names they bore; in the case of Reg. v. Closs, the Court of Criminal Appeal had held that the writing upon a picture the name of "Linnell" was not a forgery, and that case was precisely similar to the present.</hi>

Closs; there was no difference between the packet of powder and the picture; the name of "Borwick" on the powder was a mere arbitrary mark of the maker, in the same way as the name of Linnell on the picture, or as the name of Mordan on a pencil, or Manton on a gun.</hi>

In leaving the case to the Jury, he stated that the question for them was, whether this was a document so framed as to be calculated to deceive persons of ordinary observation, and to make them believe that it was a genuine document, and whether the prisoner forged that paper, intending to defraud the different parties by so deceiving them.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer. On 5th Jan. I went to No. 16, Princes Square, St. George's in the East, with Mr. Sheffield—I found the prisoner there—I said to him, "My name is Brett, I am a police officer; I have come to see you respecting five cases that you obtained from the West India Docks on Christmas eve, by means of a forged order"—he said, "Shut the door, do not make a noise, I will tell you all about it; I am in a dreadful fix, if I had not been hard up I should not have done it: I have just left a respectable situation"—I said, "Are the boxes here?"—he said, "Yes," and he took from his trousers pocket which he was putting on, a key; he unlocked a large cupboard, pointed to three boxes, and said, "These are Captain Lloyd's, and there are the contents, pointing to different things which were in the cupboard and in the room; they were ladies' dresses, jewellery, a soda-water apparatus, and other things—I took the things up one by one, and he said of one, "That is mine," and of another thing he said, "That is Cap<lb/>tain Lloyd's"—I came to a musical box, which was standing on the drawers, and said, "Is that Captain Lloyd's?"—he said, "No, that is mine"—he took another key from his pocket, unlocked the box, and took out eight dupli<lb/>cates, which he handed to Mr. Sheffield; he said, "Four belong to property of my own, and these four," selecting them out, "belong to property belong<lb/>ing to Captain Lloyd; I wish to retract what I have said with respect to the musical box; that is Captain Lloyd's also"—I then removed him to Arbour Square Station, searched him, and found on him four shillings, a purse, a ring, and in his shirt three studs—I took them from him, and he said, "These belong to Captain Lloyd"—I went back to his room afterwards, and found there two papers; one is a note from the wharfinger: "I deliver this day to your order, five packages; the order is for six, but I have received but five"—the other is a shipping bill, and on the back is an indorsement, "James Barber and Co., per ship <hi rend="italic">Rangoon</hi>, four small chests of wearing apparel, Nos. 1 to 4, and two cases."</p>

From information I received, I watched the prosecutor's premises some few days, and on Monday, 18th Jan., about 2 o'clock, saw a waggon being loaded at their warehouse—I saw it leave; Paine drove it, he alone was in charge—I followed it; it went down Thames Street, as far as the Hour Glass public house, where Paine got down to obey a call of nature, got on again, and drove to the Steel Yard; he then got down again, and did something to the back of the waggon, as if he was fastening the tarpaulin; he then went to the front of the waggon, and Myland came from the front of the waggon, looked round, disappeared for about a minute, and returned with a cask of butter on his shoulder, and went into Mortimer's shop, No. 155, Thames Street—Steel Yard is about sixty or seventy yards from opposite Mortimer's shop—I went up Bush Lane, remained a few minutes, and when I came down, the waggon was gone—I looked into Mortimer's shop, but saw no one there—I communicated with one of the partners of the firm, Mr. White, who came back with me to Mortimer's shop—hewent in, came out again, and in consequence of what he said I went in with him, and he pointed out a cask of butter with a basket of herrings on it; before it was an empty cask with a piece of bacon on it—Mr. White said, "That cask of butter is my property"—I asked Mortimer if that was his name; he said, "Yes"—I told him that I was a detective police officer, and asked him how he accounted for the possession of that butter; he said, "A young man left it a short time ago, and is going to call for it in two or three</p>

I had been watching the prose<lb/>cutor's premises, for six weeks prior to the robbery—on 12th Jan., at 7 o'clock in the evening, I was in their warehouse, and saw Myland leave with other porters; they crossed the street, went into the Coal Exchange tavern, remained there a short time, came out, and went down St. Mary-at-Hill, and along Thames Street—Myland and another separated from the others at the steps leading on to London Bridge, and proceeded along Thames Street again to Calvert's tap house at the corner; they there waited half a minute, or perhaps a little more, and Mortimer came over to them out of his shop, and all three went into the public house—the other was a porter in the employment of the firm, named Glyde, I believe—they came out again, and Myland and Mortimer proceeded into Mortimer's shop, and the other porter followed after—they remained there ten or fifteen minutes, and then came out and went home—I took Paine on 18th Jan., between 4 and 5 o'clock, took him to the station, and searched him—afterwards, as I took him along Cannon Street to Bow Lane Station, I said, "How long has Myland been in the employ of your master?" he said, "About nine months"—I said, "Did you know him before he came to work there?" he said, "Yes, I knew him when he was a carman"—he afterwards said, "Well, it serves me right; I ought to have known better"—I afterwards went to Myland's house and took pos<lb/>session of certain things, which I have here.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 422). On 22d Dec. last, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening, I was on duty in the Mile End Road; it was the day after Christmas-day, what is called <hi rend="italic">Boxing</hi>-day—while I was in the Mile End Road I saw the prisoner Callagher; I saw him assault a man named M'Carthy—he struck him with his fist in the face and head—I saw McCarthy bleeding very much from the eyes, nose, and month—I took Callagher into custody for that assault on M'Carthy—this was in the Mile End Road—Callagher was rescued from me by some of the persons who were there, who are not in custody—I pursued him into Leslie Street, and there took him again; he resisted very much, and endeavoured to throw me on my back, and kicked me with his feet—the deceased Henry Morgan, a police constable, came up to my assistance at that time, in Leslie Street—he laid hold of Callagher on the right side, and I on the left—we then succeeded in taking him towards the station, as far as Jubilee Street—there was a large crowd following us as that time, I should say at least 100 persons—they did not interfere with us at all in Leslie Street, but when we got into Jubilee Street, the mob attempted to rescue Callagher; they endeavoured to pull him away from our custody—a very violent struggle took place between Callagher, myself, and Morgan; Callagher said he would not go to the station—there are some railings at the bottom of Leslie Street, which inter<lb/>cepted his progress—I overtook him there; he laid hold of those railings—thatwas before we got him from Leslie Street into Jubilee Street—it was in Jubilee Street that he said, "I will not go to the station"—at that time both Morgan and I had our staves out—we had our uniforms on; I had on my great coat, with my number on my collar—our staves were drawn in Leslie Street—while we were struggling in Jubilee Street, the prisoner Murphy came up—we were assailed by the mob with stones; I mean, they threw stones at us—Murphy laid hold of Callagher, and attempted to pull him away from us—after a very violent struggle we succeeded in getting him a little further towards the station, through Jubilee Street—then another</p>

               <p>struggle took place between Callagher, myself, and Morgan; Callagher again became very violent; another shower of stones was hurled at us by the mob, several of which hit us in the head and face—Morgan's hat was cut through by the stones—Callagher then said that he would not go any further, no two b----policemen should take him to the station house (this was in Jubilee Street)—he then struck Morgan with his fist, and hit him twice in the left eye, two following blows; they were very severe blows; the second blow caused Morgan to stagger—in consequence of that blow he let go of Callagher, and he said to me, "Mate, that is almost a <hi rend="italic">settler</hi>"—he said that to me in the presence of the prisoners—Murphy then laid hold of Callagher, and pulled him away, endeavouring to get him away from myself and Morgan—Morganhad let go of him after receiving the second blow in the eye, but took hold of him again directly—Murphy laid hold of Morgan's staff, and pulled him round in this position (sideways); he was standing with his back towards him at the time—Callagher dealt him several very heavy blows with his fist at the back of his head and neck—at that time Morgan's hat was off, I believe—I do not remember whether Morgan, after that, used his staff upon Callagher; I do not recollect—other constables then came up—after, Morgan was struck on the back of the head by Callagher, he received a blow at the back of the head from a stone, which cut through his hat—his hat had been put on again; at least, he had his hat on at that time.</p>

On the day in question, I was in private clothes—I went to the disturbance in Jubilee Street, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening—I found a mob of persons assembled, and should judge there were about 200 or 300—they were surrounding the constables and Callagher, some throwing stones, some trying to get the prisoner away from the constables—I did not see any stones used in handkerchiefs—I saw them, but did not see them used—I saw people in the mob with them in their hands—Isaw stones thrown at the constables; I could not say whether they struck them—when I got up, Callagher was lying on his back kicking and struggling, trying to get away—Morgan and Pillars had hold of him—I saw Callagher strike Morgan several times about the head and face with the fist—Idid not see Murphy do that—I did not see any struggle to get the staff out of the hands of any person—it was nearly over when I got up—a stretcher was procured, Callagher was fastened to it, and carried away—I had a staff with me; I drew it—after I struck Murphy he caught hold of my staff—I did not strike him until after he had struck me—he took me by the collar and struck me on the side of the head, and then I hit him with my staff—abrother constable came up and took him into custody—I got my staff away from him—I was struck by some of the stones—I got my head cut open, and likewise my nose; I do not know who did it; it was some of the mob—Ireceived a blow in the back with a stone tied up in a handkerchief, I believe, from Murphy, but I cannot prove it—I did not see him do it; he was behind me at the time—I was struck between the shoulders as I was in a leaning position—Murphy was the only man that was close to me at that time—I did not see whether he had any thing in his hand—they used very violent language to us.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at No. 9, Sykes Ter<lb/>race, Mile End Road. I saw the commencement of this affray; it was close to my house—I did not see M'Carthy assaulted by Callagher—I saw some of the affray previous to that—at the time that occurred they had moved away a little distance—when I came up the second time, Callagher had stopped at the bottom of Leslie Street, and was holding on to the railings to prevent his being taken on—he was at that time in the custody of Pillars and Morgan—hewent with them from Leslie Street into Jubilee Street—at that time time there was a great crowd surrounding them; I should think 100 persons at least—I followed and kept close to the constables—when they got into Jubilee Street I heard Callagher say that he would go no further, and he attacked both Pillars and Morgan with his fists successively; first Pillars, and afterwards Morgan; he struck them with his fists—I saw him strike Pillars several times; but Morgan only one blow, from which he staggered—that was a blow on the left side of the face or head—it was a severe direct blow with the fist, and it caused him to stagger back a pace or two, and let go his hold—Callagher immediately attacked Pillars again with his fists—Morgan came back to his assistance; he struck Callagher a severe blow on the top of the head with his staff—there were loose stones in Jubilee Street—the road had been mended some little distance further up—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185802010029"/>
               <p>directly Morgan had knocked Callagher down with the staff, the crowd flung the stones—the mob closed round on them and the stones were flung immedi<lb/>ately—thatwas the first I saw of the stones—I heard one of the stones strike Morgan on his hat—I saw a stone strike Pillars in the ear, and at the same moment I heard another strike Morgan on the hat—I was close to them then—Ithink the stone struck him on the front part of his hat—I did not see anything of Murphy at that time—shortly afterwards, when Callagher was on his legs again, he wrenched himself away from the custody of Morgan, and Venables took him into custody; then Murphy seized hold of Venables—thatwas the first I saw of Murphy—he seized Venables and endeavoured to rescue Callagher—other constables then came up and secured Callagher and Murphy.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside in High Street, Stepney, and am surgeon to that divison of the police. I had known the deceased for three or four years—Iwas called to see him on Thursday, 31st Dec., at his house, No.9, Wat<lb/>ney Street, Commercial Road—I found him lying in bed in a partial state of insensibility—I asked him what he complained of—I roused him with some little difficulty; he wag in a state of stupor; he muttered, rather than spoke, that he had pain in his head, and he kept putting his hand to the left side of his head, and to the back of his head—I was not at that time aware that any violence had been done to him—I looked at the pupils of his eyes, one was contracted, and the other dilated, that indicated pressure on the brain—I con<lb/>sidered him in a dangerous state—I attended him twice daily, until he died, which was on the Saturday following, 2d Jan.; he never rallied—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on the 4th—I found a black mark over the left eye—Iexamined carefully all the outer portion of the scalp, and found no other marks of violence, except the blackness over the eye—I then opened the head, and examined to see if there were any bruised marks, but there were none; there were no marks of violence there—I examined the dura mater, the vessels of which were very much congested—I found an escape of about two teaspoons full of black blood from the back part of the head—I did not see any lesion of any vessel from which that blood had escaped—I then exa<lb/>mined the arachnoid, or second membrane of the brain; I found it inflamed and vascular, with deposits of pus, or matter, on the surface of the mem<lb/>brane—Ishould think those deposits must have been made within a few days, or, perhaps, a few hours of his death—I consider they were sufficient to account for death—I believe the effusion of blood came from the vessels of the pia mater—that also was sufficient to cause death—the substance of the brain was healthy, but I found fluid in the lateral ventricles; that was not material, it would result from the inflammation of the membranes—I should say that the inflammation was recent—I opened the chest and examined the heart; it was somewhat flabby, and there were considerable adhesions of the pericardium to the heart—I consider they were of some standing, they were firm; I am not aware that those adhesions would indicate anything particular; I should say they would not account at all for the state of the head, the man having been perfectly healthy up to the time of the accident; the state of the heart was in no way due to the adhesions, they may have existed from birth; it is impossible for any one to say—I think that very severe blows on the head would tend to produce congestion of the vessels of the brain, and inflammation of the membranes of the brain, such as I found—I think that blows which left no external mark might cause the appearances I found; it is quite possible that the effusion at the back of the head might have arisen from the rupture of a small vessel at the time the blow was given, although</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185802010030"/>
               <p>that blow might leave no mark; a small vessel might have been ruptured, and a slow effusion taken place, without preventing the deceased from doing his duty; that might be so until the blood had sufficiently accumulated to cause pressure on the brain, and cause death—the state of insensibility in which I first saw him, was quite consistent with that process going on; it was consistent with any pressure on the brain—I had known him for three or four years; he has called at my surgery on various occasions, and to the best of my recollection it was for pains in the head and for indigestion; he had medicine—that was three or four years ago; I had not seen him for the last three years, he made no further application to me; it would be my duty to see him, as surgeon to that part of the force—I gave him some medicine on that occasion, and from that time until his death I did not attend him professionally once—I believe his age was twenty-five or twenty-six, he was a very fine, tall, robust man.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The proximate cause of death was the pus and the effusion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the first I heard of this affray was from his wife, when I was called to see him first; I inquired what was the cause of his being in that state, and the cause of the blow over the eye, and his wife then told me of this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Hurley, of No. 125, Rosemary Lane. I know the prisoner and his wife—On the afternoon of 28th Dec. I was in Rosemary Lane with a child in my arms coming up towards my own door; a woman came up and asked me whether it was my child, I said, "Yes"—she said, God help me, I had enough to do—I was just telling her that I had buried a fine girl, when another woman came up and struck me—thenthe soldier came up, put up his cane, and said, "Don't, mistress," or "mother, don't strike the woman, with a baby in her arms"—then the crowd all gathered away from me, and I could not tell what happened for a good bit—the soldier who lifted up his cane did not strike any body that I could see—I do not know not know whether any body struck him or not, at that time, not till a good bit afterwards—I saw one blow given by the prisoner on the soldier—I could not tell where he came from—he was close to the soldier at the time he struck—he struck him with a hammer on the head—I saw him put up his hand—I only saw one cane—I do not rightly know whether the other soldier had one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You are not sure, I believe, whether the prisoner threw the hammer, or struck—so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of my belief the hammer was in his hand, but I could not rightly tell you—I am not quite sure whether he threw it or not—I am not a friend of theirs, I am quite a stranger there—I am a poor woman that has five children, and nobody but God Almighty and myself to provide for them—I do not go about begging; I would not let my children go without, if I had nothing to give them—I do not go about regularly every day as a beggar—I do not support myself almost entirely by begging—I have got a little boy, and some days he will bring me a half crown, and some days not a shilling—I do not send him out begging; he goes out shoe cleaning—I do not live with my husband; he left me three months ago, the Monday after my little girl was buried, and where he went to I cannot tell; I was a good wife to him—I dare say the policeman in this case has been talking to me about this matter; he has spoken to me twice about what I had to say—I did not wish to come up here against the prisoner, because they are a <hi rend="italic">long tailed</hi> family, and I am afraid of my life every day; I would rather not have had any thing to do with it—I did not go to the prisoner's house two days after this, and begin drinking with his wife; I do not know where his house is, and never was there in my life—I have not been repeatedly drinking with his wife since this occurrence—I can not say I have never done so.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman H</hi> 153). From information I received on 4th Jan., I took the prisoner into custody in Royal Mint Street—I told him I wanted him for assaulting a soldier on the 28th Dec., against the Clock House</p>

               <p>public house—at that time the deceased was living—he said he was not there, and knew nothing of it—I saw Tarbett next day at Windsor barracks, or hospital—I took the prisoner down to Windsor on the 5th, and Tarbett made a deposition before a Magistrate—the prisoner heard what he said, and had an opportunity of cross-examining him—I saw the Magistrate append his signature to it; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I did not see Tarbett after he was dead—on 5th Jan., while we were at the hospital, the prisoner told me that the deceased struck his mate's wife, and he got a cut with the hammer, and he gave it to him—thosewere the words he used, to the best of my recollection. (<hi rend="italic">The deposition of David Tarbett was read as follows:</hi>—"I am a private in the 2d battalion of the Scotch Fusileer Guards, stationed—I was on three days leave, from Thursday, 24th Dec. last—I went to London—on Monday, 28th Dec. last, I was in Rosemary Lane, near the Tower of London—I was going home towards Queen Street—Robert Steele, a private in the same battalion, was with me—Isaw two women fighting; one woman was striking another with a child in her arms—Steele interfered with them to quiet them, and a man went to strike him—I stepped forward to protect my comrade, Steele, and was trying to get him away, when some man behind me struck me on the side of the head with a hammer; the blow made me insensible—there was a great crowd round the man now present—Patrick Riley is very like the man who struck me, but I cannot positively swear to him."</p>

                  </hi>. I am battalion surgeon to the Fusilier Guards at Windsor—Tarbett was admitted to the hospital on 2d Jan.—he was in a state of partial insensibility—I examined his head; I found a wound there nearly healed—from the symptoms, I considered it necessary to enlarge the wound, and I then discovered a fracture of the skull—after the operation of trephining was performed he recovered his sensibility—he continued to do well until within two days of his decease, when he became worse, and died on 26th Jan.—in my judgment a blow from a hammer would cause the appearances I found on the skull, and that blow would cause death—the injury to the skull was the cause of death—I examined the head after death—I was present at the examination by the Magistrate—I saw this policeman there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> On what day did you perform the operation of tre<lb/>phining? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the day of his admission, the 2d Jan.—I do not know what course of living he adopted from the time of the injury to the time of his admission—he was at Windsor—It would have been possible for him to recover from such an injury without any operation at all, supposing he had lived carefully and had abstained from drinking—the operation of trephining is one of the very last resort; it is an operation which is mostly fatal—I did not think, at the time this operation was performed, that it was one attended with very considerable danger to the patient; but I considered that the case was one of imminent danger, and had not the patient been operated upon he would have died—it is an operation which is frequently fatal; it would be doubly dangerous, and most probably end mortally, if he had been out drink<lb/>ing previously; that would add to the danger—he died from abscess; that is a common result of inflammation—he died on 26th Jan.—that would be twenty-four days subsequent to the operation—I am able to state that death did not proceed from the operation—the abscess was seated some distance from the seat of the operation.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you believe he could possibly have recovered if you had not resorted to that treatment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not.</p>

               <p>any opinion that he had not lived carefully, or that he had been drinking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am ignorant of that; it was a question of possibility, put to me, as I understood; the injury to the skull might possibly have been cured without trephining, and, with that view, abstinence from drink and careful living would have been necessary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PLATT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not that part of the skull which was struck by this instrument particularly thin for a man of that age? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was thinner than is usually met with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Bearing in mind that particular condition of his head, would a light or trifling blow have inflicted the injury, or must it have been a blow given with violence, or with an instrument of some weight? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think the blow must have been given with violence, or if the instrument was thrown, it must have been thrown with force.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jobbing whitesmith. The prisoner occa<lb/>sionally works at No. 124, Royal Mint Street—on the afternoon in question, about 3 o'clock, I was coming home, by way of Tower Hill, and saw a crowd of people, and a party of women fighting outside No. 124, Royal Mint Street—Iremained some little time on the opposite side of the way, looking on—afterbeing there a few minutes, I saw two soldiers coming along, the witness Steele was one of them, Tarbett was the other—one of them said, "Oh! here is a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>; let us come over"—they crossed over the road; Steele had a cane, I did not see one with Tarbett—Steele said to one of the women that was fighting, "Don't be fighting old woman, or hurt the child"—the woman told him to go away, and mind his own business; and I dare say she said something more unpleasant to him, which I did not exactly hear; but he struck her two or three times over the head and face—I saw that—I cannot exactly say which of the three women it was; there were three of them in it, the prisoner's wife, the witness Hurley, and another, the wife of a man named Maloney—the prosecutor's mate, struck her two or three times over the head and face with the cane, and she pushed him—her husband was coming out, and made way to get between them, and Steele took off his belt and struck Maloney in the face with it—Tarbett had his belt on, I believe, I did not see it taken off; Maloney then thought to strike Steele, but he got out of the crowd—Tarbett got very much excited at seeing his comrade about to be struck, and he laid hold of the prisoner's wife, and struck her in the face—I saw that—she fell, and called out, "Murder!" and for the protection of her husband—Riley appeared to be at work inside the shop, he came out imme<lb/>diately after his wife called out; he had a hammer in his hand; it was a small hammer, apparently about a few ounces weight, somewhere about a foot long, with a small head—he flung it at the deceased, I cannot say that I saw it strike him, though I saw him put his hand up to his head—that was all I saw.</p>

On Friday 15th Jan. about 1 o'clock, I was at the New Cattle Market, with a mare and cart, which was marked with chalk "For sale" at the back and the side—shortly after I had been there Hunt asked me what I wanted for the horse and cart, I said, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he bade 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I ultimately agreed to take—heleft me to find the man who wanted it—after the market was over, Wedge and Hunt came to me together, and Hunt said that he would take me to the man's house that wanted the horse and cart—he jumped up into the</p>

               <p>cart, and we all three went on—on the road Wedge said, "You stop here; I will buy your horse and cart of you"—he told me to stop at a public house about a mile from the market, and said that he would buy it, if I would give him a stamped receipt for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he would give me the rest of the money when he got home, but I refused—he drove on again to the Cranes public house, I do not know the name of the street—he wanted to pay me 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. there, and gave me a stamped receipt, and wished me to drink, but I declined, and we all three drove on—he then said that, if I went back to the Cranes, he would buy it of me—we went there, and Crawley left the house, and said he would bring somebody who would buy the horse and cart—we all three went in, and left the horse and cart outside—Hunt then went out, and said he would bring somebody in who would buy it, leaving Wedge and me together in the public house—he returned in six or seven minutes with Flinn and Crawley—Crawleycame to me, and said that he would buy the horse and cart of me—theyall went out together to look at the horse—Crawley offered 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., if I would give him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. discount, which I agreed to—he wanted me to take a deposit and bring the rest of the money in the morning—Hunt said it was all right, that Flinn and Crawley were cattle dealers from the country—Flinn said of Crawley, "He is my brother," and that he lived at Stamford Hill, and could not go there for money, but I was to come in the morning—I did not agree to that, and was going to leave with my horse and cart, and Hunt said that he would take me to the man that wanted to buy the horse—we all went to Union Street, Bishopgate—the man he took me to there looked like a Jew; he bade 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it; I refused that—Crawley and Flinn said that they would buy it, if I went back to the three Cranes—we all went back there, and went inside; Wedge and Crawley went out, and left Hunt, Flinn, and me in the house—Flinn said that he could not get the money, would I give him my direction, and he would come down to my house in the morning for the horse—he borrowed a pen and ink of the landlord, and asked some person to write the direction as I could not write—my direction was written down, and Flinn took it—I was going home, but was stopped at the door by a party who <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me in, and when I did get out, the horse and cart were gone—Huntand Flinn remained, but I saw nothing of the other two after that—I ran out and made a communication to Policeman, H 105—the cart was found in the Green Yard, but I have not found the mare.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Gray Searle, artist and surveyor, of No. 4, Bloomsbury Place. On 2d Jan., between 10 and 11 o'clock, I closed the water closet window and bolted the lobby door—next morning I found that the window had been opened, and it had never been open before, being stuck by paint—the marks in it correspond with this instrument—that would make an opening big enough for a man to get in—a towel in the water closet, which had been hanging up, I found in the wash-hand basin, and the soap dish and soap were put into it—the door leading into the lobby, which I had bolted, had been opened—there were marks of gravel on the seat, and marks of three fingers on the window inside.</p>

On Saturday night, 2d Jan., I was with the deceased in Nicol Square; the prisoner's wife and the deceased's wife were there also—we had been to the theatre together—the deceased asked the prisoner to get him some beer, and gave him the money—the prisoner said, "I do not think I can get any beer; I have got a drop of rum in my pocket"—the prisoner was a little in liquor—after a time, we all went to the prisoner's house—there was some little quarrelling there about the rum, and after a word or two that O'Neal said, there was a proposal to fight—whenwe first got into the house, the prisoner put the rum on the table—Richardsonthrew down a penny, and said, as there was a quartern of rum, that would pay for it; with that the prisoner took up the rum, and put it into his pocket, and said he would take it away with him—the deceased said, "Don't take it away, as you have brought it here; let us drink it"—the prisoner put it into his pocket, and said he would—the deceased said, if he did, he would break it in his pocket—the prisoner said he would bet him a sovereign he would not break it, and if he attempted it, he would put such a man as him up the chimney; he said there was some little animosity between them—Richardson said, "I did not know it; if there is, let us come out and settle it"—with that he took off his coat, and went out into the square—the prisoner ran to the fireplace, and caught hold of the tongs; they were taken from him by Mrs. Richardson—Richardson said, "Come out, if you are a man"—the prisoner then caught hold of the fire shovel, and that was taken away from him; then the wives of both men advised the prisoner to go up stairs, which he did, into Mrs. Mann's room—the deceased called two or three times to him to come down like a man, if there was any animosity between them—the deceased then went up stairs; he found all in darkness, and he called for a light—they would not take him one, and he came down for one—he got a light, and went up stairs with it; I went with him, and directly he opened the door, he was struck; I did not exactly see what with, but I saw fire irons of some sort—nothing was said by the deceased at that time, that I heard—I saw him afterwards; he was bleeding very much—he was helped down stairs by three women, and was afterwards taken to Bartholomew's Hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. The deceased was brought there about a quarter to 1 o'clock in the morning of 3d Jan.—he had a scalp wound about two inches and a half long, by an inch broad, a little to the left of the middle line of the head—upon introduc<lb/>ing my finger, I found that the bone of the skull had been depressed and was exposed—those portions of bone which were depressed and fractured were afterwards removed; symptoms of inflammation of the membranes of the brain set in, and a constant discharge of brain from the wound took place, and he died of convulsions on the 24th—I afterwards inspected the head; it simply corroborated what I have stated; I have no doubt of the cause of death—a blow from such an instrument as this produced would be very likely to pro<lb/>duce such a wound.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi> 230). On the evening of 18th Dec. I was in Skinner Street, Snow Hill—I saw a white bull coming in a direction from Smithfield, down Snow Hill; it went down Skinner Street into Far<lb/>ringdon Street; Harper, the drover, was following it; it was trotting; a large crowd was following—they did not do any thing to it, or touch it—therewere no dogs following it—I went after it—when it got into Farringdon Street it tossed a woman; it then turned up Stonecutter Street into Far<lb/>ringdon Market, and went into Mr. Child's livery stables—at that time, Wheatley, another constable, came up—the bull turned into the yard of the livery stables, and then to the right through a passage about eighteen feet long and four feet wide, and then into a harness room, which is about sixty feet long—I saw it in the harness room; it was not doing anything there; it was standing perfectly quiet—there were two or three men there in the employ of Mr. Child, I believe—there is a division which runs down the centre of the harness room, upon which they hang the harness, and there was some hanging there then—two of the men, in their shirt sleeves, stood on the top of this division, just over the bull—they had got long poles in their hands, and they were striking it with a view of turning it out—Mr. Child was there likewise; he had a stick in his hand, and he called to the men several times to turn the thing out, and they struck it—Harper, the drover, was there—I told Mr. Child that if he turned it out he would be responsible for any thing that might be done after, as it was then perfectly safe, and that a conveyance would be there in a very few minutes to take it away—he was likewise told the same by the other con<lb/>stable—hesaid he did not care a d—for the conveyance or any thing else, he would not have it there—I should say it was about ten minutes in the harness room; I cannot say exactly—they succeeded in driving it out, and, as it was turning out, he struck it three or four times himself; it was then turned out into Stonecutter Street—it ran out through the passage, through the yard, into Stonecutter Street, up Stonecutter Street to Shoe Lane, and there it knocked two or three people down—I saw it knock them down—I told Mr. Child, before he turned it out, that it had injured several persons, and he had better let it remain as it was, until we could take it away—when it had gone out, he laughed very heartily at it, and said it was a fine <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>—heseemed to enjoy it very much—after it was gone they shut the outer gates—if they had shut them while the bull was inside, it would have remained there and been perfectly safe—there is a door on the right hand side of the passage, and I thought that door would close across, but I found that I could not succeed in doing that—it is a sliding door, and finding I could not do that, I called upon them to close the outer gate—they said they should do</p>

I drove four bulls from the New Cattle Market—the white bull in question was one of them—they went on all right and straight till we came to about the middle of the new street that runs into Farringdon Street—a little dog flew out and set off the white bull—that was the first starting of it—the bull started off, I was not able to overtake it—I next saw it in Mr. Child's yard, in Stonecutter Street—he was in a little turning on the right hand side, I do not know what they call it, a ride, or a loose stall; he was standing very quiet when I got there—the moment I got there I sent a young <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> for a conveyance to Mr. Bruce's, in Fox and Knot Yard, which is a little distance from there—I told Mr. Child to let the bull stop there until the conveyance came, and said I had sent for a conveyance—he took the stick out of my hand, and whether he turned him out, or one of his men, I will not swear—he said he was not going to have the b—bull there to tear his things about—the bull did not show any symptoms of tearing the things about—I heard the policeman ask him to let it remain there—he said he was not going to have the bull there, and the bull came out, and directly after that he turned to the corner of Shoe Lane—the moment the bull was out, the gate was slammed to—I saw the bull turn the corner of Stonecutter Street—he knocked a young man down named Greenwood—he turned up a narrow court, and that was the last I saw of him, for I went to Smithfield station with the policeman—the bull was a very few minutes in the stable.</p>

I was standing on the pavement near my shop—I saw a mob of persons coming, and then I saw a bullock turn the corner of Stone<lb/>cutter Street—I saw it knock a man down in Shoe Lane; it then walked past our shop, and walked up King's Head Court, a narrow court—about half way up he attacked a woman, and felled her to the ground—it then walked through the court into Gough Square; the deceased was coming through the square, turning an angle from a court in Fleet Street, and came right in front of the bull, and the bull tossed him directly against the wall—Iassisted him on to a step, and then followed the bull to the bottom of White<lb/>friars Street, where it was secured, and put into a conveyance.</p>

I told the prisoner that he ought to do his work in a proper way, because that would be to the advantage of himself and his master—I said so because the master looks to me for the proper execution of the work—the prisoner said that I intended to put him out of work—I said, no, I did not intend to do any such thing, or I should apply to the boiler or to the master—I then went up to the roof to make an air hole, and when I came down, the prisoner took up the candlestick, and knocked my head, and pulled me by my hair, and the blood gushed out—he struck me more than once; I got so many blows from him that I do not know how many—he made no threat to me before I went up stairs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of No. 5, Great George Street, West<lb/>minster, and medical officer to the workhouse. I saw the child on the morning after it came in; it was in a very emaciated and deplorable state, covered with sores all over it's body, which conveyed to me the impression that it was the result of neglect, not of disease—it was always under the care of one of the nurses, and I prescribed for it daily, but it did not want medicine, only food—I gave it all the food I thought right—it had arrowroot and brandy—it rallied for a little while—it did not gain flesh at all, but it seemed to have more power—it died on the 11th, and I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examina<lb/>tion—theblood vessels of the brain were rather congested; the ventricles of the brain were full of serum; the cavities of the heart contained a very small quantity of fluid blood; the pericardium, or membrane surrounding the heart, also contained some serous fluid—the lungs were perfectly healthy, and also the liver, stomach, and intestines—the small mesenteric vessels, which are often in a state of disease which produces wasting, were very little enlarged, but they were somewhat larger than the proper size; I do not think that material—the omentum covering the intestines, which should have a good deal of fat, was entirely transparent; the musoles were very pallid—there was really no cellular tissue between the flesh and the skin, and the whole body was in a very emaciated condition—the heart having that very small quantity of blood indicated extreme want of power and debility—I think the child died from want—there was effusion of water on the ventricles of the brain—there was no evidence of any disease to cause death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> In addition to those symptoms, was the child affected with diarrhoea? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it had in the beginning, but it subsided—much mental anxiety or bodily toil would affect the mother's milk, both in quality and quantity—a child suckled with milk which did not give the proper degree of nutriment would sink—when a child is partly suckled by the mother and</p>

               <p>partly fed by biscuits, diarrhoea frequently follows, and it would lead to further mischief if there be a predisposition to disease—I have frequently met with cases in the higher walks of life when, in consequence of a child being partly fed and partly suckled, a disordered state has arisen—there are cases in which, however great the supply of milk may be, it is of such a quality as not to agree, and disease ensues.</p>

PLATT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If this was the case, and disease ensued, would you not find something after death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, you would find the mesenteric glands very much enlarged, and the liver in an unhealthy condition; that was not the case here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would the liver be enlarged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would not be healthy, but studded with tumours the same as the lungs—the effusion which I found in the brain might have commenced before it came in, or it might have begun to take place before the remedial measures were taken, as, during the nine days it was in the workhouse, it had every thing which my skill could suggest—thestomach often retains it's integrity after symptoms in the brain have commenced—starvation produces effusion on the brain, because the powers are so feeble that the whole of the tissues and fat get absorbed; that supply ceasing, the functions give way, and you get effusion; it is a deficiency of power—I think the symptoms might be produced by starvation and want, and yet the appetite continue—those symptoms would not prevent the food from nourishing—the mischief was done before I saw the child—all I could do would not give it real power—there was some diarrhoea, and that would interfere with the nourishment; it was, undoubtedly, better for what I gave it.</p>

PLUMTREE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the difference between starvation from want of food and starvation from emaciation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Every parent could find a remedy for starvation from want of food—I have seen a child reduced to such an extreme state as this boy was, through the nourishment of the mother not agreeing, and they not liking to have a nurse; in that case a healthy wet nurse becomes indispensible—I cannot undertake to say that the symptoms I found were the result of neglect, but it looked like a case of neglect—there was nothing scrofulous about the sores—there was nothing in the heart to indicate disease, but it was small, empty, and had been acting feebly—I found nothing to account for cough and irritation of the chest; the lungs were healthy—it's head was dirty and sore, but it had not scald head.</p>

"she said, "It is cutting it's teeth;" she did not come to look at it during the eight days—I was obliged to go and look after her; I told her the child was very ill, and I could not keep it, for I had four of my own; and she said that she would come for it, but she sent another person, and I never saw the baby afterwards—she gave as a reason for not coming, that she had no money to pay me, as she had no work; I do not think she had—she does not live or work near me—on that I went to the parish and got an order there, and met the mother, and told her what I had done—the order was to take it into the house, but she told me if I would take it, she would pay me, and she sent for the child—it had proper food while with me; bread and milk, tea, and potatoes—I gave it enough of food, but it seemed so craving that it never seemed satisfied—it did not seem ill when with me, or to want a doctor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Flowers, a surgeon, of Camberwell Green. On 2d Jan., about a quarter to 1 o'clock in the morning, I was called to the police station, and found Batchelor bleeding profusely from five wounds, two in the back of the neck, one of which penetrated to the bone, one on the right ear, and two on the right cheek, one of which was about half an inch deep, cutting through the cheek—they were clean cut wounds, such as this knife would inflict—if he had not been of a good constitution, and in good health at the time, erysipelas might have come on, and terminated fatally—I have attended him ever since, and shall have to do so, probably, a fortnight longer.</p>

Sir,—Having consulted our correspondent of Liverpool, we have the honour to inform you, that we should wish you to send us, as samples of your manufactory, two hunting guns, one of 180 francs, the other of 150 francs. We should like to receive these two guns by the steamer, which leaves Antwerp for London on the 18th of this month. We leave to you to put your name upon these samples or not. Please to take particular notice of the fact, that our orders will be of a considerable amount, if these articles answer our expectations, and offer real advantages. T. Thompson, Davis, and Co.

Sir,—We received this morning an answer from Mr. Paterson, of Liverpool, who informs us that he is very much satisfied with your samples, and that if you continue to furnish us in the same satisfactory way, you may rest assured of our future orders. The gun of 180 francs is perfect in all particulars, but that of 125 francs is still more convenient for us, because we find it very profitable. Only one observation for our future orders, this is, that it would be preferable if the cap could be placed when the hammer is at the stop. These guns, as we told you before, will be used for exportation; and, therefore, it will be necessary that they are as showy as possible. And, as these samples are about to be sent to different places in the United States, have the kindness to send us, by the <hi rend="italic">Dolphin</hi>, which leaves Antwerp on 1st Nov., three guns of 125 francs each, of the same kind as that which which we have received. We beg you to send them, with urgency, at that date, as the vessel which is to take away these guns sails on 5th Nov. next from Liverpool for Boston.

Thompson, Davis, and Co. To Mr. Montigney, Bruxelles.")—Inconsequence of this letter I sent three guns by the steamer which left Antwerp on 1st Nov., dircted to T. Thompson, Davis, and Co., No. 8, Hunt<lb/>ley Street, Tottenham Court Road—I received this letter E—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Lon<lb/>don,3d Nov., 1857. Sir,—We received, in due time your letter of the 1st instant, by which you send us the three guns we had ordered of you. Unfor<lb/>tunately, the two guns of 115 francs each cannot suit us, as we find a great difference with the one of 125 francs, which we received in the first sending. What we want is, three guns of the same price, manufactory, and quality. And as you mentioned in your letter that you have some of them, but not finished, you would oblige us greatly by furnishing two of these arms for the 10th instant, the latest, because we were not able to send the others we received from you before to our correspondent at Liverpool, for the reason and excuse that they were not similar to them of 125 francs. It is quite true, Sir, what you say, that we ought to give you more time; but it is absolutely necessary that these samples should be, on the 14th instant, at Liverpool, to to be shipped on the 15th for America. We hope, Sir, that you will not fail to send us these guns for the 10th instant, as this is a matter of importance as regards the two guns. Signed, T. Thompson, Davis, and Co. Mr. Mon<lb/>tigny, Bruxelles. Please to add, if agreeable to you, your invoice of 365 francs to this one.")—I did not send two guns in consequence of this letter—thewords, T. Thompson, Davis, and Co., importers of foreign goods, and purveyors to the Queen, were on all the letters—the address of Tonbridge Place is not on the letter of the 14th Oct.—I tore the words, T. Thompson, Davis, and Co. off, and sent them to Mr. Speilman, in London—they could not find the address, and to show them that I was right, I cut them off and sent them.</p>

I saw the board at his place four or five months afterwards—I did not make any remonstrance about it—this is my letter to the prisoner on 3d Nov.: "We have forwarded a parcel of invoices which we request you to use."—I should say it was not the first direction we gave the prisoner that he was not to use the other bill heads—I must have told him it was wrong—I will not swear that I had—we got those papers printed in the country that we sent up on 3d Nov.—we never sent any before—I have no recollection of seeing one of the prisoner's circulars—I know it was early in Dec. that we heard of some defalcation—I should say I was early as the 1st of Dec, this letter of the 24th of Dec. is my writing—</p>

On Tuesday morning, 19th Jan., between 1 and 2 o'clock, I went into Barne's coffee house—I saw Burgess, Tugwell, and Hillier there—I also saw Smith there, but not in their company when I left—when I first saw the other three they were in the court—I met them, and they went into the coffee shop—they had nothing with them at that time—they went out, and came in again in about ten minutes with a bundle—Mrs. Langston's is only about twenty-five or twenty-six yards from the coffee shop—Hillier carried the bundle as far as the door, and then Tugwell took it away from her, and took it in—I remained there about a quarter of an hour—Smith went out before me—I did not see him come in again—the bundle I saw was tied up in a hand<lb/>kerchief—Isaw it when it was all loose; it contained a black gown and white linen—Smith was in a separate box from the others, opposite—he was there when they first went in—he went out just before them—he was not there when they came in the second time, I did not see him.</p>

About half past 1 o'clock on Tuesday morn<lb/>ing,19th Jan., I was at Barnes'coffee shop, Lambeth Walk—I saw Burgess, Tugwell, and a woman there; I saw them come in, one of them had a bundle—Smithwas in there, in the opposite box, when they came in—I had been there from 10 o'clock; I was only sitting there—I saw Tugwell go over to Smith at his box, and Burgess also, they both went over to him—they were by him for about five minutes—after they came back from him they opened the bundle—I did not see what was in it—at the time it was opened, <hi rend="italic">Polly</hi> Cane and Adams were also there; I had seen them before, I have known Adams about Lambeth for the last four years—when the bundle was opened, Hillier, Cane, and Adams, put portions of it under their shawls, and went out—after a little time they all three came back, and sat down in the same box, and then they went out again—they did not take any refreshment.</p>
