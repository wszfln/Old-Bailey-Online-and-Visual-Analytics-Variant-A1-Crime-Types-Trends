On 18th May, about a quarter to ten o'clock at night, I was on duty on the South-quay, London-docks, where casks of brandy were lying—I saw the prisoner crouching between the casks, and heard a rippling of liquid in the water—I turned my light on him and asked what he was after—he made no answer—I pulled him away, and heard a rattling like a piece of tin—I said, "You are at the brandy," and pulled him on to the pavement—I saw Luton take a tankard with brandy in it from the same spot.</p>

On Tucday, 16th May, I had some binders' tools—I missed them on Friday morning, on going to my workshop, with six volumes of "Shakspere," a pattern volume of the "British Essayist," and one volume of the "Statutes," of 1843—they were then in an unfinished state—I have since seen one of my tools—I had not used it for two months before—I know it because, two years ago, I broke the shank off it in putting it into a handle, and I have a book here with the impres<lb/>sion of the tool upon it—I discovered some of the books at Mr. Weddell's shop on 24th May—these produced are them—they are a portion of those I lost—Thomas's brother occupied a room above me, and he brought the prisoner into my workshop the evening before the robbery, and said he was going to give up business, and was going into a situation, and wished to know whether I would buy his tools; but I did not want any—the value of the books I lost is about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the tools—would sell for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I could not replace them for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my workshop is part of Mr. Noble's house—the entrance to it is in Star-court, by a street-door open to all the lodgers.</p>

To the Inspector of Police, Fleet-street Station. Sir, In the case of William Thomas, who was taken into custody last Saturday morning, he will find those he wants at No. 70, Noble-street, Goswell-street, on the second-floor back-room, and most likely some of the property stolen. The party not in custody not wishing to suffer for the guilty, makes this state<lb/>ment conscientiously, knowing the same to be true. The purchaser of the books has perjured himself most grossly, as will be proved by confronting him with the above persons, having dealt with the female, to the writer's knowledge, several times before, knowing it to have been stolen. Descrip<lb/>tion—one man, 5ft. oin. in height, fair, slim built, plumber by trade—second; a woman, much taller than the man, dark complexion, slim built, narrow face, and long nose—third; John Reed, stout built, about 5ft. 8in., lives somewhere about Percival-street, Clerkenwell, uses the Champion public-house, in Goswell-road.

                  </hi>. I am a letter-carrier in the General Post-office, and have been so four years and a quarter—I was employed at the Stepney-branch office—the prisoner was a letter-carrier also employed there—on 19th May, about eight in the morning, we were both there in the course of our duty—he was engaged at a table sorting the letters that had come that morning from the General Post-office—I was at my own desk, that did not command a view of his situation—after the letters were sorted, he brought some to his desk, to throw them off into walks for delivery—I then sat immediately opposite to him—I saw him throw a letter upon a few old or dead letters, which were on the desk—I heard something <hi rend="italic">jingle</hi> when the letter fell—it sounded like money—he threw it with the seal uppermost, and I saw that it was sealed with red wax—I then saw him take more dead and old letters from his side pocket, throw them on this letter, and then put the whole lot into his left coat pocket—as he was taking them up I noticed a large figure "4" on this letter in red ink—he then said to me, "Basely, I have nothing to give up this morning "—meaning no dead letters to go to the Dead-office—in about four minutes he went out of the office to deliver his letters—a letter addressed to Grove-road, Mile-end-road, would not be in his walk, but in Paveley's—on the prisoner's going out, I went to Mr. Cham<lb/>berlain, the inspector of the district, and made a communication to him, and in about three minutes the prisoner was brought back to the office—Mr. Chamberlain asked him to show him the letters he had in his pocket—he produced nine old and dead letters from his pocket—Mr. Chamberlain asked me whether the letter I had spoken of was among them I said "No"—he then asked the prisoner whether he had any more in his possession—he said, "No"—Mr. Chamberlain said he must see further, and was about to put his hand into the prisoner's pocket, when the prisoner put his own hand in and pulled out this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is the letter which 1 had previously seen—I said so—it was sealed with red wax, and the figure '"4" was on it—</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. Did a similar letter to this one, with money, come monthly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It used to come frequently—I cannot say whether monthly or weekly—it was a well-known writing, and known to contain money—we have marked divisions for each walk to sort the letters into, and we take ourletters out of those boxes—they are sent from the General Post-office in agreat bag tied up in large bundles—they are then untied and sorted, and placed in the boxes according to the districts—each carrier takes a bundle and unties it—the bundle may contain letters for his walk and for others also—I saw Baseley there that morning—he was not very near to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then it is not extraordinary for a letter-carrier, while sorting, before he gets to his desk, to have in his hand letters for sorting which do not belong to his walk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It sometimes happens by mistake—the letters come in packets of 200 or 300, not sorted.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of letter-carriers at the Stepney Post-office—the prisoner has been employed there some time—his district was Limehouse—I know Baseley—I was present when the prisoner left that morning—a communication was made to me about two minutes after that, I sent for him back again—he returned—I told him that it had been intimated to me that he had a letter that did not belong to him—he said he had not—I requested him to let me see what letters he had—he took nine dead letters out of his side-coat pocket, and told me that was all he had—they do not carry letters for delivery in their pockets, but these were dead ones—I did not ask to see the bag—I asked Baseley if he saw the letter that he spoke about among those—he said, "No," and I said to the prisoner, "I must see further," and was in the act of putting my hand into his left-hand coat pocket, when he put his own hand in, and took out this letter—I asked him how it was he had that—he said he did not know he had it—it was sealed—I told him he must go with me to the General Post-office, and I took him to the president, Mr. Sculthorpe, in whose presence he was further searched—a letter addressed as this is would not belong to his delivery, and he had no right to have it—he would have the opportunity of taking such a letter while sorting—there is no particular bundle for each man to sort, but each of them take a bundle from the bag, for the purpose of sorting into the different districts—this letter ought to have gone to the Mile End district—the prisoner would have no right to have such a letter about him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. Supposing a person took out dead letters on his walk he would return them at the end of the day, if the parties to whom they were directed, were not forthcoming? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That would be his duty—they ought to be given up every hour, and taken out every hour—the letter was in his uniform coat pocket, which is a large pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am President of the London Dis<lb/>trict Post-office. The prisoner was brought by Mr. Chamberlain to the General Post-office on 19th May—Mr. Chamberlain in his presence told me he had a letter in his pocket containing money, and that when he was asked to produce it he did not—he took out other letters which are termed old letters, leaving this one containing money in his pocket—I asked the prisoner how he accounted for the letter being in his pocket—he said he did not know it was there—I said, "You could not have it in your pocket without knowing it, it is so heavy"—he then said, "It is the first offence I am guilty of"—I then gave him into custody, and gave instructions to search him and his house.</p>

In 1843 my offices were in Cannon-street—I was first acquainted with the prisoner in Feb., 1838—he then lived in Mint-street, Borough—I was con<lb/>cerned for Mr. Brown, his landlord's collector; that introduced me to him—he was behind with his rent—he said his son had recently married a lady entitled to some money, and he wished me to interfere to induce the execu<lb/>trix of Mrs. 'Faddy to advance a sum of money for his son, and referred me to</p>

               <p>a Mr. Rivington, who I saw several times; but could not succeed until the prisoner's son and his wife became of age—the wife was entitled to the money under the will, but the minority of the son was the great obstacle—about Dec., 1838, the prisoner paid my bill for the trouble I had had—I hadno further instructions, and do not know whether the rent was paid or not—I saw no more of the prisoner till Jan., 1843, when he called on me, and said he and his co-trustee, under his son's settlement, were about making some disposition of the fund, and would I introduce him to my stock-broker—I referred him to Mr. Edwin Newton Bryant, and did not see him again till he was in Newgate.</p>

James Grant was messenger and porter—he hadthe sole care of the building day and night, had apartments in the building, and a very good salary—the House of Lords, on different occasions, have tocommunicate with the House of Commons—it is the custom to remit the"Reports of the Houses of Lords and Commons" to the Masters—these six"Reports" all have my writing in them—I kept them in a small retiring-room, to which James Grant has access—I did not give him leave to takeany of them—this was discovered by Sir William Hall missing some papers—I have seen one of these since Easter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of my father, Daniel Spence, of Beraondsey-street, a town carman. On 18th March I was with my father'scart on London-bridge—Webb hired me; Quaife was with him, and anotherperson who is not in custody—the other man got up in the cart, and rode to Lawrence Pounfney-lane with me—when we got there, I received a bale ofwool, which came from the loophole of Mr. Cooper's premises—I saw a manthere, but who put the bale in I cannot tell—the cart came up Arthur-streetwith the wool, and I there saw Quaife—the cart, went along Fenchurch-street, to the Minories—Quaife walked on the pavement, sometimes by the side ofthe cart, sometimes before or behind—I got to the further end of the Minories—they kept me waiting from three quarters of an hour to an hour—Fletcherthen came up—I complained of being kept—I said if they did not take thebale of wool out of the cart I would throw it into the street—the man whowas in the cart with me went and spoke to Fletcher—Quaife was in the Minories at that time, but I do not know whether he was along with them—I then went to a turning in New Commercial-street—I saw Fletcher go as faras Whitechapel—that was in a direction towards where I took the wool—when I got to the gateway I backed the cart in, and got out the bag—Quaifeand Webb were there, and a man who is not in custody—they assisted me tounload the cart, and the man who is not in custody paid me.</p>

On the Saturday morning you have been speaking of as the day the wool was to bedelivered, did you order me to meet you at Arthur-street about eight o'clock?Did you bring a person and introduce him as the owner of the wool at thattime in Arthur-street? Did you not also bring another person shortly afterto me, who you said was the proprietor of the wool? At that time, did I notfell you that I had sold the wool to a person of the name of Harris, and ifyou did not let it be, as Saturday was the Jews' Sabbath, there would be somedelay in the delivery of the wool? Did you send a party (one of them two) along with me to Mr. Harris, to receive the money for the wool? At thetime you have been speaking of, the wool being in the Minories, did you notsend these two men with me, and the stouter man of the two was to receivethe money? After the time you have been speaking of, as having been to-Myer's and seen the wool disposed of, did you not come down with the stoutgentleman into Trinity-square? Did you not say when you came there thatit had been a very unfortunate piece of business; that the wool had gone in thesame channel that a whole sheet had gone before? Did I not then call anofficer who was passing by, and the stout man and you ran away immediately, an officer of the name of Childs? Did you go with the cart to Adams' yard?Did you send the two men with the cart to unload it there? What did youmean when you said the wool was two hours in my possession? Have youmet with the fourth person, because there were four persons when you werein the Minories? Have you met with the person in the chequered short coatwhom you represented as the real owner of the wool? Was he there a shorttime with you?</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, at Princes-street. On Sunday, 4th June, I was strolling about in the direction of Victoria-park, merely for freshair—I was going near the Church in Bonner's-fields, there was a consider<lb/>ablenumber of people there, scattered in all directions—I remember thepolice coming out of the Church—before they came out, I saw Inspector Waller in front of the Church—stones were thrown at him and at the Churchat the same time, and I heard cries something like execrations on the police—I did not take particular notice of the words, but they were, "Down withthe b----y police!" or something to that effect—some of the stones struck Inspector Waller—he went into the Church, and the throwing was continued—the police came out in four or five minutes, and some directions were given—I fancied I heard the words, "Steady, steady," by the inspector—the policethen came out of the chuich-yard, and proceeded to disperse the people—thethrowing of stones continued—I ran off as soon as I could when I saw thefighting, when the police came out.</p>

I went for a walk in Bonner's-fields on Sunday evening, June 4th—I saw stones thrown at the Church windows some time before the police came out—I was forty yards off—I saw Inspector Waller begging the people to desist; I could not hearthat, but I saw by his hands that he did so—the police made a feint as ifthey were ordered to withdraw—they then made a rush out—there werestones thrown then, and as the police followed the mob they were mostbrutally attacked by the mob—I withdrew as the mob did, and after themeeting was dispersed I came back, and accompanied the police with the pri<lb/>sonersto Arbour-square—I never saw men act with greater forbearance thanthe police, till they were attacked by the ruffians that were there—I was at<lb/>tacked, being taken for a Special—a man came up, and said, "Don't act as</p>

                  </hi>. I have been incumbent of St. Jame's Church, Bonner's-fields, between two and three years—I have a residenceadjoining the Church. On 4th June I was attending my duty in the Church—the morning service was concluded about one o'clock—there was afternoonservice concluding between four and five—during the afternoon service Iheard a noise outside as of a number of persons assembled—the service wasnot interrupted by it—at the conclusion of the service, about four o'clock, Ileft the Church to go home, and saw some hundreds of persons assembled, throwing stones at Inspector Waller and at the Church windows—I did nothear any individual words, but there was a general cry—this meeting inspiredterror and anxiety in my family—Inspector Waller went into the Church-yard—there had been about thirty-six police in the body of the Church—ontheir being brought out they proceeded to disperse the mob, who were makingconsiderable noise, and throwing stones—I watched the efforts of the policetill they returned with some prisoners—I gave permission that the personswho were taken into custody on the spot should be placed for security in avault of the Church—I saw no violence used by the police before they wereassaulted—I was there when the medical men were attending the woundedpolicemen—I do not recollect seeing any wounds on the prisoners who werebrought in.</p>

Wilson, at Guildhall, and charged him—what I said was taken down—I signed it—this is my signature—I received a paper, placing me under 401 penalty to appear, and as far as that paper went I knew that I ought toattend the trial of Philip Magnus—Maria Allen lived with me—she wentwith me to Guildhall—before we went into the Court, Hannah Decastro cameup and asked if we knew what time the Court opened—I said I thoughttwelve o'clock—she said, "Are you going?"—I said, "Yes"—she said, "What for?"—I said, "To give evidence against a young man for picking my pocket—she said, "Come here, my dear, I want to speak to you"—Maria Allen went on one side—Mrs. Decastro said, "He is my next doorneighbour; I have very great respect for him, and if you will not go, I willtake you anywhere you like, and you shall have what you like"—Allen heard it—the prisoner called on me the next Monday morning alone—he said he cameto see me concerning the prisoner Philip Magnus, to see what be could dorespecting ray not appearing, and said the family were very respectable, oneof the sisters kept a shop in Chancery-lane and another in Gray's-inn-road;(which I found she did;) that he was very ill, and his wife was just confined, and for the sake of his wife and family wished me not to press against him—I said I was under 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">bail</hi> to appear—he said he that was of no more conse<lb/>quencethan the dust under his feet—I said I was afraid it was—he said heknew the law, as he was in the law, and was always brought up to the law—two days afterwards the prisoner came again with Mrs. Israel, as far as I canrecollect, but I was very ill—they pressed me not to appear—Mrs. Israeloffered to send me a physician, and Mr. Lazarus offered to send me a bottleof wine and a physician, if I would not appear—Mrs. Israel said I shouldhave a home in her bouse, sit at her table, and be one of her own family, if I would not appear—Allen was with me—they wanted me to go outof town—I cannot say which asked me—I went that evening to inquirewhether they were respectable, as Mrs. Israel said her husband was a tax<lb/>gatherer—I found they were very respectable—I do not know whether itwas that evening, but we went to Mrs. Israel's house, and saw her and herhusband, who took a sovereign out, offered it me, and said I must be in wantof money, having had my money taken from me by the prisoner—Allen wassitting by me, and told me not to take it—Mrs. Israel said her brother wasgoing to be married—she did not mention bis name—when we went downinto the shop the prisoner was there, and asked us to go to the wedding, and offered to lend us his sister's clothes, white or satin dresses, or anythingwe liked—I said I would not go if my own clothes were not fit to go in—on 15th Sept., Mrs. Israel and Mrs. Decastro came about eight o'clock, before I was up—I got up, and saw them—Mrs. Israel had been to me theprevious evening to know how it was to be settled—I said we bad better goto the Court, and let the Magistrate decide it—she came next morning ingreat distress, with her sister, and said her mother and all her friends werevery much cut up—I would not consent to go away unless I had a lawyer'sadvice—they had offered to Lake me to any lawyer I liked to go to—they</p>

               <p>said Lazarus would be there in a few minutes—he came, and said he hadcome to take me so any lawyer I liked, and we went out with that view—on going along he said Mr. Wooller was always considered very clever insuch cases, but he did not know where he lived, and so he would inquire in astationer's shop—Maria Allen was with us—we went into a stationer's, andlooked at a directory, and then went to Mr. Wooller—Lazarus told him thatthe prisoner was a friend of mine, and I did not wish to prosecute—I do notknow whether he said the prisoner's name—I said, "Mr. Wooller, I wishyou quite to understand what it is"—I showed him my recognizance, andsaid I had no animosity against the party, and wished to do what was righton both sides; but I did not want to place myself in any da Dger—Mr. Wooller said he recollected hearing of the case, and if I acted according tohis directions I might do it with perfect safety; that it was a thing that wasdone every day; that we must go out of town, but he must know where wewere, and we should be perfectly safe if we acted under his directions—I leftthe recognizance with him—Lazarus gave Mr. Wooller his card, and promisedto let him know where we were—he said he would conduct the trial, and ifwe were wanted he would send for us—I saw no money paid to Wooller, but Lazarus had money in his hand when we were speaking, and he sent me and Allen out of the room, and joined us in about three minutes—we then allwent to Mrs. Israel's—she said she had written to a person, who she fre-quentlystopped with at Gravesend, for apartments, and she wished us to godown that afternoon—I said we could not go that day, for we could not leaveour lodging without giving a week's notice—she said if we paid for the weekit would not signify, and gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the rent, and half-a-crown to payour coach-hire to the Grotto Tavern, with our luggage, and she would meetus there—we packed up our things, and went to the Grotto—we met Mrs. Israel in Holborn—we were in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and she followed us to the Grotto—Allen stopped with the luggage—I went with Mrs. Israel to Chancery-lane, to see if Elizabeth Magnus was come—we found her, and went back to the Grotto, and took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to Blackfriars-bridge—we got on the packet, and then Mrs. Israel said she had a letter from Gravesend saying that the apartmentswere full—we all went to Woolwich—Mrs. Israel took apartments of a Mrs. Dawson, and told her she had brought me down for the benefit of my health, and her sister was come to accompany me, and would wait on us—Mrs. Israel went home that night—Mrs. Decastro was the first person who visitedus; it was the next day, or the next but one—she went back the same. Day—on the Sunday Lazarus came down—I did not converse with him; I waslying on the sofa, very ill—he went back the same day—I think Mrs. Israelcame on the Tuesday, and I think Lazarus did—I am not sure whether hecame twice or three times—on Thursday, Mrs. Israel and James Magnuscame, and before Magnus had been there five minutes he offered, metwo handfulls of sovereigns, and said, "Miss Davis, you must be inwant of money; my brother has taken yours; you are welcome to as much as you like, but don't say anything about it to any of your friends"—Allenwas not present—I said I did not want money from any of them, I did notwant to make anything by it—Allen then came in with the tea—next day, Friday, Mrs. Israel came down about dinner-time, and shortly afterwards Lazarus and James Magnus came to fetch us home, as I had said" I could notstop longer than Friday, whether it was settled or not—Lazarus said it wasall over, and the prisoner was released—Mrs. Israel wanted us to stop till Tuesday, when our week was up—Lazarus was present—I objected—shesaid she wanted to stop for the benefit of her health—we all went home by</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gas-fitter, and live at 24, Wyndham-street—I keep the house, and have been there eighteen years. On Saturday night, 27th May last, I happened to be at the Harcourt-street station, and saw theprisoners there—Wilson was dressed as a railway porter—he was chargedwith assaulting Gardner—he was searched—he produced a gold watch—thepoliceman took it from him, and it was given to Gardner—she had previouslyasked for some silver that was taken from him, and likewise a knife—herefused to give her either, but he gave her the watch, and I understood himto say, "It is <hi rend="italic">yours</hi>, you may take it"—perceiving that it was gold, and amodern watch, in consequence of suspicions I went next morning to Collard, and told him what I had seen—I afterwards accompanied Collard to Hatton-place, where the prisoners lived, and Gardner produced the watch—Collardasked whose it was—Wilson said, "It is mine"—he asked where he got it—he said it was left him by a deceased brother, I think he said about threeyears ago, and he referred Collard to his sister at Windsor—on the Saturdaynight, when Gardner left the station with the watch, I went with her—shetold me that it was her watch, that it was given her by her grandfather, andshe had had it ten years—" Indeed," she said, "I call it my child."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a turnkey in the Queen's Prison, and superintendentof the night-watch. On 17th May the prisoner was confined there as a Crownprisoner, among the third class of debtors—in consequence of somethingthat occurred about half-past eight o'clock, I went with Dennis and Martin, two other officers, to his room to search for spirits—Dennis said he bad cometo search the room by order of the Governor—the prisoner said, "Search," or"Search away"—Dennis went to one corner of the room and I to another—the prisoner said to Dennis, "You have been annoying my family for sometime"—he directly Ald hold of Dennis by the collar and struck him—I wentto his assistance, and he struck me also—he then made a rush to the oppo<lb/>siteside of the room, where there was a cupboard, snatched up a knife in onehand, and a knife and fork in the other—I followed close after him, supposingit was his intention to destroy some spirits—when I saw the knife in onehand, and the knife and fork in the other, I rather shrunk back, and herushed at Dennis—I ran towards him and attempted to lay hold of him, andhe stabbed me in the left wrist—I have not been able to use my arm since—Major Hawkes and the prisoner's wife and daughter were in the room.</p>

On Saturday evening, about five o'clock, I was standing at the door, and saw Carey come past—a tea-cup was thrown from the window, andstruck him—he said, "Who is it? is that the foreman's wife, Mrs. Feeney?"—she said, "I am no foreman's wife;" and then 1 saw the knife come overthe top of the window, and hit Carey at the side of the nose—he put his handto his face, and then I saw the knife come again, and his hand was cut—hehad done nothing before the cup was thrown—he broke no window with thecan—he was a few yards from me when the cup was thrown—Louisa Calnanlives in the next house—Carey did not do anything to her before the cup wasthrown—he did nothing to anybody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mrs. Eliza Stevenson—she is awidow, and lives in Loughborough-road. At half-past twelve o'clock on 20th April, I was in the back kitchen—I heard a noise in the front kitchen—Iwent in in about two minutes and found a birdcage, which I had hung inthe centre of the window about ten minutes before, had been moved, and puton the table—the window was open—it had not been quite shut down before I missed a pair of sugar-tongs, a coffee-pot, tea-pot, and three silver tea-spoons—they had been en the dresser opposite the window—from what Baker told me I went out, and met an officer, and saw some persons running, but I only saw their backs, and do not know who they were—in the evening, this cream jug was brought in—it is one of the things taken—I also knowthis tea-pot and coffee-pot, spoons, and tongs, to be Mrs. Stevenson's—I sawthem in the house about half-an-hour after I had missed them—they were onthe dresser, but they had clay on them, which they had not before—I saw thespoon and tongs on the Thursday afterwards, when Turton brought them—on the day before the robbery I had seen both the prisoners—Lloyd had apocket-book in his hand, and came and offered needles for sale, and after hewent, Williams came and offered side-combs for sale.</p>
