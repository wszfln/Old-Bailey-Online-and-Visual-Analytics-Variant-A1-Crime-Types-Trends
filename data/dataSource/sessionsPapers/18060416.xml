               <p>Q. Had any order been given by the officer for the company to halt. - A. Not in my hearing; the officer came up, and asked who had halted the men; they said they wanted their pay to get some subsistence, for he had promised not to march them further than there that day; he said they must go on to Highgate, and they said they could not, as they had had no refreshment from twelve o'clock the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. What hour of the day was this. - A. About one or two o'clock; the officer told them to go on to the next public house, then he would halt them and give them some refreshment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go on upon that. - A. Yes, till they had passed this public house, then they halted again without orders, and said they were not able to go without some refreshment; the officer said they must go on to Highgate; the deceased man said, as well as the other men, that he could not go to Highgate without some refreshment, the serjeant said he was able to go, and he must go, without any refreshment; the deceased told the serjeant that he should not be so cruel to a deserter, it was only three months ago that he was marched from the Savoy as a deserter himself; the serjeant said he was a liar, and then the deceased said he was a liar; the serjeant said he wished he had the pleasure of shooting them all; then the serjeant returned and struck him with the halbert, he took the halbert in both his hands, and gave him a hard blow with the cross bar on his head, the guard, the steel end of the halbert stuck in the scull.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the halbert stay upon the place where he struck him. - A. Yes, it struck very fast, and it drew his head of one side when he pulled it out; he pulled two or three times before the halbert came out, his hat came off with the halbert, and the man cried out he was dead, the blood flowed when the halbert was drawn out. The deceased sat down and begged the officer to take off his handcuffs, and called for his wife and child, who were behind; the officer who commanded the escort sent for a surgeon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay with the man. - A. No, we were marched on to London.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you halt at any place. - A. We did, about an hour afterwards; I saw Kirby brought into the Savoy that night, he was brought to the Savoy in a cart, and I saw him after he was dead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. You joined the party. - A. Yes, I was taken three or four miles below Barnet.</p>
               <p>Q. The deserters halted twice; there were no orders given by the officer or the serjeant to halt. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the conduct of the deceased quiet and peaceable. - A. He was as peaceable as the rest, all of them refused to go on till they got their subsistence money.</p>
               <p>Q. The words liar passed between both of these men. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the blow immediately given on these words taking place. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was some of them willing to go on. - A. No, there were none of them willing to go on till they got their pay.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the deceased the only person that pulled the rope. - A. I did not see one pull the rope more than the others.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The deceased was before you. - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not he pull the rope back to stop the others without your perceiving it. - A. He might, I did not see the deceased pull the rope, they were all of them willing to stop to get their pay.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the deceased the first file. - A. About the second; I was the seventh file.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he left hand man or right hand. - A. The right hand was handcuffed, and secured to the rope, his left hand was at liberty.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Gurney. Were you in this party of deserters at Barnet on the 23d of March last. - A. Yes, I came with the party from Chester.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the deceased come from Chester likewise. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe some of you come from Ireland. - A. The whole come from Ireland.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner at the bar take charge of you under the officer. - A. At Litchfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember halting at Northampton. - I do, they halted about an hour before the goaler would take them in custody; during the officer's absence, the deceased and the prisoner at the bar had some words; I was in the rear file that day, I cannot tell what was the beginning of the words, I heard the soldiers grumble very much not getting their billets to get their dinner; I heard the serjeant say d - n the Irish rebels, they should all be put to death; the serjeant talked very hot to the deceased, and the deceased to the serjeant; the deceased said the serjeant charged him with being a deserter, he had been a deserter himself; the serjeant said he was very much obliged to the soldiers for telling the deceased that, otherwise he could not have known it; the serjeant said, if the d - ned rascal speaks to me again I will take his life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you come on from thence to Barnet. -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160004"/>We remained there some-time before a place could be got to put the deserters in; there the deceased told the officer, that Mack threatened him with his life, and was abusing him in a gross manner; then the officer, that gentleman that is there, (pointing to him) told him to hold his tongue, brought us forward to another goal, and put us in there. On the next day we marched to St. Alban's, and on Sunday morning we marched from St. Alban's to Barnet.</p>
               <p>Q. From Northampton to Barnet had any other dispute took place between the prisoner and the deceased. - A. Yes, at a place called Chalk Hill, near Dunstable, the serjeant impeached him again of being a d - ned rebel for flying from his colours; the deceased gave him as bad in return again, told him he must be a d - ned rebel for flying from his colours; with that the serjeant drew back, took his halbert, and swore he would run him through; the corporal of the party laid hold of the serjeant's arms to hinder him from stabbing him with the halbert, and then the officer gave orders for the serjeant to go on.</p>
               <p>Q. In your march from Northampton to St. Alban's, what was the latest hour that you had refreshment. - A. About twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. At what place had you the refreshment. A. About twelve miles from St. Alban's some had refreshment, and some had none; I borrowed some money of the officer to get some refreshment; my wife was in the rear, the last that we had was at Dunstable.</p>
               <p>Q. Then on the morning of Sunday you had none. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Nor on Saturday afternoon. - A. No, we had none till Sunday at noon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. When you came to Barnet the deserters stopped without orders. - A. All halted without any order; that was opposite of the Red Lion. The officer came up, and asked what was the matter; I told the officer he had promised a halt there, because we had marched the day before thirty miles, and by halting here, there would be a short day's march to London; then the officer told us we should halt at the next public house. We came out of the town, and there was only one public house to be seen, and at that public house they all halted again; the prisoner at the bar came up, and the officer came and asked who ordered to halt; some man said it was the serjeant; the officer desired them to go on; he said he would halt them at Highgate. They did not move for some time; some knew the distance, and some did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the deceased say anything at that time. - A. He did not; some said it was only three miles. and the officer said it was only three or four miles, We all said that we could not go without some refreshment; we could see no public house; the officer told us there was a public house a little farther on; the serjeant came and struck the deceased on the head.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were you to the deceased. - A. I was the rear file of the whole; I could hear them mutter some disagreeable words one against the other, but not enough to make him strike him; I heard the word Liar returned backwards and forwards from the serjeant and the deceased; one and all said they could not go on without having refreshment; Young said he would be d - ned if he would march any farther without he had some refreshment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the deceased say any thing. - A. The deceased said he was not able to go till he had some refreshment; he was very much fatigued, his wife was in the rear to get some for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you say you heard the serjeant and the deceased call each other liars. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any other angry words between them. - A. The serjeant said if he would not go on he would take his life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that to the deceased only, or to any other person. - A. To the deceased only, as I understood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any more words from one or the other before the blow was struck. - A. No, I saw the serjeant give the blow with the halbert.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the halbert did the prisoner strike him with. - A. With the cross-steel bar, he struck him over the head (witness describing the manner the prisoner struck the deceased) with both his hands, with the cross-steel bar, he knocked it through his hat into his head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it come off from the head easy. - A. No, with great difficulty he got it out, it struck in the skull; he made several pulls to get the halbert out, and the deceased stooped his head for him to get the halbert out; the hat came off with the halbert being pulled out, and the blood flowed immediately; the deceased cried out that he was murdered, and begged the officer to let his handcuffs be taken off, and called for his wife and child; the deceased sat down, and they were taken off, and the witness that gave evidence before me was put in his place, he not having been handcuffed before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay with the deceased. - A. I was marched on I dare say about a couple of miles, when we stopped for some refreshment; we then came forward to London; I saw the deceased again at night when he was brought to the Savoy in a cart; he lived till the Wednesday or Thursday following, I do not know which.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you to have said, that Young said, D - mn him if he would go any further. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the opinion of you all. - A. No, I cannot judge of any man's opinion but my own.</p>
               <p>Q. You were all desirous of having your pay. - A. That was my opinion, I do not know what any other man's was. I said I wanted refreshment; the serjeant would have stopped them if they had not stopped; the men said we were d - mned fools if we did go; the serjeant was as willing to stop as the men, if it had not been for the officer's order.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the serjeant halt you. - A. He did; because the officer said he would halt us at the last public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was it in Barnet the deceased received the blow. - A. This near end to London.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said the words were as high of one side as the other. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there an attempt at Stafford of you all to make your escape. - A. About ten were for going, and six were not for making their escape.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that the night before you was delivered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160005"/>over to the officer and the present serjeant. - A. It was.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. What are you. - A. I am a shoemaker, I live at Barnet.</p>
               <p>Q. On Sunday the 23d of March, did you see a party of deserters marching through Barnet. - A. I saw a party of soldiers escorting a line of deserters.</p>
               <p>Court. Were there as many soldiers as there were deserters. - A. There were more, there were nine on each side, with fixed bayonets; the deserters were handcuffed together, fastened to a rope that went through the line, the prisoner at the bar was in the front, and the officer was behind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the deserters halt. - A. They halted for the first time opposite the Red Lion; when they halted, I came up to them, they appeared to be much tired, and I heard a general complaint amongst them of want of refreshment. I heard the officer and the prisoner at the bar order them to move on, the officer promised that they should stop lower down in the town; upon that order they moved on, I believe more than an hundred paces, opposite the lower Red Lion, the last public house in the town, and the nearest public house in the town towards London.</p>
               <p>Q. When they came up to the lower Red Lion they stopped. - A. They did, I did not hear any order for stopping, the officer ordered them to move on, the prisoner at the bar then repeated the same as he had done before, they then moved on I believe about thirty paces, and then halted without any command, I then ran towards them, and I saw the deceased, for one, pull the string, he rather checked it back, he was in the second file; there appeared to be a general complaint throughout the whole line; I heard the deceased say he could not and would not go any further till he had some water; instantly I saw the serjeant leave the front, stepping a few paces he uttered some words, I did not distinctly hear, he then struck the deceased with the guard part of the halbert on the head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to penetrate the head. - A. I saw the guard pass through the hat into the head, and it was with difficulty he drew it out, it brought off the hat on the pike of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner struck the deceased with the halbert, in what manner did he hold the halbert. A. With both hands, and struck him as violent as he could strike him, with as much force as a butcher would strike a bullock; I was close up to him at the time, I heard the deceased exclaim, oh, I am killed! I am killed! the blood flowed from the wound; as soon as I heard the deceased say these words, I saw the blood stream over the right eye, he did not immediately fall with the blow, because he was supported up by his fellow deserter that was handcuffed with him, who held him up, then his handcuff was taken off, and he sat down; in about a quarter of an hour the surgeon came; I saw the deceased put into a cart.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was the deceased put into a cart, and sent to London. - A. I believe it must be more than an hour, because he was taken into a stable and searched by the surgeon.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the prisoner struck the deceased with the halbert, had the deceased either struck him or made any motion towards striking him. - A. None in the least, I am perfectly sensible of that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. You said that you saw the deceased lay hold of the string. - A. No, he did not lay hold of the string, he rather checked the string; the officer and serjeant requested them to go on, but they were all unwilling to go on till they had some refreshment.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were you to the serjeant at the time the blow was given. - A. I was close to the rear of the party, I distinctly heard the deceased say the words that I have told you, there was a rumour of different people speaking, I might not hear all that passed.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe you are now headborough of the town. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On Sunday the 23d of March, did you see a party of deserters march through Barnet. - A. I did, under an escort of a serjeant and an officer, and about twenty private soldiers, with their bayonets fixed; the prisoner at the bar was in the front with his halbert, and the officer was in the rear.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe them to halt opposite of the Red Lion. - A. No, the serjeant halted them between the upper Red Lion and the sign of the Harrow; I was standing at my own door, about twenty yards from them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing at that time. - A. I heard the officer ask who halted the men; one of the privates answered it was the serjeant, the officer said you must go on, they went on from opposite the sign of the Harrow till they came to what we call the lower Red Lion, then the men halted opposite the lower Red Lion in the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any word of command given for that halt. - A. No, but there was a murmuring between them, they said they had been marched so far the day before, and they could not, nor would not, march any farther, till they had some refreshment; then by the word of command being given by the officer, they marched on a few paces farther, till they came to the stonemason's beyond the lower Red Lion; when they come on these few paces they halted again, they were all determined, semingly, of going no farther, as there was no other public house for them to stop at; they were all dissatisfied, I did not see one more so than another.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the rope pulled by any of them. - A. Yes, by several, I was close at the rear of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the serjeant do any thing upon their halting. - A. The serjeant uttered very bad words, he came from the front towards the deceased, and struck him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any words that the serjeant made use of. - A. When he had got the halbert up, he said, I will murder you, you b - r.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did he take up the halbert to strike him. - A. (the witness described here the manner in which the serjeant was carrying the halbert, and also the manner he struck the deceased) When the halbert was in the deceased's head, he tried to pull it out, he could not at first, he drawed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160006"/>the man towards him; it was the guard part of the halbert that went into the man's head, and when he pulled the halbert out the deceased's hat came off with it, and in a very little time the blood flowed, the man did not drop instantly, but in a few minutes he fell to the ground, and the blood flowed over his right eye; the moment the deceased was struck, he cried, oh, I am killed! I am killed!</p>
               <p>Court. Before he fell did you see or hear any thing more pass with respect of the serjeant. - A. Not a word; the serjeant returned back into the front of the party again, and never came nigh the deceased any more in my sight; the deceased begged for some water, and Mr. Birdstock, who keeps the lower Red Lion, brought him some water; a surgeon was sent for who came.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the serjeant struck him on the head, had the deceased made any effort to strike him, - A. I did not see any thing of the kind, I am certain it is a very false thing if any body says so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a general refusal among them not to proceed any further, till they had received refreshment. - A. There was.</p>
               <p>Q. There were words used first between them. - A. Yes, but I cannot tell what the words were.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean words between the prisoner at the bar and the deceased, or words among the men in general. - A. There were words among the deserters in general.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there words used between the prisoner and the deceased while you was there. - A. Not a word.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You saw him pull the string. - A. He did, and the others pulled.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not after the rope was pulled different ways that the blow was given. - A. The serjeant ran from the front immediately the refusal was signified by the whole party.</p>
               <p>Q. And then the blow was given. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whether the place by the stonemason's where the blow was given, is in Hertfordshire. - A. It is in Hertfordshire, in the parish of Chipping Barnet.</p>

I was, I found the man in a stable at the lower Red Lion, I examined the head and found the wound to be about an inch in width, an instrument had penetrated the scull, and entered the brain.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it such a wound as a part of the halbert would have made. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any part of the brain exudate from the wound. - A. There was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a wound as might produce death. - A. It was, I thought it was a dangerous one, and so I told the officer that he would not live long.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether you saw the man put into the cart. - A. I did not see him put into the cart, I overtook him, and saw him in the cart, going to London.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. The officer enquired of you, sir, I understand whether it would be safe to convey him to London. - A. It was my opinion that he might be removed without encreasing the danger.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that the officer had the cart to remove him. - A. It was.</p>

Yes, I brought him from the lower Red Lion, his wife and child was put into the cart with him, I got some straw for him to lie easy, the woman let the man lay his head in her lap, as well as she could; when he was coming to town he never spoke, he never was in his senses at all; I stopped three or four times to get some milk and water for his wife to refresh him and wash his wound; I brought him to the Savoy.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Gurney. On the evening of the 23d of March, I saw the deceased in the Savoy, I examined his wound in the barrack room, in the presence of another surgeon, we were then both of opinion that there was no fracture, I gave orders immediately for him to be taken to my hospital, where I bled him immediately; the next morning I went up to see him, he was walking about the room, he said he had a pain in all his limbs, that he had undergone a long march; I told him he might go to bed, I would rather see him in bed than up; on Tuesday and on Wednesday morning he was very well, till about five o'clock, I believe, he then did not care to speak at all, his pulse was rather low; Wednesday evening he did not care to speak at all, he appeared sensible.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he complain of the pain in his head. - A. Not at five o'clock; at ten o'clock I saw him, he told me he had a pain across his forehead; on Thursday morning about five o'clock, I was called up, he was quite dead; I opened the head; on removing the scull, I found there was a small fracture.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the wound appear to have penetrated the brain. - A. On removing the pericranium, I perceived it had entered the dura mater.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that that wound was the occasion of his death. - A. No doubt at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. At the time these deserters were delivered to the officer and me at Litchfield, I was informed by Mr. Allen that they were a very dangerous set of men. At Northampton the deceased was very refractory; I told him to be quiet till the officer could get a prison or some other place<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160007"/>for them; he abused me in consequence of his bad conduct. The officer commanding the escort put him in the lower part of the prison. About four miles from Northampton this

At Dunstable, he in particular grew refractory; most of the party were agreeable to go on excepting this Kirby, and a man of the name of Young, who said they would go no further; the officer then with the flat of his sword struck Kirby. At St. Alban's the prison-keeper would not let them in without a guard; this Kirby said he would not march, though he was able to do it. At Barnet they halted without any word of command whatever; I said to this man go on quietly; at one time he said he was not able, and the next reply he made me was, he was better able to march than me, but he would be d - mned if he would go on, and if I would come nigh him, for a rascal he would strike me dead. The party moved on till we come near the Red Lion, or below it; they halted again, he asked for the rascal of a serjeant at the front. The officer ordered the party to go forward; I said come on, he said if you come nigh me I will strike you dead, he made a pull to get at me, and rushed forward to make a blow at me, I took my halbert and thought to hit him with the wood part, he fell back, and then the cross pin catched him over the head.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you with the deserters all the way from Litchfield to London. - A. Yes, we had the charge of sixteen, and the deceased was one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he and the rest of them conduct themselves quietly and orderly on their march. - A. The whole of them but Kirby and Young. Kirby behaved in a blackguard manner, he refused the orders of the officer on Sunday the 23d of March; we were coming through Barnet; the prisoners wished to stop to get themselves some refreshment, the lieutenant desired them to go on, the deceased laid hold of the rope and stopped the party, and said he would be da - ned if he would go any farther; when he gave these words the serjeant moved forward, and said he would stab him in the a - with the pike if he did not move forward; the deceased d - d the officer and him both, and if he came near to him he would kill him; the deceased made a push with his hand to strike the serjeant with his right hand; then the serjeant hit him with the pike, the deceased drew back his head, frightened at the blow, the pike just touched his head; I believe the serjeant meant to strike him with the wood part of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had delivered the deserters at the Savoy, you and the prisoner returned towards Litchfield. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And it was in your way back that the prisoner was taken up on this charge. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. You and he conversed a good deal on this subject. - A. We did a little.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath have you any other reason to believe that he did not mean to strike him with the iron part of the halbert, but that he has told you so. A. I have no other reason.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you ever escort a more riotous and disaffected party than these were. - A. No.</p>
               <p>- WILLMOTT sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. Were you of this escort party. - A. Yes; the deceased was one of the deserters under our escort, I came with him all the way from Litchfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his conduct peaceable or otherwise during your march. - A. Very otherwise; he did not obey the officer's orders, and he threatened the noncommissioned officer many times on the road. On Sunday morning at Barnet the deserters halted themselves without orders; Kirby said he would not go any further till he got some refreshment; he d - d both the serjeant and the officer; the serjeant said if he did not go on he would job him with the pike. Kirby said if the serjeant struck him he would kill him if it was possible, he laid hold of the rope with his right hand, and drew the rope back, and would not let the other men go on; the serjeant struck him.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the serjeant struck him had the deceased made any blow at the serjeant. - A. Yes, he held his hand up to hit him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it immediately after the blow that was aimed at him that the serjeant struck the deceased. - A. Yes, directly he struck him with the halbert; I was about two yards from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he receive the blow or did he retire from the blow. - A. The man flew from the blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Then of course the halbert would recline from him as he drew down his head. - A. Yes, and he received it in his head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that it was the intention of the prisoner to strike him with the wood or the iron. - A. With the wood.</p>
               <p>Q. If the deceased had not retired from the blow, or flew from the blow, as your expression was, would the wood part have hit him instead of the iron. A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Nor the rest of you. - A. I never heard any of of them.</p>
               <p>Q. The serjeant and the deceased were not upon good terms upon the course of your march, were they. - A. No, they quarreled at Northampton.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time they halted at Barnet the deceased d - d both the officer and the serjeant. - A. Yes, that was the last halt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say it quite loud. - A. Yes, the best part of the escort heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. He, a prisoner about to be tried for desertion, d - d the officer and the serjeant too. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when the prisoner said he would not go on, he said he would prick him with the pike. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then the deceased said, if you prick me, I will kill you if I can. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So that if the serjeant had not gone away he would have knocked him down. - A. Yes, the deceased stepped forward to hit him.</p>
               <p>Q. So that if the serjeant had not gone away, he would have knocked him down. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160008"/>Q. How far did he step. - A. About four steps.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he must go about three or four yards. - A. Yes, to make his blow at him.</p>
               <p>Q. And the blow that he made to the serjeant was so violent, that if the serjeant had not got away, it would have knocked him down. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you think the blow touched the serjeant. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You say he made three or four steps forward, you do not mean to say that each step is a yard at a time. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. What was his conduct coming along the road. A. Sometimes he would be very stubborn, and use ill language to the officer and serjeant; he d - d and and bl - d them, and called them all the rascals he could think of; when we got to Barnet the deserters refused going any farther.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the deceased one of the most active of those that refused to go any further. - A. Yes, the serjeant desired him to go on; he said I will not for you nor the officer nor any of the party, and d - d the officer and serjeant; the officer gave the word, Shoulder arms, and told the parties to go forward, march quick time; upon which the men were going; Kirby laid hold of the rope and pulled the party backwards, the serjeant at the same time struck at him with the pike.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he hold up his hand towards the serjeant as if he was going to strike at him. - A. Yes, it was aimed to strike him, but it did not hit him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you saw the serjeant strike him with the halbert or pike. - A. Yes, the deceased and the serjeant were about two yards distant.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the serjeant aim his blow at the deceased. - A. From what I saw, the way that he meant to strike him was on the shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell us what part it would have been likely to hit him with the halbert. - A. About a foot or eighteen inches from the top part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it would be with the wood part of it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the position of the deceased at the time he received the blow. - A. He stood upon his legs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he run from the blow. - A. Yes, and the deceased received the blow as he was retiring from it; he was struck with the cross-bar on the head.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the deceased to have stood his ground, and not to have receded from it, would the cross bar have hit him then. - A. It would not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not the serjeant talk to you about it. - A. No, nor I to him.</p>

               <p>Q. You say the conduct of the deceased was somewhat stubborn. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the serjeant and the deceased upon good terms on the course of the march. - A. They were when they first started.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, because they were strangers, when they got to Northampton it was otherwise. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And they were upon ill terms all the way to Barnet. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The deceased was to be tried for desertion. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he knowing he was to be tried for desertion, d - d the officer. - A. Yes, I believe every one of the party heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. And he made a violent blow to the serjeant. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many steps did he take when the blow was attempted to be given. - A. Two or three steps from the line.</p>
               <p>Q. And made a violent blow at the serjeant with his double fist. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If it had hit the serjeant, I suppose it would have knocked him down; do you know where he aimed to strike him. - A. From the way that he struck at him, I think it was his head.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember what the serjeant said before he struck the deceased. - A. He told the deserters to go on.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I understand that you had the command of this escort. - A. I had come from Litchfield with them.</p>
               <p>Q. You remember the deceased being one of the deserters. - A. Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he quiet and peaceable under your orders during the march. - A. No, excessively riotous all the while; at Northampton I had some difficulty in getting them into a goal, the town goaler refused taking them in; the serjeant and the deceased had a dispute, I said nothing to him, and when I had them put into a goal, and the prisoner for his ill conduct was put into a lower cell; the next morning they marched, I believe we went to Newport; the day after we went to Dunstable, and when we halted the serjeant took me to a stable to shew me to put the deserters in, it was a good stable, but the price was too high; I asked them whether they would take that stable or go on to St. Alban's, some were willing to go on, and others were not, they wished for refreshment; I told them when they got to the end of the town, and the mob had left them, I would give them refreshment, the majority being willing to go on I gave the word, Quick march, and ordered them to go forward; they all went on but this Kirby, he seized hold of the rope with his right<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160009"/>hand, and pulled the men back, and swore that he would not go on, I went up to him, drew my sword, and struck him with the flat part of the sword, on his back, then he moved on; when I got to the top of the hill, this side Dunstable, I halted; the deceased then seemed content; after he had some drink, and after he had received his refreshment, he swore that he did not mind if he marched to London that night, he only considered his wife and child that were behind; we then marched on to St. Alban's, where we put them into a goal; the next day being Sunday, we marched for Barnet, intending at the same time to make London, as I was allowed eight days to march from Litchfield to London; this was the last day I had for my march; in the former part of our march the roads were excessive bad, and they would not go more than eight miles a-day; when we got to Barnet the deserters supposed they were to halt there; when they saw that I did not give the word to halt, they halted themselves, and my not wishing them to halt in the street, to have a mob about them, I told them to march to the end of the town, I would there halt and give them refreshment; when we got towards the end of the town, they halted again; I immediately asked what was the reason for halting, they answered that they wanted refreshment; I told them that I would not halt there, but if they would go on about half a mile to a public house, we there would have refreshment.</p>

               <p>Court. You knew there was a public house there. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Tell us the reason for your not stopping in Barnet. - A. Because a crowd would come about the deserters; some of the escort had ordered their arms, I told them to shoulder the same; the deserters moved on, particularly the three leading files, upon which Kirby, the deceased, took hold of the rope with his right hand, saying, he would be d - d if he would move for either officer or serjeant; seeing a number of people round the escort, I turned round to them, and told them to go away; I then saw serjeant Mack standing about the third file, on the right of the escort; I saw the deceased extended with the rope, he pulled the man on the left out of the line, very near to serjeant Mack; at which time I saw Mack lift his halbert, and make a blow at the deceased, which blow I am very confident had the deceased remained in the situation he was in, would have struck him with the wood of the halbert; when he saw the blow coming, he moved himself and fell away, by which means he received the cross bar of the halbert in his head.</p>
               <p>Court. By moving himself he brought himself within the reach of the cross iron of the halbert. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Upon the solemn oath you have taken, do you believe from the manner in which the blow was given by this man, it was meant to hurt him on the head. - A. Upon my oath, I do not believe it was, and I am very positive, had the man remained in the situation he was in, the iron would not have hit him on his head.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known any thing of this serjeant previous to the time you had him at Litchfield. - A. I was the officer who received him as a volunteer from the Lancashire militia, of which he was a private; I received an exceeding good character with him from the officer; I have paid more attention to his behaviour than to any other serjeant; he has always behaved well; I never found him inhuman.</p>
               <p>Q. We have heard that the prisoner has been a deserter. - A. When we received the volunteers, they were ordered to the Isle of Wight, to join the first battalion; we left the volunteers there, at the Isle of Wight, the prisoner was one, and he, in consequence of the good character from the Lancashire militia, was made a serjeant in the second battalion, in the thirty-eighth regiment; and after I had left there, he received a pass from the Isle of Wight to Lancashire; when he got this pass he was proceeding to join his regiment, and some person took him up as a deserter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he was excessively riotous several times, you marched in the rear of the escort, can you tell me of any other instance that you know of your own knowledge. - A. Frequently going along the road, I have heard him speak words that were very incorrect, both to me and the serjeant.</p>
               <p>Q. From Newport you marched all the way to St. Alban's, that was thirty miles, that was a very long march. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. A very unusual march for deserters. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. You stated that you thought there was a public house half a mile this side of Barnet; in point of fact do not you know there is none till you come to Whetstone. - A. I do not know exactly the place, I did not proceed with the deserters; I sent the deserters on, and remained with the deceased, to see that he was taken care of.</p>

He had been back to the shop with an excuse for an awl, and then he got this leather, I saw the eight pieces of leather taken out of his pocket; he then begged leave to go and desired us to say nothing about it.</p>

On the 8th of March I was sent for to take the prisoner in custody at the Bull in the John street; when I came there Clark was sitting by him with this leather in his hand, and this here piece of leather I took from him before the magistrate; it was in his apron. (The leather produced, and identified by Clark).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Them pieces of leather were cut out the day before, and some of the leather I had in my pocket; while I worked for Mr. Harman, Clark did every thing to counteract what I did; the second witness is Clark's man, they both work piece work. I took the work home on Saturday, intending to do the work on Sunday; I was treating these men on Saturday evening, when Clark was very much intoxicated, and I was the worse for liquor; they took me in a state of intoxication. I should have done the work on Sunday had I not been put in prison.</p>

             sworn. I am a constable of Worship-street. On the 25th of March I was going out with the patrole, about eight o'clock, into Shoreditch; as we were going along, we were of the opposite side of the way to Mr. Moss's; we saw three or four boys at his window, there were four at first at his window, he had a very great light in his window One of them crossed over to that side where we were watching them, and one (I think it was Parker) crossed over to him; Parker was one that was standing at the window. The others walked a little distance from the shop once or twice; there was a house that was quite shut up next door to Mr. Moss's, and it being a dark night, we had lost sight of them for a few minutes; in a minute or two, by the light of Mr. Moss's shop, we could see them all three quite plain, as Parker had returned, and only one remained of the dark side where we were, whom we have heard was his brother. At first I thought they might only be looking out of curiosity; I sent Gleed the officer over to see if they were doing any thing; Gleed then laid hold of Kennovan and Gable, Parker walked away, I immediately ran across with Ferris, Ferris went after Parker and fetched him back; Gleed was in the act of stooping down with the boys, I thought they would get from him; I pushed the two boys and Gleed into the shop altogether; Ferris brought Parker into the shop directly, he had only gone one door off. Gleed searched the prisoners in my presence, and took one pair of stockings from one of them, I being behind them did not see from whom.</p>
               <p>- GLEED sworn. I am a patrol of Worship-street office. On the 25th of March I was with Mason and Ferris; I observed the three prisoners at Mr. Moss's window, the house on the left hand side (to where they was) of Mr. Moss's was shut up, I observed them all three walk away.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen them do any thing. - A. Not then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a fourth person. - A. Yes, he was of the side of the way where we was; after the three prisoners had walked away they returned to the window the second time; I crossed over the way by Mr. Mason's desire to see what they were doing. When I had crossed over the way I catched Gable's right arm in the window, and the prisoner Kennovan had this pair of stockings in his left hand; Kennovan seeing me, dropped the stockings on the ground, and tried to kick them away with his foot; Parker walked away immediately. I then stooped and picked up this pair of stockings off the ground, and by the time that I picked up the stockings, Ferris brought the prisoner Parker back; I am sure Parker was one of them. We searched about the street, there was no more than one pair of stockings found. When I was pushed into the shop I had this pair of stockings in my hand; I says to Mr. Moss, are these your pair of stockings, he said he had a whole row in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any search made upon the prisoners in Mr. Moss's shop. - A. I did not see them searched there. When we came to the office, I searched the two prisoners that I had apprehended, and in Gable's left hand pocket I found this knife; when I took it out of his pocket, I said to him the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160011"/>knife has got the putty on the point of it; he replied that it was not putty, that it was eggs that he had in his pocket and they had been broke; I examined his pockets, I could not see any appearance of eggs whatever, there is putty on the knife now. After I had searched them at the office, I immediately went to Mr. Moss's shop, I with a candle examined the window, I observed there was a piece of glass taken out of the window, it was big enough for me to put my hand in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the part of the window where you saw one of their hands in. - A. The same place, and the knife fitted the hole in the putty.</p>

             sworn. Q. We understand that you was in company with Mason and Gleed. - A. Yes; on the 25th of March I saw the three prisoners at the bar at Mr. Moss's shop window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see more than three at any time. - A. There was four at first, one of them crossed over to the side of the way that we were, I could not see which of them it was.</p>
               <p>A. Did you see any of the other prisoners move from the place where you first saw them. - A. They all moved, but we did not see where they went to.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards saw them at the window again. - A. Yes, Gleed was sent over by Mason to see what they were doing, and I crossed at the same time, Gleed ran, and was rather nearer than me, I observed Gleed catch hold of Kennovan and Gable, Parker walked into the next house, a grocer's shop, which was open (the house of the other side was shut up), he just walked in and turned round, and as I got to the door he was coming out again, I caught hold of him at the door, and put him into Mr. Moss's shop; I just rubbed them all three down, and found there was nothing on them.</p>

I asked Parker what had become of the other stockings; Parker said the other boy had got all the other stocking; but that one pair. I went to his mother's in Wheeler-street, and to several other places, but I could not find him. (The stockings produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

             took them out and gave them to me; Parker went and put his hand to the window at the same time to take them out, and made a noise; the stockings fell, I picked them up; one of the men came and laid hold of me, and I dropped them.</p>
               <p>Gable's Defence. I was coming along with this boy up Shoreditch, we perceived the window broken and a pair of stockings hanging half out, I pulled them out, and gave them to Kennovan; Parker put his hand in the window and made it crack. I let them fall on the ground, Kennovan went and picked them up, and put them in his apron till the officer came, and then he dropped them.</p>
               <p>Parker's Defence. I had not been to work all that day; my master was not at work (I work at the chip hat business), my master could not get his irons to cut his wood, I was playing about the street, after I had done playing I sung a song, then I went to the tripe shop in Bishopsgate-street for some tripe; coming back I saw these two boys stopping at the shop-window, I went to the window, I knew them, they shoved me away; Gable put his hand into the window, took out the stockings, and gave them to Kennovan. I walked into a grocer's shop, and asked how much his rice was a-pound, he said sixpence; I immediately come out again, having only four pence. A gentleman came to me at the grocer's door when I had the tripe in my hand, and shoved me into Mr. Moss's shop. I put the tripe I had been buying on the counter, and there I left it.</p>

             sworn. I am a servant to the duke of Montrose. On the 5th of March near three o'clock in the afternoon, I was standing at the porter's hall window in <placeName id="t18060416-4-crimeloc24">Grovesnor-square</placeName>

I saw the prisoner go up the area steps, I suspected him, and went to the door and followed the prisoner: I observed that he had something under his arm, I catched him by the coat and asked him what he had got; I took him back, and it appeared he had this great coat with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether the prisoner had the coat in his possession. - A. I can swear that the prisoner had the coat in his possession when I took him; I brought him back and the coat; the coat belonged to a servant in the house that acted as baker and the young ladies' footman. The prisoner told me that he found it in the passage that leads from the front area to the servant's hall.</p>

             sworn. This man came to me at the watchhouse; I took the prisoner into custody. I produce the coat.</p>
               <p>Curtiss. The coat is the duke's property; on the buttons is the duke's crest and coronet.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was coming across Grovesnor-square, I saw the coat laying across the corner of the area steps; seeing nobody near it I took it up.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Curtiss) You are very sure that he told you that he found it in the passage below, as you understood him. - A. I asked him where he took it from, he said in the passage; he beckoned to me at the same time to the passage leading to the servant's hall. There is but that passage at that part of the house.</p>

             sworn. On Monday. the 10th of March about ten o'clock in the forenoon, I met the prisoner at the bar with the quadrant, going down Crutched Friars; it was under his arm wrapped up in a woman's apron as it is now; I took it from him and asked him what he was going to do with it, he said he was going to sell it where he could; he said a boy gave it to him to sell, pointing to a boy who then stood opposite. An officer who was with me went and took that boy; we took them both to the Mansion House; the boy was discharged by the magistrate and the prosecutor's name being on the quadrant, we went to his house. I produce the quadrant.</p>

I was going home, and a gentleman stopped me and asked me whether I wanted a job, I said what job is it, he said take this thing to the Two Bells, Whitechapel; he said he would give me six-pence; as I was going there two gentlemen stopped me. This gentleman stopped me and asked me to carry it for him to the foot of London Bridge, and when the officers took me he ran away.</p>

Beating her on the right side, to make her go as fast as he could; I went to the seed scuttle, to see if the stick was gone as well as the mare, that was gone; I went into the road to see how far the man was gone, he was beating her then: I went into the plow field, and took a horse out of that field, and rode after him, and at the King's Arms, Palmer's Green, about four or five miles off, I found the mare, she was standing at the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the prisoner at the bar there. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What past between the prisoner at the bar when you came there. - A. He was talking to a man of the name of Baker when I got to him, I heard him say he would not take a farthing less for her, but he would not mind spending a crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon hearing of that, what did you do. - A. I catched hold of his collar, I said, You are the villian that stole the mare out of my yard, he stood for a second, and then he said, I did not steal your mare, I found her on the road, I said how came you by that stick.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the stick that you put in the seed scuttle. - A. Yes, he said he found the stick in the stirrup; I had laid it in the seed scuttle; he said he was sorry for what he had done, if I would go to Islington, where he lived, he would give me a guinea for my trouble, if that would satisfy me; I told him that was more than I dare do, it was not in my power to let him go; then I sent a man for a constable, and just at the constable's house he said if I would let him off, he would give us a guinea a-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the saddle and bridle of Mr. Vaughan's. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. It had a bridle and saddle on it then. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. This was in the middle of the day, was it. - A. About half past one o'clock when I hung the mare there.</p>
               <p>Q. When you observed that you had missed your mare, you saw a man upon her, which you say is the prisoner. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw a man riding the mare very hard, he was beating her very unmercifully. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear that he was conducting himself as though he was perfectly sober; how did he appear. - A. I cannot tell, I am not acquainted with the man, I never saw him before.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Watson. Q. What are you. - A. I am a fisherman.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you passing along Holborn on the 27th of March. - A. Yes, about half past seven in the evening; I saw the prisoner and three other men as I was coming along Holborn; there was one on each side of the chaise and two behind: I saw the two that were at the fore part of the chaise, the prisoner and another man at work at the trunk, accordingly they got a little further, and the trunk fell from the chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you saw the trunk fall, did you see the prisoner there about the trunk. - A. He was in the act of taking it on his shoulder; the other three men lifted up the trunk on this man's shoulder, and when he came to the end of the pavement I catched hold of him with the trunk on his shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you saw him working at it. - A. I saw him trying to loosen it, I asked the prisoner what he was going to do with it, he said what is that to you, it does not belong to you; I was afraid of my life, for fear they should cut my throat, they being all around me; I called out Watch and Stop Thief, and the other three run off; in my scuffle this one got from me, I held fast of the trunk; he got about forty yards from me before he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the prisoner at the bar is the man that you saw at work at the chaise, and the man you saw with the trunk on his shoulder. - A. I am sure of it; the chaise was stopped by a butcher's boy, who ran after the chaise; I staid with the trunk till the prisoner was brought up to me by a person of the name of Warren.</p>

On Friday the 14th of March, between twelve and one o'clock, I was coming from Tottenham Court Road, where I had been to see a friend of mine, and it was rather too late to go to my lodgings, they always shut up at eleven o'clock; I met the prisoner at Charing Cross.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you sleep there. - A. Yes; I had my watch when I went to bed with her, I took it out of my breeches pocket and put it in my waistcoat pocket, I slept in my waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any liquor at that house. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Any by the way. - A. No; I gave the girl a glass of gin at Westminster Abbey. I bolted the door when the prisoner and I went to bed; about seven in the morning I missed my watch; the prisoner got up before that time and went to bed again, I had two half guineas in my pocket, a seven shilling piece, and some silver and halfpence; I missed none of my money. I promised the prisoner half a guinea if she would let me have it. When I awoke in the morning I observed the door open.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not given her the watch. - A. No, I gave her two shillings, I never saw the watch again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The young man was very much intoxicated in liquor when I took up with him, I never saw him have a watch; when he came into the room I saw he had gold and silver in a purse, when he gave me two shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. Just a little describe that, you say he rushed against you. - A. He gave me a violent push, his breast hit against mine; at the same moment I felt my watch go away, because my pocket is so narrow.</p>
               <p>Court. You perceived it come out. - A. Yes, directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing was said, but you perceived your watch go out. - A. Yes, then he took to his heels directly, and ran down Bedford-street: I ran after him, and cried out Stop thief, stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you loose sight of him. - A. No, he went no farther off than this room; he was stopped by a man and I came up to him; he called out I am not the man, the gentleman let him go again; he crossed over the street, and took to his heels again, I cried out again, and he was taken again.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was stopped the second time, was it by the same person, - Q. I do not know who the first person was that stopped him; when I come up to him I asked him where my watch was, he said what do you mean by your watch, I am an honest man, I have no watch; then says I if you are an honest man you shall go to Bow-street, he says very well, I will; he then walked off directly, and the people that stood about him left him; he had not been gone half the length of this room, a gentleman came and says, he has your watch in his hand; I then said to him where is my watch, he said, you blackguard, I have no watch; he crossed upon his heels and ran down Bedford-street; I called out the third time Stop thief, when I came up to him again; that gentleman wrenched the watch out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is that gentleman. - A. Mr. Taylor, he is an engraver, his hand was all cut with the glass of the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. You said the gentleman wrenched his hands, was it some time before he parted with it. - A. Yes, ten minutes, he would not part with it, till at last the glass cut his hands, and then he parted with it; then the prisoner was taken to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court. When you took the watch from him, the glass was broke. - A. I had it not in my hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. The prisoner's hand was cut. - A. The man who tried to get the watch from him, his hand was bloody; when the prisoner was at Bow-street he let one hand be seen and not the other.</p>
               <p>Court. I understood you to say that he run against you, and gave you a violent blow on your breast. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At that instant you perceived your watch go, did you see him take it. - A. No.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr Watson. On the 21st of February did you see the prisoner at the bar. - A. I did.</p>

               <p>Q. You are an engraver, Mr. Taylor. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first see him. - A. In Bedford-street in the Strand, towards the bottom of it, he was then running violently.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any cry of Stop thief at that time. - A. Yes, which first attracted my attention towards him; seeing the prisoner I apprehended him to be the thief; at the instant of time that he came up I should have stopped him, but being fearful there might be a gang, and the prosecutor talking so unintelligibly, I took but very little notice of it, but turned on my heel and left them; a minute had not elapsed before I heard the cry of Stop thief, reiterated with the addition that he had got the watch in his hand; I have seen it, I looked round, he then might be about twenty yards from me, and then he was running down the street which he before had ran up, seeing that I was then decided what course I should pursue, and as he approached me I knocked him down and kneeled upon him, and after a severe struggle I took the watch from him, and kept it till I went to Bow-street; and had I not done it another witness would have done it, as he had hold of the chain, and I had a more powerful grasp, having hold of the body of the watch.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was your hand cut. - A. No, my glove was tore, I believe with the chain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing. - A. Not a syllable.</p>
               <p>Q. You took the watch to Bow-street and the prisoner also was taken by you to Bow-street. - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man that you stopped. - A. I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How long was you and me struggling before you got the watch out of my possession. - A. It was so small a portion of time it is imposible to divide it, I may safely say it was a minute before I could get a good grasp.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your hand in a gore of blood. - A. I could not tell, I had my glove on, when my glove was off there was no blood on it then.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long had you him down before you got the watch from him. - A. About a minute.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. You said there was two endeavouing to take the watch from him, did you observe whether<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160017"/>the other man's hand was cut. - A. It might have been possible, he having hold of the chain, and in addition to his having hold of the chain the watch glass was broke.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you say at Bow-street that you wrenched the watch out of my hands. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the other gentleman say that you took it from under me, and then you said we must keep in one story. - A. Upon my oath as a man I never did, I disdain it.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Watson. Q. You are a plaisterer. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 21st of February, did you see the prisoner and where. - A. I met the prisoner in Bedford-street in the Strand, in my way home, as I was coming from my work; I saw the prisoner standing in a drunken position, I saw him reel against the prosecutor, and he almost knocked him off the curb stone into the road; the old gentleman ran after him up Bedford-street, I could not well make out what he said; the prisoner said he was an honest man, what did they mean by stopping of him; he said he had a wife and children, they directly told him to take the old gentleman to Bow-street for having his character taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. The mob was disposed to believe the prisoner at the bar. - A. Yes, soon after the alarm was given again, stop thief, Mr. Taylor happened to stop him; if he had missed, Mr. Taylor he could not have missed me, as I was not above two yards from him when he fell, or not so far as that, he stopped him in such a way that the prisoner fell at a door, when I suppose the watch fell and the glass was broken; the watch was taken out of his hand by Mr. Taylor, I had got hold of the chain, and Mr. Taylor had got hold of the body of the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body's hand cut. - A. My hand was cut just here.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the glass of the watch. - A. It was broken upon the stones; the prisoner was taken to Bow-street and the watch also.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you take the watch out of my hands. - A. I had part of the watch out of your hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the watch out of my possession. - A. I can hardly say.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you saw the watch upon the ground. - A. I saw the watch on the ground, and then he catched it in his hand directly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you recollect when you was at the public house at Bow-street, that the gentleman said he took the watch out of my hands; you said no it was taken from under me. - A. I said the watch was on the ground, and you took it up again, but from which hand it was taken from I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>- LAVENDER sworn. Examined by Mr. Watson. I am a patrole belonging to Bow-street; I was present when the prisoner was brought to Bow-street, I produce the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the watch which was brought with that prisoner to Bow-street. - A. Yes, I received it from Mr. Taylor, I have kept it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. (to prosecutor) Look at that watch. - A. This is my watch, chain, and seal, the glass is out, I have had it five or six years; it is an odd sort of a thing, it opens behind, I know the chain and seal and the whole of it to be mine.</p>

Yes, I was waiting upon a lady about five yards distance from the prisoner at the bar, I saw her hand by her side, which gave me suspicion; she was drawing her hand up, as if she was putting it up under her apron, I immediately cautioned Mr. Acomb not to let her go out of the shop without examining of her, I immediately examined on the counter to see if there was any thing missing; I gave him a second caution; the girl told me that she had a pain in her belly, I told her I could easily relieve her of that disease, upon which Mr. Acomb immediately took the handkerchiefs from under her apron; I took her into the back room and sent for Mr. Sapwell.</p>

After my cloak was stole, I met Mrs. Harrison, she said she was very glad I found out the person that stole my cloak, she said she suspected her of stealing her cloak; I told her the prisoner had given me a ticket of a black silk cloak about three months back; she went to look at the cloak at the pawnbroker's, she knew the cloak, I gave the ticket to the officer.</p>

               <p>Q. Has the shop any communication with the house. - A. It is at the front of the house; I went out on the 7th of February, between three and four in the afternoon. In the shop I had before me a rail, where I put my watches to time; I had left hanging in the window several watches; I returned home near six in the evening, or a little after; immediately on my return I put up the shutters and shut up the shop, and then went down to tea.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any thing was missing. - A. No, I never looked, I shut up in a hurry; while I was at tea a person came for his watch or a glass; I went into the shop, and in attempting to take down the watch for the person, I discovered a third part of the rail entirely bare; there were about seventeen watches I have since found out were missing from off the rail in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you observe at that time whether the window had been broken. - A. I conceived at that time that somebody had come in by the door having been left open; my grandfather found it out, he sent to me at Bow-street, about eight o'clock, that he had discovered the window broken; between eight and nine I returned back to the shop, and found on the left hand of the window, a pane of glass was cut in a circular hole, big enough to admit a man's arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether that hole was there when you went out. - A. I can safely say it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Could an arm put in at that place reach the number of watches that you had lost. - A. It could.</p>
               <p>Q. Out of these number of watches, did you ever see any of them again. - A. One of them I saw on the 27th or 28th of February, in the possession of Crocker the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the same state as when you lost it. - A. There was a pair of gold hands on it then, it had no hands when lost.</p>

I am a coach-trimmer; I live at No. 5, Mercer's-street, Long Acre; I was at home at dinner, I heard a noise in the street, opposite to where I lived; I looked out of the window, and saw Crocker, had the prisoner and another, one on each side of him; I went out and followed them to Bow street, out of curiosity, hearing Crocker say they were the two lads he took up at Croydon; at the corner of Bow-street, I was close by the side of the prisoner, at the bar, I felt him touch my left hand jacket pocket, I wondered what he touched me for, I was not afraid of his picking my pocket, because I had my jacket on; I waited outside of the door while he took them in, in about two or three minutes I put my hand in my jacket pocket, I found a watch in my left hand pocket, it not being my property, I thought it was proper that I should give it up; I knocked at Carpmeal's door, I went into the little room where Crocker and the two prisoners were; the prisoner addressed himself to me, he said young man come and set down, and let us have something to drink, he seemed very urgent to get me to set by him; and after he had put that question to me twice over, I looked at him very steadfast, and said what did you put that watch in my pocket for, he then said, I put that watch in your pocket, I never saw you before in all my life, you b - y thief; I left the watch in Crocker's custody; I am positive no one put the watch in my pocket but the prisoner, because I felt him touch me so plain, and I had my hands in my pockets before when I was walking along.

               <p>Q. Did you see the person of the prisoner before you received the blow from him, so as to be certain that it is the same man. - A. I saw the prisoner as soon as he attempted to strike me, not before; the tall man who had been talking to me before struck me another blow on the breast, I fell to the ground, the prisoner struck me again, before I could recover to get up, he likewise kicked and stamped upon me; he said I was a bl - y fo - e, my hat came off, the prisoner gave it a kick from me; the other two men took it up hastily.</p>
               <p>Q. There were two others besides. - A. I think there was six, but five I saw; a short man came up and said you are a bl - y f - e, the prisoner had said so before; aye, aye, says the prisoner, we'll do his business for him; he then rushed his hand into my pocket, while with his other hand he had hold of my handkerchief in order to choak me, by drawing my neck handkerchief very tight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take anything from you at all. - A. No, I had nothing in my pocket:</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a watch. - A. Yes, the tall one put his hand in my breeches pocket, they attempted to get my watch; I had the chain concealed in the inside, they could not get at it; I usually carry it in that manner. The short one said, do you want anything to do his business, we will rip the bl - y f - e open; the short one put his hand to his pocket and drawed his knife, held it to my head, offering it to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he hold it for, did he demand any property. - A. In order to do some execution with it, he struck at me in order to stab me, but I struck his hand away, I struggled, I got up, and shrieked out Murder as loud as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand by what they did, that they wanted to stab you. - A. The expression used was, Cut him open, we will cut his t - st - s off, and make him an entire figure. When I shrieked out murder, two gentlemen came from Broker-row; the prisoner attempted to strike me again, I took hold of him by the collar, and never loosed him; he was conducted to the watchhouse by the assistance of these gentlemen; the other men all ran away when they came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Are either of these two gentlemen here. - A. No, the watchhouse was rather in a confused state, because the watchmen were coming to their evening duty.</p>
               <p>Q. That does not explain to me why you did not learn these two gentlemen's names. - A. When he was taken into the watchhouse the door was put to immediately, I could not utter a word for five minutes, when they opened the door, which was full ten minutes, the gentlemen were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the watchman here. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the hat carried away. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you saw two little ones, and they carried it off, and they then returned afterwards in order to cut your throat. - A. The short one returned, that was the time that he drawed his knife.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they want to cut your throat for, what was there to hinder them, there was six of them about you, do you apprehend that they wanted to kill you; what could they want to kill you for, you had nothing about your person. - A. I cannot say, I prevented being cut by striking his arm off.</p>
               <p>Q. What way of life are you in. - A. I am a <rs id="t18060416-26-viclabel145" type="occupation">shoemaker</rs>

               <p>Q. How came you not to have the watchman here. - A. The officer who took him in charge attended the three examinations at Worship-street, I called upon him to know whether he should attend the trial, he said he was not bound over, and without he had been bound over he should not attend.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you had got a watch in your pocket at the time the attack was made upon you, can you shew me the watch. - A. It is at home in my box.</p>

               <p>Q. You have no clock in the house. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a watch, and for the purpose of the use of your house you lock it up in your box, have you got the key of the box in your pocket now. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. May I ask you what the maker's name of the watch is. - A. I cannot charge my memory with it, nor the number exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you can tell me this, that there is a a reward of forty pound upon the conviction of a man for a highway robbery. - A. No, I never heard it.</p>

               <p>Q. Which way were you then walking. - A. At that time I rather went to the right; the man was very importunate, and said, that he must have some money; he repeated several times that he had met me before only a night or two ago; I had only half a guinea and a seven shilling piece in my pocket, I gave him the seven shilling piece and told him to go about his business, he said that would not satisfy him, he must have the twenty pound; two men came up, and took me under each arm, said they were Bow-street officers, and that I must go with them; they hurried me down the street, I resisted, and said I defied them, I said I had done nothing that they could hurt me for; they all said that I had met that man a night or two before, and had promised him twenty pound, that they would swear to me any where; I said I had made them! no such promise, and would not give them the money, they said I must on account of my character, as they would all swear I had; one of the men whispered to me and said, I see you are a gentleman, you had better give him the twenty pound, and we will let you go; I was frightened at being surrounded by three men.</p>
               <p>Q. When all this was said respecting your character, what impression was made by that declaration on your mind. - A. I concluded that they meant to accuse me of some unnatural crime; I put my hand into my pocket and took out my purse; one of the men snatched it out of my hand and said now you may go; I run to Richardson's hotel, where I had just left a friend of mine (Mr. Wheathley), I told him what had happened.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in your purse and what sort of a purse was it. - A. A red leather purse, it contained a draft for eighteen pound, drawn by my brother

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Gurney. I believe you are a tailor and breeches maker in the Strand. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning of the 25th of March did the two prisoners at the bar, or any other person, come to your shop. - A. Yes, between eleven and twelve the two prisoners and another man, who called himself Muir or Mier, I am not certain which.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed when they called. - A. I went forward to take the orders from them, my foreman followed and said, I know one of these gentlemen, he had a suit of clothes when you were in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in the hearing of the prisoners. - A. Yes, I believe Bevan accosted me first, and Muir or Mier, the other man that is not here, they said that they wanted superfine great coats, and after agreeing for the price, my foreman measured them; the while my foreman was measuring Bevan and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160023"/>Muir, Hemmings said that he would have a waistcoat and a pair of breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that waistcoat to be made, or one ready made. - A. He concluded to have one that was lying in the window; I then showed him some stuff for breeches, he fixed on the Manchester stuff for breeches, and Bevan produced the draft.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that draft, and see whether that is the draft that Bevan produced to you. - A. I believe it is the same, but not in the same state in which I received it from him; that is the draft, I endorsed it.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave it to Lavender at the office. - A. I did, in the presence of the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did Bevan give you the draft. - A. When he presented that draft to me, he said, Mr. Lingham you will see if it is all right, and we will call in the course of an hour for the ballance; they all three left my shop; before they went away Bevan endorsed his name, he asked for a pen and ink, and wrote upon it G. Bevan, Grosvenor-street.</p>
               <p>Q. After they were gone did you take the draft to Mr. Fogous to be accepted. - A. I did, almost as soon as they went away it was accepted.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did they call upon you again. - A. They did not call so early as I expected, I left the money with my people, it was about two o'clock, they all three came together, I then gave them the ballance, amounting to 7 l. 18 s. deducting 10 l. 2 s.; I gave the change to the man who is not here, to Muir, who was a taller man than either of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time was the coat to be finished that was ordered. - A. The coat was to be finished for Muir by six o'clock in the evening, but it was got off till seven o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. When was Bevan's coat to be finished. - A. In the course of a day or two, and Hemmings' breeches was also to be finished in a day or two.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the prisoners afterwards at your house. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 28th you presented the bill to Drummonds, was it made payable. - A. On the 31st I did for payment, there was three days grace.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I believe the payment was stopped. - A. It was, and Hemmings was in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you to say that after your foreman told you he knew one of the persons, he measured them for the clothes, which occupied some time. - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. It was in the middle of the day. - A. It was, and publicly done in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. And Bevan, the person who was known to be in the shop before, was the person that gave his name. - A. He gave his name, and endorsed it on the back of the draft.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon their leaving you the draft, Mr. Lingham, as you are a man of business, I ask you was there any thing that lead you to suspect them, they giving you an opportunity of knowing whether it was good or bad, or whether it would be accepted or not. - A. That gave me a better opinion.</p>
               <p>Q. How long a portion of time was it agreed upon that you should have for making the enquiry. - A. They said in an hour they were to call.</p>
               <p>Q. So that after the person had described his name, and after they all had given you the same paper for the purpose of making the enquiries you thought fit, these persons came publicly to your shop again. A. They did, as near two o'clock as possible.</p>
               <p>Q. I think I understand you to say, my friend, it was not Bevan that received the money, but Muir, who is not here. - A. Muir received the money, but Bevan gave the check.</p>
               <p>Court. You said you gave the ballance of 10 l. 2 s. A. I paid the change in this manner; a five pound note and three one pound notes to Muir, Bevan gave me half a crown back and I gave him sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you send the clothes home. - A. By the directions left, they were all to be sent to Bevan's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was the only person that gave any direction, the others gave no direction. - A. No more directions than they were to be sent to Bevan's house, as Muir was to call at night for the account.</p>
               <p>Q. Then as to the residence of the other persons they gave no account. - A. They did not</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hemmings (to prosecutor). Did you ever see me at that time on the night you was robbed. - A. I do not know that I saw you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney (to Lingham). You say Bevan was the only one of the three who gave you his address. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the address that he gave you was Grosvenor-street. - A. Yes, I have another direction, one hundred and something in Swallow-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you got that direction here. - A. One of the officers has, I gave the officer the direction.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he give you the direction of Swallow-street. - A. At the time that he ordered the goods.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. He was taken in consequence of that. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he give the address to Swallow-street at the same time he wrote on the back of the bill. - A. Much at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not strike you the address being in Swallow-street, and on the bill is Grosvenor-street. A. The goods which he ordered while I was in the country were sent to Grosvenor-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not strike you as something extraordinary that he should write on the back of the bill Little Grosvenor-street, and give you a direction to Swallow-street. - A. That was where they were to be sent to.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he lived there. - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not attend to this bill to see if he had endorsed it. - A. I did not look at the back of the bill till it was shewn me at Mr. Drummond's office; on their leaving it me, I looked at the front of the bill (I saw there was three days grace) to see if it was good, I did not look at the back of the bill to see the endorsement.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean your observation went no farther than to the person to whom it was payable. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did he produce to you that purse, or a like purse - A. It was a red leather purse, like that.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you. - A. He said that was mine, after tendering the purse to me, to the best of my recollection that was the first thing that he said.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you come to the door to him. - A. I did not, I was called to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did you give to him. - A. I said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160025"/>it was not; he asked for the butler as I was informed by the servant, he again said it is yours, I said it certainly is not; I asked him where he got it, he said it was left at the Adelphi coffee-house: he then wished me to open the purse, I made an attempt, but was not able to open it then.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he open it. - A. I am not certain whether it was opened by him or me, it was opened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any papers in it. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these papers that are in it now, and see whether these are the papers that you then saw. - A. I believe these to be the papers, but I do not state any further; I then told him that they belonged to nobody at that house, but I would inform him where he would find the owner.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you tell him was the owner. - A. I am not certain whether I told him the owner of it, but I told him at No. 22, Sackville-street, he would find the owner of it</p>


               <p>Q. Do you remember whether you did not mention the name. - A. I do not know, I was busy at the time, there was company in the house, and I had so little time to spare.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave the purse back again to the man. - A. I did.</p>

            , at his original trunk manufactory.</p>
               <p>Hemmings's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, I was going up a street near the Adelphi, about half past nine o'clock, on Monday the 24th of March, I heard a noise in the street, and I saw a parcel of people together, there were two tall gentlemen had hold of this gentleman, who is here; one of the two men was a servant in livery, I asked them what they were ill using the gentleman for, they told me I had nothing to do with it, for they were officers, or if they was not, they knew well what they were about; the gentleman pulled a pocket book out and had it in his hand, one of them snatched the purse, and directly after that they all ran away, the whole of them, after they were gone I picked up the purse, and I took it the next day to a public house; I could not read myself, I shewed it to a gentleman that was in the house, I asked him if he could tell me who it belonged to, he said yes, if I enquired at Mr. Orde's, in Lincoln's Inn Fields, he believed there I should find the owner; I went to Mr. Orde's, in Lincoln's Inn Fields, I asked the butler if that purse did not belong to him, he took it and opened it, and said it did not, but he could inform me who it belonged to; he did not tell me the gentleman's name, but told me to inquire at No. 22, Sackville-street, and there I should find the owner; I called there that evening, Mr. Orde was not at home, the servant told me if I would call the next day at ten o'clock, I should see him; I called the next day at ten o'clock with the purse, I saw one of these gentlemen, I asked him if that purse did not belong to him, he said yes, it certainly did; he asked me how I came by it, I told him that I believed he lost it in a scuffle on the Monday night; he asked me whether I was there at the time, I told him yes, that I was coming by; he asked me if I was an officer, I told him no, I was not, but the two other men who had hold of him said they were; the next day I met with a traveller, after I had found the pocket book, I went with him to the Hit and Miss, the corner of Swallow-street; I bought a pair of stockings and a handkerchief of him; coming out I met with Bevan, Bevan asked this traveller how he did, would he have any thing to drink; Bevan, and me, and this traveller went back into the public house to have something to drink, he asked me if I knew any tradesman in town.</p>
               <p>Court. Who asked you. - A. Muir.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the traveller. - A. Yes, he asked me if I knew any tradesman in town, I told him, I did not; he asked Bevan if he did, Bevan said yes, he knew a taylor that made clothes for him; he said he took a check in the country, he would be glad to get it exchanged, he wanted the ready cash to buy more goods; Bevan told him he might get it exchanged by laying out a pound or two for what clothes he wanted; Muir asked Bevan what clothes he wanted, he would pay for them with the check, and he might pay him again, then he should be able to get his note exchanged; Bevan told him he would have a great coat; he then asked me if I wanted any thing, I told him no, I did not particular want any thing at present, but I did not mind having a waistcoat and breeches; he asked Bevan if he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160026"/>would put his name to the note, for he said he could not write himself; Bevan put his name to the note; and said to Mr. Lingham, I beg you would inspect into the note to see whether it was good or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you mean to say this conversation passed of his putting his name to the note. - A. This was at Mr. Lingham's.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not said any thing of your going to Mr. Lingham's yet, where was it that Muir asked you if you wanted any thing. - A. That was at the Hit and Miss in Swallow street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before you went to Mr. Lingham that the traveller asked Bevan to put his name to the note. - A. That was before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you went to Mr. Lingham's. - A. Yes, I had a waistcoat and breeches which I paid for to Muir; then I left him, and did not fee any thing more of him.</p>
               <p>Bevan's Defence. I was at Bath last December with a paralytic complaint in my arm; I saw Muir at Bath as a pedlar, he used the Lamb; by that means I became acquainted with him by going to see the papers of a day; on the latter end of December, or January I should say, I left Bath; I never saw Muir again till the 25th of March I met him in company with Hemmings at the Hit and Miss the corner of Swallow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say Hemmings you mean the prisoner. - A. Yes, he asked me to have something to drink; we returned into the Hit and Miss, and when we come out of there he presented the draft to me, which I took to Mr. Lingham's; he asked me if I knew any tradesman that would discount it for him, I said I knew Mr. Lingham, whom I had bought clothes of, and that I should tell him that it was not my draft, that it was his, that it should be left for inspection for an hour or an hour and an half; Muir said he had no objection to that, but as he could not write, he begged I would put my name to it, and he said that he had taken it in trade; he agreed that we should leave the note at Mr. Lingham's for an hour or an hour and a half, that Mr. Lingham might see it was right, at which time we should go again to get the balance. Muir ordered a great coat to be done that evening, as he was going out of town; he asked me if I wanted a great coat, I said I should like to have one of the same cloth that he had, but that at present I could not afford to pay for it; he owned me a pound note for being at Bath, he lent me another, and two pound I took out of my pocket and gave him, as he insisted to pay for the things out of his draft; I told Mr. Lingham a few days hence would do for my coat; on Friday evening I sent my wife for my coat; I have not seen Muir since, nor did I know that the note had been obtained in a fraudulent manner, nor I should not have presented it at a place where I was so well known, if I had meaned any fraud.</p>

On the 9th of April I went out of my house, I returned home in the afternoon with my goods, and put them under my window; at half after eight I had occasion to go into my yard, and when I returned I found my sash window open, and my bag and all my clothes gone, it might be rather better than a minute or two that I was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Your window was lifted up, what did you miss when you came back. - A. The property that was in the bag was one blue coat, one pair of stays, one shirt, one hare skin, one pair of old boots, six white aprons, five handkerchiefs, five pair of men's shoes, two petticoats, and there were four hats; I have not mentioned them all in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen any of these things yourself. - A. Yes, part of the property is in court.</p>

On Saturday evening the 1st of March, at half past ten o'clock at night, there were eight pair of boots on the counter, I went up stairs, and left the prisoner there with two other men; when I come down I found one pair gone, they were black in the sole, and the others were not. On Monday morning I asked the prisoner how many pair of boots he took with him on Saturday evening; he said seven pair, four pair to one woman, and three pair to another, to get them corded; on Tuesday morning I went and got a search warrant, I took the officer with me, and in his apartment we found three pair of boots, and ten pair of shoes; I knew them all to be my property, I came back, and had him taken up at my own house.</p>

               <p>Q. The prisoner was at work at your shop at the time that you searched his lodgings. - A. Of course.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him in these lodgings. - A. I do not recollect that ever I did, his name was on the door; most certainly it was his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. You may have a very firm conviction of it, but how do you know it. - A. This man is employed by me as a weekly servant, I give him several things<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160028"/>to do after his hours of his being with me; we found six pair of Hessian legs in his room (when we found these other things) that I had given him to work at home; he had earned eighteen shillings this week at home, besides the guinea I gave him.</p>
               <p>Court. Is he a married man. - A. Yes, and he has got a child; I have seen his wife at my shop, and she was at the lodgings, and she was in custody for one night.</p>
               <p>- HARPER sworn. I am an officer of Worship-street; on the 3d of March, the prosecutor came to our office, and took out a search warrant; I went with him to execute that search warrant in Paul-street, Shoreditch, and there I found the property which the prosecutor said were his, three pair of boots, and ten pair of shoes; I produce them.

               <p>Q. What state was the outer door in. - A. When I went up stairs I shut the door, when I came down again I found the front door open.</p>

             sworn. Q. You are a city marshall. - A. I am; on Monday the 31st of March, about nine o'clock, I went into Smithfield, I had been in the market but a few minutes, I was applied to by two or three people, saying, that there was a man in the market who had offered these two beasts to sell, and that they had no doubt but he had stole them; I went up to the prisoner, and asked him how he came in possession of these heifers; his answer was they were the property of Smith, who lived between Leicester and Northampton and as Northampton fair was on Tuesday he had sent him on with them to Smithfield-market; he was to sell them for twelve pound, or as near twelve pound as he could get, his master was going back to Northampton; he said that on Sunday morning, he met his master at Whetstone, who had about a score of the same cattle, and had sold all but them two. I then asked him what his master was, he told me that he was a jobber in cattle; I immediately told him that his master, as a jobber in cattle, knew better where to sell them than Smithfield-market, they being lean, I suppose one would calve in about three weeks; he gave no answer to that, but he had obeyed his master's orders; I told him I was so far dissatisfied with the account thas he gave me, that I should certainly take him into custody; I took him into custody, and secured the cattle, he was examined at Guildhall; I took him in custody, and he remained in custody till the Saturday, he was then liberated by the order of alderman Boydell, he pleaded poverty, and out of the money I received for the cattle, I was ordered to give him fifteen shillings, to convey him back to Northampton; on the Thursday following the prosecutor waited on me, hearing that I had the man in custody the week before, I gave him then an account of the man; I received information that he was seen working in the brick-field, at the lower part of Hoxton; I went to the lower part of Hoxton, and there I met with him; he has since had an opportunity of writing to his master, and they have wrote to Northampton, by the order of Mr. Kirby, and no man has come forward; I took him last Friday, this very day week, in the brick-field; the heifers were delivered by the alderman to

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My master is a man that deals in cattle in general, of different kinds, some good and some indifferent; I met him at Whetstone, he ordered me to go on with him, when we got partly out of the Heath, he says, I am a good mind to go to Northampton, you go to Smithfield, and if I am not there by seven o'clock, you sell them; so I came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160031"/>on, and put them in the pound, I asked one of the drovers to bring them down and tie them up; that gentleman asked me the price first, I told him I was not to sell them till seven o'clock, if my master is not here at seven o'clock I may sell them at the price he told me; I stood by the beasts till eleven or twelve o'clock to take care of my master's property; if I had known it was wrong, I had plenty of opportunity of escaping.</p>
               <p>Q. If you lived with a jobber that comes to town, when you was discharged why did not you go down to him instead of going to work in the brick field. - A. I wished to be here, as I expected him coming up; it was my intention to be near in town, if in case my master come he would come forward, so I got work in the brick field.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you observed during his service that there were any deficiency in your silver. - A. Yes, I had spoken to him many a time on that subject, his answer was that it was very strange that there was not more silver come out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the top shop. - A. That was the shop that I did not keep any account against; there was one shop that I did and one that I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the care of that shop. - A. No one particular, no farther than I trusted the prisoner to look after the silver when I was absent.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he mentioned any thing respecting any other person looking after the melting pot. - A. My son attended the melting pot, I used to find it very deficient.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 10th of March had the prisoner been out on your business. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On his return, did he bring you home four silver spoons wrapped up in paper. - A. Yes, he brought them from a shop for orders.</p>
               <p>Q. On your opening that paper in which the spoons were, did you find any thing. - Q. Yes, some silver filings; when I found the filings it rather alarmed me, I asked the prisoner how these filings came in the paper, he said he could not tell exactly, except it was from the workmen, which he was in the habit of going several times to the workmen to take the silver in and out, and bringing the silver in his pocket, he said that might be the case; I said it could not be so, for I had never met with such an accident since I had been in business; I askked him what he had in his pocket, he then pulled out some silver filings.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that the same paper from which he had taken out the spoons. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity might it be. - A. It might be worth about four pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before the constable came. - A. Yes, I went for a constable, the constable came and searched him, and in his right hand pocket he pulled out a pocket book, and in the pocket book were more silver filings; my son stood by, he immediately asked him to go up stairs, he went up stairs with my son, and in the prisoner's hearing, my son said the prisoner had confessed of taking the things away, and if I would forgive him he would bring all the things back; I said I shall say nothing to that, I must first have what you have taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with the constable to his lodgings. A. Yes, I there found eighteen silver tea spoons, fourteen silver salt spoons, four silver mustard ladles, three pair of silver sugar tongs, and forty-two ounces weight of silver filings; they were wrapped up in different papers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he state to you whether they were yours. A. Yes, when he went up into the room he unlocked the box and took out the different articles, and said they were my property; he gave them to me, I laid them on the table, they were delivered to the constable.</p>

On the 25th of February, about half after three in the morning, I stopped the prisoner with a piece of beef wrapped up in a great coat, the prisoner was in the Minories; I asked him what he had got, he said a farmer gave it him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what it was. - A. No, I took him to the watchhouse; the very same piece of beef I took from the prisoner, Mr. Pitt swore before the lord mayor that it was his property.</p>

            , No. 15, Hatton Wall. On the 20th of March, about half, past three o'clock I was in New Bridge-street, Blackfriers, I saw the Dartford post chaise come full speed down Blackfrier's Bridge; seeing it stop at the last coach in the rank, I stopped, I saw the coachman get off his box, he opened the door, and likewise opened the chaise door, took out the luggage and put it into the coach; on seeing him turn round from the chaise I observed him drop a yellow coloured watch, he picked it up, and put it into his right hand coat pocket, got on his box, and drove away towards Ludgate Hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the coachman. - A. Yes, that is him, the prisoner at the bar, I am sure of it, I have seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the gentleman that got out of the chaise. - A. Yes, that is the gentleman. (pointing to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the gentleman that offered a reward of ten guineas for the person that convicted the prisoner of stealing the watch; what way of life are you in. - A. I am a bedstead maker's apprentice.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you out with a bedstead then. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were standing in the street, instead of going about your master's business; you never spoke to the coachman before in your life. - A. I have seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. You may have seen a great many other men; what the colour of the horses were, you cannot tell me. - A. One was a dark one.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know the number of the coach. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long afterwards was it that you heard of a reward. - A. I never heard of it at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it that applied to you to come forward. - A. Trott, the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Trott to find you out. - A. My master went to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you go to the gentlemen when he got into the coach, if you thought the prisoner was doing a wrong thing; you heard of the reward, and so you thought you would go then. - A. I saw the prosecutor get out of the chaise into the coach.</p>

             sworn. I am an officer of Hatton Garden office. On the 25th of March, I received information from the last witness and his master, that induced me to apprehend the prisoner the next morning; he had been driving a coach exactly of the description which the last witness gave me; I saw the coach standing in Turnmill-street, near Mr. Fox, his master's, gateway; the last witness informed me where he lodged; Wellspring went into the tap, and saw him sitting by the fire, he came out and informed me, I went in and took him into custody, and searched him, nothing was found on him that led to a discovery of the watch; he denied any knowledge of it whatever; I took him to the office, and locked him up, being early in the morning; I received information that a person had been to take out some gold watch cases, which had been sent to Mr. Cox, a refiner, in the city, for six pounds eleven shillings and sixpence; I went immediately to the house of one Watson, in Clerkenwell, I saw Mrs. Watson, I challenged her of knowing something of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160033"/>a gold watch that had been described to be found near the Old Bailey, her answer was, that her husband was out with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find the watch cases. - A. Yes, these are the cases. (producing them, and the inside of the watch separate.) After this conversation, she said she had some part of it up stairs; she went up stairs, I went up stairs after her, and there I found it, and the gold chain, which is broke; the capping of the watch answers to the advertisement.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the watch chain and the inside part of the watch. - A. Yes; I took her into custody, and she then took me to Mr. Henshaw, he said he had sent his wife to Mr. Cox's to take them out; he afterwards brought them to the office.</p>
               <p>JANE FOX sworn. Q. Do you keep coaches, or your husband. - A. My husband, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. How many numbers do you keep. - A. Three.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what numbers they are. - A. One is 410, 151, 830.</p>
               <p>Q. Now which number did the prisoner drive on the 20th. - A. I do not know, we never keep an account of the numbers the men drive, sometimes my husband drives morning man, and he drives night man; he has drove for us a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing more about this. - A. No more than he said he had lost a watch the Saturday before this.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Wellspring.) What kind of a coach was it the man drove. - A. A dark bodied coach.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Fox. We have got three dark bodied coaches; I cannot say whether he had the orange coloured one out, or the dark one.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it a complete watch when you first saw it. - A.

             sworn. I am a journeyman cabinet maker; I have worked for Mr. Beecham, in St Paul's Church Yard, twenty-three years. In returning from dinner to work, on Thursday, the 20th of March, about half past two o'clock, going along Giltspur-street, I crossed the road where I saw something lye, which appeared to me to be a bit of metal.</p>
               <p>Q. Laying where. - A. In the road, in the coachway between Cock-lane and St. Sepulchre's Church, when I picked it up, I found it to be the outward case of a watch very much bruised, and defaced; I put it in my pocket and then looked further to see if I could find any other part of it; at some distance, it might be a yard or two, I then found the inner case, that appeared as if a cart or a coach wheel had gone over it, the chain and seal were attached to it; the seal was bruised, and whatever stone had been in it was not then remaining in it, and several links of the chain were broken; I then took up that, and when I had it in my hand, in the act of going to put it in my pocket, a man whom I do not know, that was going along the foot pavement, I presume by way of joke, called out halves, I not knowing it to be gold made answer I did not know it was worth picking up; I kept it in my hand, it was very dirty, I put my hand in my coat pocket, when I arrived at Mr. Beecham's shop, our porter and the house maid were both in the front shop, near the door, I said I had picked up the fragments of a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. That is all you found. - A. Yes, I found first the outward case, then the inner case with the works in it.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not said any thing at all about the works being in it. - A. If I made a mistake, I ask your pardon; I found the inner case with the works in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you suppose that any man alive believes a word that you have spoke. - A. I have spoke nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Why the very thing contradicts you to your face. (his Lordship to the Jury.) Gentlemen, look at the cap of that watch: you see the cap of the watch which has been bruised, and you see the other things, they have been pulled to pieces, the marks of the bruises on the cap and the case, are in separate places, and the inside works are not bruised at all.</p>

               <p>- HENSHAW sworn. I am a watch and clock maker. On the 24th of March Mrs. Watson called at my house, I not being at home, she called the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive a watch from her. - A. Yes, in the same state that you see it now, she said that it was found by a friend who had come to her to dispose of it; I weighed them, and gave her a direction to go to Mr. Cox the refiner, as they had not been advertised; I asked her that, she said if I was going into the city, she would be glad if I would call, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of your own knowledge about this watch. - A. No. (The watch identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know them before. - A. Yes, they lived in Chick-lane; I told Growket I could not afford to treat her, she then gave me a push by the arm, while the other prisoner picked my pocket; I felt her hand in my pocket, and saw her take the handkerchief out of my pocket, I endeavoured to take it from her, but she pulled the handkerchief with great force, and tore the corner of it with the money in it, then they both crossed over the way, and ran away laughing; I followed them into Brewers' Yard, Chick-lane, I went up stairs and asked them for the money, they refused giving it me, and

The man pushed me down stairs, I fetched an officer immediately, I went with him to Brewer's Yard, they were both in bed then; I think the officer got four shillings and six pence of them.</p>

             sworn. Q. You keep this public house, do you remember the Sunday morning this happened. - A. Perfectly well; the prisoners at the bar came in between the hours of six and seven in the morning, they called for a pint of purl and gin, which they had, Newman came in during the time they were sitting by the fire, and called for a glass of peppermint; the prisoners went up to her, and asked her to treat them, she made answer I cannot afford it; one of them catched hold of her arm, I cannot say which, I thought it was out of a joke, they all went out of the house together, that is all that I saw.</p>

               <p>Q. Then they appeared to you to be acquainted together. - A. Exactly so.</p>

             sworn. I am an officer of Hatton Garden office. On sunday morning the 9th of March the prosecutrix came to my house, and informed me she had been robbed; I went with her to Brewers' Yard, Chick-lane, to the apartment of one Golding, when I went into the room the two prisoners were both undressed, and in Golding's bed; in looking about the room I saw a pocket which Philips said belonged to her, containing a shilling, a penny, and a farthing, Golding and I I with difficulty found Growket's pocket, there I found two shillings, three sixpences, and three half pence, I then took them away; in walking along, Growket burst out crying, she asked me where I was going to take her to, I told her to New Prison, she then said she did not do it, but Philips did rob the girl, and she would not be hung for Philips; the next day the prosecutrix produced the handkerchief, the knot is in the handkerchief now, it is torn away from the knot; I produce it.</p>

At half after four o'clock I met a gentleman, he gave me a shilling, he said he was very sorry to see so many unfortunate creatures in the street; we came to the Distillers' Arms, and called for a pint of purl and gin, after we had been out in the wet and cold;

            . - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He is an inhabitant of the island of Guernsey. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you employed there under him for some years. - A. For one year.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Mr. Walker. - A. He had the charge of purchasing coals for his Majesty's barracks; I had the charge of going into the North, and making the purchase and sending of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any business besides. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. About the month of July, 1804, did you receive that letter from the prisoner Rochester. - A. That is the letter, I think it is his hand writing, I dare say it is; at the time I was taken to the Court House, on the last examination, I had Mr. Walker arrested for forty-six pounds, and from the cruelty I have undergone, I have been in irons, and under great agitations of mind, therefore, I beg I may be understood; I have had time to consider, and have considered every thing that I positively know, and if there should be any part of what I now relate should not exactly correspond with what I have related before, I humbly hope it may be attributed to the agitation of my mind at that time.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of a note from Rochester, did you call upon him at his house in Welclose-square. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, when you so called, give you a note for another person. - A. There was a note inclosed to that which I had, and a message was left, begging I would give the inclosed to Mr. Walker, at No. 22, Brookes'-street.</p>
               <p>(The letters read in court.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the letter so enclosed to No. 22, Brook-street, Fitzroy-square. - A. I did, I delivered it to a lady who came to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen that lady in company with Mr. Walker. - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she live with him as his wife. - A. Yes, I believe she did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that lady in return give you a letter to give to Rochester. - A. She did, I took it back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then see Rochester. - A. I did not; I think it was the morning following I saw him, I had a cup of tea with him, and then the conversation began; he said that he had a note from Mr. Walker's that a worthy and particular friend of Mr. Walker's was dead, and left a will (he mentioned the name of major Hockings), but unfortunately, there was only one subscribing witness, of the name of Mrs. Browning, and unfortunately for him, he understood Mrs. Browning had left the country, and was gone to America.</p>
               <p>Court. When was this. - A. July, 1804; I am not certain whether it was July, or the forepart of August; in all probability there would be some altercation in the Commons in proving the will, as she had left the country, and notwithstanding she had left the country, he believed it was a good will, but it would be necessary to have one or more witnesses to it; he said it was a good will, it was sufficient with her alone, if she had not left the country; that he, Mr. Rochester, had known me long, he had no objection of subscribing for one witness, if I would join in with him for the other, which I refused.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Was any appointment then made for you to meet any other person. - A. I think he asked me if I would call there the next morning; going by I called, he was more freer, we had some conversation, he said it was a good will, he did not see that I was under any apprehension of danger to keep me from not signing the will, the conversation was that morning merely the same as before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any appointment made by you and him, for you to meet any other person - A. He gave me a note, and desired me that I would meet Mr. Walker, either on the following day, or the day after, at twelve o'clock, at the Circus tavern, St. George's Fields, on the time appointed; I went to the Circus tavern, and found Mr. Gadson and Mr. Walker sitting together; Mr. Gadson had formerly been a clerk to Mr. Walker.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you have any conversation with Mr. Walker at that time. - A. None publickly, but by writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Has Mr. Walker his hearing well. - A. No, he is very deaf.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at that time use any thing to assist his hearing. - A. No, he frequently used a trumpet, but I did not see one that day.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did you and he converse. - A. He called for a sheet of paper, he wrote upon slips; and I answered the same way.</p>
               <p>Q. Was all the pieces of paper with which you held the conversation burnt. - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. What room were you in. - A. The coffee room.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what passed between you and him. - A. What was I afraid of, he assured me it was a good will; he asked me if I had any objection to join with Mr. Rochester in signing the will, he assured me it was a good will.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think that you conversed together. - A. We occasionally read the newspaper, I suppose we sat for an hour; he told me that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160042"/>was going to dine with Mr. Rochester at Wellclose-square; I cannot positively say whether it was the day after, or two days after, at two o'clock, he invited me to call and dine there also.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on the day appointed called on Rochester. - A. I called about three o'clock, dinner was done, I was ushered into the dining room, Mr. Walker, Mr. Rochester, and his brother, and another whom I did not know, were there, Mr. Rochester gave me a nudge, and I walked up stairs with him into a lodging room, he there put the question to me, he put into my hand a sheet of paper; on the left hand of it was the signature of Hockings, and the signature of Browning; upon looking at it I smiled, and I said to him that it was newly wrote, it was not dry; the whole of it appeared to be newly written, perhaps not half an hour; I asked him whom the signature of Browning was, he said, laughing, he did not know any other than the woman who lived with Mr. Walker; Mr. Rochester says he has offered me 300 l. and he says he will give you five guineas, and 100 l. when it is finished; at the same time I would beg to be understood when Mr. Rochester mentioned that, he said it in a laughing manner; on which I shall relate something on that subject.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and him return to the company. - A. I believe I went in and took a glass of grog; on the next morning I saw Mr. Rochester, he began talking on the same subject, I asked him what he meant by asking me to sign that paper, being so newly wrote, he said he hoped that I did not go away with the idea that that was the will, it was only a copy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on the day after meet Dodds. - A. I did, in Clare market; Mr. Dodds being a countryman of mine, we went into a house and had a pot of porter, in drinking the porter I broke open the subject to Mr. Dodds, says he, sir, if you will introduce me to the parties I shall be able at the first sight to know whether it is a good will or not, he had known many instances of good wills, but he had found great difficulty in having them proved in the Commons, when there were not sufficient subscribing witnesses to them.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see Mr. Rochester again. - A. About a day or two afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apprise him of what you had said to Dodds. - A. I did, he said he would mention it to Mr. Walker.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then see Dodds again. - A. I did not see Dodds till after I had seen both Rochester and Walker together; the only conversation then was, that Rochester had told Mr. Walker of Dodds, and that they should all dine at the Saracen's head at two o'clock, and they should be glad if I would come and dine with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who said that. - A. Mr. Walker and Mr. Rochester both together, I saw Mr. Dodds and

               <p>Q. When Walker and Rochester made the appointment for you to meet them at the Saracen's head, were you to appoint Dodds and any other person. - A. Dodds was to bring

               <p>Q. How was Rochester employed. - A. I think he was reading the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the paper upon which you and he conversed. - A. I think Mr. Walker threw them in the fire place, he tore them to pieces on coming away, I think the first and second piece he wrote to me was, I am sorry to find that you run away with a vague idea that what Mr. Rochester had shewed me I should suppose to be the will, it was no more than a copy; with respect to his having 300 l. that was also vague, it was nothing but his own mode of jesting with me, and as to Mrs. Browning, he knew she was a very respectable woman, he verily believed she had quitted the country and was gone to America, as to his living with Mrs. Browning the subscribing witness, was all false, he knew captain Browning her husband many years before, she was a very respectable woman; then Mr. Walker asked me what was my objection, that I would not join in with Rochester, Mr. Rochester got into violence with me because I would not join in with him, I owned him some money, he said I had deserted him, and he would arrest me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay and dine with them. - A. I did not, I went off instantly, I called at a public house before you come to the Saracen's head upon Dodds and

               <p>Q. Was that which Mr. Walker shewed him, like that which Rochester shewed you. - A. I do not think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. When Walker shewed it to Dodds, did Dodds do any thing with it. - A. He did, he took it to the window and held it up to the light and examined it, Mr. Walker asked him what he was looking at there, he said to Mr. Walker few people have had more experience in proving wills than I have, I have seen wills to be proved that the water mark on the paper was a year or two after the date of the will, but in that it is very good.</p>
               <p>Court. The water mark corresponded with the date of the will. - A.

               <p>Q. Was any thing said about money. - A. Upon Mr. Dodds being satisfied with the will, Mr. Walker said I have promised Eddington five guineas, and a hundred pound for him to sign it, Mr. Dodds said he had no objection to make the same bargain; Mr. Dodds was to see Mr.

               <p>Q. I think, according to my observations, you have been speaking about a couple of hours, have you been speaking from minutes, or from memory. - A. From memory, I should have been more particular if I had known any thing of this sort would have happened.</p>

               <p>Q. There was no dispute. - A. Mr. Champney was not with me above two months, he was under the necessity of declining.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you afterwards, for your profit, or for your health, get any where towards the West of England. - A. Never to the West of England, I have only been ten years from the North; I have been agent sometimes at Portsmouth, Gosport, and Southampton.</p>
               <p>Q. And sometimes at Plymouth. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Every thing was going on smoothly, and every body with whom you was connected were feeling their obligations to you I take it for granted. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. When you was down collecting of tythes about two years ago, by the order of Mr. Pearson, you had no dispute with Dr. Scott, the rector. - A. Certainly there was, I do not know any person that did business with him, but what had a dispute with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it ever happen at any part of your time that you ever had any concern with naval stores - A. I have attended the dock yard since, and purchased quantities since.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not deal in naval stores. - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. You used to attend the dock to purchase stores; where did you principally employ your capital, in purchasing naval stores. - A. I do not mean that I never bought any particular for any body, I have bought particularly to fit out one or two vessels.</p>
               <p>Q. That was about nine or ten years ago at Portsmouth. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there no interruption to that business, I do not know how to call it a business, as you did not deal in it, were there no interruption to that amusement or way of employing your money. - A. None whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever occasion to be a witness in a court of justice on the subject of naval stores. - A. No, I was never a witness in a court before to day.</p>
               <p>Q. You never was a witness upon any subject before to day. - A. I cannot charge my memory with it, I do not remember of being one.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I may take it down that you never was a witness upon any trial till to day - A. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Try; if any person was to ask me how often I had been witness, I certainly could tell; do not you recollect that you ever was at any place in an aukward situation respecting of naval stores. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. After this you went to Harwich, did not you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you at Harwich. - A. About two years; I went there under Mr. Davidson to purchase coals for the various barracks on the coasts.</p>
               <p>Q. He was the contractor for government. - A. He was not the contractor, he found the money to purchase the coals.</p>
               <p>Q. He purchased upon commission to furnish the government with coals in the barrack department; you had a good deal to do in that department. - A. None but what I had to do for him and Mr. Walker.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever a dispute with either of them. - A. Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. You speak that rather doubtfully. - A. I had some with Mr. Davidson, and look every day to be admitted an evidence against him.</p>
               <p>Q. You had some disputes with Mr. Walker upon the same subject. - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. And I believe you expressed yourself what mankind in general would think in a remarkable way, that you would hang Mr. Davidson, and Mr. Walker, and some other gentlemen. - A. I never made use of such an expression.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are positive sure of it. - A. I am confident of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a Mr. Sinquagh. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never made use of any such expression against Mr. Sinquagh. - A. I am certain I would not to any man.</p>
               <p>Q. Attend deliberately, did you ever make use of this expression, That you could hang Mr. Walker, and Mr. Davidson, and the whole barrack corps, but you would swear for them that would pay you best. - A. No, I solemnly protest against it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then to be sure that we make no mistake, you assert that you never made use of any expression, that you would do for, or hang Mr. Walker. - A. I might have been exasperated at Mr. Walker's conduct in owing me the money, and he would not pay me; I certainly was exasperated.</p>
               <p>Q. When one arrests a man for a debt, we suppose the law will make him pay it; did you ever make use of such an expression at any time. - A. I never did make use of such an expression on any day, that I would hang Mr. Walker, I never said nothing of the kind to any person, I might in my own mind.</p>
               <p>Q. But nobody but God and your own conscience were acquainted with that; do you mean to have it distinctly understood that to no man or woman you ever expressed yourself in terms of exasperation against Mr. Walker. - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Dua. - A. I know a person of that name at Guernsey.</p>
               <p>Q. You never made use of any such expression to him. - A. By no means, I do not think him an object worth my notice.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever write any letter to any of the officers of the barracks board upon the subject of the accusation that you intended to make against him. -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160046"/>A. I believe I did, I think it might be to general - , it is a long while ago.</p>
               <p>Q. To be sure you said truly, it is a long while ago, in the course of a long life a man might forget. A. I think I did write a letter or two, I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of it. - A. I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is that ago. - A. About three years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. What were these letters to general - A. On the subject of repeated frauds.</p>
               <p>Q. The charge against general - was, that he had connived at these frauds, and this you communicated to him for the pious purity of teaching him to be upon his guard. - A. So far from that, I published a book of the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him any hint that he might redeem himself from these charges. - A. No, but he did me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the public loose such a valuable servant as you, when were you dismissed. - A. Yes, I was discharged by Mr. Davidson, I believe it is now better than three years.</p>
               <p>Q. I think the account that you have given us is, that your first acquaintance of the subject of this will of major Hockings was on your meeting Mr. Rochester - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he represented that that will was the genuine will of the major, but he had left it deficient in point of attestation, and then he and you not agreeing to become the subscribing witnesses, you were so good as to mention it to Mr. Dodds. - A. I have told you already that I did mention it to Mr. Dodds.</p>
               <p>Q. You never told any magistrate until you was taken into custody. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And at this time Mr. Walker, against whom you had a demand, refused to pay you that demand. A. Mr. Walker did not refuse to pay me, if I would have given him a letter under my hand that I had spoke falsely against him.</p>
               <p>Q. He would have paid you your civil debt for work done, if you had done that, how much was this debt you demanded against him. - A. Forty-six pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. He is not a pauper, he is a man passing in the world as having some substance. - A. He is.</p>
               <p>Q. He knowing that you had been present at the attestation of that will, refused paying you your debt unless you gave a certificate under your hand. A. He did offer to pay me if I would, but I would not.</p>
               <p>Q. And Mr. Dodds had the hardiness to arrest you. - A. Yes, for twelve pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. And the other refused to pay you forty-six pounds, unless you certified that you had traduced his character; Mr. Rochester is introduced into this indictment, have you never said that he was an innocent man, and if there was any thing wrong in this transaction, that you did not think he knew any thing of it. - A. No, I never saw Mr. Rochester after what had transpired, he went to the Baltic; he shewed me the copy, I am confident it was no more, I saw him in the month of December, even then he declared he was innocent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go to the Saracen's head and the Circus to meet Mr. Walker, and the manner of your correspondence was on slips of paper, which were burnt, they were put in the fire. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that they were put into the fire, or was a candle called for. - A. They were thrown into the fire place, I do not know whether there was a fire or no, I said so before.</p>
               <p>Q. You have always said so, do you mean to swear that till I pointed out to you of a candle being called for, you had not represented it so. - A. I do not know but I did, I cannot charge my memory at this moment but they were thrown into the fire place.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the magistrate did you not represent that they were immediately burnt. - A. If I did, I must have erred in that, because I do not recollect that.</p>
               <p>Q. It seems to me that you have told me that you have been speaking merely from memory and not from minutes. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I was right that you speak merely from memory, not from minutes. - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you never did make any minutes of these interviews. - A. No more than when I was doing business for Mr. Walker.</p>
               <p>Q. I am speaking of memorandums of those interviews respecting major Hockings' will, respecting that you never made any minutes. - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you not only have not any minutes, but you never had any minutes of the transaction of the will. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Certainly not; then if you ever said that you ever had any minutes, that is not true. - A. I tell you when I did business for him I did make minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. I am not talking about that, but concerning major Hockings' will. - A. I did not think it was necessary.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I should think Mr. Eddington that there was some other man of your name examined at the police office, did it not then occur to you that you could not speak from memory, but that you had notes at home, which if you were allowed to consult, you might speak more correct. - A. This was some of the minutes that I had at home about the business of Mr. Walker, it lead to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it cannot be possibly true Mr. Eddington that the magistrate adjourned the examination in order that you might go home and consult them, and still less true that on the adjournment examination you brought them, or that you spoke from them. - A. I did not bring any such minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never stated that you had any. - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure of that. - A. Quite positive of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say in the presence of several persons at that meeting, you could not then speak accurately, you had minutes at home, which if you consulted you might, they adjourned their meeting, and on the next examination you said you had consulted them. - A. With humble submission I would beg leave to state that they gave me leave to go home to search my minutes, that they might lead me more into the business, and I searched every paper that I had; I saw Mr. Humphries a few days afterwards,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160047"/>I told him that I had found nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never represented that you had consulted these minutes, and could speak more accurately. - A. If I did, I did wrong, from the agitation of my mind at that time, it was impossible that I could recollect every thing that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you first examined. - A. I think it was two or three days after I was first taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Give us the day you was taken. - A. The 14th or 15th of January last.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your memory so constituted that you forget things that happen three or four months ago, and remember things of much later date, do you mean to swear that you did not say at your first examination that you had memorandums at home on the subject of your then examination, that examination was adjourned, and at the next you did not produce the minutes. - A. No, they gave me leave to go home to see if I could find papers that lead to it, but I could not find any.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not bring any. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, sir, I am to understand you that you did not at the second meeting produce any thing that you represented to be your minutes of the transaction that took place. - A. I do not recollect that I did, I have thought of it very serious since I have been in custody, I find I might have said more than I would be this day able to substantiate.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you put pen to paper at all about it since your examination, as you were apprehensive that you had said more than you could substantiate. - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you give it me. - A. I have it not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been making minutes of all this and left it at home. - A. What was the use of my bringing the minutes when I must not take a book in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have some minutes have you. - A. I do not know that I have.</p>
               <p>Q. As you had been making no minutes before you went to the magistrate, perhaps you have been making a book of minutes afterwards. - A. I recollected every thing as well as my memory would aid me, and I might make a little extract.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did make a little extract upon paper, from what your memory told you. - A. Exactly so, it was a serious point to me.</p>
               <p>Q. I should very much like to see these minutes, could you fetch them. - A. No, I do not know whether I have any.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know whether you have or have not been making little extracts upon paper, a very singular expression, it is such a one that since the world began was never made use of before, did not you say you had been making little extracts on paper. - A. I certainly have, I drew all the extracts as far as my memory would help me, from what happened at the police office, and from what I thought in my conscience I had said and done, and what perhaps I had said wrong at the police office.</p>
               <p>Q. What extent might this little extract make, half a sheet. - A. Five or six sheets or more.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose. - A. Perhaps I wanted to take a counsel's opinion upon it, as all persons had counsel, but I had none, I had an idea of employing a counsel.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore this little extract you made for your counsel, I only want to understand this, nothing is more common; then this is not a matter of conjecture or surmise, but you now remember that you wrote this. - A. To the best of my knowledge I had made some notes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no objection to my seeing them. - A. I have it not.</p>
               <p>Q. A man seldom burns any thing that he makes with so much care. - A. I do not know that it is burnt.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it ago. - A. Why sir, what is this to do in it.</p>
               <p>Q. As your memory is so treacherous, I should have liked to have seen it on paper much better, how long ago is it since you made it. - A. Perhaps a fortnight ago, I sent it by my wife to a certain person to take opinion upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you prepared it as a brief to instruct some person who is a counsel for you to day; did you ever in your travels meet with Mr. Crawford. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any dealings with him. - A. Yes, in a colliery.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago. - A. About thirteen or fourteen years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the money, or did he find all the money that went into the colliery. - A. It so far ended, that it ended in my ruin, else I had no occasion to be here.</p>
               <p>Q. There is nothing that you know against his character. - A. I have nothing to say against his character.</p>
               <p>Q. You are still in custody. - A. I was till this morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you are not discharged. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Potter gave an information against you. - A. Potter was wicked enough to swear it, Potter is the last man that I pay any regard to.</p>
               <p>Q. You was taken into custody before you stated any thing to the magistrate, and still remain in custody now. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. The first time that you had conversation with any person respecting the will, you were conversing of a thing that then existed. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. And to that there was one signature. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had afterwards the opportunity of seeing this will. - A. Do you mean at Mr. Rochester's.</p>
               <p>Q. Yes. - A. When Mr. Rochester shewed it me, I did not see it above half a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time it was an instrument that was executed, and to which there was a signature of a witness. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you say Dodds was to produce a person, supposing the will to be a good one. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had the opportunity of viewing the will before Walker appeared. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that Walker appeared, was not the will examined, and the object of the examination, according to the account that you have given of it, was to satisfy

Yes, I do remember now Dick Walker called again, he said then, so help me God, I would not have signed the will for a thousand pounds, but I always thought it was a good will, afterwards he seemed to feel himself uneasy on account of Mr. Eddington spreading it abroad that it was a bad one.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever hear him make use of any expression respecting Mr. Walker. - A. I did, in the year 1779, at the latter end of October or November; one evening when I was at tea at his house, he told me that he would hang Mr. Walker if he could, and he said that the gentlemen at the barrack office were all rascals, and a few days afterwards he repeated the expressions to me at the North Pier in Guernsey, he d - d and cursed them all as a set of villains and rascals, including Mr. Walker.</p>
               <p>A. I do not know whether you have been much acquainted with the moral character of Mr. Eddington. - A. No more than during the space of three or four months he was on the island; he caused a great deal of disturbance while he was on the island among the people then in the barrack office, for which he was obliged to ask pardon.</p>

               <p>Q. Since that time you have been a mineral water maker in Southampton. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he any part in that. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you recollect the time exactly that this conversation passed, it was in the year 1799. - A. Yes, I cannot say to the day, as he was but a short time there.</p>

               <p>Q. This is seven years ago what you are speaking about and the disturbance that he made in the barrack department was a fraudulent delivery of coals. A. Yes, something of that nature.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, let me beg leave to lay my case before you. The prosecutrix and me having lived together in habits of intimacy for several years; my mother died; leaving me a legacy to be paid at a future period, which the prosecutrix knows, she living at my mother's when she died, and afterwards with me; she having occasion to leave my lodgings, left her box with me, and knowing that I was subject to fits, gave me leave to pledge some of her articles, which were to be restored when I got my legacy; a difference taking place between us, she thought proper to bring me before the justice at Hatton Garden, and the said prosecutrix there promised to take the duplicates, and I should pay her the money by instalments, but instead of taking the duplicates she appeared at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. (to prosecutrix) At whose house did you lodge in - A. At Weldon's mother's room.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160052"/>Q. Do you know of any legacy. - A. She had something left in a gentleman's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her leave to pledge there things for her or you. - A. Never in my life, I had left them in the same room for three or four years, and I had the key of the trunk with me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Could a man carry that out of your shop without your perceiving it. - A. He might, I had not the least idea of any person taking the clock away, it was standing about six inches to the left where I was sitting, I was very busy at the time.</p>
               <p>- TURNER sworn. I am a pawnbroker at No. 1, Lower John-street Golden-square; on the 21st or 22d of February, I believe I received that clock from the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he is the man. - A. I am, I bought the clock of him, I gave him five pound for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before. - A. I never saw him before; in about a fortnight after the prisoner came again, to know if I would purchase a clock that he had in pledge, I told him that I was busy, if he would call again the next day I might, I wished to have time to take him in custody; he came the next evening, I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. (to prosecutor.) Are you sure that clock is yours - A. I have known it these thirty years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the crime that is charged against me. On February last, I was in a public house, a genteel man came in and asked me to pawn this clock, upon which I went.</p>

             sworn. Q. You are the son-in-law of Wilcox. - A. I am, I live in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. In the night between the 31st of March and the 1st of April, did you hear any thing in the night. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the house do you sleep. - A. In the first floor, above the shop in the front.</p>
               <p>Q. What time do you say it was when you heard any thing. - A. About three o'clock.</p>
               <p>A. What sort of a noise did you hear. - A. A rattling of glass, it appeared to me to come from the shop window.</p>
               <p>Q. On hearing this noise did you get out of bed. - A. I did, I went to the front window and threw up the sash, I saw two men cross the street, one with a wooden leg.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160054"/>Q. Could you distinguish at that time that one had a wooden leg. - A. I could, it was quite moon light when they crossed from the house; they made a stop about half a minute, by that time the watchman was coming along, crying the hour of past three; one ran off a few yards, and the other walked very fast.</p>
               <p>Q. When the watchman came near the door, did they run and walk the same way. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This throwing up the sash would have alarmed them one would have thought. - A. No, I threw up the sash very quietly, I put my head out of the window, and I at first supposed they saw me, I supposed afterwards they did not, because they came back to the window again; I alarmed Mr. Wilcox, and he came down.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the watchman gone by before Wilcox came down. - A. Not above two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with Wilcox into the shop. - A. Wilcox came down into my room first, where I slept; he instantly went down stairs, and I followed him, he then went into the shop after four or five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to stay so long. - A. There was a door backwards that we unbolted, that we might go back wards.</p>
               <p>Q. On going into the shop what did you observe. A. I saw a man at the window, pulling the glass out, with a handkerchief on his head under his hat; I perceived the hand in the hole of the window, the hand was moving the goods that lay against the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Wilcox in the shop at that time. - A. I believe he was in the back room, I desired him to go out to them, otherwise the goods would be taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. When Wilcox was gone into the back room you saw the hand in at the window. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us correctly what you saw. - A. I saw the hand in when I came back into the shop, still seeing the man standing at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the hand in at the window before you desired. Wilcox to go round. - A. Yes, and saw the goods move likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. You observed a man with a handkerchief round his head, pulling the glass out of the window, did Wilcox go out of the shop into the little room before you. - A. I believe he went out before me.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that after he was gone that you perceived this hand in at the window. - A. It was after he was in the little room.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose hand it was you cannot tell. - A. It was the hand of the man that had the handkerchief on his head, standing at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him then standing at the window, as you had done before, - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Say what you saw done to the goods. - A. I saw the goods move once or twice that lay across the window.</p>
               <p>Q. What goods were they. - A. Cordovan boot legs, I saw the hand move them as they were upon the shelf, I expected them every minute to tumble.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the hole large enough to have drawn out these boot legs. - A. I do not think it was large enough without taking the whole of it out.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in fact none of them was drawn off the shelf. - A. None, they were moved two inches from the place where they lay, but still on the shelf.</p>
               <p>Q. Having seen this what did you do. - A. I laid hold of the door to pull it open (as I expected the man standing at the window would be knocked down, Mr. Wilcox was gone round with an intent to do it), and with two sudden pulls at the door I opened it, I found it tied on the outside the first pull, I gave it a harder pull the second time, and broke the string, and then I went into the street, I ran across the street and seized the prisoner Bowen right opposite, he was standing still.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of Tools at that time.</p>
               <p>A. Yes, he was in the custody of Mr. Wilcox.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that Tools was the man that was standing at the window. - A. Yes, it was not half a minute from my pulling open the door that he was in the custody of Mr. Wilcox.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether Bowen, the man that you laid hold of, that you had seen him out of the window. - A. I saw a wooden legged man and another man, but I cannot swear to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Which is the wooden legged man. - A. Tools.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when either of the prisoners were searched. - A. I was, I am not certain from which of their pockets the instruments were taken; a person brought an iron crow, but where it came from I do not know; I tried the impression made on the place, and it fitted exactly the marks on the shutters.</p>

             sworn. I am the officer of the night, of the precinct of Wellclose, I arrived at the watchhouse about five minutes after the prisoners were brought in; Thomas delivered these things to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160055"/>me, I produce a gimblet, a flannel jacket, and a black bag, and there was a little saw, which I have had the misfortune to drop as I was coming along yesterday; there I understood were taken from the pocket of Tools, and this gimblet I understood was taken from the door, there was a mark of a gimblet on the post of the door.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I found the gimblet, it was bored in the post of the window, I pulled it out, and carried it to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Thomas) Did you receive a gimblet from any body. - A. Yes, from the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Wood) Do you undertake to say that you saw any of these boot legs moved up from the shelf. - A. Only being moved on the shelf, I saw his hand at the legs, the legs laid so close to the window, he could not put his hand in without shoving them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him lift them up at all. - A. I saw them move from him, I saw the end of one half dozen move round, I expected that they would be taken out when I went to Mr. Wilcox.</p>
               <p>Q. What size are the legs. - A. The legs are about eighteen inches long, and as the legs lay across the window, one half dozen was turned round from the rest, just at the time the hand was taken from the window, and the blow was given by Wilcox.</p>
               <p>Q. My question is whether you saw them lifted up from the place where they were. - A. They moved, I did not see them lifted up, only a drawing on, a little moving round.</p>

On the 9th of March I missed the property; the key of the room where the property was taken from, was taken out of the bar, and a strange key hung up in its place; about four o'clock in the afternoon the door was unlocked, the property was taken out, and the door was locked again; about eight o'clock in the evening she absconded; we did not suspect her to be the person that had taken it, till a person at whose house she was said she had robbed her of her things; my mistress went up stairs and missed the property.</p>
               <p>Q. That was on the 10th when Mrs. Gee missed the property. - A. Yes; I never saw any more of her till the 18th when I found her in a public house in Long Lane, with one of my wife's cloaks on; I left her in the custody of two men, while I went down to Hatton Garden office for an officer; when I came back again she had hid the cloak in the privy, then she was taken to our house, and from there she was taken to the office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. (to prosecutor) Mr. Gee, in the first place you recollect you gave me a guinea on Sunday morning in the cellar, and after that you gave me two pound notes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did I give it you for. - A. That is best known to yourself; you asked me several Sundays if you should take an apartment for me and keep me, and that very Sunday morning you made a noise about the key, you broke open your room door, and you said to Mrs. Gee that Mr. Davis's boy had taken the key out of mistake; with that you says to me, will you have a great coat or a cloak, I told you I never wore a great coat in my life; you went up stairs and brought me down the cloak, you know very well you would never let me alone when I was down in the cellar, every one knows your character, your wife, and there she is, has told me that she suffered shipwreck by your goings on; if I had taken your advice you would not have done as you have.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never spoke a word to you about what you have been saying, I solemnly declare to God.</p>
               <p>Court. Now Mr. Gee, upon the oath that you have taken, did you ever give her the cloak. - A. Upon my oath I did not, if it was the last word that I breathed out of my body I never gave her a farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came back the cloak was hid in the necessary. - A. It was.</p>

I went back into the kitchen, and one of the men called out landlady, I went to see what they wanted, she asked to go to the privy, I went to the back door and shewed her where to go across the yard, and she went, she had the cloak on when she went to the privy, I did not see what she did there, she went by herself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the cloak found afterwards. - A. Yes, it was found in a place that was broken in the ceiling of the privy, she must have stood upon the seat of the privy, and have put it into that hole.</p>

             sworn. I am a wood cutter; on Saturday between twelve and one o'clock the prisoner brought a board and set it up against the wall in the street, as nigh as possible to my house, he asked me if I would buy it, I says, did you come honestly by it, as I never bought stolen property in all my life; he says three times over it was his own property; I gave him a shilling in part, he was to come again on Sunday morning for the other shilling; when he came again for the other shilling he brought another board, I was not at home, my wife took it in, he desired her to let him leave it there.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the same man. - A. I am certain of it. (The board produced and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

(The board produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the same board. - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Sturdy) On the Monday when he came you took him to Marlborough-street. - A. Yes, I went to a neighbour of mine and asked him what was to be done, as I believed they were stolen goods, he advised me and said he would assist me in taking him to Marlborough-street, accordingly we took him there; that is the second-board that he left at my house, I should have taken him on Sunday if I had been at home.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Eaton) Whose board is that. - A. It is the property of Mr. Slade.</p>

               <p>Q. Is the property of that warehouse under your care. - A. It is, I am answerable to the company for it.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 9th of April was the prisoner employed in that warehouse. - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a great quantity of raw coffee loose and in bags also in that warehouse, it was in such a situation as he could get at it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And in the course of his employment he went in and out of that warehouse any time he pleased. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In the evening of the 7th of April, when he was coming out of the Dock premises, was he searched in your presence. - A. He was searched by Mr. Mac Donald in my presence, I saw a little bag of coffee taken out of his breeches, and one taken out of his hat, which contained more raw coffee; we had nothing else in that warehouse but raw coffee; I went along with the officer to the house where he lodged, the officer searched it, I saw a quantity of coffee found in a little back room under the bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you to be the warehousekeeper; the quantity of coffee that is contained in that warehouse I should think that it is impossible for you to state that you lost this. - A. We have too large a quantity to swear that we lost that.</p>
               <p>Q. I think there are a vast number of warehouses that have articles of this description. - A. Not in the Dock, out of the Dock there is raw coffee in a great many warehouses.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were employed in this warehouse as well as him. - A. I suppose fifty.</p>
               <p>Q. How much does this quantity amount to altogether that was found upon him. - A. Between three and four pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it found upon his going out of the warehouse. - A. Yes, he was within a hundred yards of it, but he was not gone out of the great gate.</p>
               <p>- MAC DONALD sworn. Examined by Mr. Bosanquet. I was on duty at the west gate of the Dock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner there. - A. I saw him when he was coming out, I searched him, I found two bags of coffee, one concealed in his breeches, the other concealed in his hat, it is raw coffee; I said to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160059"/>him, Tuck, you ought to be ashamed of yourself to do such things; upon my word, says he, I was led into it by others, he said he was very sorry for it.</p>

             sworn. I am servant to Mr. Newport at the New Prison. On Wednesday the 26th of March the woman was brought into our custody; it is a usual thing when they are brought into custody, to demand their bonnet, accordingly I asked for hers, she denied it, and the only reason was, there was so many men present she did not like to take her bonnet off before them: I took her to the women's side, then I asked her again, she rather refused, I was under the necessity of taking it, she put her hand up to the top of her head, and took the watch from the top of her bonnet; I immediately took it from her, and related the circumstance to the governor; he told me to take it to the sitting magistrate at Hatton Garden. I produce the watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. (to prosecutor) You took her up immediately, and took her to Hatton Garden. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not they search her. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He gave me the watch when he got into my room, he told me he had no money, he told me he would pledge the watch and give me some; in the morning I asked to let me go with him to pledge the watch, he refused, and I refused giving him the watch; I never had a single farthing of him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I gave her two shillings, and I had fourteen shillings and six pence remaining; I did not give her the watch, the watch was taken out of my breeches pocket when I was asleep.</p>

             sworn. I am a victualler, I live at the Cape of Good Hope, Devonshire-street, Portland-place. On the 16th of March, the prisoner came into my house, about nine o'clock in the evening; after sitting some time, he offered the watch for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160060"/>sale, he said he had been very ill, and was very much reduced, would be glad if somebody would buy it of him, he at first asked three guineas and a half, he came down at last to twenty-five shillings; the man came and asked me my opinion whether he should buy it, I advised him not to buy it; as he was coming by the bar, he wished me to lend him half a crown upon it; I took the watch away from him, and gave him in charge of the watchman. On seeing him bring the watch in his hand I thought he had stole it, I do not think he had any pocket to put it in. I wrote to the man who cleaned the watch at Edgware, and on Tuesday morning the prosecutor came to me, (The watch produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>Q. Did you examine it. - A. I examined it at the time, it was in such a situation as is unusually to be met with, it is generally in a large mass, as you may have seen it, it was irregularly powdered.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it. - A. White arsenic, it is generally made use of in a fine powder.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Goldsmith, and his wife, and child were all very ill. - A. They were all very ill and sick.</p>

               <p>Q. You impute the sickness from this arsenic to these persons. - A. To the suspending of the arsenic that they drank; when you boil arsenic up, it impregnates the water, the arsenic itself is not soluble in water.</p>
               <p>Q. If this arsenic was boiled up again and again, it would have been the same to all the water. - A. Not if it was not suspended, held up in the water.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you take in such a pot as that without suspecting her. - A. I did suspect her, but she evaded my questions by saying her brother and she had a few words, and the name that she told me corresponded with the cypher, she was better dressed, and looked a respectable person; she only asked two guineas, she seemed to know the worth of it; it was certainly an error of judgment, I confess.</p>

             sworn. I am constable of the precinct of White Friers. On the 20th of March the son of the prosecutrix came to me to take Clarke into custody; I took her into custody at the house of Mrs. Witts, in Water-lane, Fleet-street. In searching of her I found seven pennyworth of halfpence, and three duplicates, one for a pair of pattens for fourpence, the other a petticoat for half a crown, and the third was the duplicate for that handkerchief which the pawnbroker has produced. (The tea pot identified by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Clarke's Defence. That is my own hankerchief, and the hat is my own, I had fifteen shillings given me the night before, I gave thirteen shillings for the hat.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Blake) Look at that hat. - A. This is the the same hat which we bought, each of us had one of these hats.</p>
               <p>Weston's Defence. Mrs. Witts desired me to pledge the tea pot; I have lived with Mrs. Witts ever since I was twelve years old; she was obliged to quit her house, a gentleman lost his gold watch there, she then removed to the lodgings in Drury-lane; since I have been in trouble she was obliged to remove again to Clement's Inn.</p>

               <p>Q. How did he behave himself before you found him out. - A. He was the most useful man that we had, I treated him more like a brother than a journeyman, there was not a man that worked for us that had the same liberty, I believed him to be an honest man; when he was detected he fell down upon his knees, and said he was sorry for what he had done and hoped I would forgive him.</p>

             sworn. I am an officer. On Monday the 24th of February, as I was standing at the office door, I saw Mr. Page running towards me, I went up to him, he told me there was a woman that he suspected had got some stolen-shoes, I went with him the way he has described till we came to the pawnbroker's in Baldwyn's Gardens; I was behind

             there, and heard her offer these shoes for sale; Mr. Page had informed me that some of the shoes had something scratched out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160066"/>of the toes, that made me look at them; I asked her who made the shoes, she said her husband, but by something that fell from her conversation I found where the prisoner lived, he lived in a court in Saffron Hill, where I found a person of the name of Tiller lived, a hackney coachman, and the prisoner occupied two rooms on the ground floor; I knocked at the prisoner's door, the prisoner opened it himself, I asked him if he had any wife, he said no, I asked him if he knew a woman that went by the name of Tiller, I told him she was in custody on suspicion of stealing some women's shoes; I asked him if he had sent her with any, as she had said her husband was a shoemaker and had made them, and she was sent by him; he said that she was sent out by him, but they were his own making, and that he had done so frequently; I then left another person with the prisoner, while I went and enquired if this shoemaker worked for any one on Saffron Hill; there I found Mr. Carey almost immediately, he said this person had worked for him as foreman for eighteen years; Mr. Carey returned with me, immediately as Mr. Carey and I returned to the prisoner he seemed very much agitated, I told him I should search his apartment, we looked over the front room where we were standing and found nothing; in his back room (the bed room), there was a box, I asked him for the key, he said he had not got it,

             had got it, I told him that was impossible, I was so particular in searching her, I begged him to get the key, but I could not persuade him, nor could I find the key till after I had broke the box open; in that box, among other shoes and new leather, I found three pair of women's shoes, I then brought him into the front room and told him he must go along with me as a prisoner; the master told him he was a bad man, he was sorry for him, he never thought he would have robbed him, he could have trusted him any where; the prisoner went down upon his knees, after bursting out a crying, and begged his master would forgive him; his master was going to speak to him, I told the master not to go near him I would not suffer it; I told the prosecutor not to make him any promise or to threaten him, but to let him alone and go to the magistrate, and let it be settled there. (The property produced, and identified by the prosecutor's workmen, who had made them.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor has work brought in from them men regularly every day, and he sells them regularly every day; he cannot tell whether he has sold these shoes or whether he has not.</p>
               <p>Court. There is very good evidence for the jury to say they are his property, if you bought them you must know where you purchased them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. On the 8th of this month the prisoner came to my house between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, and offered a waistcoat to pledge; I observed at the corner a pin which is here now, and a little part of what I supposed it had been pinned to hanging to the pin, that gave me reason to suppose that it had been torn off from somewhere, I sent my young man round the neighbourhood to see if he could find out where it was stole from, he went to Mr. Lowther's. I took no notice to the prisoner, he had some suspicion that my young man was gone out, he went to the door, and said, Jane, why do not you come in, why do you stand in the cold; he took the opportunity of going off, I did not go after him, I knew he was well known at Hatton Garden, and therefore they knew where to find him; I am sure he is the man, his wife comes to our shop sometimes, her name is Jane. (The waistcoat produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>- STANTON sworn. I am an officer, I knew where to find the prisoner, I apprehended him, I believe he is a cabinet maker.</p>

               <p>Q. (to Mr. Page). Did he appear to have been drinking. - A. Yes, but he knew how to run away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was the man that I had in company with me at the door that gave me this waistcoat to pledge; I went to Mr. Page's, Mr. Page went out of the door to look at the waistcoat, I says, James come in yourself, no, says he, I will not, he wished me good night, and said I had better go home; I know no more of the waistcoat than a child unborn, I can get a waistcoat without stealing one; I can earn two guineas a week.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

Yes, a quarter before six o'clock in the morning; they asked me what time of the morning it was, I told them about a quarter to six, I came on and passed Lee Bridge, my brother was with me then, I passed on towards Clapton; then the man at Lee Bridge come up, he communicated something to me, I went forward and found Griffiths, and called him up; while Griffiths was getting up I went forward to see whether they were coming through Hackney, I was informed they were pursuing the Dalston road, Griffiths and and I pursued after them, I lent him one of my horses, I saw Griffiths speak to them, and I saw Munday strike him, they both run; Griffiths said I must pursue them, as he could not leave the property, I pursued after them, they had dropped their bags; the prisoners ran into a field, I went after them, one was secured at the end of the field, and the other further on; I called out to Mr. Botts, Stop thief, they were both taken; when Mr. Botts came up to them both the prisoners drawed their knives, they swore that if he attempted to touch them they would run the knife in him; Munday was going over the style at the end of the field, Mr. Botts then caught hold of his coat and pulled him back, and another man come to his assistance, who took the knife out of his hand; then I pursued after Landsdown by myself, and at the end of two fields I come up to him, he had his knife drawn in his hand then; just before I come to take hold of him I perceived that he chucked something away over some low paling of a poor person's cottage.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find it. - A. I picked it up after the man was secured, it turned out to be a phosphorus box, and one of the matches in it had been lighted, when I came up to him he was standing with his knife drawn at me, I kicked his heels up and threw him down, there was then nobody by but myself, he was turning on the ground, I struck him on the hand, and the knife dropped out, I got him up, I I told him his companion was taken, he struck me on the side, he was going to knock me down, when another man came up and he was secured.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of any suspicion, did you break the door open to see if any thing was missing. - A. I did, I missed a pair of sheets a blanket, and a pillow; she paid me one weeks rent before she went away; she told me that she was widow of Mr. Murry, a captain of a man of war who was deceased she was married again, she was obliged to keep herself quiet for fear she should loose her salary.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Last January I went to the prosecutor's house, being in little distress, I took this garret, I was to pay the rent weekly, when my week was due I asked them if they would take my money monthly, the answer was if it was sure they would; there was an old neighbour of mine that came to see me, and I was with her for three weeks; I went to the India House to receive my money, I then went to Mr. Bradley's to get the sheets, I told him they were not mine, I was going to return them to the people where I lodge, and pay my rent; Mr. Bradley said he must send for an officer, the pawnbroker knew me for many years.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe you have had your horses for some time from Mr. Gullan, a job master. - A. For more than five years.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe it was agreed upon that you were to find the coachman with board wages, and a livery. - A. It was; in the beginning of last year the prisoner was hired by Mr. Gullan, to drive my chariot, and I found a complete <rs id="t18060416-71-deflabel425" type="occupation">coachman</rs>

               <p>Q. On what day did you discharge him. - A. On the 2d of November I sent him and the horses back to Mr. Gullan; I gave him his board wages at the same time, and paid him all that was due.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he and his wife sleep in a room over the coach house. - A. They did, he came on the Monday and said he was going into the country to look for work, and begged that I would let his wife remain in the room over the stable till he got a place, I gave permission; I told him to bring me back the livery, and to clear the stable of every thing that belonged to Mr. Gullan, and to let me have the key; when I ordered him to bring back the livery his answer was certainly, so, the clothes are not mine, and I should not think of keeping your property; he disappeared from the stable that day, and I could never hear of him till the beginning of this month, I then caused him to be apprehended; he acknowledged before the magistrate that he had sold them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. This man was hired and sent to you by the man whom you hired the horses of. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He lives over Westminster Bridge, the agreement was that you was to pay the coachman so much a-week. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had only a pair of horses when he came, the third horse came the second day after the man came. - A. I did not agree with the prisoner at all, the master was answerable for the third horse, I paid Mr. Gullan for the horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not some difference between you and the prisoner about the third horse. - A. The man had asked me to give him something more, which I had refused.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you promised him to give him the livery for the trouble. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you dismissed him he had the livery on him. - A. He had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you give him permission to wear them clothes till he got other clothes. - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When first I was sent by Mr. Gullan to Mr. Sheldrake, he questioned me where I lived, I told him at Mr. Oliver's at Bath, whom I had lived with fifteen months, and if he did not approve of that, I would let him have a character of nine years I lived servant with Mr. Rutt; in consequence of that Mr. Sheldrake said I shall give you twelve shillings a week, I said I was very well satisfied with that, and Mr. Gullan's wages; I asked him respecting the clothes, he said he should try me with regard to what a coachman I was; in about a fortnight or three weeks I said to him it is time I should have my clothes, he told me to go to his tailor's, I in consequence went, and was measured for them, in a short time after, I was informed by my fellow servents that the clothes were not to be made; he said coachman, have you offended your master, I said I did not know, I went to the tailor and asked him the reason why my clothes were stopped, he told me it was the master's order; I went to my master and asked him if I had affronted him, he ordered me to go to the tailor again, to get my clothes as soon as I could, the clothes were brought home, at this time; Mr. Sheldrake gave me a guinea out of the chariot window, and on the day he ordered these horses home to Mr. Gullan he gave me my wages, I took the horses to Mr. Gullan, I asked him who was to pay me for looking after the odd horse, Mr. Gullan said I have only to pay you for the two; I went to Mr. Sheldrake on the Monday, I asked him, he looked at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160069"/>me very hard in the face, and said that he had nothing to do with it, and I told him I should summons him about wearing my own clothes so long, he said what do you bother me about clothes, have not I given you clothes; I asked him to let my wife remain over the stable till she got well; I got a place to drive a stage for Mr. Nash, for one guinea per week; he ordered my wife out of the stable, although she was in a poor condition, with two scalded legs; as I was driving the Woolwich stage, I stopped at Mr. Gullan's door, I told him that I had got Mr. Sheldrake's clothes, and if he would satisfy me for taking care of the third horse, I would return them; I kept the clothes seven months in the whole, and he never troubled me; Mr. Gullan told him where I was to be found, which was the occasion of my being dragged away from my family.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you loose your purse. - A. On the 28th of March, at a quarter after eight in the evening, I supped, I goes over and takes some tea and sugar to my daughter at Knightsbridge, it was near ten o'clock when I left her; as I returned I went into the Brown Bear, Knightsbridge, to have something to refresh me; I left there and come forward, that was about eleven o'clock, then I went to <placeName id="t18060416-72-crimeloc430">Hyde Park Corner</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was you drunk then. - A. No, I had only there a pint of beer and a glass of gin; when the girl brought the change back, I put the purse into my left hand breeches pocket, I thought proper then to go home.</p>
               <p>Q. High time. - A. I went out of doors and the prisoner followed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the house then. - A. Yes, she followed me out; when I was about fifty or sixty yards from the house, she came up to me and asked me to give her a shilling, which I refused, I told her I knew better what to do with it.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whether you and she had not drank together. - A. No more than others.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you give her part of your beer. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you. - A. A pint of beer and a quartern of gin, I drank but one glass.</p>

               <p>Q. First of all you had your supper, then you went to the Brown Bear, you staid there an hour, you could not stay there without drinking. - A. I had a quartern of gin there.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you went to the Triumphant Chariot, and had a quartern of gin, and a pint of beer, where the prisoner followed you out, she asked you to give her a shilling, you refused her. - A. Yes, she instantly made a bit of a push at my pocket, I missed my purse immediately, I called the watchman, he was at a good distance, two women came up and rescued her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they rescue her. - A. They wanted to do it, but I prevented them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she taken in custody that night. - A. Yes, immediately to the watchhouse, she was searched but nothing was found.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all that passed between you and this woman. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I went into the public house, this man was very much in liquor, it was about half after eleven o'clock; when the landlady was turning them out, he said he would not go, the landlady turned us out all together; He wanted to go with me, I would not go with him, he immediately charged me with taking the money; I never saw a farthing of his money.</p>

             sworn. I am a bricklayer. On Saturday morning the 22d of February, I bought a dozen of pantiles of a man of the name of Toosen, in Petticoat-lane, it was for a job of my own that I had to do; I went to this man and asked him if he had any odds and ends of tiles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner. - A. Yes, I went down into the cellar and handed them up to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you work for Mr. Story. - A. I did, but not at that time, he put them into the shed; that day I was working for myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose tiles were they that he out in there. - A. Them that I had took from Petticoat-lane to there.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to Mr. Story's cellar. - A. I went and asked the prisoner for some more, the cellar was open for any one, and when I had got more I was to return them to Mr. Story.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Mr. Story that. - A. No, I did not see Mr. Story then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the prisoner any money for these tiles. - A. No, I did not say I would give him any money; in the course of about a month after that I meant to give Mr. Story half a crown for them.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not mean to take them from Mr. Story without returning the same number. - A. No, or paying him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know her before. - A. I have seen her before, but I never spoke to her; she says, I wish you would be so good as to give me a glass of gin, I says the price of a glass of gin is no object to me, I put my hand into my pocket and took out about twopence halfpenny, and gave it to her; she kept intruding and followed me, I said, my girl, I do not want any thing to do with you, my wife and family lives about here; I live at about the middle of Sun Alley in Christopher's Court, I went by there to go to Red Lion market, as I had the care of some old houses there; I most times go there to see the things are safe of a night; this girl came after, and says, Sir, I with you would be so good as to give me something for a bit of supper, I have only a few halfpence; she came very close to me, I told her to get off, she says pray give me a few halfpence for my supper, and while I was putting my hand into my waistcoat pocket, she pulled my watch out and ran off where there were two or three people standing at the Red Lion passage, I never saw the watch again; on the next morning I went out in the market, thinking very likely I might see the person; she came out of Whitecross-street with: child in her arms, I passed her on her left side, I looked over my shoulder, I saw her look over her left shoulder and smile, I watched her into the house at the corner of the market where I had seen the people standing, and there I challenged her with it; she denied it, she said that if she had my watch she would have a better pair of shoes to her feet.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been so late, were you drunk or sober. - A. I was not drunk nor sober, I was what you may call a little lively, I had a little revived myself; I followed her then into the house, I told my boy to go to Philips the constable.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was entrusted to work for the company I belonged to, I work in the same street under a window in a stall, my stall had been been broken open twice; ever since my shoes and leather I have carried home of a night, I had my leather in my pocket when I went into this shop, I was stooping down to pick out of this box what I wanted, my own leather in my pocket rather come forward, I put my hand to prevent it from falling out, they saw it, and charged me with taking it.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Renney) Do you know any thing of him. - A. I have always seen him at work at the stall, he bears a good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Of course he not being on board at the time of any capture, he could not be entitled to any of the captures. - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that you know Mac Goven very well. - A. He was a favourite seaman, and always about my person.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you acquainted with his hand writing. - A. No, I was not in that habit of intimacy with him, he was merely one of my bargeman, and constantly in my cabin.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that certificate, and see the signature to it, whether that is your hand writing. - A. It is not.</p>
               <p>Q. May I ask you, as knowing these two persons Calder and Mac Goven so well, is the prisoner at the bar Mac Goven, as he represented himself to be. - A. He is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that he never was on board so as to be entitled to any prize money for the captures. - A. Quite sure.</p>
               <p>Q. What is become of Mac Goven. - A. I left him in the Carolina frigate, I came home with the admiral, he was on board that ship last August.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you leave him. - A. I left him on the 28th of February of the last year.</p>
               <p>Q. Is any part of that certificate your writing. - A. None at all of the certificate, it is so irregular (witness looking at the certificate). When I first saw the signature I had my doubts, I would not have so positively swore to it unless I had read it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You mean by that it is quite impossible that you signed that certificate from the irregularity of the body. - A. I am positive I did not sign it, and the invaliding of Mac Goven, who was never sick, but always about my person; I should not have signed the certificate which stated him being invalided; and the list of prizes are not in the order in which they were taken; if I had given him a list I should have given him a list of the prizes in the order they were taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember giving any certificate to Mac Goven. - A. I gave every man one when I came away.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not necessary for the captain to do so only when he leaves the ship; I observe the date of the certificate is three months before you left the ship. - A. Yes, which makes it inconsistent, when I was in Canton, it is dated where the ship was, and where I was.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are an officer; in consequence of information from that young man did you go to Brown's. - A. I went exactly as he described; in tracing Brown to Mr. Joblin, I enquired of Mr. Joblin if he worked there, I found he did, and he was gone with the waggon to the Hambro' Wharf in the city; finding he lodged in White Horse Yard in Wood-street, I went there, his wife was there; I found this piece of jennet undone, and rolled up in heaps inside of a half tester bedstead which was turned up in the room, I took it away and went to the Hambro' Wharf, where I saw the prisoners Brown and a waggon; seeing so many persons there I told him his master wanted him, I took him into a public house and there I told him what I wanted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160076"/>with him and what I had found at his house, he was very much alarmed, he was taken to the office, there he confessed in the yard that Pink was concerned with him and Pink had received part of the property; I then went to Mr. Joblin and waited for Pink returning home with the waggon, then I took him in custody, then Mr. Joblin, he, and I went in in a coach to search Pink's house, I forget the street's name, it is in Brick-lane, Spital Fields, we asked him if he lived there, he said he did; there we found a piece of jennet cut in the form of a child's frock, and part of it put together; Pink was taken to the office, they would not confess for two examinations, when they did it was taken in writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. These men were locked up in the yard at the police office, did you serve out any promise to them. A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What conversation had you with them. - A. Very little indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. I should take it that you locked the prisoners up for the magistrate to examine them. - A. Surely.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enter into an examination of them. - A. I did not; Brown told me if I would make haste and go to a person of the name of Frost, Cole Harbour-lane, Thames-street, I should find another piece, he thought he could not have disposed of it by that time, I got a search warrant from the lord-mayor, I found this piece at Frost's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You are now producing another piece. - A. Yes, Pink informed me that he had left a piece at his brother's, Mr. Robinson in Whitechapel; it is a dark piece with the mark of M. S. on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Frost's a public house. - A. Yes, I think it is the Dyer's Arms, or Distiller's Arms, I will not be positive.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You have said there were two examinations before they would confess, that expression implies an unwillingness in these men to confess. - A. It was two examinations before they would confess, Brown did confess on the second.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that no one said any thing to these men in your hearing. - A. I heard a friend say to Pink, Oh! you fool, the other has turned evidence, why should you keep so many things in your breast.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not that expression been made use of in consequence of something falling from you. - A. It had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you desired that friend to say that. - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was a good natured friend of the prisoners that induced him to say that. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You saw them sign their confession. - A. I saw the magistrate sign it, and I saw the prisoner Brown make his mark to it; I saw Pink sign his name, and the same magistrate signed it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. (to Ferguson) Is that your property. - A. I cannot see any mark to enable me to say; that mark which Trott has shewed me, I have no doubt of that.</p>
               <p>Trott. That piece was found at Brown's.</p>
               <p>Ferguson. The piece that was found at Pink's likewise, I think it is of the same quality.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. That is all you can say, they are of the same quality. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They never were in your possession. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When these goods were taken the papers were gone, which is a material thing, and the fag had been cut off, are they jane or jennet, are they not distinct species. - A. I do not know that they are.</p>
               <p>Court. (to Mr. Joblin) When this package came to your warehouse was the prisoner Pink in company with Brown. - A. They were both on one duty that day, they both came into the yard together.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the piece produced by the pawnbroker. - A. This is one of the pieces that was sent to Mr. Ferguson, there is S. M. on this, it exactly corresponds with one piece missing.</p>
               <p>Q. You believe from the inspection of all these pieces, the one that is produced by the pawnbroker, the other piece from Brown, and the piece cut out at Pink's, you believe them to be those pieces that you sent. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Your apprentice gave you an alarm. - A. Yes, on Wednesday evening the 12th of March, about seven o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not before seven. - A. It was before seven, I should suppose in the last quarter, I think it was in the last quarter before seven; as we came in it was seven o'clock, when I sent for an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had been in pursuit of the man it was seven o'clock when you returned. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned from the pursuit was not you gone more than a quarter of an hour. - A. No, I am confident of that.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard your apprentice call out Stop thief. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of light was there at that time of night. - A. It must be considerably after six, else we should have no occasion to have put lights in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had they been lighted. - A. They had not been trimmed for a great while, I suppose they had been burning nearly half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out was there any day light. - A. No; when I went out the first person that I saw was a woman, that directed me to pursue after the prisoner; when I got up to them they were threatening to knock my boy down for pursuing them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find them. - A. At the corner of Leg Alley, just about eight houses from the corner of Hart-street in James-street, there is a public house between my house and Hart-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came up to the prisoners they were threatening to knock your boy down. - A. Yes, when I came up I asked the boy which was the man that cut the glass, he shewed me him, I went up and took Lancey directly; directly I took him he threw something from him, but what I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you bring Lancey back to. - A. I brought him back to my own house; as I was coming back the boy pointed out Britten to me, I was so angry I did not look after Britten much, for I had been robbed four times in a month.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the man the boy pointed out to you was the prisoner Britten. - A. He was much the same size man, but he had a great coat on then.</p>
               <p>Q. You brought Lancey back. - A. Yes, and placed him in my parlour, and sent my apprentice for the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine your shop. - A. When the officers came, we went before the magistrate, and when I came back I put up the shutters before I went to the office, I had not examined any thing of my loss.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you went with the officer to the office. A. Yes, the magistrate particularly asked me whether I had missed any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between you and the prisoner. - A. No, I never spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you came back and examined your window. - A. Yes, I found half a pane of glass cut, and pushed in; one pair of velvet shoes were missing, and six pair of boots were huddled togher.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there room enough for a man's hand to be put in. - A. Before the officer and my boy I put my two fists in, and there was room enough for two more; I missed one pair of shoes, and about six pair of boots were huddled together and drawed up to the breach in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the care of your window while you and your apprentice were pursuing the thief. - A. Two young women and Mrs. Tapper.</p>
               <p>Q. They are not here. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not miss the shoes immediately. - A. My wife was alarmed with the boy calling out Stop thief as well as me, she went and stood at the door with these two young women till I came back, she went to the door as soon as me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you absent. - A. I was not absent four minutes.</p>


               <p>Q. You brought the man back again in four minutes after you left the house, did you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not found the shoes again. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he steal any ham at any time. - A. Last Sunday week I detected it on him in the evening, I was on shore the whole of the day, when I came on deck I found the mate had him confined.</p>
               <p>Q. The mate accused the prisoner of having taken some hams out of the ship. - A. Yes, we got a candle and lanthorn and went down below, and we found a ham under his head as a pillow in his hammock, I wished him to confess whether he had sold one, he gave evasive answers; I confined him on board that night, and the next morning I sent for a Thames police officer, who came and took him in custody; on the following day he acknowledged that he had offered the second ham for sale on shore; he offered to give me a guinea, provided I would say no more about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not offer him a guinea to my knowledge.</p>

             sworn. I live at Stone Stairs, Ratcliff, my husband is a victualler. About four o'clock in the afternoon on Sunday, the 13th of April, the prisoner at the bar came to my house and offered me a ham for sale, I told him I would not buy it, he went out of the door, in about a quarter of an hour he returned without the ham, with some money in his hand, I suppose he had sold it; he called for a glass of liquor, which he paid for and went away.</p>

             sworn. I am a Thames police constable; the prisoner was given in my charge on the 14th of April, together with the ham, I produce the ham.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is the ham I found under his head as a pillow, I am sure it is mine, we had a good many in a crib in the gun room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I went on shore the mate and me had some words; the carpenter had offered me some provision if I would stay on board, but the sails being unbent the mate was very angry with it, with that I took my bag out of the ship; the mate should have overhauled it; when I came alongside of the ship Nancy, I found there was something in my bag that should not be, I hoved it out on the lighter, this gentleman's mate was looking at me the whole time; I found that I was trepanned by some means, I stood by the lighter till I could get a boat to give me a cast on shore; when I came on shore I took the ham along with me, and when I went on board I took it on board again, and went to sleep, not knowing there was any thing laying to my charge; about nine o'clock the mate waked me, the captain said I had stole a ham and carried it on shore; I had a ham, and carried it on shore; I had a ham that somebody put in my bag, I brought it back, it was wrapped up in a piece of printed canvas; I was seen by the people on board with the ham, if they were but here they know it, but they are out of the way; I never stole nothing in my life from a King's ship nor a merchantman, I never was detected of any thing of the kind before in no place.</p>

(The property produced and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
