                  </hi> I am a law-stationer, in Tavistock-row, Covent-garden. Franks was in my service—I have know Whitley about twelve months—he was in the service of Few and Co., and was acquainted with Franks—after he left Few and Co., their managing clerk gave him some bills, which he wrote at home, but which passed through my office—on 13th March I procured from the Stamp-office, in exchange for allowance-tickets, two 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. stamps on parchment, and four on paper—they were brought to my house by Footman, and placed in a drawer in the counter—Franks was there when they were brought in, and he remained there—it is our custom to count the stamps at night, and one of them which was on paper was missed—I inquired about it, and inquired of Franks, but I could get no tidings of it—On Saturday, the 25th March, about a quarter past one o'clock, Whitley came to my house—(it is the practice of the Stamp-office, if any stamps are spoiled, to give allowance-tickets to get other stamps of the same amount, and it is usual to sell those tickets amongst law-stationers)—he brought this allowance-ticket, and asked me to give him cash for it—I said it was not quite convenient to do so then, but I would on the Monday, if he would leave it—he said he wished to make up some money, and I eventually gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it, deducting five per cent.—while we were dealing, Franks came in, and he said, "What, Whitely, have you been spoiling stamps?"—Whitley replied, "What is it to you if I have been spoiling stamps?"—Franks remained there till Whitely was going—he them said, "Whitley, I have a letter for you;" and he was going out to fetch it—I said, "Another time will do;" but I saw he was very desirous of going out, and I did not prevent him—he was gone about ten minutes—that anxiety to go out created my suspicion, and I Want to the Stamp-office, and an affidavit was produced to me, numbered the same as this allowance-ticket—it was written by Franks, in the name of Whitley, spelling the name with <hi rend="italic">ly</hi>, instead of <hi rend="italic">ley</hi>—I saw there the stamp that the affidavit alluded to—I believe it to be the stamp that had been stolen from my drawer—it had been written on by Franks—I knew it from his figures of being on the back of it—this is the allowance-ticket—here are two figures of 35<hi rend="italic">s. on it, one in ink, which is my writing—I do not know whose writing the other is—it looks a little like Franks'—I lost a book at the same time I lost the stamp—this is it—it has my name in it—it was kept behind the counter—it was found at Whitley's lodgings—here are some entries of mine in it— —the last entry is Franks' writing, which has no reference to my business at all—Whitley would have no right to have any book of mine.</hi>

On Saturday, 6th May, I was in company with constables Harvey, Neville, and Hawkins, in George-street, Foley-street, Tottenham-court-road, and saw the prisoner Alexander come from No. 27, in that street—I crossed over with the other constables, seized him by the arm, and told him I belonged to the police, and had directions to take him into custody, on suspicion of having in his possession counterfeit coin—I pushed him into a shop, put my hand into his waistcoat pocket, and found in it two half-crowns and ten shillings, separately divided by paper to prevent them rubbing—he said, "It is all right, you have got me <hi rend="italic">to rights</hi>"—I also found four half-crowns, five shillings, six sixpences, and seven fourpenny-pieces, all good—I then took him to the house he came from,</p>

               <p>and knocked at the door—it was opened by a female, and I asked her what part of the house Alexander occupied—she hesitated, and Alexander said, "It is all right, the top back attic"—we went to that room, and found the key in the lock outside—I unlocked the door, entered the room, and saw Wilmot at a table, with his back towards me, his coat off, and his shirt sleeves tucked up—I seized him and took him to a distant part of the room—on the table stood four galvanic battery jars, and four cups, out of one of which Wilmot took a sixpence when I seized him—Hawkins immediately took it from him—in the same cup there were these three other counterfeit sixpences in a solution, to receive a colour like silver—each battery jar was connected by a wire, with silver leaf attached in the cup in which was some solution—I produce a portion—the other cups contained solution and coun<lb/>terfeit shillings—on the table I found strewed, 25 shillings and 15 sixpences, all of which appeared to have been recently operated upon—on the window<lb/>ledge, which was a sort of work-bench, I found 14 counterfeit half-crowns, with the rough edges on them, after having been cast, and before being silvered, and three counterfeit shillings complete for circulation—I also found this piece of iron steel with a graining on the edge for the purpose of <hi rend="italic">milling</hi> the edges, to give them a perfect appearance—I also found these ten files, with white metal in their teeth, five powders of different colours, five bottles containing liquid, and these five plaster-of-paris moulds in a box near the window, three for casting half-crowns, one of which was warm, a double mould for shillings, and a double mould for sixpences—I also found two iron ladles, with a piece of white metal in one, hot, forming the <hi rend="italic">get</hi>, which is the refuse cast into the channel of the mould—several tin bands for the purpose of forming plaster-of-pairs moulds, with plaster adhering to them, seven gal<lb/>vanic battery plates, and some copper wires which appear as if they had been dipped in the solution, they were then dry—I also found a pair of large scissors, and two knives with plaster-of-paris adhering to the blades.</p>

               <p>but a very short period—the process was just commencing—I cannot judge how long they had been subjected to the process, as that would depend on the strength of the charge—there is a greater deposit on the first sixpence than on these—they might have been put in at different times, or if put in at the same time, might have a different amount of silver on them—they are evidently base—the first is not silver (<hi rend="italic">bending it</hi>)—I have torn off some of the silver, and the base metal underneath can be distinctly seen—I should think that sixpence could not have arrived at that stage in less than a quarter of an hour or ten minutes, but it is a doubtful point—the things pro<lb/>duced are quite complete for the purpose of silvering base metal—I put one of the solutions into the of the batteries, and another into one of the cups, and put into it one of the half-crowns produced by Brannan, uncovered, and I got this distinct deposit of silver on it—these shillings are all covered with silver deposited by the voltaic agency—they are quite complete—judging from the solution not containing a large quantity of silver, I think the pro<lb/>cess must have been conducted rather slowly, at any rate a quarter of an hour, or even longer—I was about two hours casing the half-crown, but there was very little solution—these sixpences found on the table have been sub<lb/>jected to the same process—they are perfectly covered, and are very well done—they would of course be wet when taken out of the cup.</p>

                  </hi> I live at 11, Page-street, Westminster, and am employed in the Royal Engineering department. On Sunday morning, 16th April, between twelve and one o'clock, I was in Regent-street, west<lb/>minster, which is to the west of the Abbey—I had just got to the corner of Vincent-street when I heard a slight cry, like a female <hi rend="italic">screeching</hi>—I went down Vincent-street, in the direction of the scream—I passed down on the right hand side, with my right hand to the houses—when I arrived at the centre of the street I saw a figure at the further end, which was very dark—I proceeded towards it—when I crossed to the other side I lost the figure—it turned out to be the prisoner—the first I saw was the figure of a female lying on the ground—I could not tell whether the other figure I saw was a male or female, but I judge it to be the figure of the prisoner—it was standing at the farthest end of the street—I went on towards that figure, and on going towards it I found the woman on the way—she was lying near the kerb, on the horse-road, with her feet towards the foot-path—she was lying on her front, with her face buried in the ground—her bonnet was on the ground, and her face under it—the prisoner was standing about two or three yards from her—he was standing between a gateway leading to a court and a post—there was no one there but him—I asked him what he had been doing to her—he made no answer—the woman was lying on the ground at that time—I asked the prisoner whether she was his wife, and why he did not go and assist her, or something to that effect—after a little while he want over towards her, then turned round and said to me, "I have stabbed her; I have killed her with this knife;"at the same time exhibiting a knife to me—before he said that to me, as he passed over to go towards her, I heard him say, "Maria!"—I am not certain whether he said" Get up," but he men<lb/>tioned her name distinctly; and while I was speaking to him previous to that, she raised herself on her arms a few inches, and dropped again instantly into the same position—I looked round for assistance, but could not see any one—I did mot go to the woman at all—my first impression was to go to her assistance, and my next was to take care of myself—I wished to keep myself from being implicated in it, as there was nobody there but the prisoner and I—there was but one lamp in the street—I got the prisoner towards that—it was on the opposite side—I moved towards it, and he came with me—I then saw his face—I did not take hold of him—I asked him again what he had done to her, and he again said he had killed her, he had stabbed her with that knife—I then went to the corner of Regent-street, gave as alarm, and returned with the police and others to the place where I had left the female lying—she was still lying there—she never moved afterwards—I cannot tell whether she was alive or not—the prisoner was gone.</p>

On Sunday evening, 16th April, I was shown the body of a female in St. Margaret's workhouse—it was the body of a person whom I had known before, by the name of Maria Eddons—she had occupied one of my rooms nine weeks before, and the prisoner was in the habit of sleeping with her—he cohabited with her there—he slept there the first night and the last night, which was the 14th April, the Friday before the murder—he only came there of an evening—he took no meals there that I am aware of—the deceased was a very sober person—I never saw her tipsy—they seemed to live very happily indeed—on the Friday evening they had a few words, but very trifling—they did not seem to be in any anger—I remember his saying something concerning Newgate, but I did not recollect the words—I did not hear any more threats, nor any threats indeed—I merely passed through the yard and in again—they lived in the back apartment—I have been examined before—I cannot say any more than I have said—I heard him say something about Newgate, and she only laughed—that was all I heard—I took no parti<lb/>cular notice of it.</p>

                  </hi> I live at 5, Cottage-court, Orchard-street, West<lb/>minster. I knew the deceased Maria Eddons, and also know the prisoner—I have seen them together several times—I recollect being at the New Star and Crown public-house, in the Broadway, Westminster, on the Friday evening before Maria's death—the prisoner was there, and a soldier named William Brown, and Maria—I have heard the prisoner say that he would make Maria his wife as soon as it laid in his power, if she would give the soldier up; and I have heard her say that she would not give the soldier up, that she would be with the soldier until the prisoner did make her his wife—nothing of that sort was said on the Friday evening, it was previous to that that I heard it—on that Friday evening I saw Maria go out of the public-house about twenty minutes to ten o'clock, with the soldier, leaving the prisoner there—I heard the prisoner ask her where she was going, and she said she was only going down to the bar, she would not be many minutes—she then went out with the soldier—she was gone about three quarters of an hour—when she returned the prisoner had left—she went away, came back, and asked me if the prisoner was up stairs—I told her no—she crossed the road to the other public-house, and came back, and told me he was there—she appeared to have been searching for him—the prisoner afterwards came to the Star with her, and I saw them go home together—they then seemed on very good terms—I saw them there again on the Saturday evening, from nine till about ten minutes to twelve, at the same public-house—the soldier was not there that evening—I saw them quit the house together about ten minutes to twelve—they then appeared to be on the beat of terms—I did not hear any quarreling or difference at all that night—I did not see Eddons alive again after that.</p>

                  </hi> I live at 5, Regent-street, Westminster, and am surgeon to the B division of police. On 16th April, at one o'clock in the morning, the body of the deceased was brought to my surgery—she was quite dead—I found she had a wound on the left side of her breast, just below the collar-bone—I afterwards found it had penetrated the <hi rend="italic">pericardium</hi>, and wounded the pulmonary artery—that must have produced immediate death—the wound might have been inflicted with this knife—it was nearly four inches deep, and must have been inflicted with considerable force—on making a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, I discovered an aperture in the chemise corresponding with the wound in the body.</p>

                  </hi> I am a licensed victualler, at Well-street, Whitechapel. On 29th March I was at the Lass of Gowrie beer-shop at Shadwell—I saw a scuffle—my hat was knocked off—Doig was there—after I got home I missed a watch from my waistcoat pocket—I had it when I entered the beer-shop—this is it, and this chain and two seals—I also lost a small gold watch without a chain—I had just got it from the watchmaker.</p>

IV, <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 86, <hi rend="italic">and the substantial part of the charge against you was, that after the celebration of your marriage with your present wife, you knowingly and falsely made to the Clergyman, Mr. Hamilton, several false statements, for the purpose of being inserted in the register of marriages; and on your behalf there were two objections taken by your counsel—the first was, that there was no proof that the Registrar-General had furnished books for the purpose of the marriage register being effected; and it appears that there was no statement in the first count of the indictment, that the register-book in question was furnished by the Registrar-General. The Judges have taken that objection into consideration, and they are of opinion that it is not at all necessary that</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">the indictment should allege that the books had been furnished by the Registrar-General. The allegation in the indictment was, that the register was made in a certain book furnished to the Minister for that purpose; and the Judges are of opinion, that is sufficiently proved by the fact of the book being the book that had been furnished; whether by the Registrar-General of some other person, is for this purpose immaterial—therefore they are of opinion that that there is no weight in that objection. The second, and the more substantial objection in the case was, that as the entry in the register-book had been made by the clerk before the marriage, the false statement that you made for the purpose of being inserted in the register, was disproved, because the entry had already been made; but the Judges, upon considering that point, are of opinion, that at the time of the marriage, and previous to the marriage, although as entry had been made by the clerk in the register-book, yet that the registration must be the act of the clergyman, and that the matter is merely in fieri, in the process of making, until the clergyman has finally ascertained from the party to be married what is the truth, or the statement that he makes as true, with respect to the matters which the Act requires him to insert in the register; and therefore they think that you were properly convicted upon the charge of knowingly making a false statement for the purpose of being inserted in the register; the register being at that time in a state in was the duty of the clergyman, if an erroneous entry had been made, to rectify it, and to give a sanction and stamp to that registration by the asking of those questions and ascertaining what it was that the party meant to represent as being true. Under these circumstances the Judges were of opinion that the first count of this indictment was fully proved, and that you were properly convicted upon it.</hi>

                  </hi> I am a clock dealer.

                  </hi> I am shopman to Mr. Marshall. On 22nd Sept. I received a parcel of goods from him to take to Manchester-buildings—I had directions not to leave them without the money—I god there about ten o'clock at night—I could not find the prisoner, he was not in—I did not leave the goods—I went about nine o'clock next morning—I gave the things to a servant—I sent them up with the bill—the bill was not receipted—then girl came down, and said he would call on Mr. Marshall—I said I was not to leave them without the money—after waiting some time, I went up myself— —I saw the prisoner, and told him I should be glad if he would pay me for the goods, as I had somewhere else to go to—he had the shirt on, he was dressing—he said if I would wait till he was dressed he would talk to me—I waited at the door, and when he came out to me I told him again I must have the goods or the money—he said I was not fit to wait on a gentleman; he should tell Mr. Marshall of my conduct—I still told him I must have the goods or the money—the wished me to take a reference—I said I did not want a refer<lb/>ence, I must have the goods or the money—he said he would not give me the goods or the money, he would see Mr. Marshall—I should think I staid three-quarters of an hour—I left him there when I went home—it was not my intention at any time to part with the goods without the money.</p>

On 16th April I went to the lodge, and asked the prisoner when he got the chicken—he said he bought it of a man in South Wharf-road—I asked his name—he said he was a stranger—if a man bought a fowl he ought to apply for a ticket—there would be no difficulty in doing so in an honest transaction—I went to truck 730, and found a large tea chest full of poultry—a piece as large as a book had been removed from under the cor✗ to make an opening—something had been extracted—I took it next morning to Newgate-market—it was there opened—it contained five layers of twelve fowls, but the top layer only contained eleven—there was a vacancy of the size of a fowl—the rest were stowed as close as could be.</p>

Three weeks before I was before the Magistrate, Pulbrook sold me a coal-scuttle, a pair of flower-tubes, and a stove—I bought this chamber, this knife and fork, and these ornaments, of both prisoners together.</p>

                  </hi> I am barman to Mr. Thomas Jarmaine, of the Grapes', Old-street. On this morning, a few minutes before five o'clock, I was roused by a ring at the bell, went down stairs, and found a policeman in charge of the door—the bar was in a very disturbed state—the glasses had been used, and brandy was spilled about the counter and on the floor, and some cakes were gone from some glass globes—I guaged the brandy-vats, and from No. 12 missed about nine gallons—it could be got from the foun<lb/>tain on the bar, which communicates with the vats by pipes—this two-gallon stone jar (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my master's—I missed some bottles from the ware-house adjoining the bar—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of them—the brandy found is of the same kind as we have in the vat—I went to the station, between half-past seven and eight, and found both prisoners there in custody—I was there shown some cakes—they were the same sort as were missing from the bar—I was also shown a dozen metal wine bottle labels, which are Mr. Jar<lb/>maine's property—I shut up the house the night before at eleven o'clock—I was the last up, and saw all safe—the door which the policeman was in charge of was barred and bolted—when I was rung up I found a window open in the warehouse, leading to a gallery—the window opens into the back-yard—there were a pair of large 4 steps kept in the back-yard—a person could, by raising those steps on to a shed, get through the window—we found the steps against the window—they had been kept against a hay-loft—that window was open the night before—it is generally open to air the place—I saw a rope suspended from the rail of the gallery, by which a person could swing himself down into the warehouse—Higham had been in Mr. Jarmaine's employment occasionally for eight or nine days—that would enable him to know the nature of the premises—I have seen Price there also.</p>

On the morning after the rob<lb/>bery I was sent for to Mr. Goss's—I examined the premises carefully, and, in my judgment, the robbery must have been committed by some person well acquainted with the premises, and from within—there were no marks of violence outside—I examined the coal-cellar, and found several pieces of wood placed in the corners, and the angles of the corner formed a sort of closet large enough to hide one or two persons—a person coming into the cellar even in the broad day light would have no opportunity of seeing any person concealed behind there—I received a description of Elliott and Hicks from Mr. Goss, and made enquiries in the neighbourhood where they had been in the habit of frequenting, and I could not meet with them—on 28th March, a week after the robbery, I went to the prisoner Nicholl's who keeps a beer-shop in Goswell-street—I asked if he knew of the robbery at Dr. Goss's—he said he did not—I asked if he had any knowledge of the two lads Hicks and Elliott. who had lived with Mr. Goss, and gave him a description of them—he said that two lads of that description had been at his house on the 21st; they remained there about a quarter of an hour; he knew nothing at all about them; he had never seen them before or since—on the Thursday following, the 31st, in consequence 4 of information, I went to West Coker, near Yeovil, in Somersetshire—I there saw a man named Randall, and re<lb/>ceived from him these two letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) bearing the London post-mark—I was in plain clothes, and wore a cap while at West Coker—Nicholls afterwards saw the letters, at the post-office—I had sent my brother officer, Elsom, to Nicholl's house, for the purpose of procuring his writing, and, in consequence of what he showed me, I went to the house on Wednesday, 5th April, saw Nicholl's, and told him that I took him into custody on suspicion of being concerned, with others, in the robbery at Dr. Goss's—he said, "Very well"—I searched the house, and found this portion of the <hi rend="italic">Morning Advertise</hi> newspaper of 27th March—I took him to the station, and on the road I told him I could show that he had written to Elliott—he said he had never written to one of them in his life—on the Friday following, in conse<lb/>quence of information I received from Mrs. Hatswell, I went the same night to Dartmouth, in Devonshire, and at the house of Mr. Fall, a boatman there,</p>

I heard of the robbery at Mr. Goss's—I was in the habit of going to Nicholls's beer-shop, both before and after that—I knew Nicholls, and I know the other three prisoners; I have seen them there day after day—I think I first saw Murphy there on 24th March; that was after the robbery—Nicholls told me that Murphy had got a coat and hat; that was not said in Murphy's presence—I heard Murphy say that a man named <hi rend="italic">Andy</hi> had pledged the coat—I had seen it; it was a dark cloth coat—I did not take any notice of it—I think it had pockets in front—Murphy said he had sent a</p>

Pearce, of St. John's street—I heard Murphy say (I do not know who else was present at the time) that he and the two boys went to Mr. pearce's house on the morning after the robbery, knocked him up, went inside, and stopped there all day, or nearly so—I do not remember hearing Murphy say anything to Nicholls about the two boys.</p>

                  </hi> I lodge in the first-floor front room at 10, Cale<lb/>donian-crescent, King's-cross. On Thursday morning I got up about six and saw the prisoner Kenerley leaning from the inside of the parlour window of Mr. Webb's house, nearly opposite me—the window was quite up, and one curtain rather crumpled and drawn out—he was looking towards the left; towards the crescent avenue—in a minute or two I saw the other prisoners standing in the crescent, outside the house, within fifty yards of each other—Kenerley got out of the window, dropped on to the cill of the next window, and came up the area steps and through the gate; they then went round the crescent, two of them together, and the other met them—they all then went together up to the window, as if they were going in again—Williams looked through the key-hole; the other two were on the pavement opposite the window, only the width of the pavement off—I then rapped loudly at the window—they all ran away, two one way and one the other—I informed the police about a minute afterwards.</p>

                  </hi> I am wife of John Theodore, of the Stag, Fulham-road in the parish of St. Luke, Chelsea—the prisoner lived with me a month—on 25th April I received information from Stevens, my bar-maid, and went into my bed-room, on the second floor, about twenty-five minutes to three o'clock, and, from a box on the table, I missed a gold watch and chain, seal and keys, two diamond rings, a brooch, two gold hair pins, a mourning ring, and a gold keeper, and from the barmaid's room adjoining, a gold watch, and from the room below a gold pin and silver pencil-case—my box was unlicked—I had seen the things safe about five minutes to two o'clock—the value of them is about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I sent for a policeman and searched the house, but found nothing—the kitchen window looks into a yard which</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184805150086"/>
               <p>leads into a skittle-ground adjoining the tap-room—about half-past one that day I was in the back kitchen, and saw the prisoner getting in through the window—she must have come from the yard—that gave her an opportunity of speaking to any one in the skittle-ground—I asked what she had been doing out there—she made no reply—she was servant of all work, and had no right in the yard or skittle-ground—it was after that I saw my property safe—the prisoner had no right in the bed-rooms in the middle of the day, as her work was done—I kept a purse in the drawer—persons who usually came into the bed-room would know that.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police inspector.</hi>) I was sent for to Mr. Theodore's about four o'clock, on 25th April—I satisfied myself that the robbery must have been done by some one well acquainted with the house, and in the house at the time—the place where the money was taken from was where a purse of money had been kept for a considerable time—the person must have known that, as the articles were taken from the corner in which the purse was usually kept—the corner was rummaged about—the prisoner was then brought to me from the kitchen—I said, "I must examine you: a serious robbery has been committed in this house"—she said, "Well; you may"—I put several questions to her—she said, "But why am I questioned more than any one else; I have not been up stairs since the morning"—I said, "It is necessary that all parties should be examined"—she was very re<lb/>luctant to be examined—the barman was then examined—a few days after<lb/>wards, in consequence of what I heard from him, I gave instructions for the prisoner to be taken—she was searched, and nothing found on her—a person must pass the tap-room door to get to the skittle-ground, which is a very confined one, to pass through the window into the kitchen.</p>

On 2nd April, between seven and eight o'clock, I saw the prisoners together in Stanmore-street—I knew them before—one had a cap, and the other a hat—they changed the hat and cap, and crossed over, one on each side of the street—they crossed back again, and went up to Mrs. Ginger's street door—(I did not then know whose house it was)—Johnson seemed to be putting a key in the door—Cummings was behind him, touching him—it did not open—they came down, and afterwards went back again—Johnson opened the door with something—they went in, put something in their pockets, and shut the door—I did not say anything about it till Monday night; I did not like to—I did not hear of the robbery till the next afternoon—I had no other reason—I did not say they went in, because their companions threatened that they would stab me.</p>

               <p>policeman after the prisoners went in; we did meet one before—he ordered us off, as we were making a noise—I went to the bottom of the street, and came back again—it was three-quarters of an hour after that that the prisoner went in—we then went to St. Pancras' workhouse—we were in the work house, and had to be in at nine o'clock—I got there before nine—the other boys went home—they saw the prisoners go in—I was in trouble twelve months ago, at Clerkenwell, for getting goods by flase pretences; I got six months—I was in trouble six months before that, for robbing my master—I nineteen years old.</p>

                  </hi> I live in Wellington-street, St. Luke's. On 15th April, between one and two o'clock in the morning, I met the two prisoners at the end of Brick-lane, Old-street—they came up and spoke to me—I stopped talking a few minutes, and they began to pull me about—I found Brown's hand in my pocket, and saw her hand pass to Handley, who was close by—I heard three or four sovereigns drop—I stooped to pick them up—I</p>

               <p>had previously had some loose silver in my right-hand trowser's pocket, gold ring, and twelve sovereigns, and one half-sovereign, in a purse—I know that I had the money in my pocket at the time I saw them—I put my band into my pocket after I saw Brown take her hand out, and I found nothing but the loose silver—the purse had been put back into my pocket, but it had nothing in it; the twelve sovereigns and a half, and the ring, were gone—I never saw the purse out of my pocket—I accused the prisoners of robbing me—they said the money they dropped was money they had taken over night—I called two policeman to my asistance—some money was heard in Brown's mouth—it was not found; she swallowed it—I saw them stoop and pick up the remainder of the money, except one sovereign, which I picked up—Brown told Handley to pick up some money, and Handley picked up some; I cannot say much—when the officers came up, I said that Brown had some money in her mouth—I saw her pass something to her mouth, and heard it rattle against her teeth—I had hold of her hand at that time—the officers took charge of both the prisoners—Handley struggled very much, and when we came back from the station we found the gold ring in the kennel, on the spot—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I can swear to it by its being scratched round the edge, and bent in two or three places—I have it in my possession since my wife died—it was her wedding-ring.</p>

About half-past one o'clock, in the morn<lb/>ing of the 15th April, I heard a scuffle up a court in Brick-lane—I and Reeves went up, and found the prisoners and the prosecutor, who was making a desperate effort to keep them in the curt—he said, "They have robbed me of twelve sovereigns and a half, and a ring"—he said Brown had put, her hand in his right-hand trowser's pocket and took it out from a purse, and she had just put some in her mouth; but previously, in passing some of the money to Handley, it had dropped, and that one said to the other, "Pick it up"—he said, "I have picked up a sovereign myself; they have picked up the rest"—the prisoners said they had not robbed him—I took Handley, and my brother officer took Brown—Handley made great resistance, and I saw her throw her hand on one side, and heard something fall, but I could not say what—I saw Brown with her hand towards her mouth, and I heard something rattle in her mouth; I could not distinctly say what it was, but I</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of David Crichton. The prisoner was in our service five weeks—on 2nd May 1 missed a lace veil from a hat<lb/>box, in the closet by the side of my bed—in consequence of seeing some flowers in the prisoner's bonnet I suspected her, and on 4th May went with my husband into her bed-room, and found in a hat-box the net handkerchief to which the had been attached—I found the veil between the bed and mattress—I also found in her box some lace cuffs, candles, and tea—she was not present—these are the things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are mine—my father called the prisoner up stairs, and she said in my presence she had found the lace cuffs under her bed, and did not know anything about the veil—I also found some combs which I had seen a week before—I had not seen the veil for three weeks.</p>

I was in the warehouse on 20th April, I heard some one come down from No. 51 floor very quickly—I followed him down—when we got under the arch I followed him very closely—he saw me and he was confused—he made a stand all at once—I have no doubt it was the prisoner—he stood still, and then walked by me and went into the water-closet—I then saw the bag of coffee lying in the kennel—Jordan and his horse were there—I pitched the bag up against the wall—I then called up to the other workmen to know how it came there.</p>

On 24th March I went to 14, Dake-street, with two children's hats and a cap—I saw John and Mary Ann Piper—John Piper took them from me, with the bill, and said they would be sent to Gravesend, for Mrs. Piper to see, and they could not be paid for till she had seen them—some men's hats were ordered—I afterwards went with three, and John Piper chose one, which was to be altered, and the two were then to be sent back—I called again, not with the hat, but to inquire about the hats and caps—I saw Webb—I received a cap I had left there the day before—I asked for the money, and was told the hats were at Gravesend, and I Could not have it till the following day—I went again next day, and saw John Piper, who said the caps had not been sent, Mrs. Piper not having decided on keeping them—I asked for the money—he said they could not be paid for till Mrs. Piper had decided on keeping them, and told me to call again—I called again on Saturday, and saw Mary Ann Piper—I asked to one see Mr. Piper—she said he was engaged in paying his men their wages, and asked if I was afraid of the money, as I called so many times—I said, "Yes"—she said she had lived with Mrs. Piper fourteen years, and that she was a highly respectable woman of property, and I need be under no fear, for I should have the money sent round by the servant either then or on Monday—I never got goods or money—I have only got one cap back.</p>

On 15th May, in consequence of information, I sent for her, and asked how the soap got into her room—she said she did not know, somebody must have put it there—I said, "I suspect you"—she said she did not, she thought there was a conspiracy, or something of that sort—there was 3 1/2 lbs. of soap, it was very common, for the use of the house.</p>

                  </hi> In March last I kept the Red Lion, in King edward-street, St. Martin's-le-Grand. My family consisted of three little children of my sister's, one maid-servant the prisoner Jane Walker, one man-servant, named William Roberts, and a person named Birchnall, who assisted me at the bar—I had a black box in my bed-rom, which contained six silver table-spoons, two desert and eleven tea-spoons, four salt-ladles, one pair of sugar-tongs, some forks, a silver watch, chain nd seal, four rings, a brooch a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note, two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, a promissory-note for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a stock receipt for 470<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the plate and jewellery were on a tray in the box, and the money and notes in a work-box under that tray—on 20th March I had two charwomen at the house, Hannah Shepherd and Mary Smith, the wife of Samuel Smith, of Philpot-street, Commercial-road, I believe—I had one lodger, named Hambridge—a person named Baker was there, as a customer—a great many persons came in as customers, but no other persons were living there besides those I have named—Mr. M'Millan was there that day, assisting me in the business, as I did not understand it—about seven o'clock, on 20th March, I sent Walker and Mrs. Smith to my bed-room, which is No. 1, to make the bed—the box was in that room—I had been in the room a very short time before, and the box was then safe—I afterwards sent them up to the top of the house, to remove a large old linen-press, which I wanted brought down—they would have to pass my bed-room in going up, but would not have to bring it down so far—one of the children slept with me, and the other two in No. 3, on the same floor, where the maid-servant slept—there were two beds in that room—about nine o'clock, in consequence of information from Birchnall, I went up stairs, and foud the box had been broken open—some of the things were strewed on the floor, and I missed the articles I have stated—there was a quantity of tallow grease on the box, as if the candle grease had been dropped on it—the two women would have had a candle when they went up—Walker has been with me since 26th Jan., but was with my late sister from 4th Nov.—she was in the habit of going to my bed-room when anything was required to</p>

I had received six half year's dividends at the bank on 470<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. stock, which amounted to 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is the warrant (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is signed by myself—I received the money for it from a cashier at the Bank of England, one 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes, and the rest in gold—I know the number of the notes—I placed them in that box—they were taken out of the box when it was broken open—I did not write my name on the notes.</p>

                  </hi> I am bailiff to Mr. John Scrafton Thompson, of Ilford. On 19th April I counted some sheep of his in a field at Barking—there were seventy-nine at four o'clock that afternoon, and between nine and ten next morning I went to the field, and one was gone—I traced some footmarks into an adjoining fields, and there found marks of blood, where the sheep had been slaughtered—I found the skin there;it was marked "J. S. T."—I knew it to be the skin of the missing sheep—I gave it to Corbyn, the constable—I was present when the butcher afterwards compared some meat with it—the prisoner are strangers to me, but I have seen Webb once or twice.</p>

Charrington's brewery—I could not positively sweat to King's face but his dress and size are the same—I took Webb to the station, opened his bundle, and found it contained about half the carcass of a sheep, quite warm—I afterwards saw the contents of the other bundle; it was about the</p>

                  </hi> I am a market-gardener. On 18th April, I was in my garden, which adjoins the Surrey canal bridge, at Deptford—I was about thirty yards from the canal—I saw the prisoner on the bridge with a child in her arms, folded in a shawl—I watched her for half or three—quarters of an hour—she walked about on the bridge—some showers came on and she went under the railroad arches once or twice out of the rain—I heard a man cry out, "There is a woman in the water"—I directly went to assist, and saw the prisoner in the water—she was off her feet, lying on her face, and the child was underneath—she did not move hand or foot, only her head—the water there is never less than six feet deep, and sometimes it is about eight—a rope was thrown by a man named Moore, and she was pulled out by about half a dozen people on a barge—she laid for a minute and a half or two minutes before she was lifted up, and the child was lifted from her—they were both taken out at the same time—when she recovered she asked where the child was—I</p>

I went after the prisoner as she was going home, and told her she was charged with throwing herself and the baby into the canal, and she must go with me to the station-house—in going there she said she did it in consequence of having words with her mother-in-law—there was a barge passing at the time, and three or four people assisted in getting her out.</p>

                  </hi> I am a millwright, I lived at the prisoner's aunt's, 6, Burton-street, Walworth. On Sunday, 23rd April, the prisoner came to my window and tried to get in—he said I was a government man, and said, "I belong to O'Connor, and O'Connor will be hung and I too"—I told him to go—he went away—in about ten minutes I went out for some milk with a jug, leaving my wife in the room—as soon as I got out the prisoner rashed at me and struck me with a piece of chair, three or four inches thick—my wife came out—he shut the door, leaving me outside—I heard my wife scream—there had been no quarrel between my wife and me—there was between her and the prisoner.</p>

The prisoner came to the window and threatened my husband—he went out for some milk and locked the door, and I saw the prisoner in the middle of the street heating him with a stick—I unlocked the door and went out to protect him—the prisoner came and shut the door, leaving me in the passage with him, and my husband outside—he pushed me down, walked over me, and struck me with a stick on the top of my head—it bled very much—I put my hand out to save my head, and received the next blow on my hand, here is the mark—a third blow came on my arm—I was down—I saw the stick</p>

                  </hi> I am coal-porter at Vine-srteer, Millbank-street, Westminster. On the 25th April, about half-past five o'clock, I went with three of four persons into the tap-room of the Lord Nelson public-house, Old Kent-road—I went to the fire to light my pipe; the two Murphys were there, and I had to pass them to get to the fire—I did not see Ward—as I was returning from the fire Cornelius his me in the eye with his fist—I had not said or done anything to him—my eye was <hi rend="italic">bunged</hi> up from it—I could not see out of it—I fell on the ground, and he kicked me at the side of my head and cut me—Michael was standing by and, as I was trying to get up, struck me a violent blow with a quart pewter pot on the head, which stunned me and cut my</p>

                  </hi> I am apprenticed to the prisoner, who is a shoemaker. On Monday morning, 8th May, I found two or three pieces of something that looked like pewter in the coal scuttle, and showed them to the other apprentice—my mistress happened to see it, and told my master—he tole me to go and shake a piece of carpet—I did so, and when I came in he had a cane in his hand, and caught hold of my collar, and hit me with it, and said, "Have I been melting pots?"—I said, "No, sir, I did not say such a thing as that; I said that it looked like pewter"—he only struck me once them—he told me to go and clean the outside windows—I did so, and then asked him what I should do—he told me to sit down, and make a ten-cord thread—I sat down to make it, and he then told me to wipe up some water—I went to get something to do it with, and he said I had got the hemp entangled on purpose, and began to cane me—I cannot say how many times he struck me; he kept on a good time—I struggled, and kicked him twice—he said he</p>

               <p>would learn me to kick—I then sat down, and went on again making the thread—I felt the blood running down, and when the other apprentice, Hine, went out with a pair to shoes to the Blackfriars-road, I told my haster of it—I had not mentioned it to Hine—I said, "You have cut my side open, Sir; "and he said, "It served you right, and I wish it was worse"—I did not show him the blood—the blood had been running half an hour when Hine went out—my master was in the room while I was working, before Hine went out; it was in the shop—my master was there all the time—there was a knife lying on the cutting-board, about a yard from my master—he stood up when he caned me—I did not see the knife while he was caning me; I saw it in his hand about ten minutes before—I did not see it again that day that I recollect—I do not know the moment when I was cut.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon, in High-street, Borough. About two o'clock, on 8th May, I examined the boy—I found a wound about an inch and a half above the hip joint—I did not probe it—it had the appearance of a stab—it went through the lining of the trowsers and shirt—I should say this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is very likely to produce such a wound—it must have been dine with considerable force to penetrate the lining and shirt—such a wound might be produced from various causes—it is quite possible if the knife had been lying on the bench, and the boy had stumbled against it, it would have produced it—it is not of any importance—it was a clean cut.</p>

                  </hi> I am wife of James Day Quy, a draper, of the Commercial-road—the prisoner was in our service four months—she left on Monday week. I missed two shawls, thirty-three yards of muslin, and a scarf—I had seen the prisoner with one of the shawls on, but did not know it then—my husband afterwards asked her if she had seen it—she said no—he charged her with stealing it—she denied it, and said she bought it in the City—I asked where—she would not tell me—I sent for a constable—Sergeant May came, examined her box, in her presence and mine, and found these two remnants of muslin—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are mine—she produced this shawl and scarf out of her box—they are my husband's—she knelt down and said she was very sorry she had taken them, but she had not taken the shawl and piece of muslin—she was not given in charge, but dismissed—she left next morning—the washerwoman's daughter brought me eight yards of muslin, which she had given her for a dress—I showed it to the prisoner, and asked her how she came by it—she said the apprentice, Jessop, gave it her—it is my husband's.</p>
