I am a widow, and live in Cambridge-street, Hyde Park, and keep a boarding house—the prisoner was about two months in my service—on Sunday, the 13th of August, I received information, and next morning I told the prisoner I missed a petticoat—she said, "What sort of one?"—I said, "With tucks at the bottom"—she said she had got one with tucks which was given to her by Mrs. Richardson—she unlocked her box and handed it to me—I said it was mine—she said it was not—I knew it to be mine—I do not recollect where I lost it from—it was in a drawer or about my room—it was made in the East Indies by a black man—I brought it home myself, and know the work—I told her again the next day it was mine—she said Mrs. Richardson gave it to her; but when I gave her in charge, she said it was mine—the policeman found a gold pencil-case and two pocket handkerchiefs in her box—the white handkerchief is mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Mrs. Ann Conway and two others, wholesale grocers; the prisoner was their porter for three or four years. On Friday evening, the 25th of August, in consequence of information, as the prisoner was leaving the warehouse with a basket, I told him to stop for orders, and asked if that was his basket—he said it was—I asked what was in it—he said it was merely the basket he brought his meals in—I said, "I wish to see what is in it"—he then said he was very sorry, he had taken a little sugar—I took the basket from his hand, called a policeman, and gave him in charge—the basket contained eight pounds of very fine lump sugar of a peculiar kind, my employers' property.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas King, and live at No. 20, Collingwood-street. The prisoner's brother, George Jeacock, lives in the front parlour—I knew the deceased for about a year and a half—she lived in Nelson-street, and was sometimes called Matilda Bailey, and sometimes Matilda Jeacock—she and the prisoner used to visit George very often in the front parlour—on Wednesday, the 16th of August, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, they were in George's room—I heard the prisoner and deceased at very high words, and heard very bad language; in consequence of which, I went into the room—the deceased was then sitting, with a pair of scissors in her hand, and the prisoner was sitting on a table by her side—they were quarrelling very much—the prisoner asked the deceased for the key of the door—she denied it, and said she would not give it him—he asked for it again—she said she would not give it to him, and she would run the scissors into his b—guts—they were both the worse for liquor, but the prisoner more so than the deceased—the prisoner desired her to put the scissors down—she said she would not—I begged of her to put them down, and she dropped them by her side on the floor—I picked them up, put them on the sideboard, and begged of her not to take up such things as those any more, as they might do one another an injury before they were aware of it—I was then coming out of the room—the prisoner said something to the deceased, but what it was I cannot say—she jumped up, took the scissors off the sideboard, and stabbed the prisoner with them in his left arm—I cannot say whether he took them out of her hand or out of himself, but he instantly stabbed her with them in the side—I saw them in his hand—it was done very suddenly—they were both in a passion—on receiving the stab, the deceased only gave one scream, and fell on the chair—I never heard any more of her afterward—Mrs. Jones came in, and we assisted the deceased—she bled very much from the stab—we let her be till Mr. Gillatt, the doctor, came in, in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—she remained in the chair till the doctor came—the prisoner sat on a chair by the side of her—she died on the Friday af<lb/>ternoon following.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Jeacock, and live at 20, Collingwood-street—I knew the deceased by the name of Matilda Boreham—the prisoner and her were in the habit of visiting my husband almost every day—they were living together as man and wife—at the time of her death she went by the name of Mrs. Jeacock—I saw her and the prisoner at our house on the Wednesday in question—they had been drinking—the prisoner came into the room in the afternoon, about four o'clock—the deceased said, "This is a pretty birth-day for me; if I had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I would spend it"—he directly took 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of his pocket, and said, "Will you spend this?"—she said, "Yes," and he went and got some beer—they began quarrelling—he said he would go to his work—she said he should not—an old gentleman came in and spoke to them about quarrelling—I left them and went home—the prisoner came after me in about five minutes, and then the deceased came in—he asked her if she would go home, she said, "By and by"—he asked for the key—she</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184309180015"/>
               <p>said she would not give it him, the door was open—they begin quarrelling about the key—I know she had the key, because I had seen it in her hand—they were at very high words, and used very vulgar names to each other—she then took up the scissors, which I think were lying on the table or side<lb/>board, and swore she would run them through him, mentioning a very bad word—he said he would knock her d—d head off, if she did not put them down—Mrs. King came in and told her to put them down—the prisoner then desired her to put them down, and she let them fall on the ground—Mrs. King picked them up, and put them on the sideboard—I tried all I could to pacify them—she took hold of the scissors again, and made a rush from the chair and struck him between the shoulders and breast—he was standing not a yard from her—he directly took them, whether he took them from himself or from her hand, I cannot say; but he directly stabbed her in the side, before I could rise from the chair; she screamed, and fell on the chair she rose from—I did not see any blood then, not till she was undressed—I saw her between that and the Friday when she died.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Shoreditch—I was called in to see the deceased, on the Wednesday afternoon, about five o'clock—I found her perfectly insensible, and sitting in a chair propped up against the wall—I had her removed to the bed, and undressed her—animation was re<lb/>stored in a short time—I found a wound in her side which I probed, and found to extend about three inches in depth, above the seventh rib—I gave her brandy and stimulants and she recovered a little, I then dressed the wound, and from the symptoms, saw there was some very serious injury—I attended her regularly till she died, which was on the Friday following—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I found the point of the scissors had entered the left lung, opposite about the fourth or fifth rib—it was such a wound as one of the blades of a pair of scissors might have inflicted—I am quite satisfied that wound was the cause of her death—she had no disease—I did every thing I could for her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the wound appear to have been recently inflicted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Quite recently—the prisoner was present when I first saw her—he seemed very sorry—I examined his wound, it was on the muscles of the chest near the heart; the clavicle, scapula and other bones are there—persons frequently recover after receiving wounds in the lungs—I probed the wound very slightly—I was satisfied that the wound entered the cavity of the chest,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184309180016"/>
               <p>and I considered it improper then to probe any farther—I probed about three inches—there are no arteries of very great importance within those three inches—if the wound had not penetrated the chest it would have been of trivial con<lb/>sequence—if any artery had been grazed by the passage of the scissors, the probing might have some effect on it, and therefore I did not proceed further—I closed the wound immediately—I administered brandy in the first instance, and good doses of sal-volatile—on the post mortem examination, I found a very slight enlargement of the liver, but nothing to affect her lungs—the stomach was perfectly healthy—it did not exhibit symptoms of inflamma<lb/>tion—there was inflammation round the wound in the lung which was pene<lb/>trated, the other lung was perfectly healthy—in a bad constitution, a wound not otherwise dangerous, is frequently mortal—taking a large quantity of alcohol produces an inflammatory habit, which is very dangerous—I am a member of the College of Surgeons.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk at the Police-court, Worship-street—I attended Mr. Bingham, when he went to the deceased's house to take her depositions, about half-past one o'clock—I was there about half an hour—she appeared to be perfectly still, in a state of collapse; but when spoken to she rallied, and spoke with a tolerably audible voice, and gave her statement very uninterruptedly—I took it down as she spoke it—this is it—the prisoner was present as well as Mr. Gillatt—and in answer to questions put to the prisoner, he also made a statement—she signed her statement, and the prisoner his, and it is attested by the Magistrate—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"The information of Maris Boreham, &amp;c.—I am a single woman, and live with the prisoner. I have got a wound on my side—it was done with a pair of scissors. I received the stab, I think, on Tuesday or Wednesday last, about half after five o'clock in the afternoon—it was William Jeacock, who is now sitting before me, who gave me the wound. I threw the scissors at him first, and then he struck me with them; he had been drinking, and was the worse for liquor. I had also been drinking. I believe we had a quartern of gin and a pint of beer between three of us. I have been living with the prisoner very near four years. He stuck the scissors into me, and I fell down from the blow; he is wounded on the shoulder; he was wounded by my throwing the scissors at him. I was excited by his using very bad language to me. I think it happened in the room we are in now, No. 20, Collingwood-street—I am thirty-three years of age."—"The prisoner says, 'We had been drinking together; I asked her for the key of Our lodging; we had words together in this room—she took the scissors from the table. I told her if she did not put them down, I would take them from her—we had more words; she dropped the scissors on the ground; we had more words, when she picked the scissors up, and stuck them into my shoulder. I took them from my shoulder and from her, and then in my anger I struck her with them.'"</p>

The prisoner was my errand-boy about two months back, and had opportuni<lb/>ties of going about the house—the area door opens into a small front area, beneath the street—there are iron railings across it—I was called up on Sunday morning, I went down and noticed that the pane of glass had been taken out of that door very carefully—the opening made was large enough to admit such a boy as the prisoner—one of the bars of the area railing was missing when I took the house, that might leave sufficient space for a boy of the prisoner's size to get between them; but it seems almost impossible that a boy could get through—there was no other means of getting into the area—the glass appeared to have been removed by cutting the putty round with a knife—I found the pane of glass in one of the cellars, underneath the street, on the other side of the area—it had been newly put in, I think, about the time the prisoner left my service—I cannot recollect positively whether it was before or after—I do not think a boy of the prisoner's size could reach the upper bolt when standing on the ground—the door was unbolted when I saw it—I did not observe any chair or stool on which he could have stood—I afterwards searched the house, but did not miss anything myself—I saw a broom and a mat left in the passage near the front door, which was open—it is usually fastened with two bolts, one at the top and the other at the bottom, a chain in the middle, and a latch—there are four or five fastenings to it—a boy of the prisoner's height, I should say, could not reach the upper bolt—I saw no chair or stool near, on which he could have stood—I do not recollect whether I had gone to bed be<lb/>fore the servant—I went to bed, I think, about half-past eleven—I did not exa<lb/>mine any doors or windows below stairs—I examined the front door; that was fastened and bolted in the usual way—my servant lived in the house before I took it—I had an assistant in the house named Barnes, he is now living with me.</p>

                  </hi>. I searched the prisoner's premises last Monday fortnight, and found a window-blind, some account-books, a gallipot, harp-strings, table-cover, a wooden board, some wrappers, pieces of veneer, and solid wood—I can speak to some from their general resemblance, and I can positively swear to the account-books—I had lost one blind from Judd-street, and one out of my cellar in Cloak-lane—I believe the blind produced is mine, and the wood at the bottom of it is the wood that was on the blind in my cellar, but the canvas belongs to the one stolen from Judd-street—to have done that he must have taken both—I missed a box, containing 120 or 140 harp-strings—the prisoner had access to it—I asked him if he had seen it—he said no—some time after I inquired about it, and he said he should not wonder if we lost all the things in the house, if we kept that girl Elizabeth in the house—I spoke to the girl; her boxes were searched, but nothing found—a week or two after we lost two or three napkins from up stairs, and discharged her—this table-cover was in my care, and was lost from a sale at Tottenham-court-road—I had an allowance to make for it—the prisoner told me he was sorry to say he had taken it from there—here are a quantity of pieces of mahogany and veneer—this is a parcel of mazephyr, or unrated wood—it was not in the tariff, and escaped the duty at the docks—I am not aware of any parcel of this wood imported into this country, except what I had—I never sold any of it, only as manufactured—I missed veneers from time to time—I have upwards of a hundred pieces of this wood, some of it very small—I have every reason to believe all these articles are mine—the account-books were warehoused with me by Parrington and Co.—they were in a large cupboard, which he had ac<lb/>cess</p>

               <p>to at times—I found some of the veneers and mahogany in a box under the prisoner's counter—he has a small shop in Dog-row, Bethnal-green—I know some of this wood as well as I should know the features of a person—here is a box made out of them, a zephyr wood—it has only been polished with wax—this is the wood I first missed, and discharged a man for—it is valuble, and is called snake wood—I lost eleven veneers of it, and it was said my foreman had stolen it.</p>

               <p>tell Joel he should like to have a book or two, and Joel handed over to him four or five books of this description as near as possible—this is one of them; I know by the writing inside, belonging to Mr. Parrington, it is the very book that Joel gave the prisoner—I do not think there was a dozen with this sort of cover—I have not the least doubt in the world of it—as to the others, there was a green covered book, and one or two white-covered—they were similar to these—I firmly believe they are the same—I have heard Mr. Norman say, in reference to sales, if there was any pieces of wood, old iron, rags, bones, &amp;c., the men might sell it, and get a pot or two of beer; if it would raise a drop of beer we might have it—it is what is called the clearance—we had a sale at a large linen-draper's in Tottenham-court-road—Mr. Norman gave a man named Lillycrop, who is now dead, leave to take about two cwt. of rags—I firmly believe it was done with Mr. Norman's leave—I did not hear him give leave.</p>

                  </hi>. I am solicitor, and live in Laura-place, Clapton, in the parish of St. John, at Hackney. On Saturday night, the 26th of Aug., I went to bed about twelve o'clock—before I did so I went down stairs, to see that the house was secured—I was called up next morning about half-past seven o'clock—in consequence of what my servant told me, I went down stairs, and examined the basement floor—I noticed an inner door, at the foot of the stairs, communicating with a passage—the street-door is at one end of the passage, and the door leading into the garden at the other end—I had bolted that inner door, top and bottom, when I went to bed the night before, and placed an iron bar across the centre—that door was lined with iron—the lower panel of that door was bored in eighteen places, as if with a centre-bit, and the iron bar lying on the ground—that door communicates with a win<lb/>dow and door at the end of the passage—I found a square of glass cut out of that window, and the door open—that was the door leading to the garden—I cannot say how that door had been fastened the night before—I did not ob<lb/>serve it—that door had become considerably warped at the bottom by heat—it stuck, so that if hastily opened or forced, it would shake the bolts, and make a considerable noise—on the lower panel of the door I saw large black marks or daubs, and also on the door-posts at the side of that panel—it ap<lb/>peared to me as if a sooty knee had been pressed against the bottom panel, for the purpose of gently opening the door without making a noise—these marks were on the inside of the door—it appeared to me that that was the mode by which the parties had got out—I afterwards went into the garden, and on the border found some of my dishes and basins, and this iron bar, which belongs to the larder window, was on the gravel walk—I went to the larder, and saw that the wire-work by which the window is protected was torn away—that wire-work faces the garden—I found this bar was torn away, the removal of which would enable persons to get into the house by means of the larder—the window is about twenty-seven inches long, and twenty-one high, and communicates with the kitchen, and the kitchen with the house gene<lb/>rally—it is all under one roof—I missed an electrotyped silver teapot from the kitchen cupboard, and a plated toast-rack, also some pewter spoons, and a few kitchen utensils—this is the teapot and toast-rack—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had seen and used them on the Saturday morning—they were then perfect, but are now broken—I went up stairs, and missed from the dining-room mantel-piece a gold watch and two silver snuff-boxes—the watch had been on a pe<lb/>destal, beneath a glass case, which I found by the side of the pedestal in the morning—I went into the drawing-room, and found it in disorder, but missed nothing from there—I went into my breakfast room, and found my desks lying topsyturvy on the ground—they had been removed, but I missed nothing from there—I afterwards discovered the footsteps of apparently two persons on the border, in the back garden—I could see the marks of shoes in one impression, and the other appeared to be made with a foot without a shoe—they were rather slight, and close against the wall—it was not distinct enough to enable me to say whether the person had stockings on or not—I gave information to the police—the value of the property I lost was about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

On Thursday night, the 14th of Sept., between twelve and one o'clock, I heard a smash of glass—on looking out, I saw the prosecutor standing at the door of his house, and the prisoner standing close by, using very abusive lan<lb/>guage—she said she had something that would <hi rend="italic">do</hi> for him, she would run it through his heart—he came out, and she struck at him several times—he did nothing to her before that—I saw something in her hand at the time she struck him—I do not know what it was—a scuffle ensued between them—they both fell on the ground—I was standing outside my door at that time—I came down stairs, into the street—I observed Taylor's left hand bleeding very much, and the left side of his throat—I did not see her hand at all then—Taylor went in-doors to wash himself—I never saw the prisoner again till she entered the house with a policeman—I cannot say whether she was drunk or sober—he appeared rather in liquor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Hammersmith. About half-past two o'clock on the morning of the 15th, Taylor was brought to my house—I found two wounds on his left hand—they appeared to have been inflicted by a sharp instrument, like the knife produced—there was one wound across the wrist in a transverse direction, about an inch long, or a little more, not very deep, going through the skin—the other extended from the knuckle upwards, about three inches—it was deeper than the other wound—it had gone down to the muscles through the integuments and cellular membrane—I observed a wound on the left side of the neck, about an inch and a half long, not very deep—it might have been inflicted with such an instrument as this—I did not consider any of them dangerous.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Ship public-house, which is about sixteen or twenty yards from Bridge-place. I know the prisoner and prosecutor—on Thursday evening, the 15th, a little after ten o'clock, the prosecutor came to my house with a young woman, and remained there with her till about twenty minutes or half-past eleven o'clock—the prisoner was in the tap-room eating her supper when he came in—she had been in the habit, since she left the prisoner, of coming there sometimes—she was staying next door—she had brought home a dress for Mrs. Bolton that evening—I do not believe the prosecutor saw her when he came in—he and the young woman had some gin and water to drink—the prisoner said she would see him as he was there—I thought they were man and wife—I had told her he was there, and not to have a bother, but she would go in front of the bar, and called for a quartern of gin and cloves between three of them—there were two young men who lodged in my house having their supper—they work on the new sus<lb/>pension bridge—after she did that, she sat down by the side of the prosecutor and the other young woman—there was one man between the prosecutor and prisoner—she had a little cigar in her hand—the prosecutor saw it and said, "Now put that down, or else there will be a hell of a row," or something of that—she said she would not, several times—he got up to lay hold of her, I suppose to take it away, and she directly struck him, and told him to get away, he had nothing to do with her—this was about a quarter before eleven o'clock—they then got to fighting in front of the bar—I ran and stopped them, and took the prosecutor away into the passage, and would not let him go near her for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—after that he got away from me and ran round to the other side of the bar to get at her—I pulled the prisoner out at the other door, and did not let them meet again there—I laid hold of the prosecutor and told him he should not go near her any more to have that disturbance in the house—he begged me to let him go in</p>

I am a general dealer, and lodge at 24, Gravel-lane, Houndsditch—on the afternoon of the 17th of Aug., between three and four o'clock, I was at Mr. Davis's coffee-house, in Castle-street, Soho, where I usually go of an afternoon, to have something to eat; and while having my dinner, the prisoner came in with a brown bag across his shoulder—I saw him speak to Mr. Davis—he then took the bag off his shoulder, put it down, took out some boots, and laid them on the table—several people came to look at them—Mr. Davis called me, and said, "George, you look at these boots, and see if they will suit"—I looked at them, and offered 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—the prisoner would not take it at first, but put them into his bag, and was going away—he returned, and let me have them at 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Mr. Davis and I bought them—there were nine pairs of Wellington boots, two pairs of low boots, and one pair of shoes—Mr. Davis, I believe, asked him how he came by them—he said he had taken them of a gentleman for a bad debt—he had three or four other pairs, which he took away with him—those were old boots newly fronted—he wanted too much money for them—I had never seen him before—these are the boots I purchased; I sold them again, that same afternoon, to Mr. Streather, for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor. On Thursday, the 17th of August, between two and three o'clock, I was at Mr. Ferguson's public-house—the prisoner and two or three others were there—I do not know persons named Hubbard or Flight by name—I know one Williams—on the 17th of August, between two and three o'clock, I saw Williams, who has a hare-lip, and another person, come into Mr. Ferguson's, with a dark canvass bag with some boots—Williams addressed the prisoner, and said, "How do you do? I have got some goods here that will just suit you; you can get a crown by them"—the prisoner said, "Let me look at them"—they were in conversation about five minutes—I did not hear what they said—the prisoner then took the bag out of the room in which we were sitting—he returned in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my brother, Richard Woodthorpe, at Kingsland, in the parish of St. John, Hackney—on Saturday night, the 2nd of September, I went to bed at near one o'clock—I looked at the doors and windows; they were all fastened—I saw some of my brother's plate, in the plate drawer, in the kitchen—I was awoke in the night by the barking of the house dog, presently my brother's door opened, and he threw the window open; we had been very much troubled with rats, the floor of the kitchen had been taken up, and I called out, that it was only the rats, for I had heard them gnaw<lb/>ing frequently before—I got up between five and six, went down stain, and found the doors of the lower part of the house barred—I went into the garden, and found the dishes all strewed about the ground—I went into the kitchen, saw all the drawers open, and nearly all the plate gone from the plate drawer—there had been thirty-six tea and dessert spoons, four tureen ladles, and a butter-knife in it, the night before—I went up to my brother, and told him—I then looked round the house—no doors were undone—one of the thick iron bars of the pantry window had been taken away—there was glass in that win<lb/>dow, and two straight bars outside; and inside, thick lattice work, I do not know whether it was iron or strong tin—the bar had been got off, by sawing off an immense thick piece of wood; the window was then thrown back, it turned on hinges, and they then forced the grating or lattice work inside—from that pantry they could get into the kitchen—I do not know either of the prisoners—I have seen them playing about together as idle boys generally do.</p>

On a Thursday, about the 11th of August, she came to me with this note in her hand, and asked me to cash it—she owed me 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at that time—she showed me the note, and asked me if I would let her have a few shillings for her husband to go to see his mother before he went on board ship—I said I could not advance her any—she brought it again at one o'clock on the following day, asked me to cash it, and said that her husband expected to go on board ship in three or four days—I said I was obliged to borrow part of the money, and had promised to</p>

I did so, and brought the 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and duplicate to her; she said she had not then got enough.

I was not to go to the bankers', as it is dated the 29th, and they would not pay it till it was due. I was taken into custody on the 29th, so I could not go. Immediately I was taken into custody I sent to her to justify me; they would not let me go; "they Brought word that she was out; the Magistrate, Mr. Coombe, sent a summons 'down to lock her up. Next day the landlord where she resided, in Great Ormond-street, came up, and said she did not sleep there that night, that she had left the two watches, and run away without paying her rent. I did not know the cheques were forged. I have received a good many cheques since I have been here. I was commissioned from various merchants in Paris, and had various kinds of cheques. I am the loser. I gave her the balance. I believe she and Henry Bush made it up between them to say that they had better give it to me, because they knew I was a foreigner, and easily deceived. I brought them their money directly. (<hi rend="italic">See the case of E. A. Taylor, page</hi> 873.)</p>

I am a watchman employed by Williams and Sowerby, I went on watch—on the night of the 17th of September, about six o'clock in the evening, I went into the dwelling-house in Well-street, where they live—I staid there until eleven, then came out, and went into the unfinished house—there was a hoard round it—I went and saw all round the bottom part as far as I could with the light—I got in by undoing the padlock of the door in the hoard—I looked round, saw nobody there, went out, and locked the door after me—I sat myself down, and fell asleep—I was awoke by the policeman—I rang the porters up, and got a light from a man that keeps a coffee-stall at the end of the street—the policeman went away for another—he came back again—I had been up into the first floor, looked round, and could see nothing—I got up by the ladder to the middle window—one ladder was placed at the middle window and one at the end, inside the hoard—while I was gone to get the candle, Harden took the ladders away—when the policeman came back I went up again, and on going in at the middle window I saw the two prisoners standing at the corner window—I afterwards saw the bundle that the policeman found—I cannot tell how they got into the unfinished house—I never saw them till I collared them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with John Williams and Joseph Sowerby; their premises are in the parish of St. Marylebone. I know the unfinished house that adjoins the back of our premises, Nos. 61 and 62, Oxford-street—by getting over the hoarding outside, a person could get to our shop by means of a ladder which reached up to the leads on the top of the shop from the yard of the unfinished house—on the morning of the 18th of Sept. the policeman awoke me—when I got up the prisoners were in custody in the unfinished house—I found gold and silver to the amount of 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in this handkerchief in the unfinished house, on the first floor—there was a ladder at the back—from that first floor a person could get on the top of the leads of the Oxford-street premises, and get into the shop by means of a sky-light, which they opened—there was no fastening to it; it opens by means of a hinge, and is kept open by its own weight—I should think it is twenty feet above the floor of the shop—this rope (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and a ladder was placed there—it was taken from the sky-light, part on the leads, and part hanging into the shop—it was not fastened above at that time—a person holding by that rope, if fastened above, could get into the shop—one person on the leads must have held it while the other got down—a person could get back by fetching a large pair of steps from the shop in Ox<lb/>ford-street, and bringing it under the sky-light, where I found it on the morn<lb/>ing of the 18th—the steps had not been left there the night before—I examined the cashier's desk in the shop; it was locked, and apparently safe, but my attention was afterwards drawn to a small board at the side of the</p>

On the 12th of Sept. the prisoners were in my house, a quarter of an hour before the young men—when the butchers sat down to their dinner, the prisoners placed themselves by their side—they were quite drunk—the butchers were quite sober—Cummins took Leech's food out of his plate—he said he was very tired and hungry, and did not wish to be annoyed by her—she continued doing so—he said, if she did not leave off, he would knock her down, or something to that purport—Cummins then made use of a very bad expres<lb/>sion, and gave Leech a blow on his side—she sat by his side—whether she stabbed him I do not know, but she had the knife in her hand—Belgee got up, and took another knife off the table, and Furze ran out of the shop—he came in again—there was a dreadful scuffle in getting the knives from them—as fast as they got them out of their hands they got others off the table, and when Belgee was making a blow at Leech, by some means Furze knocked the blow off, and I think it cut his arm.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant.</hi>) On Saturday evening, the 26th of Aug., I was on duty at the station in Church-passage, Spitalfields—the prisoner came and asked for two officers named Trew and Bircham, and said he had been waiting for them all day, that Trew had been making an ap<lb/>pointment with him to no purpose—I said, "For what purpose?"—he said he had got the man with counterfeit coin—I asked where the man was—he said, "He is now in Elder-street, and has got three pieces about him, which is quite sufficient to obtain his conviction"—he said, "You must do by me as Trew has done"—I said, "What is that?"—he said, "Bring me to the sta<lb/>tion-house, and let me go again"—I said, "What occasion is there to bring you to the station if every thing is correct?"—he said, "If I am not brought to the station-house, his friends will say that I have sold him"—I then said, "I don't like this; this is something like entrapping him, don't you call it so?"—he said, "Oh, if you don't like to do it, there are others that will, for I know more about these cases than you do"—I then told him to wait for a few moments—I went out, and when I came back he was gone—about twenty minutes afterwards Nicholls was brought in in custody of Martin and Jackson, two policemen, charged with having three shillings in his possession—sus<lb/>pecting him to be the boy the prisoner had alluded to, I gave the policemen instructions to fetch the prisoner—they brought him—I told him I should de<lb/>tain him—he said, "I hope not, for you know what I have done"—I then entered the charge against the prisoner and Nicholls—while doing so I heard a scuffle, and saw two officers struggling with the prisoner, who had his hand to his mouth—I heard something rattle against his teeth like pieces of coin, and saw him swallow something—he afterwards asked for some water—Ni<lb/>cholls was crying very bitterly, and said to the prisoner, "You know you gave me the money, and told me to wait in Elder-street"—the prisoner made no answer.</p>

                  </hi>. I was seventeen years of age last month—I am a bricklayer, and live at No. 2, Baker's-court, Half Moon-street, Bishopsgate. I am sometimes in the habit of going to the Green Dragon, Bishopsgate-street—on Saturday night, the 26th of Aug., I was there for about a quarter of an hour—the prisoner came in, and sat on the tap-room table—two men came in—he asked them to stand a pint of beer, which they did—I went into the skittle-ground—the prisoner followed me, and asked me to take a walk—I said I did not mind—he took me up to Elder-street, and said, "There is three shillings, put them in your pocket till I come back"—I put them into my pocket—I afterwards looked at them, and found they were bad—I waited about a quarter of an hour, and then went back to the Green Dragon—in about ten minutes the prisoner came in, and said, "Come out and buy some tobacco"—I said, "I shan't, the money is bad"—he said, "Nonsense"—I went out—he took me to Union-street, and two officers came over to me—they took the three shillings out of my waistcoat pocket which the prisoner had given me, and took me into custody—they took me to the station, and afterwards brought the prisoner there too.</p>

I am the wife of George Green; he is porter to the Honour<lb/>able Charles Compton Cavendish, of Burlington-house, Piccadilly—about five o'clock in the afternoon of the 5th of Sept., my husband went, to the post<lb/>office—the prisoner came directly after; she rang—I ran and opened the door—she asked to see the housemaid, and asked if she had been there many years—I said, "No, not more than five or six years"—she said, "It is more than twelve years since I lived here; I wanted to ask her about some of the old servants"—I said I could tell her as much as they could, and she wanted to go in—I said Mr. Cavendish was very particular—she laid down her umbrella and said, "I shall go and see the housekeeper"—I said, "I shall go with you"—she went across the court yard—I left her in the still-room, while I went to the housekeeper and told her—I returned soon after, and the prisoner was sitting down—I then heard a knock at the gate; I went, and my husband came in—the prisoner came down to the lodge where I was sit<lb/>ting, and said, "The housekeeper cannot give me any information, I shall go and ask John Hartley"—she took her umbrella and a parcel that she had left, and went away—soon after, the housemaid came to know where the woman was that I took up the yard, and an alarm was given.</p>

(meaning the prosecutor)—he said, "Getting out"—I went to the cab door, and the prosecutor said, "They have robbed me, and cut my pocket"—I found his pocket was not cut, but turned inside out—the prisoner had then disappeared—I am sure he is the man.</p>

On Tuesday, the 22nd of August, I was up stairs, by the boiler in the factory, about four o'clock in the afternoon, and heard a noise below—I looked down, and saw Scott wheeling a tub of oil along the floor—I had been to that tub before, and had taken oil out to trim the lamps—he wheeled it from the soap frame to the outer gate, in Dock-street—I went down, and found Scott had got the cask in his arms, on the outer step; he was going to lift it into a truck, and Garrod was holding the handle of the truck up to receive it—I said to Scott, "What have you got there?"—he said, "Only a little water, which belongs to me"—I said, "It is not water, it is oil; I have had some out to trim the lamps"—he said, "Nonsense"—I said, "I am positive it is oil, for Mr. Fe<lb/>rina saw me take some out"—he then said, "Well, if Mr. Ferina has seen it I will put it back"—he wheeled it back again to the soap frame, where it was taken from—he then wanted me to have some beer—I said, "No"—he went away, and said, "For God's sake, don't mention it to them up stairs," meaning the other two men—I saw some iron hoops in the truck—I said, "They don't belong to you"—he said they were not worth 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told Garrod they did not belong to Scott, they must be put back again—Garrod said, "Well, if they don't belong to him I will put them back, of course"—there were fourteen iron hoops in the truck, and an iron chain and hook—they belong to my master—I said I could not let anything go off Mr. Jones's premises without his knowledge—Garrod said, "Very well"—he was at the truck all the time—we had been clearing the place, and had put the hoops all up together—when I took the things out of the truck, and Garrod helped me to put them on the floor of the factory, he said he had been hired by Scott; he had been moving goods for Scott all day—he knew Scott had been in Mr. Jones's em<lb/>ploy—I did not know what to do—I knew both the men, and I let them go—as soon as Mr. Jones came next morning I told him, and, by his direction, I got a policeman, and went after the prisoners—Scott was taken that morning, and Garrod in the evening.</p>

Curtis from Stone-stairs wharf, Ratcliif, to Smith's distillery, Whitechapel—it was customary for every man at the wharf to receive a ticket with each load of sand—a man a the other end was to receive the ticket from him—John Keating was placed at the wharf—in consequence of something that came to my knowledge that day, I gave the prisoner into custody—I told him he was charged with stealing a load of sand—he said he only received one load, and that he delivered, and the other part of the time he went to have his horses shod—I did not meotion two loads to the prisoner—he, without my having said anything about two loads, said only one had been delivered.</p>

               <p>did so—the ticket has on it, "Rook, one load of sand"—I am sure this is the ticket I offered to the prisoner with the first load—I left the yard before his cart left—I saw that curt, drawn out in the main road by the prisoner, about ten minutes after I left the yard—it was then about twenty minutes to eight in the morning—I went to Mr. Smith's distillery, which is about a mile from where the sand was delivered—if the prisoner had gone straight it would have taken him about half an hour—it was five minutes to eight when I to the distillery—I staid there till twenty minutes to ten—he did not come with his load while I was there—Mansfield brought his load while I was there, about twenty minutes past nine—I left the distillery twenty minutes before ten—I went to the wharf, and found the prisoner there loading his cart with sand—it was about one-third full—I had come straight back from the distil-lery to the wharf—I asked where he had taken his first load—he said, to Smith's, where he had been accustomed to take it—I said, "You make a mistake, you have not taken it there"—he said, "I have, I will lay you a wa<lb/>ger of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—there the subject ended—I gave him this ticket, No. 696, with his second load—I gave Mansfield two tickets—he was taken up, but the Grand Jury have ignored the bill against him—I was on the premises all the time I was at Mr. Smith's—it was impossible for him to have brought a load of sand there without my seeing it—a load of sand would weigh about two tons, and would be worth about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I received the ticket I have produced to-day from Withalls, at Mr. Smith's distillery, next morning, and some other tickets for things taken in the afternoon.</p>

I was in the service of the late Lord Fitzgerald as under-butler—I remained there till after his death—he died on Thursday morning, the 11th of May—I am now in the service of Mr. Williams, of Eden Bustard—on the Friday after Lord Fitzgerald's death I remember a person coming into the pantry with Howse the steward—his back was towards me, but by the prisoner's height, and his fine stout appearance, I believe he is the person—I was in the pantry—I did not like to stand to hear what they had to say, and went out—I returned in about five minutes—they were still there—there were in that pantry ten or eleven chests of his late lordship's plate—the plate closet had been under repair, it opens into the pantry, and the plate chests had been removed there on that account—when I returned into the pantry the man who was there with Howse, was standing by the plate chests—I recollect one chest in particular which stood on the top—that was the chest that was afterwards stolen—it contained a great number of silver dinner plates and silver gilt plates—it was full, and they were Lord Fitz<lb/>gerald's—the man was standing with his hand on the chest that was after<lb/>wards stolen—it was then about half-past six in the evening—I heard Howse say to him, "I think this pantry is larger than yours"—they then both went into the plate closet, and Howse said, "You see we have had this done up for the old man, but it is of no use now"—next day, about noon, I went out for beer—I shut the area door after me—when I returned I found the area door still fastened—Smith, the butler, opened it for me—West was there at the time—in a few minutes I went up to the dining-room where the servants were to be measured—all the servants were there but Howse—I had been down in the servant's hall when Howse ordered me to go up to be measured—when I had been up in the dining-room two or three minutes I heard an alarm—I went down stairs directly, and when I looked in the pantry I missed the plate chest that was on the top—I had seen it safe in the pantry at twelve o'clock, just before I went for the beer—I had had occasion to take one of the plates out of that chest, and that plate had only been put away out the Friday morning—when I came in with the beer, there was a horse and cart standing at the door, and a man standing at the horse's head at the area gate—there had been workmen engaged in the plate closet on the day before, and Howse had ordered them not to come on the day of the robbery.</p>

I was housekeeper to the late Lord Fitzgerald—I had a room in the lower part of his house, which adjoined the room from whence the plate chest was taken—I was at home on the Friday evening before the robbery—I noticed a man who came that evening to see Howse, the steward—he resembled the prisoner in every way—he had rather more whiskers about the face than he had under his chin—I heard him in conver<lb/>sation with Howse—I heard Howse say there was a quantity of plate, and that the plate closet had been fitted up, and how the chests were to be arranged; and he said, "I suppose your master will be having one fitted up something like it"—he made some answer, but I did not hear what, and then Howse introduced him into my room—he introduced me to him as</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Parker,—Lord Fitzgerald's housekeeper,—my friend"—I turned round and looked at him, and then turned my head again—the prisoner resembles him, and I do think he is the man, but I can't positively swear it—when they went out of my room they went along the passage, and I heard the man say to Howse,"What door is this?" and Howse said, "This is the wine cellar door"—the passage they went along leads from the place where the plate was, to the area door—I cannot tell how long the man was there—he was in the pantry, and I believe he had been in Howse's room—the fol<lb/>lowing day, about twelve o'clock, an alarm was given that the plate had been taken—shortly before that Howse had been in my room—after he left my room I think he closed the door, but I can't say that it was fastened—as soon as he closed the door I heard a shuffling of feet, wbicb appealed like two per<lb/>sons with a weight—if a person stood at my room door they could not see all down the passage, as there is a projection—they would look down as far as Howse's room—it could not have been more than a minute after I heard the shuffling of the feet, before I heard that something had been carried out—the cook ran from the kitchen, and made a communication to me.</p>

On the 28th of Aug., between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, I went to a chapel there—I opened the gate of the chapel-yard, which was locked—I left it open, and went into the chapel—I heard a noise like a person knocking at a door—on hearing it repeated, I went into the girls' school, which is on the other side of the yard—there is a door from the girls' school into the yard—I found that door broken open, and the prisoner was coming from it—he had no right there whatever—I asked what business he had there making that noise—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "You have been breaking the door open"—he said, "No, I found it so"—I then let him go I observed a piece of slate in his right hand—I went up into the girls' school, and saw a desk which had been broken open—I have seen this bit of slate produced fitted to the marks on the desk, and in my judgment the marks are such as it would have made.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live at Walthamstow. On the 28th of Aug., a little before nine o'clock, I saw the prisoner go into the chapel-yard—that would lead to the school, but I could not see the school door where I was—he came out of the yard in seven or eight minutes with a piece of slate in his hand—he was running, and threw the slate down—he went in a direction away from his own house—I picked up the slate—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I fitted it to some marks on the desk, and it corresponds with them—the door of the lobby, and of the school room, were both broken open, but there were no marks on them—I think they were opened by his feet—both the locks were disordered, as if the doors had been forced.</p>

On Wednesday evening, the 30th of Aug., about nine o'clock, I was a Newington-causeway, near three quarters of a mile from London-bridge—I saw a chaise-cart driving from the Elephant and Castle towards the bridge at a very furious rate—there were three men in it—the daylight was gone—I stood and watched the nearly to St. George's church—I perceived no alteration in the rate at which the cart was driven—I perceived no attempt made to stop the horse—I could have seen it if it had been done—as it passed me I did not perceive whether he had the reins—from his position in the cart, I should say he was not pulling at the reins, as his position was perfectly erect.</p>

I was three or four doors on this side York-street, at the foot of London-bridge-hill—I saw a cart coming towards me at the rate of fourteen miles an hour—three men were in it—the one who was driving was dressed as a butcher—the other two were sitting still—he was urging the horse to go faster with the whip—I saw him strike the horse twice—York-street is pot more than a hundred yards from London-bridge—I saw him go up the hill as hard as the horse could go, and heard a collision—I lost sight of the cart then—I ran up, and when I got on the bridge on the City side I saw the two carts—I saw the man in the blue frock, but did not notice his to know him again.</p>

               <p>on Saturday morning, the 2nd of Sept.—I was present at a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> exa<lb/>mination—on removing the scalp there was a portion of coagulated blood over the right temporal muscle—on removing the upper part of the skull, the whole surface of the brain appeared much inflamed, and the vessels very much congested—on the right side of the brain was a very extensive lacera<lb/>tion, which had caused a cavity, and that cavity was filled with coagulated blood, which was the cause of his death—some serious concussion must have caused those injuries, some powerful external violence—it could not have occurred from natural causes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You could not discover any external fracture? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—there was considerable laceration on the right hemisphere of the brain—there was no external injury to be seen to cause it—I never saw so serious an internal injury with so little external violence—I am clearly of opinion that there must have been external violence—I have no doubt about it at all—I can conceive of no state of nervous action that could produce such a result—I have known the vessels of the brain congested without external violence—it is generally the case in paralysis and apoplexy, but here the brain was lacerated—it must have resulted from external violence—there was merely a tumefaction externally, which I have named—that was all the external vio<lb/>lence—if I had not heard of his meeting with this accident I should have attributed his death to some violent external injury.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Garnham, the prisoner's master, who is a carcase butcher in Leadenhall-market. On Wednesday, the 30th of Aug., I went with the prisoner to Norwood—I went to see how the horse went, to try him—I understand horses a little—that was the reason I went with the prisoner—the horse had been brought from the country by George De Coe—we had not had it half an hour before we started—we toek seventy stone of meat down to Norwood—I thought the horse would have run away as we went—there was a difficulty in keeping him in—the prisoner drove him—he did all he could to restrain the horse—he made several efforts to run away on the road to Nor<lb/>wood—after we had delivered the meat we set out to return, about ten minutes or a quarter after eight—John Martin was in the cart with us then—the horse attempted to run away several times on our road home—the prisoner tried to pull him up—I believe he did every thing he could to restrain him, but the horse broke out, galloping several times—I do not know Newington—it was going at a violent pace a quarter of an hour or so before the accident—it was pulled up, and started two or three times—up to the time of the accident the prisoner used every effort to restrain the horse—in my judgment it was ungo<lb/>vernable in his hands—he was not able to restrain it up to the time of the accident—he had not power enough—the last time the horse started was some<lb/>where by the Elephant and Castle—I was thrown out by the collision, and stunned—we were all three perfectly sober—I have known the prisoner three-quarters of a year—he was always a steady, sober, trustworthy person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate woman, and live in Vine-court, Tooley-street, Borough. On the 4th of September, between twelve and one at night, the prisoner came to my place—I had never seen him before, ito my know<lb/>ledge—he appeared to be very much in liquor—I said nothing to him, but shut the door—I refused to let him in—with that he burst the door open—it was bolted—the bolt was not quite forced off—the hinges were forced so as to let him in—he came into my room, which is on the ground floor, and dragged me over a place, close against my bedstead, out into the court by the hair of my head, and said he would cut my b—throat—he threw me down and took a clasped knife out of his pocket—it was shut when he took it out, and I saw him open it—he then cut my throat—I called out for assist<lb/>ance—a person named Jakes came up, and I saw the prisoner chuck the knife about two yards from him—a young woman who was in the house at the time, went and fetched the police, who came and took the prisoner into custody—I saw the knife picked up by a young man and given into the policeman's hands—it was such a knife as this now produced—the cut was not very deep—I went and got some strapping put on it—I was not attended by any medical man.</p>

I live about three doors from the prosecutrix—on the night in question I heard a noise at her house, in consequence of which I came to the door, and saw the prisoner and prosecutrix scuffling togther—he got her down on the stones outside in the street—I think he had his arms somewhere round her neck at the time—he was on the top of her—I heard him say that he would cut her throat, and saw him take a knife out of his right-hand jacket pocket—I did not notice whether he opened it—she sung out "Murder"—I directly ran, picked the man up from her, and took her in doors—he threw the knife away—I saw it picked up, and given to the police<lb/>man—this is it, I believe—it was turned up a little at the point, where it hit against a stone when he chucked it, but that has been altered—the prosecu<lb/>trix was bleeding at the throat, and I wiped the blood off—the police came up and took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in King-street, Lambeth-walk. On the 1st of Sept. I had to do some work to a van for the prisoner Boorn—I told him I wanted some nails—he said he would send Cotterill for a penny-worth—I said that was no use, I should want half a thousand—he said he would not trust him with any more money—he afterwards sent Cotterill with 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get two quarters of a thousand—he brought two packets, and one was not right—I sent it back—Cotterill returned, with two par<lb/>cels, one of which had a brass knob outside—Boorn asked Cotterill what he wanted for it, and he said, "Give me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., Ben"—Boorn gave it him, and he jumped down out of the van—Boorn said to him, "Don't go there any more, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, or you will be <hi rend="italic">nailed</hi> "—on the Thursday following I met Boorn—he said I had been to the station-house—I said I had not—he said, "You b—, if I thought you had, I would jump your b—guts out"—he said, "Never mind; if you had, I could have brought a person to prove that you bought the things"—I said, "Very well," and the next, morning I went to a Mr. Redford, an ironmonger, and then to Mr. Boden's.</p>

               <p>building-yard door, and it being very moonlight I saw a person get over a wall about six feet high, and slide down the building materials up against the wall separating the yard from Captain Watts's premises—the man then went in an angle across the yard, and climbed up the building materials—I ran round the premises in a direction which I expected he would come—he peeped down, saw me, and began to retrace his steps—several pieces of wood fell down with him—I could hear his footsteps at the other end of the wall in a direct angle across the yard—he jumped over the gate I had been peeping through, nearly into the centre of the road—I had then retraced my steps to the corner of the fencing, and saw him just descending into the road—I ran up and caught hold of him—I thrust him across the road into Mr. Sherwood's court-yard, which is well lighted, and called for assistance—he then struggled very violently, and I had his face full to the gas-light, not more than six feet from it—he at last succeeded in getting away from me—I had had him last by the arms, and was afraid he would strike me—his hat was knocked off, and he ran off—I followed him—when he arrived at some houses, called Kelham-place, sixty or seventy yards off, I distinctly saw him throw some things in the area of one of the houses, and heard them most distinctly against the wall—I was very near him, almost touching his coat—some other person joined in the pursuit—he went as far as Edward-street—he went down there into the York-road, and at the end there I lost sight of him—I could not run any farther, and called out "Stop thief"—a great many persons were in pursuit of him—I waited two or three minutes—I can swear that the man brought back to me by the policeman was the man I had seen before—it was the prisoner—I went to the house in Kelham-place—the lady was standing at the door—she went down into the area with a light—I stooped and saw her pick up something—she brought these things and delivered them to me—I gave them to the police<lb/>man—some other things were brought to me by some gentleman, which I gave to the same policeman—this thimble was afterwards picked up in the road—it was not brought to me—the middle of the Belvidere-road is about thirty or forty yards from Captain Watts's—the prisoner ran directly down the centre of the road, so if any thing had been found in the middle of the road, thirty or forty yards from the house, it would have been in the direc<lb/>tion he took—he ran past the fence of Kelham-place—the fourth house down is No. 39—he threw the things there.</p>
