                  </hi>. I am an upholsterer, and live in London generally. On Monday, the 4th of August, I was at Tunbridge Wells—I had occasion to send my clothes and other things up to London that day—I packed the articles stated in the indictment in a white deal box, I nailed the box down, corded it, and put on it a direction, "To the care of Tho<lb/>mas Jackson, No. 18, Wild-court, Drury-lane, London"—I took it to the Van-office—in due course it should have arrived in London about the middle of Tuesday.</p>

A woman named Clark lodged in the same house, above me, for about twelve months, and in August last the prisoner Ashton came to live with Clark—I have frequently seen Patterson at the house before the rob<lb/>bery—on the 31st of August, between four and five o'clock in the after<lb/>noon, I saw him come in with a white deal box—he was carrying it on his shoulders—it was heavy—I was at the street-door—he asked me to allow him to pass me, which he did, and went up stairs—I afterwards saw Clark come down with something, and after that I saw Clark and Ashton go out</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184111290007"/>
               <p>together—they returned in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and went up stairs where Patterson was—they might in a shorter space than that have gone to Picket-street and Clare-market—I afterwards saw the two prisoners, Clark and another man, a friend of Clark's, who had come in, leave together.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Patterson. Q.</hi> Who rented the room that Clark lived in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Clark her-self did—she took it in her own name, and a man named Goodrich lived with her—I remember your coming there several times last summer, and telling her to send Goodrich to your shop to work for you—I do not know whether he worked for you last summer—you called several times after the rob<lb/>bery, to know whether they were at home—Clark and Goodrich left the house that same week, and he has not been there since—the police have been after him there—he is visible enough to be found, I believe—I after<lb/>wards pointed Clark out to the policeman—I was asked where I bought a duplicate—Clark had been in prison before, while she was living at this house, and that you know as well as I do—I do not know what it was for—she was in custody last Christmas, and several times for different things, attempting robberies, and that sort of thing, but I do not know that she was ever committed to any prison.</p>

I have seen the prisoner there—I did not know him as a person reading in the library at the Museum, before Satur<lb/>day the 23rd of October—I saw him there about two o'clock that day—something had reached me, which directed my attention to him particu<lb/>larly—about four o'clock I was told he was leaving the Museum—I went up to him as he was going out at the door, and told him I wanted to speak to him—he came with me into the library—I had two books in my hand out of three which he had had—I said, "You had three of these books, and have returned two, what have you done with the third?"—he said he did not know, he might have forgotten it, left it on the table, or some-body else might have taken it away—he wanted to go and look for it—I said, "No, we must find the book first"—he then said, "Why, if it be lost, I will pay for it"—I said, no, that would not do—he then said, "Do you suspect me?"—I said it was very awkward, he had had some of our books, and I mentioned two which be had had, one on the 24th of July, and another which he had had two or three days before, which were both missing—he said he knew nothing about them—I had sent for Sir Henry Ellis, who presently arrived—I then said to him, "This gentleman has had three books, there are two here, and he says he knows nothing of the third"—Sir Henry Ellis said to him, "What have you to say?"—he denied it again, and Sir Henry said, "Go for a policeman"—I said, "I have already sent for one"—that was in the prisoner's hearing—he then said he wanted to speak to us alone—I said, "No"—he said, "You don't think I am capa<lb/>ble of stealing books," or words to that effect—I said, "Well, it is no use, you have a book in your pocket now, and the policeman will find it there when he comes"—he then, after some moments' hesitation, produced the book from his pocket—this is it—it is one of the books belonging to the library of the Museum—we then went on and met the policeman, and we told the policeman to take him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am treasurer of the parish of St. James, Clerken-well, and am one of the guardians of the poor—there are sixty-three guardians—I was one in 1838 and 39—I have been so ever since—the prisoner was a clerk in the office of Mr. Selby, the vestry-clerk, and was employed by the board to collect monies—the book now produced is the minute-book of the Board of guardians—here is the minute—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"31st August, 1830, Resolved that Mr. James Hill be collector of bastardy debts from Michaelmas-day next, for one year, at the usual commission, and that he pay over to the treasurer all monies he may receive when the same amounts to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he took on himself the duty of collecting those debts—on the 11th of October, 1831, there is the following minute—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)— "Resolved that Mr. Hill be collector of monies on orders of affiliation, and for boarders in the house, for the year ensuing"—he continued to act after this resolution in the same employ down to August in the pre<lb/>sent year without any fresh appointment—it was his duty to enter in the ledger produced, all monies due to the parish for the support of bastard children, on the debtor side, and of all he received on the creditor side—it is a debtor and creditor account—his accounts were occasionally audit<lb/>ed by members of the board—I believe the whole of the entries in the account of John Hard are in the prisoner's handwriting, except this entry of the balance due at the bottom—the last sum he admits to have received, is dated June, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and it is entered in one sum in the column, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., September 10th, 1838—there is no other entry after 1838.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ascertained the prisoner's deficiency to be about 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in bastardy cases? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say some hundreds—I have no hesita<lb/>tion in swearing that my belief is, that it is more than 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Selby resigned the office of clerk to the guardians in July or August this year —it was about the time of this inquiry other cases were mentioned—that may not have been his inducement to resign—there were large sums in the poor-rates stated to have been paid by the broker to Hill, who denies receiving some of them—he admits a great portion.</p>

               <p>understood he had received it from the parties for them—I do not know who he received it from—they were not people who had order made on them by the Board—I know nothing of his receiving there money from putative fathers of children—I have seen women come to ask if he had received money from the fathers of their children—he has sometimes said he has received nothing for them, and at other times paid them money, but these were not monies received under orders of affiliation, or they should have been handed over to the guardians—this had nothing to do with the accounts—I heard from the prisoner of his debiting himself with money as received for a boarder, which he had not received—I believe Mr. Selby has since received that money—I have not desired him to retain it—he has reported that he has paid it to the parish bankers—I believe it was above 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner had debited himself with money which he stated afterwards he had not received—money was sometimes received at the gate for bastardy cases—I did not direct Mountstevens the beadle to retain 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., said to be due to him from the prisoner—I did not know of his owing him money till recently—there are two entries to Cameron of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which he credited the parish for—I afterwards un<lb/>derstood he had not received it—that is what I alluded to before—I asked the prisoner why he entered monies he never received—his answer was, he had been negligent in his duty, and thought proper to put those entries in to cloak any neglect—I gave the prisoner into custody in St. John-street-road on my own authority, conjointly with two or three acting as a committee—Mr. Bezley and Manton, two of the committee, were with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HILL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What were the circumstances of his paying women money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have seen females apply to him to know if the fathers have paid money which was due—he sometimes said he had received them, and sometimes not—when there are orders of affiliation, the weekly payments are entered in the pension-book—when the fathers neglect to pay, the committee lessen the amounts to be paid the women till the fathers pay up—Hill should report it, and then the full pension is paid, but whether it was these cases or others I do not know—men occasionally disagree with their wives, and pay money in for them—there is a regular debtor and creditor account with persons having orders of affiliation on them—I have seen him pay money—I do not know for what purpose—I should think the majority of those cases were women having disputes with their husbands, and the money paid in at the gate, not bastardy cases—I have seen him pay money to women—I cannot say whether they were cases of orders of affiliation or not.</p>

HILL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you recommend him to this anointment in 1830? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it was the spontaneous act of the board—I immediately said, "Gentlemen, I guarantee," I thought him strictly honourable—I knew the duties of the situation—since the change in the poor law, the bastardy cases have been fewer than formerly—it was never part of my duty to keep the accounts of the house—his accounts with me were kept accurately.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were they accurate in the other sense of the term? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very—there was no default in them—I am not aware of a single default in my accounts—the broker's account is not mine—I certainly know from him that he is a defaulter on the broker's account—I never could ascertain the amounts—I have heard him state it could not exceed 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and at the same time he stated there were outstanding money he could receive to meet it, and there would not be any large defalcation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say you have never objected to pay the defalcations of the prisoner on the bastardy account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have never been asked the question, that I am aware of, till a few days ago, when Mr. Pascall was in my office relative to the broker's account—then the question was put to me, whether I intended to pay the defalcation of the bastardy account, and I said I do not conceive I have any thing to do with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you mean by saying you were ready to pay, &amp;c.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was what I intended at the time these observations were made, that any defal<lb/>cation of his I meant to be answerable for, and would have paid it—I have not changed my mind, but have been required to pay a large sum of money more than I believe he has received on the broker's account—I cannot say now that I intend to pay the bastardy account, but I always did till this course was taken, and I am required to pay about six times more than I am aware he has received.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You got from the prisoner the fact that he was in arrear about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the broker's account, and there were outstanding claims to meet it nearly; was that part of the conversation you had with him, in consequence of directions to get answers from him in writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was before that—it was in the presence of Mr. Pascall and Mr. Lovel I entreated of him to give an account of every thing he had received—I stated over and over again I would be answerable to the board, and every<lb/>where else—Mr. Pascall came to me to know how much out of the 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. they said I ought to pay, I was disposed to pay, and then I stated I was disposed to pay a much larger sum than then it appears to me Hill re<lb/>ceived from the broker.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a trunk-maker, and live in Greville-street, Leather-lane. About half-past six o'clock, on the evening of the 5th of November, I missed a trunk, which I had seen about five minutes before—I ran down Fox-court, and found the prisoner just crossing the end of the court, with the trunk on his shoulder—I asked him where he was going—he said a gentleman had given it him to carry somewhere—I said, "You must come back with me, that story will not do"—he came a step or two, then <hi rend="italic">chucked—the trunk down</hi>, and said, "Well, you shall carry it then"—he made a desperate struggle to get away, tried to throw me down, and knocked me against the wall—I gave him in charge—this is my trunk—my name is inside it.</p>

I—was passing down Holborn, and a gentleman came up and asked me to carry the box to King's-cross; I carried it; the prosecutor came out of a court, and asked how I came by the property; I turned round, and said, "This is the gentleman that gave it me to carry." The moment the gentleman saw me taken into custody, he ran off; I put down the box; the prosecutor collared me; I did not try to resist, to get away, but turned round with the intention of detaining the party who gave me the box; I walked along with the prosecutor till we came to a police<lb/>man, and was given into custody.</p>

On Friday night, the 5th of Novem<lb/>ber, about half-past eleven o'clock, the prisoner came to our shop for a penny pie—he gave me a shilling—I gave him the change—he went out—I gave the shilling to my son, who was at the end of the counter—he said it was bad, and went to the door to look for the prisoner—my son put the shilling into a paper, and put it at the back of the drawer, where we keep the far<lb/>things, and where there was no other money—there was nothing else in the paper—he was taken on the Thursday following—he had come to our shop several times for pies.</p>

On the 9th of November I was walking along on this side of Blackfriars-bridge, in the direction of Farringdon-street—I saw the prisoner, in company with two others, go behind the prosecutor, and, after standing a minute, I saw one of the others draw this handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket—he passed it behind him, the prisoner received it, and put it into his right-hand trowsers' pocket—I collared him, and asked him what he had got there—he took the handkerchief out, and tried to throw it behind him, but I threw him on the ground with it in his hand—I received a blow on the nose from one of the party, but I could not see which—I got the prisoner off the ground, and called to Mr. Nicholls—he followed me to the station—I showed him the handkerchief, and he identified it.</p>

I am bottle foreman to the prosecutor, and have charge of the bottled beer—the key of the padlock of the vault ought to have been on a nail outside my counting-house door—I hung it there on the Saturday—on Monday morning I found it in the padlock, and the door unlocked—I left the premises about eight o'clock on the Saturday—I do not know whether Brown and Brailey were gone then, they were not in my department—they could get to where my key was by getting round through the brewery—I found a deficiency in one bin, five, two, five, and half-a-dozen—I have tasted the beer found in one of the bottles which the officer took from Brailey, and have no doubt it is the same quality as the beer in the bin—a lad named Peter White is employed in my department—he is the prisoner White's son—he had access to the key during the hours of business.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a messenger in the General post<lb/>office; the pri<lb/>soner was also a messenger there. On the morning of the 28th of October, we were both on duty in the Inland-office—it was part of our duty to stamp and prepare the letters from the receiving-houses—I was taking letters away from behind the stampers, for the purpose of being sorted—the prisoner was stamping the date stamp—about the close of the stamp<lb/>ing, I perceived a few letters lying beside the prisoner on the table he was stamping at—I observed that one of them contained some coin, or something very heavy, and, very singular, there was a pin at the back of it—I took the letters up in my hand—the prisoner stopped me, and said, "Stop, they are not obliterated," that is, the Queen's head was not destroyed—there was no Queen's head on the letter with the pin in it—I laid them down again, and in consequence of the prisoner's manner, I kept my eye fixed on him—I saw him take up this letter along with the others—he went over to another table, for the purpose of obliterating them as I thought—it was not his duty to do so that morning—he came back with the same letters in his hand, and went behind a table where there is a writing-slope—I there saw him shuffling them in his hand for a little bit—he then came round, and put them down on another table along with some others that were done—thinking there was something wrong, I looked over the letters—they were all spread out with their faces towards me—there was about 150 or 200—I ran them over with my hand, and looked at the backs; and could not find the letter with the pin to it—it was not there—I then took the whole of the letters down to the sorters, which was a little way down the office—the prisoner was standing talking to one of the other messengers at the time, about five or six yards off, but not out of my sight—I came towards him again, and he said to me he thought it was time to go into the railway department, which is at the further end of the Inland-office—it is not exactly the same room, it is a place parted off at the further end, and there is a communication by arches, without opening a door—he and I walked down together into the railway department—he went to tie letters at the Stafford branch, and I at the Weedon, close by his side—Mr. Hodd, one of the clerks, came round to see the men do their duty—in consequence of my suspicion, I stepped on one side, and spoke to Mr. Hodd—we had some conversation, and I went to the Weedon branch again—the prisoner left the room very shortly—I followed him as far as the President's desk—I there met Mr. Hodd—he called the prisoner back, and said the President wanted to speak to him—I saw the President, Mr. Hodd, and the prisoner, go into a private room—I did not lose sight of the prisoner from the moment when</p>

               <p>the letter with the pin in it was taken off the table, till he went into the president's room—he did not in that time pick up any letter from the floor, or any other part of the office, if he had, I must have seen him—this is the letter I saw.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the General Post<lb/>office—I was on duty in the Inland Office on the 28th of October. About nine o'clock in the morning Forbes made a communication to me, in consequence of which I went and spoke to Mr. Holgate, the president of that department, who came out of the office—the prisoner was not in my sight at the time I spoke to the president, but he was immediately after—I kept my eye on him till Tyrrell, the officer, came—in that interval he did not stoop to pick up any letter, or any thing of that kind—I called him and said, "Mence, the Pre<lb/>sident wishes to speak to you "—he made no answer—he appeared to be going from me—I called him back again, and told him not to leave, for Mr. Holgate would be back immediately—he waited then—Mr. Holgate came in in a minute and a-half or two minutes, and he and the prisoner then went into the president's room—Mr. Holgate said to him, "From in<lb/>formation I have received, I strongly suspect you have a letter which does not belong to you," or words to that effect—the prisoner made no answer to that that I heard—I was shutting the door at the time, and he might have said something without my hearing it—Tyrrell was in the room at the time—as soon as Tyrrell came in, or shortly afterwards, I observed him seize the prisoner by the wrist and struggle with him—he said, "Let go, Mence "—there was a considerable struggle between them for a minute or so—I saw he was getting the advantage of the officer, and assisted—I got hold of his other hand, and in the struggle Tyrrell took the letter from him, containing one penny-piece—the letter bears the Inland Office stamp of that morning's date, which denotes it had been stamped that morning—Tyrrell afterwards said to him that he had no occasion to answer any question un<lb/>less he thought proper, as it would, perhaps, be eventually brought against him, and then asked him where he got the letter from—he waited some little time, and then said he picked it up just before Mr. Hodd called him—he had a blouze on that morning, with pockets outside.</p>

I took some supper home, and asked Mrs. Easted if she would go and get some beer; and while the beef was frying I went to the cupboard to get some onions, and fell on the child.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at No. 18, Wil-liam-street, Regent's Park. The child was brought to me on the night in question—I examined it—it had evidently received some external vio<lb/>lence, and had tumefaction on the right side of the bead, just above the right ear, going all along, and extending to the middle of the back part of the head—it was a welling—I could not find whether there was a frac<lb/>ture, as it felt completely pulpy—I could not then judge whether it was from one act of violence or not—I recommended its being taken to the hospital—at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, I found the skull was fractured, and it died of that fracture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If it had been in bed, and a man fell down on it in the bed, could it produce that injury? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say not, because there was more than one fracture, and I think they were produced by more than one blow, be<lb/>cause there was a large depression on one spot, and a smaller about three inches from the front, which was not so deep as the other—I would not say it was impossible to be done by one blow, but it is not probable—any blunt instrument might produce the injury, supposing it was not very broad—I do not think the instrument could have been very little more than an inch in breadth—(<hi rend="italic">Thomas Kendall here produced a hammer</hi>)—such an instrument as this might produce the wound I saw—the depression was not more than two inches at the broadest part, and formed more of a tri<lb/>angin—it is not necessary that the hammer should be triangular to make a triangular depression of the bone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If it had been hit perfectly flat the probability is, it would make a circular mark? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—that is not at all necessary—it might be circular or triangular, as far as the instrument is concerned, only it could not be made by an instrument much larger than this—it was such a wound as would probably be inflicted by this instrument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there any separation of the skin at all exter-nally? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—there was a great swelling—if done with the hammer, the swelling would not be nearer the size of the hammer, as it would con<lb/>tinue to swell as long as there was blood under the skin—it depends on the size of the blood-vessels ruptured by the blow—it would swell as long as the blood poured out—the mother brought the child to me as soon as she found it out—I do not swear it is impossible a fall on the child would pro-duce these injuries, but it is improbable, and it would depend on the height. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the part that fell on the child's head was covered with clothes, would not that be more likely to produce the appearance you saw more than a hammer—if it was a hard substance covered with the man's</p>

               <p>clothes, for instance, a man's elbow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would not be more likely—it would not account for the second depression—if the man fell from any considerable height it might cause one depression—it must be a consi<lb/>derable height to cause the fracture.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of University College Hospital—I re<lb/>member the child being brought there on Saturday night—I saw it as soon as I was called down—I found it insensible—I noticed a small mark on the right ear, and a small mark on the right side of the head—those marks alone were not sufficient to draw my particular attention—it expired in two hours—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, by order of the coroner, and found a large quantity of blood under the skin, nearly over the whole of the head, particularly on the right side, and a fracture—there were two fractures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment could those two fractures be caused by one blow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would depend on the instrument employed—I conceive if it had been an instrument which bad two points of contact at the same time, it might—if it was an instrument striking two parts of the skull at one time, it might make two fractures, but an instrument with one face would make but one at a time—I think it probable such a fracture might be produced by a common hammer—they were such fractures as were likely to be pro<lb/>duced by this hammer—I cannot say they were so, but such a weapon was likely to produce them—the face of it, or it might have been the side—it was certainly not the claws—I have not the least doubt the wounds caused the child's death.</p>

               <p>At the forehead, and extended horizontally backwards to the back of the head, across the whole of the parietal bone to the middle of the occipital bone behind—there was another fracture from about the centre of this, upwards towards the top of the head—there was a very considerable de<lb/>pression of the bone there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where was the third line of the triangle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was a mere ima<lb/>ginary line—the base of the triangle was in front—the fractures were not at right angles—it did not go in a direct line upward, but slanting—I merely express an opinion as to the probability of the particular instru<lb/>ment doing it—I will not say other things might not produce it as well as a hammer—the bones of children of that age are not more brittle than elder persons—they are softer, and yield easier to pressure—I think it would require greater force to cause a fracture with a blow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But not with a fall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would not make much difference—the kind of fracture would differ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose force was applied to a part of the head, might it not produce a double fracture, one part going horizontally, and the other upwards, by the same blow, might not the fracture take two different ways? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but you do not understand what I mean by two fractures—there was another fracture, separate from this, and depressed—there were not three fractures—the other was behind—not a third fracture—by lines, we do not mean fractures—the two lines were one fracture—there was another behind, in the back portion of the same bone, the parietal bone, near the lower part of the head—I think it very improbable all this could be produced by one act of force applied to the head—I will not swear it could not be.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might not a drunken man fall with great force? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It depends entirely on what part of his body struck the child—I do not think it pos<lb/>sible that the force of a falling man would be sufficient to cause the injury, even if the buttons came against the child—here are two brad-awls found on the prisoner, produced by the policeman—I do not think these could have produced it, if in his pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brewer's servant. On the 13th of October, about a quarter to four o'clock, I was sitting on a dray, which my fellow-servant, John Sneezeby, the deceased, was driving out of Rupert-street into Coventry-street, Haymarket—it was quite light—two <hi rend="italic">busses</hi>—were coming from the Black Horse public-house, which is at the other end of Coventry-street, one behind the other—the <hi rend="italic">buss</hi>—which knocked the de<lb/>ceased down, and ran over him, belonged to Thomas Powles—the pri<lb/>soner was driving that <hi rend="italic">buss</hi>—they—were coming at from ten to twelve miles an hour, from a trot to a canter—Sneezeby was at his fore-horse, by the head, turning round the corner—he was going as carefully and steadily as any man could drive a horse—it was the second <hi rend="italic">buss</hi>—which knocked him down—he was knocked down by the fore-part of the <hi rend="italic">buss</hi>,—and both wheels went over his body—he did not die for eight days—the people went up to the <hi rend="italic">buss</hi>,—and told the prisoner he must step down, if he pleased, and took the name and number of the <hi rend="italic">buss</hi>—the prisoner gave himself up to the policeman, who was standing on the side of the street, and he was taken to the station—the <hi rend="italic">buss</hi>—was certainly not driving carefully—he had pulled from his right side against the deceased.</p>

               <p>the 13th of October, I was in Coventry-street, driving Mr. Clark's Pim-lico omnibus, coming into the City—when the deceased was driven over I was at the corner of Panton-court, on the near side of Coventry-street, with my face towards the prisoner's omnibus—I saw the pace at which he came—he began with a walk and did not come on above five miles an hour—he could not have come more than that, the distance would not allow him—he had not got above twenty-five yards from the Black Horse at the time—the wood pavement is very slippery in wet weather, and very dangerous for horses—the prisoner's omnibus was on its right side, the near side—one of Mr. Powell's omnibuses had just passed us, and was about thirty yards off—the brewer's dray came out of Rupert-street—the deceased had hold of the first horse with his left hand, trying to stop the other horse from coming on the pavement, but being on the wooden pavement the horse could not stop the weight of the dray, and the chain-brace of his own horse caught him and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi>—him under the omnibus, which came on the near side—being on the wooden pavement the deceased could not hear the noise of the omnibus—the omnibus was going so slow at the time, that he had time to scream between the first and second wheels going over him—he did not know that he had run over the man till I called, "Stop, stop, look what you have done "—he looked the re<lb/>verse way—he pulled up almost immediately and got down—it certainly appeared to be an accident on the prisoner's part and nothing more—if the <hi rend="italic">buss</hi>—had struck the deceased it would have <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi>—him under the dray—if the splinter bar had caught him, it would have thrown him to the off side, but the chain-brace of the dray caught him—no one could have seen so well as I could from my position—there was nothing passing at the time but the two omnibuses and the dray.</p>

On the 13th of October I was standing at the corner of Oxendon-street and Coventry-street, and saw the Brentford omnibus, which the prisoner was driving—tothe best of my judgment it was going at about seven miles an hour—it was nothing like ten or twelve miles an hour—it was not going at a pace dangerous to the persons about—I saw the dray coming from Rupert-street into Coventry-street—the deceased was at his fore-horse's head, cross<lb/>ing Coventry-street from Rupert-street, endeavouring to get to the near side of the street—I saw the omnibus going by on the near side of the street, which was on its right side—the deceased was more than in the middle of the road—if he had obtained the near-side, he would have been on his right side—in order to turn round the post, it was necessary to make a bend to go to the near-side—he would have to go straight across the street to get to it—the dray was going towards the Haymarket, which would bring the deceased more into the middle of the road, on the side which he was endeavouring to avoid—he had his two horses and part of the dray out of Rupert-street, in Coventry-street—the omnibus was going by on the near-side-of the road, consequently the deceased, who was at the fore-horse's head, was on the off-side of the omnibus—by some means, I do not know what, he was knocked down—I was not on the off-side to see—I was on the Oxendon-street side—the moment the omnibus passed him, I saw him lying in the road on his back—I do not know whether he was knocked down by his own horse, or by the omnibus—I could not per<lb/>ceive any negligence or carelessness on the part of the prisoner—I had crossed the road myself the moment before—the prisoner pulled up as soon as he could on the wood pavement—it is very difficult to pull up on the wood.</p>

The prisoner came to lodge there—he said he was traveller to a wholesale stock merchant—two days after he came, he brought three spoons, and left with my mother, and a quantity of stocks—he sold some of the stocks to our customers—he said they were last year' goods, and very much tumbled, and he was selling them for his brother-in-law, in the City-road—he brought two boxes, one one day, and another the following day—he inquired for the spoons some days after, and I gave them up to him—he then asked me to purchase them—I said, if I knew the value of them I would do so—I sent our boy over to a shop opposite, to know the value, and I paid him 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—they weigh</p>

He did not tell me he had seen bills in the win<lb/>dows—there were bills in the windows—my master had given 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to have it back, but Barnes did not say he had heard that—I believe a Mrs. Brown had it, in the Land of Promise—he had received it back before the rob<lb/>bery, and it was stolen again on the night of the robbery—it has not been recovered since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Seaward. The pri<lb/>soner was employed in the house as servant, to go on errands and to pay bills, when there was not work for him as a labourer in the factory—I deal with Mr. Driver, a fishmonger—I have occasionally sent the prisoner with orders to Driver, and to pay accounts, which were kept in a book—I sent the book every time I sent orders—the orders were written at the fish<lb/>monger's—my orders were to send fish, without specifying what sort—he sent what was convenient for the day—about the 15th of October twelve-month I tore the last leaf out of the book, and gave the prisoner the money to pay it—I received this receipt from him, but I am not sure whether it was by his own hand or not, because I had removed to the west end of the town; and in one instance, when he paid a bill for me, he was not to re<lb/>turn</p>

               <p>to the house that night—I said, "Send me the receipt by post"—whether it was in this instance, or not, I cannot say—I think I received this from his own hand, hut I cannot say positively—the one which I had by post I received in the course of the following morning—it was merely enclosed in an envelope—there was no writing except the direction—I have not got it—I suppose I burnt it—I never keep any thing of the sort—the envelope was in his handwriting, I am sure of that—I filed the re<lb/>ceipt after I received it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Have you not had other persons call to pay Mr. Driver? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I have not sent other persons to pay bills within the two years the prisoner was with us—I did not at the time I was leaving the factory—I did not give some money to Sarah Little to pay Mr. Driver, nor to Charles Witham—I came to the factory, and left a small bill to be paid to Mr. Avendry for Mr. Seaward's lunch—I paid Mr. Hill myself—I remem<lb/>ber your coming with a load of turf from Epping Forest—it was shortly after we came to the new house, which was in September—I do not think the turf came till October, but am not sure—I do not think I ever caused Mr. Driver to be paid at the door—I should not do that when I had an account with him—I have had receipts put into the book, and also a stamp receipt for the last amount before this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Whitehouse, a draper and laceman, in Oxford-street. The prisoner came into the shop on the 13th of November, in company with another woman, who asked for some lace—I put a box of lace down—I cut two yards of quilling, and then I called the shopman forward—the women both sat down about the centre of the shop—Henrietta Smith, my apprentice, spoke to me, and in conse<lb/>quence of what she said, I spoke to the shopman who was attending on them—the other woman paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for some lace—the shopman told them he missed some lace—the prisoner said she did not know any thing about it—we desired her to hold up her cloak, and from under it dropped this piece—I requested her to go into the other room at the back of the shop, which she did—I then searched her and took from her person this other piece of lace, containing about seven yards and a half—it was in her bosom under her dress—she said she did not know how it came there—she then took from the other side of her bosom this piece of lace, and threw it on the floor—those three pieces of lace were in the box I put before the prisoner—I am confident of that—my husband's</p>

                  </hi>. On the 5th of November I was in the service of the prisoner John Richard Packard, who is a surgeon and chymist in Drury-lane—some officers came there that morning, and one was left in possession—he sat in the kitchen—it was about five o'clock in the evening as near as possible—about nine o'clock master went into the kitchen, and the deceased asked for a glass of gin—master said, "Very well, you shall have it," and gave him no gin, but some rum and water in a tumbler—I tasted it—the tumbler was about three parts full—the officer was quite sober—he drank the rum and water—master had then returned to the parlour—he came into the kitchen very shortly after, and asked the officer to step into the next room, which is the parlour—the kitchen and parlour are on the same floor—the man went into the parlour—it was about half-past nine or ten o'clock—I went into the room afterwards—I found master, Mr. Joseph Packard, and the officer there, and Jemima the maid<lb/>servant—the prisoner Kennett was not there then—there was spirits on the table in tumblers, and wine glasses too—there was no wine on the table then—I cannot say whether there was wine in the wine glasses—they appeared to be drinking—the officer did not seem to have any thing the matter with him then—about half an hour after I was called in again—the same glasses were on the table as I had seen before—there was no wine—there was rum in the officer's tumbler—I believe it was rum—I do not know the colour of port wine—there was some red wine on the table in tumblers, and rum and</p>

               <p>water as well, and there was gin and water—master kept gin in that room in a gallon stone bottle, which was in the cupboard—the spirits had been poured out of the stone bottle into the tumblers—the same persons were still at the table, with the maid<lb/>servant, and Kennett was there the second time I went in—he had come about ten o'clock—when I went in the second time master sent me with a note to the Garrick's Head public-house, which I took—it was about ten o'clock—I was to wait for an answer, which I did, but did not get one—a man returned with me to the house—master gave him an order for supper for four, to be brought at half-past twelve o'clock—the glasses were still on the table—the rum and wine were also kept in stone bottles—some of the glasses were empty, and some full—they appeared to be drinking continually—I was in and out of the room from then till half-past twelve o'clock, and the materials for drinking were still on the table, and they appeared to be still drinking—the supper came at half-past twelve o'clock, and two bottles of red wine in decanters—I placed them on the table—all the three prisoners were at that time sitting round the table with the deceased and maid<lb/>servant—I waited at supper—the maid<lb/>servant supped with them—I saw red wine given to the officer—the maid<lb/>servant drank wine as well as themselves—there was no spirits on the table then, I fetched two more bottles of red wine during supper, by master's directions, about one o'clock, making four bottles—it was all drank except a very little at the bottom of the decanter—it was all drank in wine glasses—three pints of porter was sent for—that was not all consumed—there was very little left—I cleared the table after supper—after the table was cleared the maid<lb/>servant took something out of the cupboard in stone bottles by master's direction—only one bottle was brought out while I was there—I do not know what it was—I saw her take one bottle out as I went out of the room—I cannot tell whether it was gin or rum—when I went into the room again I saw some spirits in tumblers—it appeared to be rum—what was in the officer's tumbler was red—it was nearly full—they were still round the table, and continued drinking there for about half an hour after I cleared the supper away—that would make it about half-past one o'clock—I went into the room again at the end of that time—the officer was then very tipsy, and did not appear able to help himself—master directed me to go and fetch a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—Mr. Rennet joined in that order—the prisoner Joseph Packard was present at the time—after getting the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, I went into the room and told master I had got it—my master and Mr. Kennett lifted the officer down stairs into the little room behind the shop, called the surgery—he did not appear at all able to help himself at that time—master put a smelling-bottle to his nose in the surgery, and said, "This will do you good"—the deceased made no answer to that—I do not know whether he was able or not—they then lifted him up stairs again and put him on the sofa—he remained there about a quarter of an hour—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was waiting—I saw some water in a tumbler, and some spirits put into it by Mr. Kennett—my master and Joseph Packard were in the room—they gave the tumbler to the man while he laid on the sofa—they put it to his mouth—he took it—he remained on the sofa about quarter of an hour—Master and Mr. Kennett then carried him down stairs—Joseph Packard followed them down—they lifted him into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and shut the door—master and Kennett went with the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and Joseph Packard stopped at home.</p>

Foulkes—it was given to me wrapped up—I believe this to be the note—I was to wait for an answer, but Foulkes was not at home, and I left it—(<hi rend="italic">note read</hi>)—" Dear Sir,—How would you advise me to act in this matter?—the man got intoxicated last night, and my brother and Mr. Kennet prevailed on him to take a ride, therefore I thought it best to keep him out.

               <p>me to take the deceased to No. 18, Chancery-lane, giving me half-a-crown—they did not open the door of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, or take any notice of the man in-side—they left—I drove to No. 18, Chancery-lane, knocked, but could not procure admission—I staid there, trying to get in, five or ten minutes—I then tried to arouse the man in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, but could make no sense of him—I drove back to the house in Drury-lane, rang the night<lb/>bell three or four times, but could not get any answer—I then took the man to Bow-street Office—the man was then crouched down at the bottom of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I lifted him on the seat, then went to the inspector, stated the case to him, leaving him on the seat of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he groaned at that time, or made some noise—the inspector would not interfere, and I went round to Drury-lane again with the man in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and rang the bell, I could not make any body hear—I brought him back to Bow-street, took him out, and put him on the step of a door, and waited till a policeman came up, which was two or three minutes—I cannot say whether he was alive or not when I pat him on the step—he was in a very helpless state—the policeman looked at him, and said he was dead—we took him to the station on a stretcher—I went with a policeman to Drury-lane again between four and five, rang the bell, but nobody answered—as I returned to Bow-street, about five in the morning, with the policeman, I saw Joseph Packard and Kennett—I pointed them out to the inspector, who took them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Brydges-street, Covent-garden; I am appointed to attend oases at the station at Bow-street. On the 8th of November, I was called there and shown the body of a man—I saw no appearance of external violence whatever—I noticed nothing more than the appearance of ecchymosis round the throat, that would fol<lb/>low a pressure, which took place during life, or it might proceed from any thing done immediately after death, but not after the body was cold—I have heard the particulars of the treatment he received—I should think the situation he was in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, very likely to conduce to the ecchymosis appearance, I mean falling down in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with his head downward—I no<lb/>ticed saliva coming from his mouth, and slime from his nostril—the pupil of the eye was dilated—I made <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination the following day at three o'clock, in the presence of Mr. Brooks, and have a note of that examination—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)"—Externally the body presented no marks of vio<lb/>lence. It was intimated by a gentleman present, that he thought he per<lb/>ceived a red line round the throat, but upon examination it proved to be nothing more than the usual appearance from ecchymosed blood, probably arising from the position, as I understand the body was crouched down at the bottom of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>. On removing the cal varium or scull cap, the following appearance presented itself:—the blood vessels of the dura mater or outer covering of the brain were distended with congested, that is, congealed blood; this membrane adhering very firmly to the scull bone; the blood vessels on the brain were in the same gorged and distended state; on re<lb/>moving a portion of the brain, a quantity of water, about two ounces, was seen in the ventricles, the usual quantity being but a very few drops; there was also a slight rupture of some of the minute vessels, and a few drops of blood effused. The chest was next examined; the heart small in size, but perfectly healthy, and somewhat fat; the lungs distended with congested blood. The abdomen was next examined; the external surface of the stomach, the small and large intestines, exhibited the blood-vessels in the same full and distended state as those of the brain, vis., surcharged with congested blood; the liver appeared perfectly healthy, and proved so on being cut into and examined, from which I infer the man could not have been a drinker, at least not a confirmed one; but this is not always the case, as I have seen, the livers of habitual drunkards sometimes quite healthy—the urinary organs full of urine. The stomach was very carefully removed from its situation; in detaching it, a few drops of fluid escaped, which a gentleman present, Mr. Coatee, said had a strong spirituous smell; I did not myself detect any particular odour; the contents were emptied into a bottle. The internal condition of the stomach was next examined, its coats found to be extremely thin, more particularly so in parts, its blood-vessels exhibiting the same full state</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184111290096"/>
               <p>as in the other organs; its whole complexion indicated some little degree of inflammation. It was next washed, and the water deposited in another bottle; these two bottles I carried to a gentleman of the name of Wondor, but I was not present at his examination of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the result of all this examination as far as you can judge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As far as my observation goes, there was nothing exhibiting any poi<lb/>sonous matter—there was an appearance of spirituous liquors—under such circumstances, I can come to no other conclusion than that the deceased died from a state strongly bordering on apoplexy, but whether caused from the excess of spirits, wine, or malt liquor, or whether the result of his age, I am unable to state—if unaccustomed to drink, the effect would of course be more likely to cause such a termination—I should say the position he was in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, was likely to cause suffocation, and such ap<lb/>pearances presented themselves—I conceive the ecchymosis about the neck arose from pressure at the throat, but it was very slight—it indicated pressure during life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing him to be in the state described, the vessels congested as you have told us, would pressure on the throat, arising from the position he was found in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, be likely to cause death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would assist in doing it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long would two ounces of water be collecting in the ventricles? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot tell—I did not re<lb/>gard the water of as consequence, as there was sufficient to account for death without the presence of water—it might be some time in collecting, or might collect very quickly, if he was the subject of previous disease—it is hardly probable that it would collect in five or six hours, but I have known children going to bed well, and in the morning a considerable quantity of blood effused into the brain—water will effuse in a very short time—I do not know why that should occur with adults, as well as infants—it does not flow quite so rapidly in adults—it would not go on after death—his liver was perfectly healthy, and altogether I should say he was a healthy subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there a predisposition to apoplexy as far as you could judge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was certainly short-necked, but there was nothing beyond that—the adhesion of the dura mater to the scull-bone, must have been the re<lb/>sult of some inflammation existing for a considerable period from some chronic disease of some length of time—it is frequently met with at that time of life, but not to that excessive degree—I found animal matter, and vinous and fermented liquor in the stomach, about a pint in all—it was fowl, ham and porter, but Mr. Brooks more particularly examined the contents of the stomach—apoplexy may be produced by an over<lb/>loaded stomach with solid food, particularly where there has been stimulating liquor, but I should not say so of the present case, because after having a large quantity of spirits, wine and beer, as I understand, he was put into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and driven about for one, two, or perhaps more hours, in the streets of London—I attribute it to solid food, stimulating liquor, and exercise in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—solid food taken by a person unaccustomed to live well, has a powerful effect if taken to excess—the term excess depends on the habits of a person—what is one man's meat, is another man's poison—but his stomach was not distended—there was barely a pint, liquor and all—the solid contents were partly undigested, and partly digested—I am forty six years old—I very rarely attend dinner-parties—drinking largely after dinner may lead to imme<lb/>diate</p>

               <p>death—all the world are in the habit of eating and drinking too much—there are more individuals starved to death (if I may use the expres<lb/>sion) by over<lb/>eating than under<lb/>eating.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The presence of water on the brain indicated an unhealthy state, did it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, generally speaking it must indicate some fore<lb/>gone disease, but I do not pay much attention to the water, seeing so much that was sufficient to account for death, inde<lb/>pendent of that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Throwing aside all the other appearances, might not the water alone be sufficient to cause death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I fear not, having opened the heads of persons free from disease, and found water, when in life there was no in<lb/>dication of water—it is an acknowledged fact that persons go about in good health with a large quantity of water—I cannot impute the death to the water in this case, seeing what I did besides—if I had found the body perfectly free from all disease, and two ounces of water on the ventricles of the brain, I should say that had something to do with the death, and probably it would have caused death.</p>

               <p>—I attended on the deceased Caroline Potter, in October last—she died on the 22nd of October—she was in a state of pregnancy at that time—I was not present at her death—I attended the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—the cause of death was injuries, and sloughing of the womb—the <hi rend="italic">uterus</hi> was not inflamed—it was in a state of ecchymosis, with a large slough in the middle of that ecchymosis—I attribute that to external violence—the only marks on the body which could at all be attributed to violence, were some very slight remains of bruises about the right groin, but they were so slight that I did not take any notice of them—while alive she com<lb/>plained of pain about the womb—I have not the least doubt of the cause of her death—kicks or blows about the womb would certainly produce the effect I saw—from the appearance after death, I should say the injury was inflicted a fortnight before, or it might have been six or seven weeks before.</p>

I apprehended the prisoners on the 17th of November, at No. 36, Brook-street, which is about 150 yards from Mr. Thompson's premises—they were in bed together—I called them to open the door, I got no answer, and I broke it open—I then asked them if they had been to Mr. Thompson's rope<lb/>factory with an order for any spun-yarn—they both said they had not—I asked if they had been there on any occasion, and they said they had not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother, William Cribb—we are manufacturers of matches, at Clarence-place, Regent's Park-basin. The prisoner was our porter and carman for about eighteen months—he was in the habit of coming home late, and it was his duty to stop there and attend to his horse—that frequently occurred when most of the other persons were away from our premises—on the 30th of October, in conse<lb/>quence of Mr. England calling on me, I went down to his house—Mr. England brought to my house about 8lbs. of blue, and two gross of con<lb/>greves—I compared the blue which he brought with what we had—I missed about 4lbs. of blue from a parcel we had of 7lbs., and that was all that I could miss from our store—about 4lbs. of the 8lbs. of blue that. Mr. England brought, corresponded with that parcel of 7lbs. —I have no doubt whatever it came from there—there were two or three different qua<lb/>lities in that which was brought by Mr. England, and the rest of the blue he brought corresponded with other blue we had on our premises—after I went to Mr. England's house, the prisoner came there, and I gave him in charge—I went with the officer to make a search at No. 7, Clarence-gar<lb/>dens—in the front kitchen we found the prisoner's wife—I knew her, as he and his wife had lived on part of our premises for a considerable time—she appeared to be living in that front kitchen—we searched, and found Twenty-four gross of congreves and other matches, and various other arti<lb/>cles there—all the matches were of our manufacture—we found twenty<lb/>two quires of a description of brown paper we use for packing—there were two quires and three quarters of emery paper which resembled what we sell-there was 12lbs. of black lead, which is an article we sell—there was 1lb, of powder-blue—we never had but 1lb. of powder-blue on our premises, and I afterwards found that that 1lb. was gone—I had seen it safe some months previously—I have no doubt that these articles are ours—the con<lb/>greves that Mr. England brought to me were also our manufacture—the lowest price at which we sell congreves, is 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a gross—the 4lbs. of stone-blue he brought is such as we sell at 20<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb., and the other blue was worth from 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—amongst the congreves found at the prisoner's, were some with the name of May on them, which we manu<lb/>facture exclusively for Messrs.

I was called out of my bed at two o'clock in the morning, on the 16th of November—I went to the Green-gate, Hackney-road, of which Mr. Squires is the landlord—I found he had a severe contused and lacerated wound on his upper lip, which extended into the nostril, also a contusion over the nose, and under the left eye—his lip was cut on the outside in the shape of the letter A inverted—it was such a wound as might be made by a paving-stone being thrown at him forcibly—there was another wound on the back of his head, which might have been occasioned by his falling—the wounds in themselves were not dangerous, but the symptoms that might arise might make them dangerous.</p>

                  </hi>. I am book-keeper to Mr. Kirkwall, the official As<lb/>signee, and live at Wapping-wall. On the afternoon of the 21st of Novem<lb/>ber, between five and six o'clock, I was coming up Mansel-passage, Haydon-square—there are some posts at the end of Mansel-street—I had got near them, and saw a person who I believe to be the prisoner—he passed me through the posts—in passing he snatched at my watch, chain, and seals, drew my watch from my fob, and ran away—I followed him, crying, "Stop thief," into Haydon square—I lost sight of him for two or three seconds, not more, as he turned the corner of the rail-work in the square—I went on in that direction, and found him in custody of the con<lb/>stable—I observed him more by his dress than his face it was rather dusk at the time—I did not see any one but him in the direction he ran.</p>

About half-past five o'clock on the evening of the 21st of November I was at the corner of Church-street, Haydon square—I heard a cry of "Stop thief," and saw the prisoner run<lb/>ning in a direction from Mansel-passage round the square—there was no person running with him or near him, nor any person in the square at the time—I seized him and asked him what was the matter—he said "Nothing"—I asked him what he was running for—he made no reply—I took him back in the direction he had run from, and met the prosecutor when we had got about twenty yards—I asked him if he was the person that was calling out "Stop thief"—he said he was, and they had stolen his gold watch, chain, seal, and key—I asked if the prisoner was the person—he said he had every reason to believe he was—the prisoner said he thought he was wrong—the prosecutor asked him where he was going—he said, to Rosemary-lane—he asked where he came from—he made no answer to that—I took the prisoner to the station, and afterwards went back to Haydon-square, looked for the watch there, and found it down Shippy-yard, about ten or twelve yards from where I had stopped the prisoner, and over a brick wall—it was not broken, nor had it stopped—it went on right afterwards—it was rather dark where I stopped the prisoner.</p>

On Friday, the 12th of November, in the evening, I was behind my counter—it was dark—I heard a noise, ran out, and four brushes were gone—I had seen them ten minutes before—I saw the prisoner running down Hereford-street, and followed him into Grafton-street—I took him by the collar, and accused him of stealing the brushes—he denied it, and at the same time I saw the handles of the brushes underneath his jacket—he dropped them—I gave him into custody.</p>

On the 8th of Oc<lb/>tober, in the evening, the two prisoners came there—they did not say any thing on coming in, but walked up stairs into the first floor front room—they remained there about an hour, and went away about half-past eight —Davis came down stairs first, and Smith came after her—when he got to the foot of the stairs he dropped a piece of coin—he looked down, and Davis went out of the door—Smith then walked along, looking down, and when he got to the door, he said, "If my lady calls here to-morrow even<lb/>ing, will you allow her to wait?"—I said, "What time?"—he said,</p>

On the 12th of October Davis came and asked if she could have a room—I told her, "Yes"—she asked if it was well-furnished—I said, "Yes"—she said a gentleman she was about to meet was very elegant, and she would return with him in half-an-hour—she went away, and returned with Smith about ten o'clock—they went into the back room on the first floor—my fellow-servant went up with them—in about ten minutes Davis came into the back yard, and opened my kitchen-door—she had no bonnet on—she said she was afraid if I had not a front room ready, her gentleman would not stop—I told her I would light a fire in the front room, and it would be ready in a few minutes—she then went up again to the back room—I lighted the fire—my fellow-servant knocked at the door of the room they were in, and told them the front room was ready—they went into it, and remained there twenty minutes or half-an-hour—Davis then came down stairs and Smith behind her—my fellow-servant opened the door to let them out—I was coming in at the back door at the time—I heard Smith say to my fellow-servant, "Will you allow my lady to wait here to-morrow night, I will meet her it half-past nine o'clock?"—he then said to Davis, "Go on, my dear, I will overtake you"—he then said, "By the bye, I have left my gloves up stairs, but that will do when I come to-morrow night"—I was going up stairs to fetch them when he made his way out of the house—he had paid my fellow-servant 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the room up stairs—I was in the adjoining room, and saw him give her the money—that was after I had lighted the fire in the front room—he said to Davis, "Excuse me Madam for a few moments" then closed the door and paid it—after he was gone I went up stairs—I found one candle in the front room that they had been in, and one in a little bed-room adjoining—I missed two towels from the dressing-table, and a large counterpane and two sheets from the bed in that little room, and from the front sitting-room which they bad been in an oil-painting had been cut out of the frame and was gone, and two china ornaments—I had placed all those things there myself when I lighted the fire—I found one of the panes of glass in the window was broken, which was not broken when I showed them into the room, and the window had been unfastened, which I had fastened down myself, which is a general rule when we close the shutters—I had hasped it about half-past eight o'clock—I am quite sure</p>

I was sent with a pair of shoes to Mary Bush—my master had told me to go to No. 9, Rose and Crown-court, but I forgot the number, and I asked a woman at the top of the court, if she knew where a person of the name of Bush lived, and she told me at No. 7—I went there, and saw a man named Briant—I left the shoes with him, and told him they were for a woman of the name of Bush—as I was coming out of the court I saw the prisoner—he told me to give him the shoes, and he would give them to Mary Bush when she came in—I told him I had given them to Briant—he told me to go and bring them out of Briant's and give them to him—I did so, and then returned to my master—I am sure the prisoner is the man—I saw him again on the Wednesday morning following.</p>

On the 26th of October, I and my brother and friends proceeded to Gravesend in the <hi rend="italic">Bachelor</hi> steam<lb/>boat—we went from the Adelphi-stairs—we took many parties on board going down the river—I saw the prisoner on board coming back—I cannot be positive that I saw him going down—we returned by the same boat—it had been engaged for the purpose by a friend of mine, and I assisted my friend in collecting money for refreshments, which were served on board—I received money from many persons for refreshment—I am positive I saw the prisoner on board on our return—my attention was particularly called to him—we arrived at Adelphi-stairs about seven or half-past seven o'clock—the ma<lb/>jority of the passengers left before me—I was among the last that landed—I was dressed in a frock-coat, and a macintosh, in the pocket of which I had a silk handkerchief and metal flask in basket—I had given over the money I had received to my friend—I might have collected about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—as soon as we landed, (my brother was with me) I was attacked by the prisoner, who struck me two or three times about the face and head—I could not say whether it was with his hand or any thing else, but he put his hand in my macintosh pocket, which contained the flask and hand-kerchief—I said, "What are you doing, what are you about, <hi rend="italic">Scotty</hi>, I know you?"—I was then knocked down and severely kicked about the head and left side while I was down—there were other persons with him—my brother interfered to take my part, and he was also ill used—I was rendered almost senseless—I was in a very bad state—I have not re-covered my flask or handkerchief—one skirt of my macintosh was cut off—this is the macintosh—the pocket is cut away.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the boat hired for, to go to see a fight? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To go to a prize fight, between one Adams and Carty or Carter—it was to be at or near Gravesend—Mr. Banks and Mr. Dismore hired the boat—Banks keeps the Hare and Hounds public-house, Buckeridge-street, St. Giles's, where the "Daughters of Harmony" meet—I did not patronize either of the fighting men—I did not bet a shilling—I had some brandy in the flask, which I brought from my own house, not being then aware that I was going to render any assistance—I did not take it to give Adams while he was fighting, I swear that—one Lynch was on board, and a person named Pitman—Lynch did not strike the prisoner in my presence—I was in the fore-cabin—I saw nothing of any dispute between Lynch and the prisoner—I did not see the prisoner's nose bleeding—I told the Magistrate that I served refreshment on board the boat—I might not have told him whether I received money—I do not think I ever spoke to the prisoner before in my life—the blows I received caused a bruise on my face, and my eye was cut—it is not well yet—I believe I told the Magis<lb/>trate about part of my macintosh being cut off, and that I lost my hand-kerchief and flask from the pocket of my macintosh—the macintosh was before the Magistrate, but was not shown—I had no party on board—I have been to fights occasionally, perhaps half-a-dozen in my time—(<hi rend="italic">look<lb/>ing at his deposition</hi>)—this is my handwriting.</p>

I was in company with the prisoner on the day in question—I left the boat at the Adelphi Pier with him—he went with me from the steam-boat—I took him away because there was a general fight ensued at the pier—I saw him from the time he left the boat, and went with him to a public-house, No. 45, Strand—I was in his company, for about half-an-hour after he left the steam-boat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable and gate-keeper at St. Katharine's Dock. Between nine and ten o'clock in the morning of the 16th of No<lb/>vember, the prisoners came to the principal entrance gate with a truck con<lb/>taining bundles of rope—Bond presented this pass—I examined it, and seeing it signed by the proper officers, and purporting to be signed by the captain, I allowed it to pass through, which I should not have done if I had considered it was not the signature of the captain—about twelve o'clock, Price came to me, and I showed him the pass—in consequence of what passed between us, as I saw Sheedy, some time after in the dock, I went to him, and said there was something wrong about the rope, and he had better see Mr. Taylor about it—immediately after, I met Mr. Taylor, who is the superintendent of the dock police—I told him this was one of the persons who took the rope out—Sheedy said he did not buy the rope himself, he merely assisted the other out with it—we went alongside the ship, and saw Price—I left Sheedy with Taylor while I went to the Brown Bear public-house, Smithfield—I there saw Bond—I told him there was something queer about the rope, and he must come to the dock with me—he said he should not go back to the dock, that he had bought a cwt. of rope of the captain, and the captain might come to him, and he would pay him, or he would come down about three o'clock to the captain—I said I was an officer, and if he did not go I should take him—he came with me—I directly after went to Sheedy's house, No. 5, Brown Bear-alley, East Smithfield—I found the rope there in the cellar—I brought it away—it weighed better than 4 cwt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the police at the dock. Be<lb/>tween twelve and one o'clock in the afternoon of the 16th of November, Sheedy was given into my custody by Pope—I sent Pope to look after Bond—he told Sheedy he was taken for taking a quantity of rope from the <hi rend="italic">Thomas Laurie</hi>—he said he did not buy it, but assisted in taking it out of the dock in the truck—he said it was in his cellar, and gave me his card—I went and got it out, returned, and saw Bond—I told him he was taken for obtaining, under false pretences, a quantity of rope from the <hi rend="italic">Thomas Laurie</hi>, without paying for it—he said he was willing to pay for it—I said he must satisfy the Magistrate of that, and he had got it by false means— he admitted having written the pass, by which means he got it out, and said he thought there was no harm in it.</p>

I live in Hereford-place, Commercial-road, and keep a linendraper's shop—I know the prisoner Levine—he called on me on Monday morning the 11th of October, I think between ten and eleven o'clock, or between ten and twelve, he brought some small patterns of calico, about quarters of yards—he asked me 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard for them—I offered him 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I ultimately agreed with him for twenty pieces at 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a yard—they had stamps on them, one stamp blue and two red I believe—I saw him again that afternoon—he came I think about five or six o'clock—he wanted to know if the calicoes had come—I told him they had not, and that I should like some more with the blue stamps on them—he said he did not know whether he should see the parties that night or not—on the following morning thirty pieces of calicoes came—I was below stairs, and I was called up, I found the goods there and the two prisoners—I had never seen Beamond before, but I had seen Levine—I said I must look at the calicoes to see that the lengths were right, and told them to come again in the evening—they went away and came again in an hour and a half after, about twelve o'clock in the day—I had then examined some of the lengths, and was satisfied that they were right—I paid them at the rate of 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard for the thirty pieces—I have the bill of parcels here—it was brought to me ready written, and the receipt was written to it in my shop by Levine—I then paid him 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Beamond was present—I think I saw Levine again that afternoon or evening—he was there alone—I asked him if he should have any more calico—he said he did not know—he brought me four pieces more the next day—he came alone, and I paid him—this is the bill—it was written in my shop I believe, but I will not be positive—I sometimes use blue ink, and this is written in blue ink on the head of one of my bills—I did not see it written, but the probability is it was written there—I paid him for them at 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard, the same as the first bargain—I afterwards sent twenty-eight of these pieces to Luck and Co., of Bread-street, and gave the other six pieces to Miller the constable—I also gave him another piece which I received from my father.</p>

                  </hi>. I am traveller to Luck and Co., of Bread-street, and live in Spencer-street, Goswell-road. They sell Gordon and Barren's Scotch goods—our cloth is stamped in red, but it is a particular stamp of our own—all our goods are delivered through Messrs. Sangster—I remember, six or weeks ago, calling on Mr. Sayward, junior—I saw there some pieces of calico like these that are here—they attracted my attention—I knew then as Gordon and Barron's factory—I went back to my employers, and told them I had seen them—I wrote a note to Sayward, and purchased the whole of them, twenty eight pieces, at 4 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—we sell them at 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and have a commission out of that—my attention was attracted by the lowness of the price in comparison with what we pay—a communi<lb/>cation was made to the house of Oliver, Dear, and Co., and to Sangster's—we have never sold so many as twenty-two pieces to any one person in town—one or two pieces of a width is the general quantity—they are sold at a list price.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever ask her for a lock of her hair? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never, no more than a lock of my wife's hair given me before I was married, was set in a brooch—it came home from being repaired—I asked Betsy to look at it—she said, "Dear me, it looks a great deal better than it did, is that your mistress's hair?"—I said, "Yes, Betsy, you have got a good looking head of hair; if I was a young man, not married, I should like a lock of it in a brooch"—she turned round, and said, "Master, I should not like to give my hair away without it was to somebody I respected"—I said, "Oh, Betsy, I am a married man."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did she call out, and tell your wife of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh no, it was merely a joke—she never gave notice to leave—I never heard that she had done so—I never heard it was said so—she did not bring a sovereign to me which she had found—it was laying on the table about half-past seven one morning, I was serving customers—my wife was in bed—we take it by turns to get up in the morning—my man and me are always up first—I did not know the sovereign was there—she did not bring it to me—she said, "Master, here's a sovereign"—I said, "Oh, I suppose my wife left it there last night?"—I have a tailors' club held there, and I suppose she gave change late at night—this was about three or four, two months ago.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever tell her not to go to the house of your wife's mother? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She would not allow her to come—I told her she was not allowed to go—I never told her not to go—I had quarrelled with my mother-in-law—my mistress said to my mother-in-law, who went to live opposite us, "I will send Elizabeth over for the boy," and my mother-in-law said, "If Elizabeth comes, I will slap the door in her face"—I told her my mo<lb/>ther-in-law would not allow her to come over to fetch the boy, and would slap the door in her face—I did not tell her they were jealous of her—it was about three weeks or a month ago that I talked to her about being bar-maid—I gave her into custody yesterday fortnight.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did she refuse to take the bar-maid's place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not put the question to her—all I said, was, "I must have a bar-maid," and said to my wife, "We may as well learn Elizabeth the business, and have some<lb/>body to do her work"—I said to her, "If you like to take this place, I shall advance your wages"—she did not refuse it—she said she should not dislike it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant S</hi> 12.) I was called in by Mr. Beagley on the 23rd of November—I went and saw the prisoner—I was present when her boxes were opened—one I opened with a key which I found in her pocket—the other was opened by a locksmith—I asked her to give me the pocket, and in the pocket I found the key of the first box—she gave me some keys on a ring—I found a key for the other box, but I could not open it with the key—it would not open it—I found in her boxes some knives and forks, a quantity of farthings, some crockery, linen, a pair of stays, some china ornaments, and some carpet—I said nothing to her about them—she was in custody, and not present.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many boxes were there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two—they were in a back room at the top of the house—I believe this key opened the box—I rather think this is the key which belonged to the other box which I could not open readily—I did not take the lock off—I thought the key was too small for the lock—I did not notice whether the aperture for the lock appeared the shape of the key—I did not find that the lock had been hampered—I will not swear it had not—I tried it and found I could not open it, and the locksmith said he thought it was on account of the lock having been a little rusty, not that it was not the key, but that the lock was rusty—that was his opinion—I have a list here of what I found in each box—in the box which opened easily, I found six plates, two salt-glasses, two basins, one wine-glass, one rummer, one tumbler, and two china cups—I beg to say that this is to the best of my belief—the room is very small, and there was a bad light—there was also one jug, two bottles of oil, three cakes of soap, one housewife, nine chimney-ornaments, one candlestick, one pair of snuffers, one corkscrew, four brushes, two pieces of carpet, and a piece of green baize—the knives were found in the box the key would not open—the articles named at the top of this list were found in the second box, I think as far as the knives—all the articles were found in the two boxes—I found the money and bag in the second box—the hampered one.</p>

While the prisoner was in my service I missed some money—in consequence of that, and what happened in the last case, I had the policeman called in and the prisoner's box examined—I first had my man's box searched—the policeman examined the prisoner's box and found the money in question, which is the subject of this indictment—I had a forged 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and that was found in the prisoner's box among other things.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your solemn oath, was not your wife drinking brandy at the public-house yesterday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the public-house after standing some time, I believe I got her some—she tasted it—I found her sitting there by her<lb/>self—I said, "It is very foolish to sit here among the smoke, you will get overcome"—I <hi rend="italic">blowed</hi> her up for being in a smoky-room—she had got damp in her feet.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sixteen years old. In October last I was in the employ of Mr. Saltmer—I have been with him little more than three months—my father is also in his service, and has been so for about two years. On the 18th of November I went to Mr. Coronel's, No. 1, Holywell-street—about a week before that I had been to No. 17, which is the prisoner's—my attention was first attracted there by seeing a board outside, stating that they bought goods—I had nothing with me when I first noticed that board—I spoke to the prisoner on that occasion—he was at the door—I asked him if he would buy some figured satins—he said, "Yes"—I went there next evening with four pieces of black quiltings, and three lengths of figured satin, about nine yards in, each length—these are the black quilt<lb/>ings I took—(looking at four pieces)——took the satins and quiltings from my master's stock—I have since pointed out to my master the patterns in the warehouse of the silks I so took—I wrapped them up in a brown paper</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184111290203"/>
               <p>parcel—I got to the prisoner's house about half-past five o'clock—he was at the door—I went in and said I had brought the satins—I opened the parcel, and he said, "Oh, these are not satins"—the quiltings were at the top—I said, "No, but the satins are underneath"—he looked at them, and then asked me what price for the whole—I did not say any price—I asked him to give as much as he could—he said he would give 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the whole lot—I said that was very little—he said he did not wish to give more, and I took it—he paid me—no one else was in the shop at the time—I believe this was on Friday evening—there was a light in the shop—the shutters were up—nothing more passed—the day after I went to Mr. Coronel's I was taken into custody at my master's warehouse—I did not upon that make a statement of my conduct in the transaction—I afterwards disclosed what I knew of these robberies—in consequence of which I was taken to Holywell-street by inspector M'Lean, and Evans the warehouse-man—a parcel was made up like the one I had carried to the prisoner—Evans carried it—I saw Evans go into the prisoner's house—I went in first—the prisoner was not in—he came in shortly after, and I pointed him out to Mr. Evans—I was in the shop—I said, "This is the person I sold them to"—I did not hear the prisoner make any observation—I never said in the prisoner's presence what I had sold to him—he was taken in custody—I come from Newgate to give this account to-day.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Knowing at the time that there was hardly a greater rogue going at large than yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that is the truth—the first things I stole were those I sold to the prisoner—as I got into Holywell-street, the thought first flashed across me—I am very sorry now that I sold him things stolen from my master—I was sorry when I reflected on it—it was about a week after I sold to the prisoner that I tried to sell to Coronel—I tried to sell twelve lengths of figured velvet—I offered them for sale at a shop in New<lb/>ington—they bought them—I went into another shop before that—no other—the shop where I gave Mr. Coronel the <hi rend="italic">slip</hi> is in St. Martin's-lane—I had often been there for my master—I never attempted to sell any thing there—it is Mr. Ferguson's droper—we called at three other shops</p>

               <p>that night—I called at Mr. Ferguson's for a bag—I had some velvets with me—I did not intend to sell them—it was not the velvet I offered to Coronel—I had brought them from a Mr. Freeman's, opposite Mr. Ferguson's, to put into the bag—I kept Coronel waiting for me at three houses—I did not tell him I was going to sell things—I told him I went to take a parcel to the master of the shop—I had three parcels with me—I had those par<lb/>cels with my master's knowledge—I had three shops to call at with my master's knowledge—I bad three parcels in all—I had not all three with my master's knowledge—I had two with his knowledge—I never gave a false address to any body—I did not tell Coronel that I lived in Bread-street—I swear that—I never mentioned Bread-street to him—the prisoner's door was open when I went in—the shop was shut—any body could have gone in and seen me there, and what I was about—I was in the shop when the parcel of quiltings was found which I had sold to him about a week before—it was lying on the back counter—there were plenty of places of concealment in the shop—it was found tied up in the brown-paper parcel in which I had sold it—the prisoner did not ask me my address—I swear that—I did not give him "Bread-street"—I had no object in deceiving the prisoner—I deceived Coronel because he wanted to know how I got them—I did not tell Coronel where I lived—he asked me—I did not tell him "Bread-street," or anywhere—I made him no answer—he then put on his hat, and came after me—I swear I never mentioned Bread-street to him—I never gave my address as "Bread-street" to any one—always the true one—I could have given Coronel a false address, but I did not—I did not like to tell an untruth—I did not deceive Mr. Coronel—I have dealt with Jones at Newington—I am a witness against him—it was out of sorrow for my sins that I turned witness, no other reason—I do not exactly under<lb/>stand you—I wished Mr. Saltmer to have his property back—I told of this before I was threatened to be prosecuted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your solemn oath, did you tell one word until you were promised not to be prosecuted yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I did—Cuthbert told me that my master would not prosecute me if I told—I answered you before without thinking—my memory came back after seeing Cuthbert—I was not afraid he would contradict me—I said it quite in mistake—I understand the question—I do not know that it was to get off myself that I told the story—Cuthbert told me, over and over again, that I should be prosecuted unless I gave evidence—it was after that I told the story against the prisoner—I did not tell Cuthbert a word till he told me I should not be prosecuted—it is to save myself that I have come to give evidence, and also from sorrow for my sins, both—I do not think about being safe—I should not have told any thing unless I had thought I should be safe—I believe I should have done so now, because I am very sorry for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you care how many you convict, provided you get off yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not wish them to be hurt—I do not wish them to be convicted—if the Jury do not believe me, I think I should run the risk of being pro<lb/>secuted—I wish to convict the prisoner that I may save myself—whether I am prosecuted or not depends very much upon whether he is convicted; and the same with respect to Jones, if the Jury do not convict, I think I run the risk of being tried myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to the prosecutor, who has premises in Friday-street. I heard of Coronel's coming to the warehouse the next morning, in consequence of which I spoke to M'Knight—he made a statement to me—Mr. Saltmer was not there—he came in about an hour afterwards—M'Knight's father was present—Mr. Saltmer gave M'Knight two hours to consider to tell me all—at the expiration of the two hours I went and fetched Cuthbert, and Inspector M'Lean was sent for—some patterns were pointed out to me by M'Knight, which I have here—he pointed out these figured satins with respect to the prisoner—they are worth about 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard—I have examined the stock, and three pieces of that pattern, of nine yards each, are missing—I afterwards went with M'Knight and the Inspector to Holy well-street—a parcel was made up to carry—M'Knight went in first and I followed him—the prisoner came in in about three minutes, and M'Knight said, "That is the man I sold the goods to"—I did not hear the prisoner make any observation—I di<lb/>rectly came out to the inspector, who was outside—when he came in, the prisoner said, "I suppose this boy has been stealing these goods which I bought?"—the inspector then came in—he said, "Come, I want these goods"—he muttered something—the inspector went round, the parcel was Jying there, and he took possession of it—it contained the black quiltings produced—I then asked him where the figured satins were—he said he had never seen them—the inspector searched about, but found nothing more—he was taken into custody and brought away.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 29th of November, at half-past eleven o'clock at night, I was on my beat at Holloway-down—when I got opposite to the prosecutor's house, I heard a goose make a noise—I came to the gate in front of the house, and saw the prisoner standing close by an out-house—I went to the place where he stood, and found the door of the out-house open, and the prisoner inside—I took him into custody—he had not got any thing—I asked what brought him there—he did not give me any dis<lb/>tinct answer—I called at the prosecutor's house, which was about four or five yards off—somebody answered me from the window, and in a little time Mr. Aveline came out, and we took the prisoner to the station—I then came back, searched, and found a dead goose in a field close to the house, about seven or eight yards from where I took the prisoner—I did not find any other goose myself—I searched the prisoner, and found no<lb/>thing on him—the neck of the goose I found was broken—I do not know whether it was warm—it was quite flexible.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Greenwich. I went to the station at Green-wich, and the policeman told me something—I came with the policeman to my shop, and said to the prisoner, who was my shopman, "The more I go into this business, the more I see you are implicated; the policeman stopped a man with coffee and ginger-wine, and you stated you were the master of the shop, and caused the man to be discharged"—we searched the prisoner's box, and found nothing there but a document in his waist-coat pocket, which corresponded with the things the man had the day be<lb/>fore—here is the document, it is in his own handwriting—I came down, and showed him the document, and said, "Is not this your handwriting?"—he said it was—I said, "Is not the man that I saw in the cell at the station, your brother?"—he said, "No—he is my brother-in-law, and the woman in the shop is my mother"—he said he was very sorry, and it should be made up to me if I would let him off—I was talking about the goods that had been given to the man—I asked him what customer had been four or five days before, and paid for these goods—he did not offer to deny it then—he said he was very sorry for it, and it should be made up to me if I would not have him locked up—he said the goods the man was let off for, had been bought and paid for by a regular customer in London—I asked what regular customer I served in London, who would tell their son to call four or five days afterwards for goods—I said I should have found an entry in my book, and there was no entry—I know the things were parted with from the evidence of the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dresser at Guy's Hospital. I saw the prosecutor when he was brought in—he had three or four small wounds, and one cut behind his left ear—the cuts appeared to be done with a knife—I think this knife would do it—there was not the least danger from the wounds—there had been some bleeding, not much—the knife would not necessarily have been bloody if it had inflicted the wound.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. That night, as I was going to bed, I chanced to put my hand on this man's bed, as it was so near mine; he told me to mind what I was about or he would knock me down stairs; I said he should not do it: he got up, <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me across the bed, and said, if I wanted any thing to come down stairs, and he would give it me; he was drunk as well as me; when we got down stairs he struck me, and I struck him; a witness stood by, and hallooed out to him, "Do you think he has got a knife?" I had got a knife in my pocket, but I never used it or took it out at all. If it was not a couple of pins I had in the cuff of my jacket that did it, I do not know what else it was.</p>

On Sunday night, the 12th of September, I was coming oat of my father's house in Bond-court, and saw Miss Mahoney and her sister coming along—I spoke to them, and was with them when this oc<lb/>curred—I saw the prisoner standing at the end of Bond-street, talking to two females and a young man—I knew him by sight—as we passed he called after the females—he called the prosecutrix a b——w——, telling her to go home to a b——house, and then she could get up early in the morning—I went to him and said, "Don't you know that you are taking these females characters away; you are doing very wrong, it is not only them who hear it, there are people standing at their own doors, and they tear it as well"—he said, "George, we don't want to have any quarrel<lb/>ling with you, go about your business"—Miss Mahoney came to me and said, "George, don't talk to them people, we have another way to make them pay for it, without a disturbance in the street"—he directly came round, struck her, tore, her dress off her back, and terribly ill-used her—</p>

               <p>her mother came up, and I stopped him from striking her, as he had her against a brick-wall—I pulled him away from her—after that I thought all was quiet—the prosecutrix went into her father's house with her sister and me—in about ten minutes after I thought all was quiet and came outside the door, and saw the prisoner at his up-stairs window throwing flower-pots out—the prosecutrix was just in the door then—he stood with his head out of the window, throwing the pots down on the people below—there must have been twenty people there outside the railing—there were three inside the railing—he threw the pots down into Mr. Mahoney's front yard—I did not speak a word to him—I saw the prosecutrix leaving the house, and when she came outside the door, about ten minutes after the disturbance, the prisoner deliberately came out of his house with a brick in his hand, and stood about six yards from Mahoney's house, in front of the house, said something, and flung the brick at her—it struck her on the head—she was immediately conveyed to Mr. Menzie's—she fell down, a young man named Thorn picked her up, and carried her to the doctor's—her sister fainted—the prisoner afterwards threw a pint pot and hit Mr. Mahoney on the side—he threw nothing else but the flower-pot.</p>

In consequence of there being no depositions taken before the Magistrate, I thought it right to take as accurately as I could from the witnesses what they deposed, and fur-nished the other side with a copy of it—I heard the witness Thorn say that he never told me he saw the prisoner threw a large flint stone at the people—he distinctly told me he saw a flint stone thrown first, and after<lb/>wards a brick, by the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the service of Mrs. Elizabeth Beatrice Alsager, the widow of Captain Alsager; she lives at Balham-hill, in the parish of Streatham. On the 8th of February the family left town, and I left on the 19th—I left fifteen sovereigns in a small drawer in a chest, in my bed-room, at the top of the house—I locked the drawer and took the key with me—the prisoner had been left in charge of the house, and had Willis, her niece, with her—I returned on the 12th of October, and went to my drawer next morning—I found it still locked, but had a difficulty in getting it open—I found the things in it all turned about, and my money gone—I called the prisoner up, and told her I had been robbed—she said she did not know any thing about it—(she was merely a charwoman left in charge of the house)—I told her the drawer must have been undone, I thought by a key—I asked if there could be any key in the house which would undo the drawer—she then fetched a key, which I tried to the drawer—it un<lb/>locked three of them, one of which my money had been in—next morning I noticed marks of a chisel on the drawers all over the house, and on my drawer also—they could be seen without opening the drawer—two chisels were found in the house—the police were called in.</p>

               <p>my knee out on that day—I had a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, along with other monies, which I placed in a canvas bag in a drawer up stairs, which I locked—in conse<lb/>quence of hurting my knee I lived for some time in the room of the pri<lb/>soner's mother—on the 6th of November I gave the prisoner the keys of the drawer up stairs, to bring me down my canvas bag which the money was in—she took the keys, and went up stairs—her mother brought the bag down, and said, "Here is the bag with the money, take care of it"—she introduced a carpet-bag with a padlock and key, and said, "Here is a bag, put the money in it, and lock it up," which I did, and it was put into the cupboard—I did not look at my money before I did so—I remained in that room till the 14th of November—I then opened the bag, and missed a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and five sovereigns—I have since seen the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I know it by the number and date—I had put it down when I took it from Glynn's banking-house, on the 17th of September—I did not write any thing on it—I did not take the number of the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I did not have that from there.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RYLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was your reason for making that memoran<lb/>dum, when you had only one 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note left? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I should know it was my note—my husband took the other notes from Mr. Brown, who took the Axe of us—after we went to the prisoner's mother's house on the 28th of October, we put the money altogether—my husband had not ac<lb/>cess to the bag—he never saw the money after he gave it to me—I never told any body the number of this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, till it was shown to me—I stopped it at the Bank—I went with my husband to do so, on the 18th or 19th, I think—I do not know whether or not my husband took the paper with him—I told them the number and date, and they stopped it—I do not think I produced the paper—I think I stated the number and date from memory—I believe the prisoner's mother takes in washing, and does what she can for her livelihood—I believe it is a respectable house—I do not know—I knew the prisoner a year and a half ago—she used to do needlework for me—she goes out to needlework and dress-making—she made me two dresses at home once, and also came to my house to work; and in September they went to live at this house, and she wrote me a note, saying they had apartments to let, and would be happy to accommodate us—she did no millinery at home, while I lodged there, nor did she go out—she did nothing at all while I was there—her mother took in a little washing, and there were other lodgers in the house—there was a lady, her daughter, and son, in the first floor; a Mrs. Holt, her daughter, and niece, and a little girl.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, there being all those persons in the house, do you mean to assert that you and your husband have not quarrelled about his getting possession wrongfully of this money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not about the money—I do not know whether there was a looking-glass smashed one day—I be<lb/>lieve there was—my husband smashed it—we were quarrelling then—it was not because I charged him with attempting to break open the drawer where the money was, to get possession of it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a chisel</hi>)—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184111290236"/>
               <p>never saw such a thing as that in my husband's possession—Mrs. Colbert used it to flute her caps.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What were you quarrelling about when the glass was smashed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He wanted to go out, and wanted me to give him a few shillings, and I would not—I am forty-three years old, and he is twenty-three—I am po<lb/>sitive I never charged him with attempting to break open the drawer, and take the money—nor ever quarrelled with him about it in the hearing of the lodgers—we have had words the same as man and wife would have—when I counted my money on the 14th of November, I missed 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—not more—80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes, and 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, was left—that would make 148<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I thought you said just now that from the time you counted it on the 31st of October till you missed this none had been taken out, is that so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said you had 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. how do you account for the dif<lb/>ference? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When we went to the house we paid 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. away in bills, which I can produce—that was out of the 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I had no other money—I say when I counted my money on the 29th of October there was 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and there was the same when I counted it again on the 31st—it was after that I paid some away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RYLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not stated that between the 31st of October and the 14th of November you had never been to the bag at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I bad not been to the bag at all, only in the presence of the prisoner's mother—I was never out of the room—no money had been taken out of the bag between the 31st of October and the 14th of November—on the Tuesday after I met with the accident I gave my husband five sovereigns to pay for painting the bar, a sovereign to buy him a pair of boots, and a sovereign to pay for moving the goods—I had some medicine for myself, and a lotion for my knee, and a bit of calico, and 1 paid the prisoner's mother 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for rent—I calculate that I spent about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether for every thing—that 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was part of the 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and came out of the bag after the 31st of October, and after the 6th of November—I did not count my money on the 6th of November—my hus<lb/>band was at home at the time I sent the prisoner up stairs for the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why not send him to fetch it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was not in the room at the time—he was up stairs in the room where the money was—I was in bed, and not able to go up stairs myself, and I asked the prisoner as a favour to go and get it for me—I did not think it necessary to ask her to give my husband the key to get it—I placed implicit confidence in her: not more I think than I did in him—I sent for it because I wanted some money, and when the prisoner's mother brought it down I took out half-a-sovereign—I did not count the remainder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was anybody ever present when you counted your money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The prisoner and her mother were on the morning of the 29th of October—I counted it in the parlour before them—between the 6th and the 14th of November I went to the bag and took a half-sovereign out, but did not count the money—I did not disturb it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that during the whole time your hus<lb/>band never had access to your money-bag? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, what I thought proper he should have I gave him—I had the keys of the drawer where it was, in my possession—I always kept the key about me, and when I went to bed I put it in my pocket under my head.</p>

On the 19th of November I went to the prisoner's shop, No. 2, Cumberland-row, Newington-butts, accompanied by M'Knight and Mr. M'Lean—it is a second-hand clothes' shop—I and Mr. Knight went into the shop together—I had a parcel—the prisoner was at home, and an elderly man sat by the fire-side with him, who immediately went out—he was lame, and walked with a stick—on M'Knight seeing the prisoner, he said, "That is the man I sold the goods to"—to the best of my belief those were his words—I called M'Lean in, who said to the prisoner, "I must have these goods"—the prisoner said, "Oh, what I bought of this young man?"—M'Lean said, "Yes"—the prisoner said, "The twelve lengths"—he said he did not know the value of them when I told him, and said he had bought the twelve lengths for 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., he said he did not know what a velvet was, that he never had a silk velvet in his shop, and did not know the value of it at all—he began to cry—he said he had sold them to a stranger, and if the inspector</p>

On the 12th of November, at five o'clock in the afternoon, I was going home with my daughter from Walworth-gate —I got to the corner of Albany-road, between the wall and the Watch-box, exactly at the angle of the road, I felt the proximity of three young men who had been following us—I felt myself touched, and one of the men immediately passed me—seeing him put his left-hand into his pocket, and connecting that with having been touched, I put my own hand into my pocket, and immediately missed my purse—I saw a man pass me who I thought had put his hand into my pocket—I told my daugh<lb/>ter I had been robbed, and my purse was gone—a policeman being in the immediate vicinity I gave information immediately—the man who passed me, and put his hand into his pocket had on a brown Taglioni coat, with pockets in front—I lost a purse containing, as nearly as I can recollect, 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—next morning the prisoner was produced to me—from his personal appearance he bears a resemblance to one of the three men who were there—I did not turn my head to look in his face—I had got change from Mr. Townsend, and one of the shillings was excessively black between the head and the rim—I have since seen one which I believe to be that—to the best of my belief this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a shilling</hi>)—the purse has not been found—this shilling is the only one I can identify.</p>

                  </hi>. I was mate on hoard the barque <hi rend="italic">Jane</hi>, which laid off a port of Mexico, in May last—she was an English vessel, and had sailed from Liverpool—the prisoners both belonged to the ship—one of the seamen gave me information in May last, in consequence of which I looked about and missed a boat, and four men of the vessel were gone—the prisoners are two of them—I also missed some oars, a top-gal-lant studding sail, a cask, my own watch, and some clothes belonging to two seamen—I had been on deck myself till eleven o'clock the night before, and left the prisoner Thomas on deck in charge of the watch—the other prisoner was below—the master of the vessel had been on shore some days—the captain made a communication to the English consul of what had occurred—I am sure the prisoners are two of the men.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Thomas. Q.</hi> You gave the watch in my charge when you went below? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I was in the habit of doing it—it was a small silver watch.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">M'Clive</hi>. We did not steal any clothing from the vessel, it is a mistake. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. Two of the men complained of losing their clothes.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a seaman on board the barque <hi rend="italic">Jane</hi>—I remember when she laid off the port—I was on deck about nine o'clock—Thomas came up to me and said, "You are a dead man"—in consequence of that I went below—I went up on deck again about three o'clock in the morning—four men were then gone from the vessel—the pri<lb/>soners are two of them—the boat and sails, cask and other things were gone from the vessel, which were on board when I went below—the boat was on board, lying aft, when Thomas said, "You are a dead man"—I missed a jacket, waistcoat, two pairs of trowsers, and four shirts, of my own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Thomas. Q.</hi> Did you see me take anything belonging to the ship? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—it was not Jackson that told me if I did not go down I should be a dead man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">M'Clive. Q.</hi> You did not see me take any of your clothes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—Jackson was one of the four men that went.</p>

                  </hi>. I was master of the barque <hi rend="italic">Jane</hi>, and am part owner of her with others—the value of my property taken from the vessel is about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the boat was worth nineteen guineas—I have not recovered any part of it—I was on shore at the time—the vessel was sixteen miles</p>

               <p>from shore, on the high seas—in consequence of a communication from the Admiralty, I went to Cork, and found the two prisoners in custody—I saw this watch there—it was given to Roe by the Cork constable.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Thomas's Defence</hi>. I was taken from the ship into the boat in conse<lb/>quence of being in liquor; the apprentice had given me liquor, and I did not know where I was till next day; I laid in the bottom of the boat all night, till next day, when I told Jackson I wished to be put on board my ship again; he said it was impossible; I was landed on the Spanish main, and when I got back, the ship was gone; I delivered myself up to the Spanish Consul, and said I had the mate's watch, and delivered it up. I knew nothing of its being taken from the ship till next day.</p>
