             . I live at the dyer's shop in Lothbury . I saw from thence the prisoner go into Mr. Wright's shop, a carpenter, opposite the way, and bring out this hat and wig. I follow'd and brought him back to my master's shop, with the hat and wig, till the prosecutor came home. We sent for him, and he owned the hat and wig.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was going by, and found the hat and wig lying at the carpenter's door. Seeing nobody nigh it, I went and took it; and asked a person if it belonged to him? He said it was not his; so he went about his business, and I about mine; then they came and took hold on me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bentley. Did you see the prisoner within the door?</p>
               <p>Bentley . I did. He went into the shop, and brought the hat out under one arm, and the wig in his right-hand.</p>

            . On the 7th of May last, I went out from London with the York coach. I was sitting on the box with the coachman, going over <placeName id="t17550910-3-crimeloc13">Finchly-Common</placeName>

                        targets="t17550910-3-off11 t17550910-3-crimeloc13"/>. There came a man on a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100003"/> bright bay horse, with a small swish tail ; he had on a fustian frock, with a pair of greasy breeches, and his face covered with a black mask, a slouch'd hat, and a black peruke.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he overtake or meet you?</p>
               <p>Robertson . He overtook the coach , and rode up to the coachman on the off-side, and immediately, with a great oath, ordered him to stop, or he'd blow his brains out. The ladies in the coach seeing him pass the window, with a pistol in his hand, and a mask on his face, said one to the other there comes a collector, get your money ready.</p>
               <p>Q. How many passengers were there in the coach?</p>
               <p>Robertson. There were five gentlewomen, and a gentleman of about 50 years of age. The coach stopped. He immediately order'd the ladies to pull down the coach windows , or he'd blow their brains out. One of the gentlewomen said, have a little patience, and we'll give you our money directly. He, with a great oath, said, my business is haste . There was a servant belonging to capt. Paterson asleep in the basket. The robber thought he had got fire-arms about him, and said to him, if you don't come out I'll blow your brains out. I had a pistol in my pocket, being quite new; I took it out; he did not then perceive me; I could not fire it off; I return'd it near my eye to see whether I had got my finger on the guard or the trigger; then he perceived me. Upon seeing it, he said, you rascal come down, or I'll blow your brains out. He rode round the coach, fearing he should shoot the coachman. I said to the coachman, for God's sake get down; which he did. The robber rode round the coach, and swore he'd blow my brains out; and I ordered the robber, as he came round, to fire at me.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you order him to fire?</p>
               <p>Robertson. I thought I should have the better chance to fire last. He would not fire. Immediately I fired at him; and he directly fired at the same time. I did say I hit him; but I can't be certain; I suppose I did. His ball went thro' the right shoulder of my coat and waistcoat, and just graz'd, my shoulder. (He shew'd the hole in his coat, having it on.) Immediately I jump'd from the box, on the near side; and he jump'd his horse over the ditch by the road-side, and turned his horse's head about towards the coach again; I ran round the horses, and attack'd him on the other side, and pull'd out my other pistol; I talk'd much to him; he did not say much; then he shot at me a second time; his ball went just by my body, as I was between him and the coach, and swore he should not rob the coach. That ball graz'd under the coach wheel. Then I said I am your master now; you have got no more powder and ball.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was he at that time to you?</p>
               <p>Robertson . He was about ten yards from the coach, and I was between that and him. Immediately he pull'd out a third pistol, and shot at me a third time. That ball fell into a little puddle of water, and, thanks to God, did not hit me. Then immediately he rode off, and I call'd him many names as he rode. Then I got up on the coach-box, and we went on; and I can give no farther account.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the man that fired at you?</p>
               <p>Robertson. I can't say the prisoner is the man; for I did not see his face.</p>

               <p>Cogdel. This was at East-Barnet . I followed the prisoner to Enfield-Chase . I went up to him, and bid him throw his pistols away; he said, he would not. I bid him throw them away three or four times; at last he said, young man come and take them. I was going up to him; he said, young man stop before you come any further; I did; then he said, will you not hurt me? I said, no; then I was going up to him; he said, stop before you come any further; and added, will you not let any of the others hurt me? I said they should not if I could help it; then he said, come and take them; which I did; there were three of them. (Produced in court, three horse pistols .) We took him to Barnet, to the justice's, and from thence to the sign of the Swan; there he lay all night.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. What time of the day did you take me?</p>

               <p>Lockey. I believe it was about eight in the morning. We carried him to High-Barnet , before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100004"/> the justice. I did not see him examined there, being obliged to go and get my cloaths I had pulled off in the pursuit.

               <p>Lockey . I shot him before he would be taken, in the pursuit. I saw Mr. Robertson before justice Fielding, and saw him shew the hole in his coat, where he said the highwayman shot him.</p>

             . On the 7th of May, about six in the morning, I was at work just by where the York coach was stopp'd on Finchley-Common . I heard a gun go off, and somewhat of a noise with it. I stepped about a yard or two, and look'd over some pales , and saw a man attacking the coach. I heard Mr. Roberson say to the man on horseback, sirrah , you rogue, you villain, you want to rob the coach, and you shall not. You are a highwayman, a thief. I saw Robertson fire once, and the prisoner two times.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Swale . The man that was taken was on the same horse, and I saw him upon the pursuit.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether the man's face was cover'd?</p>
               <p>Swale. I could not; I believe I was 200 yards from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did he make off?</p>
               <p>Swale. He rode towards Brown's-Wells-Hill , coming towards London.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the horse he rode upon, and his cloaths.</p>
               <p>Swale . It was a bright bay lame horse, and he seemed to be in a darkish sort of a frock, with a hat not cock'd up, and a black wig. I went to my master, and call'd out, there is a man will rob, or has robb'd the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him after that?</p>
               <p>Swale . I did in about a quarter of an hour, upon Finchley-Common , making up to a wood.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that man was the man that had left the coach?</p>
               <p>Swale. I am sure he was the same. He went into the wood, and so did I. There were so many people about it, that he was obliged to forsake it, and I met him again on the side of the wood, the same man, and the same horse; then he made away for East-Barnet and Enfield-Chase . I could not run so fast as he rode. Two men on horseback began to follow him from the man hanging in chains on Finchley-Common , and I and the two witnesses that have been examined followed so far as Coney-hatch , and then went back again to my work.</p>

            . I was facing the man hanging in chains on Finchley-Common , and was shew'd the prisoner, and pursued him to the place where he was taken. There were a great many people round the wood; the man was described to me that had stopped the coach in another sort of a dress than the prisoner had on. He had on a loose brown great-coat , and a whitish wig; he was on a bayish sort of a horse.</p>
               <p>Q. to Swale. Had the man you saw a great-coat on?</p>
               <p>Swale. No; he had not when he left the coach; but when he came out of the wood he had a light loose great-coat on, and a light wig.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that this was the same man you saw before?</p>
               <p>Swale. It was the same horse, and the same size of a man, as nigh as I could guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the man's face?</p>
               <p>Swale. I did, when he went from the wood; he had no mask on then.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before that day?</p>
               <p>Swale . No; I never did to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. How old are you?</p>
               <p>Swale . I am in the 74th year of my age.</p>
               <p>Q. By what do you know the horse?</p>
               <p>Swale. The horse had a little swish or wisk tail; a bay horse, and lame; the same that the man rode who attacked the coach.</p>
               <p>Taylor continues. I pursued the prisoner from that place to the place where he was taken. His horse broke his leg at East-Barnet , and we took him on Enfield-Chase . We carried him before a justice at Barnet; after that he was carried to the Swan at Barnet, and had his wound dressed.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part was he wounded?</p>
               <p>Taylor. He was wounded through the hand, and into the thigh.</p>

Then we turned back a little way , and followed him again, and went on to a place called Coney-hatch , then through a large wood; and as he was riding up a hill at East-Barnet, his horse broke his leg short in two. I rode and catched hold of his horse, and he jump'd off, and ran down a lane; I rode down after him; I was near him when he was taken.

               <p>Brebrook. I don't know. He was upon a bright bay horse, with a sort of a swish tail. When I lost sight of him I track'd him by a bar-shoe the horse had. When he came out of the wood again I was standing at the place where he went in.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he stay in the wood?</p>
               <p>Brebrook . He came out I believe in about half an hour. I was in the path-way. I saw his face. He drew out one of his pistols, and carried it in his left-hand. I got out of the path to let him go by.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same man that you had seen before?</p>
               <p>Brebrook. I can't say it was the same man, but it was the same horse that went into the wood. I followed him as far as Coney-hatch, but was not present when he was taken.</p>

            . I am a constable. Some time after the prisoner was committed we had an affair to settle with the overseers of Enfield parish. As my brother constable and I went there, while we were going along, I said we will call and see Jonathan's horse. We call'd at the sign of the Cat; the horse was in the stable there; he was a bayish gelding, with a black mane and tail, and to the best of my remembrance a cut tail.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at his shoes?</p>
               <p>Doubleday. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long the tail had been cut?</p>
               <p>Doubleday . I don't.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you acquainted with the circumstance of the bar-shoe then?</p>

               <p>Doubleday. No; I was not.</p>
               <p>Humphry Buckle. My brother constable and I going towards Enfield, we called at East-Barnet on purpose to take the marks and colour of the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Buckle. This was about seven days after the prisoner was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before the horse was kill'd?</p>
               <p>Buckle. It was. I saw him; it was a bay horse, with a cut black tail.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was cut?</p>
               <p>Buckle . I suppose it was cut.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it or was it not cut?</p>
               <p>Buckle . It was, but not that day.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Buckle. I know that; it had been cut some time before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before?</p>
               <p>Buckle. Some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it been cut a week?</p>
               <p>Buckle. Above a week, or a fortnight, or a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100006"/> month either . Here has been many people examined here that don't know a horse from a cow, except by the horns. I get my bread by buying and selling horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Buckle. I keep a publick house; my character is fairish .</p>

               <p>Nightengale. We were within about 15 yards of them, and they were close behind Mr. Bellas all the way. Mr. Bellas immediately reply'd he had lost his handkerchief; we told him we suspected two lads that had followed him, and if he would turn back we might take them. We ran after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100007"/> them, and when the boys saw that, they run; we pursued them through several alleys, till we came cross Fleet-lane, and took them in an alley; they both run together; we carried them into a publick house, called a coach , and took them before my lord-mayor ; they were searched, but no handkerchief found, neither would they confess any thing . We came back to search where the boys had run; and as we were coming down an alley a man called Mr. Bellas , and said a girl had found a handkerchief .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them drop any thing?</p>

            , Esq ; This gentleman that has been giving his evidence, and another , came to me on Ludgate hill , and ask'd me if I had lost any thing; I put my hand in my pocket, and said, yes , my handkerchief. They told me they would shew me the persons that had taken it.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you your handkerchief last as you can remember?</p>
               <p>Bellas . I had seen it within a quarter of an hour before ; I had it in my right hand coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your coat open?</p>
               <p>Bellas . My coat generally is open, and I believe might be then. I went back with the gentlemen to the end of the Old-Bailey; I was shewn the two prisoners, a pretty way up the Old-Bailey , together; the gentlemen were both strangers to me at that time; one of them lent me a stick; I ran; the boys seeing me run, they both ran down a court, I believe it is called Black-and-white-court; I followed them down; there was a gateway, where I believe they slung the handkerchief away; they ran cross Fleet-lane, and going up a hill, on the other side, among the narrow places, we stopp'd them, and took them before my lord-mayor, where they both were searched, but no handkerchief found; and they both denied the fact. I was convinced that the handkerchief was either lost, or slung away, in the pursuit. I desired the gentlemen to go back with me, to look for it. When we came to Fleet-lane, one Mr. Evans told us his servant had pick'd up a handkerchief in Black-and-white-court. She gave me the handkerchief; I know it to be my own.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she here?</p>
               <p>Bellas . She is a child of about 12 or 13 years of age, and not of years sufficient to give testimony. I went back again to my lord-mayor. The boys were separately examined. I was in hopes the little one would have confessed the fact, and given evidence against the great one; but he denied it. The great one, which is Blackstone, cried, and fell on his knees, and said they both were concerned in picking my pocket; but the little one did the fact .</p>
               <p>Blackstone's defence.</p>
               <p>I am not guilty of the fact. My father is a shoe-maker, and lives in the Borough; I assist him in his business.</p>

               <p>Richard Stevens . On the 25th of July I was going home to my house, in <placeName id="t17550910-16-crimeloc72">Somerset-street, the ward of Portsoken , near Aldgate</placeName>

He said if I spoke another word he'd blow my brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see e'er a pistol?</p>
               <p>Stevens . No; I did not. He put his hand in my right-hand breeches pocket, and took from thence a guinea, a six-pence, three pennyworth of halfpence, and the key of my bureau; then he put his hand in my other pocket, and took out a queen Anne's half-crown, and a shilling; this was the prisoner at the bar; then he went off .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Stevens . I have known him some time; he does not live a stone's cast from my house; I was just going to say to him, Jack, you will not rob me at my own door; but fearing he should prejudice me I did not; then I went home , and told my wife I had been robb'd, and of what, and by whom. The watch was coming the rounds , at the hour one ; I call'd him in, and told him the case ; then he and I, and my son went to his lodgings; we saw several women there, but neither of the prisoners. About eight o'clock the same morning, I went in order to get assistance , but the constable was not at home . When I return'd , my wife told me she had seen the prisoner Benson hanging over a post near Aldgate; soon after he came by my door; I sent my son after him, who said he had seen him and the other prisoner go in at the sign of Oliver-and-porter, in Harrow-alley; then I sent him for the constable, who came with him. The prisoner Benson being a desperate fellow , and it is a very bad place, my son took a cutteau under his coat, and we went all three together; going along, just under the gateway , where I had seen them before, there were the two prisoners talking to each other . I went up to Benson, and laid hold of him , and said, Jack I charge you with robbing me; he denied it; Parrot sneak'd off; we took him to a publick house in the neighbourhood, and searched him, but found nothing upon him but about three-pence halfpenny. I said, Jack, how dare you do a thing of this kind? where is the key of my bureau? that is of no use to you; the bureau is lock'd , and it will do it hurt to break it open. I also said I valu'd the half-crown (having it a pledge from my wife before I married, about twenty-one years ago), more than the guinea. He wrung his hands, and cry'd, and said, I am the man, I am the man that rob'd you, but I did not know it was you. I hope you will be favourable to me. He sent immediately for the key and half-crown to Parrot. She came in, and said the key is of no use, it will not fit my lock. I had the half-crown from the officer that I sent, or from her, I know not which. She cry'd a good deal; Benson accused her of putting him upon robbing me, saying he'd speak the truth if he died for it. Did not you, (he said) when you saw the gentleman go by, say, there is a chance for you. There is a gentleman suckey, (supposing me drunk, because I am lame, and walk hobbling) if you will not, I can do it myself, and get the money as well as you. The answer she made was, suppose I bid you kill him, if it was not your inclination, what business had you to do it? She cried, and said, you may hang me if you will; after that she said, you can only transport me, and you will be hang'd, and I shall be a bright woman when you are dead. He said she had taken the guinea, and put it to her mouth, and said it is but a counter, and she wanted to get it from him; and he had much ado to get it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100011"/> from her again. You villain, said she , how much of the guinea had I? You only fetch'd a pair of stays out of pawn , and bought me a cap, and two yards of ribbon; and said that the guinea was changed to buy him a pair of stockings, a striped waistcoat , and a leather apron; and all the money was spent , except the half-crown and two-pence half-penny . When I came with the watchman, we met Parrot very near the place where I had been rob'd; she said, what have you been rob'd? I never answer'd her; she seemed then to be upon the look-out, to see if the person made any outcry.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before?</p>
               <p>Stevens . I have known her for years. When Benson was in custody, she said to me, I'll pawn my stays again, and a ring that I have, to make up the money, if you'll make it easy upon those circumstances. We thought it necessary to take her up; then Mr. Collet took hold of her.</p>
               <p>Q. from Benson. Whether it is possible for him to swear to me in such a passage where it was so dark a man can't see his hand?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was moon-light; I saw him, and knew him very well.</p>
               <p>Jefford Stevens . I am son to the prosecutor; I went with my father and the constable, when Benson was taken up; he confessed in my hearing that he rob'd my father.</p>
               <p>Q. Of what?</p>
               <p>J. Stevens. He did not mention the particulars; only he said he had the guinea; and he sent for the key and half-crown.</p>

Parrot came in, to see what was the matters and return'd; then Mr. Stevens said there was a woman in company; after that Benson confessed he had rob'd him of a guinea, half-a-crown, a shilling, a six-pence, I think three-pence halfpenny , and a key. Then the prosecutor said, give me the key, it will be of no service to you; and tell me where my half-crown is gone; I value it more than the guinea. Then he called to a person to go to

On the 20th I missed twelve gold rings out of my shew-glass: I went and got a warrant against him on the 25th, suspecting him. I took and brought him to the constable's house; there I charged him with taking these things; he owned he had taken eight rings from me: saying, I am very sorry I have taken eight gold rings from you, and you are the worse man for me by more than them, and offered to make it up by paying 3 s. 6 d. per week. We took him before justice Fielding, and got a search warrant: he told me where six of them were. They were at five different places; one in Newport-street, two in Sidner's alley , one in St. James's-street, one at a pawnbroker's . Some we found, the others did not deny but they might have bought them of him, but if they had, they were sold.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor has trusted me in the shop with the drawer when he has gone out of the shop, and it is extraordinary. I should take those rings and they not be missed sooner. I leave it to the jury whether it is probable.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There were silver thimbles in the same drawer, and on the nail where he had taken a ring, he had hung up a thimble, so that they were not so easily missed at first sight.</p>

            . I am widow to the deceased. He had been beaten , but I did not see him till in the Gatehouse, on the 19th of June, after eight at night . He could neither speak , sit, or stand; he had no more sense than the sole of my shoe. I sent for a surgeon , and got him blooded.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he for health the day before?</p>
               <p>Crane . I dined with him that day; then he was hearty and well as ever I saw him in my life. The next day he was carried to the workhouse. This was the Friday; he remained there till the Thursday following; then he was carried in a chair to Westminster-infirmary , and was there but about two or three hours; then they carried him home by his desire. He lived after the beating five weeks and one day .</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go out of doors in the time?</p>
               <p>Crane. He did; he went to sell milk one day; he lived eight days after he took to his bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What marks did you perceive on him?</p>
               <p>Crane. He was cut under one of his eyes, I can't tell which; he had a mark on his hip, just by his groin; and he always complained of mortal bruises inwardly.</p>

               <p>Q. How near was you to them?</p>
               <p>Jones. I was about thirty yards off. The deceased, I believe, made a blow at him, whether he struck him I cannot tell. There was a man's servant, in a light coloured, turn'd up with red, and a silver-laced hat, she ran up to the deceased, and struck up his neck, and fell upon him. At the same time the chairman took up Owen Crane's stick, and struck him with it several times. There was an acquaintance of more laid hold of me, and carried me out of their company, or I had taken the deceased's part</p>
               <p>Q. Can you assign any reason why the chairman drew out the chair-pole, and struck at the deceased?</p>
               <p>Jones. I know of no other reason than that of their crying out, stop thief. I went to see him at the workhouse on the Sunday after; then he excessive bad, and reach'd very much with blood; I observed several marks about his body; I saw a black mark under his rib, where he said his pain lay on his left-side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the other two prisoners do anything ?</p>

               <p>Q. How long were they on the groun d together?</p>
               <p>Jones. To the best of my knowledge they were on the ground a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any struggle between them when they were on the ground?</p>
               <p>Jones. No; it is possible the fall might disorder them.</p>
               <p>Q. Which fell uppermost?</p>
               <p>Jones. The gentleman's servant .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any blows?</p>
               <p>Jones. The gentleman's servant struck him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he fall hard upon him?</p>
               <p>Jones. He fell as hard as he could upon him, to my thinking.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the chairman strike the deceased , before the deceased struck him?</p>
               <p>Jones. I saw him strike at him with his pole; but whether he struck him or not I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the deceased abroad after this?</p>
               <p>Jones. I saw him come down King-street once after.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after ?</p>
               <p>Jones . I can't say how long.</p>

            . I went to see Crane on his death-bed, about the 21st, 22d, or 23d of June; he said he was ill of the bruises he received at Westminster . I asked him, who gave him the bruises? he said, two chairmen. I ask'd him , if he knew them ? He said, they beat him till his sight left him. I ask'd him, if he knew any of them mes? he said, one was named Salter; I said, do you lay your death to any of them? he said, I lay my death to Salter in particular. We took him up the day after Crane died; we took him before esquire Manby ; Esquire Manby said, Salter, I am sorry for this; so am I, said Salter; for it is the others should be taken up as well as I, for they had a hand in it as well as I. On the 20th of June I was at Mr. Bennet's office, a justice of the peace; I said to Salter (he having a broom-stick in his hand) I suppose that is what you hurt the man with yesterday ; he said, yes it is. A man that was by said, you ought to be made to pay for it; he answered, if I had you in the street I would serve you the same; I am the king's servant, and have an authority to serve any body so that I hear make a noise in the street.</p>

               <p>Read. Yes; he did.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the deceased did the chair-pole come on?</p>
               <p>Read. I think it came on his left shoulder or side?</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it struck him?</p>
               <p>Read. I am not sure it did; to the best of my knowledge it did; when he lay down, Salter had his left knee on him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body else there?</p>
               <p>Read. I saw a footman, with a silver-laced hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the deceased and the footman struggle together?</p>
               <p>Read. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing said when they lay on the ground?</p>
               <p>Read. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you, upon your oath, say, that the reason of the deceased's falling was by the blow or the struggling?</p>
               <p>Read. To the best of my oath it was by the chair-pole knocking him down.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to them?</p>
               <p>Read. I think I was within about three yards of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Palmer or Hines then?</p>
               <p>Read. They were a good way off when he was knock'd down.</p>

After that the other man came to me, and ask'd if we knew the man's name he had been fighting with? saying he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100019"/> used him very ill. (Crane had struck the man's wife. ) He said he'd go and get a warrant. After that I saw Crane come from opposite the Coach-and-horses, between six and seven o'clock; and whether he struck the man's wife with a broom-stick, or his two hands, I am not certain; but she stoop'd, and the blow came over her neck. Then he went towards Whitehall; I saw the mob bring him back; then he was bloody; he had some blood on his face, below his eye , from fighting the man before. Crane was a very resolute man, and would not come along; so one had hold of one leg, another the other, another an arm, and so they brought him along.</p>

             . I live with Mr. Aplick, a cabinet-maker, in Parliament-street; about three o'clock in the afternoon that day there was a mob running after a man, some with shovels in their hands; there was the cry, stop thief . The man that had been fighting, being let in at a door,

             ran against it with his shoulder, with such violence that it knock'd him backwards a great way. Several people came, and ask'd what the man had done; he said he was a thief; then he was ask'd what the man had robb'd him of; he could give no account of what; then the people abused him for saying so of the man; then he was for fighting every-body that ask'd him why he ran about so. There was a woman came after the mob; she mob'd him, and he struck her; after that he went to work; after that the man and woman were inquiring for his name, with intent to get a warrant for him. I went up into Grosvenor-square, and coming down between six and seven, I saw

               <p>Q. Did any body else run?</p>
               <p>Sayer. No; there was nobody running but he; he brush'd by me; but I was loaded, I could not lay hold on him. After that I saw Salter with a chair-pole in his hand. Crane, as he ran, was daring any body to meddle with him, saying, let them come if they dare, flourishing his stick. I saw the deceased, when he was some yards before Salter, stop, and as Salter came up, the deceased made a blow at him with the stick; the mob was gathering.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he hit Salter?</p>
               <p>Sayer . I believe he did, on the shoulder. The first man that laid hold of the deceased was a gentleman's servant in a frock. Salter drop'd the pole as soon as they were engaged; and the deceased was on the ground before Salter could touch him. I believe the deceased got several blows from the mob; people that I can give no account of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner Salter strike the deceased, till the deceased struck him ?</p>
               <p>Sayer . No; I did not. He could not with the pole. I believe the deceased's intention was to have knock'd Salter down, he being the nearest to him, that he might have got off. I saw Mr. Hines there, but did not see him meddle upon any account; only laid hold of one of the deceased's legs once, that he should not escape.</p>

The deceased was for pulling and striking every body that laid hold of him; and strugling to get away, it was as much as three or four men could do to hold him.</p>

The labourers were very mischievous with their shovels; they had been quarreling all the forenoon; the constable took four of them, and carried them into Mr. Gray's house, at the Coach-and-horses; the deceased came with a broom-stick in his hand, and said, no English booger should take him; he met Flood's wife, and gave her a lick over her arm with the stick; the constable charg'd Salter to aid and assist. As the deceased came running towards Whitehall , hallowing with his stick up, I said to Salter, as you are charg'd to aid and assist, let us stop this man if we can. Salter went to pull his chair-pole out, and in the mean time Crane got beyond him. I said to him, if you run any further I'll cut your legs off. I am a soldier, and had all my acoutrements on; but had nothing in my hand. The deceased made a stop. Salter made a stroke at him, but did not hit him . The deceased turn'd the blow, and struck Salter on the left side of his face, and made his cheek, his mouth, and nose bleed. Salter stagger'd, and drop'd the pole out of his hand. He struck Salter twice, before Salter could get to him. The mob coming up, threw the deceased down. I saw a footman kick his heels up. I never saw Salter strike him once; one hit<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100020"/> the deceased, and another hit him, for his ill usage. They carried him before the justice, and he ordered him to the Gatehouse.</p>

I examin'd him, and found a bruise on his left hip, another on his breast; he complain'd of great pains, and soreness all over his body; he said he had been beat by a chairman, and others had struck him; he said, he laid his death to the chairman in custody.

I said be careful, see whether it is not amongst the cloaths; she looked, and said it is gone, the prisoner at the bar absented himself that day. I was in a prodigious dilemma; I took post-chaise about three in the afternoon, and with a friend, went down for Dover, to see for him. I went post to Gravesend , and found when the boat came in, he was not in it. The next morning I took a post-chaise there, and went down to Dover. When I came to Sitingbourne , I had intelligence of him; and when I came to Dover, I found him on board a vessel bound to France. We took him on shore, and brought him to a publick house, where we pulled the prisoner's boots off, there we found part of the money.</p>

We brought him back to London, and as he was a young man, I was tender, and would willingly have forgiven him, and let him go; but after that, I was told I must prosecute.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was your money you found upon the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Rimbolt. By the particular pieces, I think it must be mine. I advertised two five guinea pieces, a two guinea piece, two quarters of a guinea, and an old Jacobus. I can sware to the purse the money was in, that I found upon the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it taken from?</p>
               <p>Rimbolt. I imagin'd it to be in the closet, where the money used to be.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner confess any thing?</p>
               <p>Rimbolt. I charg'd him with taking the money, and he acknowledg'd it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he acknowledge the money was your property?</p>
               <p>Rimbolt . He did, and beg'd I would be favourable to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him how much money you had lost.</p>

               <p>Rimbolt . I Did, and he said he had not so much; he said he did not know what was become of the twenty guineas; and when he delivered it up, he said there was all he had left, and the other he had laid out, which he would give me an account of in writing. He said he found it on a pair of breeches, by the side of the trunk; we were moving our goods to another house over the way , when we missed the money; it was lost from out of a trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the trunk appear to have been opened by violence?</p>
               <p>Rimbolt. I cannot say it did; when we were coming with him to London, he came out of the chaise, and rode on horseback to St. George's-fields , there I let him go away; but when I came home, there were a number of people said, if I did not prosecute him, I was liable to be prosecuted, then I went and found him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find him?</p>
               <p>Rimbolt. I found him in White-chapel, he told me he should be there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear of the other forty guineas ?</p>
               <p>Rimbolt. No; I never did.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has the lad lived with you?</p>
               <p>Rimbolt . He has lived with me six years next October.</p>
               <p>Q. How has he behaved in the time he was with you?</p>
               <p>Rimbolt. I cannot say he has behav'd so well as I could wish, but he never wrong'd me before .</p>
               <p>Q. How long had this money been in that trunk?</p>
               <p>Rimbolt. It had been there a great many months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put it there?</p>
               <p>Rimbolt. No, I did not; I have seen my wife put it in, and take it out several times, she had the care of it; she went to it in my presence , and out of my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say how much money there was of your own knowledge?</p>
               <p>Rimbolt. I cannot say how much there was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner by, when you missed it?</p>
               <p>Rimbolt. He was in the house just before my wife discovered to me it was lost; he had been employ'd to move some of the things, my wife bid him take my cloaths, and carry them over to the other house that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him, to induce him to say that was your money?</p>
               <p>Rimbolt . He soon own'd it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him, if he would confess, no harm should come to him?</p>
               <p>Rimbolt . I did tell him, that if he would make a genuine confession, I would forgive him; but when I came to town, I had reason to be more angry with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you sware that money you had from him, is your property?</p>
               <p>Rimbolt . I could know it by a particular guinea, (be produced it ) I think I have seen this guinea a thousand times.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you let him go?</p>
               <p>Rimbolt. Really , when I saw him on shipboard, I was affected at the sight of him. I was more griev'd perhaps than he was. I did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100023"/> say, I will do you no harm, he desir'd he might not be blown about the town as a common thief. Then he wanted to have his boots pull'd off and we found the money in them.</p>
               <p>Q Have not you said since, you did not believe he intended to steal it, and that you would assist him in giving him a character in Holland?</p>
               <p>Rimbolt . I never did tell him, I did not believe he stole it. I told him, if it was possible, I would send him over-sea, and would not prosecute him, without running the hazard of my life; and if he would let me have the other money, I would get him abroad if I could .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never say to any body else, you did not believe he had rob'd you?</p>
               <p>Rimbolt . No; I never did.</p>

            . I am wife to the prosecutor; there were two hundred and twenty guineas in the trunk with the Jacobus.</p>
               <p>C. Look at this crack'd guinea. (She looks at it.)</p>
               <p>Fr. Rimbolt. I can swear this very guinea was amongst the rest , I have had it thirteen years in the purse, it was amongst the money I lost. We were going out of that house, to a house over the way; he brought a bundle over the way, and ask'd where he must put it; I shew'd him; he put it down, and went back again; and as I was coming over the way, I met him coming again with a bundle of cloaths. I went directly to move my trunk, which was almost the last thing I had to move in the house. To the best of my knowledge I found it lock'd, it open'd as usual; I took out a little trunk, and look'd for my purse to put into it. I missed my purse and my money, the trunk had never been moved this twelve years. I opened all my cloaths, and shook them, but could not find my purse, my husband said, O Lord I am ruin'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether this boy ever saw you put money in it?</p>
               <p>Fr. Rimbolt . Yes; he did once. I have a value for his mother, I have lent her now and then a guinea , he had seen me go to the purse, and take out a guinea, two several times, to send by him to his mother.</p>
               <p>Q. What money was in the purse?</p>
               <p>Fr. Rimbolt. I cannot tell, but I know there was above a hundred pound; I call'd my other servant , and ask'd him if he had taken my purse ; he said he had not; then I said, where is the other? ( meaning the prisoner.) I found he was gone , we sent to his mother, she came and said, she knew nothing of him, and hearing him often say he would go to France, my husband went after him, and brought him home .</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>

            . I live not a great way from the prosecutor ; when he was rob'd , he came to my house, and told me of it, and desired my assistance. He drew up an advertisement, and left it with some friend to be put into the paper. We took coach, and went to the Borough, there took a post-chaise, and went directly to Gravesend. We staid there, thinking he would come down in the Gravesend-boat, but he did not. We took a post-chaise , and went directly for Dover. At Rochester we described the prisoner , but could not hear of him. When we came to Dover, we found him on board a ship; we took and brought him on shore into a publick house, there I tax'd him about the money; he seemed to deny it at first; after that. I told him his master would not hurt him, in case he would give him the money he had taken away, and his master told him to the same purport. Then the prisoner began to unstrap his boots, and said, he would deliver the money to his master within a trifle, that is ten or twelve pound, I cannot say which; he went to pull his boots off, but could not; then I said I will help you, accordingly I did; when they were off, the money was taken out and deliver'd into his master's possession.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was there of it?</p>
               <p>Toboyce . There were a hundred and fourscore guineas . We went into another room, and took a piece of paper, and I noted it down, and Mr. Rimbolt counted it . I think the prisoner made a little bill of what he had spent coming down to Dover. We brought him to Canterbury : he said I wish you would search me for my master's satisfaction; for there was twenty guineas missing besides what he had spent. I search'd him, but could find no more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the whole of the money found upon him?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100024"/>Toboyce . I did, there was 180 guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe a crooked guinea?</p>
               <p>Toboyce . I cannot say I observed that. We came towards London, and I left them on Black-health . Being on horseback , I came faster than they could in the chaise. The prisoner had got on horseback at Canterbury, and rode from there to a house about six miles on this side Sitting-bourne . It was in the dead of the night, and he might have made his escape if he would.</p>
               <p>Cross examination .</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner acknowledge he had the money at first seeing you?</p>
               <p>Toboyce. At first he seem'd to be surprised, and when we asked him about the money , he said what money?</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body tell him he should not be prosecuted if he would discover where the money was?</p>
               <p>Toboyce . I said he should not be hurt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did his master say the same?</p>
               <p>Toboyce . He did, and the prisoner said upon that consideration he would deliver it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Who counted the money?</p>
               <p>Toboyce . Mr. Rimbolt counted it in his hat by single guineas, and when he came to 20, I noted 20 down, and there was a five guinea piece, and a two guinea piece, two quarters of guineas, and a Jacobus, besides the 180 guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor . In what capacity was the prisoner with you ?</p>
               <p>Rimbolt. He was my apprentice.</p>
               <p>Q. What money had you with him?</p>
               <p>Rimbolt. I had no money with him; his friends were not able to give any. His mother is a poor woman, if she wanted a guinea or two, my wife has lent it her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>When I had been into the closet, and was carrying these things cross the way, I suppose the purse was amongst the things, and dropt in the street , and at my returning back, I found the purse in the street, and put it in my pocket.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner 15 or 10 years.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is he?</p>
               <p>Foster. I believe him to be near 20 years of age ; I have known his master and mistress a good many years; the prisoner's character was always reckoned to be very good. I keep a sale shop the corner of Monmouth-street: I have a great many hundred pounds worth of goods in my shop, and the prisoner had egress and regress there. I had some conversation with his mistress the day after the fact was committed. She was at breakfast in her own house. I and another gentleman desired to know how the affair was? I asked her if the chest was broke open? She said no, it was not. She said she well recollected then that she had had a gentleman dined with her a day or two before that time , and that she had put her plate, spoons, and money all in one box in the chest. She went to fetch a silver spoon to use with soup at dinner, and in taking it out she heard the purse fall on the floor; and she went down and left it. So I said to her it was a very weak thing of you not to pick it up then. She said she had locked the closet door, and thought it safe, and a day or two after she gave him the key of the closet door, and sent him to remove the goods there, and to take the cloaths out of the closet.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you account for the prisoner's having 180 guineas about him?</p>
               <p>Foster. I cannot take upon me to say how he came by them.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you find the purse in his boots?</p>
               <p>Rimbolt. No, it was in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Knellam Dawson. I know the prisoner very well. I am a salesman in Monmouth-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his general character?</p>
               <p>Dawson. It has been that of a sober, sedate, good boy always; I looked upon him to be a good servant to his master. I was with Mr. Foster at his mistress's. Mr. Foster said, for God's sake in what manner was this money taken away? She said, I do not know how it was taken away, but I believe I dropt the purse, but where I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>There appeared 12 other witnesses, who spoke well of his character before this affair.</p>

I took hold of it, and it was a piece of ribband.</p>

The next morning I received a letter from him. The contents were, that he was in trouble in New-prison, and begged I would come and speak to him. I did not go then, but on the 2d or 3d day I did. He told me he was taken up by a warrant for having carried away some books of a man that he had lived with before, and desired I would apply to the person that was to prosecute him. Then I was alarmed, and suspected him . My wife when I came home told me, there was a yard of long lawn missing. I went to the prison and asked him about it. He acknowledged he had taken it. I lost silks and sattins of divers sorts , the quantity impossible to be ascertained by me.</p>

I lost the plate mentioned in the indictment (mentioning the particulars, all or most marked with a lion, his crest;) a coat, two waistcoats, a perriwig, and two hats. The plate was taken from out of a parlour behind my shop, the coat and waistcoat I had pulled off when I went to bed, which I had wore the day before. My apprentice and another lad lay below in the shop. In my waistcoat pocket that I wore under my night-gown were some letters I had received directed to me at my house. The prisoner being taken that morning with all the things on him, and carried to Guildhall, the gentlemen , on examining the pockets, found the letters, by which means they found where to send for me. A messenger came, and I went to Guildhall, there was the prisoner and the goods mentioned, and a tap-borer, a file, and a dark lanthorn; but part of his examination was taken before I came there; he had a mind to regale himself at my expence, and had taken a ham, my property (produced in court.) I did not think it needful to put this in the indictment. (The goods mentioned in the indictment produced in court and deposed to.) They have been in the care of the constable ever since.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you think the doors were opened?</p>
               <p>Whitehead . The bolts were forced back by the means of the holes that were bored.</p>

             . I am constable of the night; the prisoner was brought to me about three in the morning, on the 25th of July, with his face all black'd over, by two watchmen and a porter that plies in the Fleet-market. We search'd him; all those goods were found upon him, and these instruments (produced in court) a tap-borer, a file, a dark-lanthorn, and a pair of nail-nippers. I ask'd the prisoner how he came by the things? he told me he went to make water at the corner of Fox-court, Gray's-inn-lane, and there trod upon them. He had a great ham, and a currant tart; I took an inventory of them . and sent him to the Compter . We found in a waistcoat-pocket a letter directed to Mr. Willes , and I carried it to him.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Bear-alley near Fleet-market; betwixt three and four o'clock in the morning, on the 25th of July I was about the middle of the alley; the prisoner was coming down; when he came over against me he stop'd to make water.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Bear-alley from the prosecutor's house in Brook-street?</p>
               <p>Treadwell. It is about a mile from it. Then Charles Legraft came to me, and said he had a suspicion that man had something about him that was not his own, and it seem'd to be very heavy; he turn'd down an alley called Black-bear-alley; I knew it was no thorough-fare; we follow'd him; he was standing leaning against a post , with the things on his arm; I said, my friend what do you do here? he said, I am a man under misfortunes , and am moving my goods. I said, it is possible it may be so; but you must go before the constable; he said, with all my heart; so I took hold of his collar, and we went on; going up Break-neck-stairs, he let the bundle of cloaths and the tea-kettle fall, and desired one of us would carry them for him. When we got into the Little-old-bailey , he said, you need not hold me by my collar, I'll go with you . We let go his collar , and he ran from me; but was retaken . I was present before the alderman when he was examined; there he said he found these things at Fox-court , Gray's-inn-lane; there I saw the tap-borer , the file, the dark-lanthorn, and nail-nippers, taken out of his pocket.</p>

I look'd up the Little-old-bailey, and saw the prisoner come running; I said, honest heart, stop ; he made a full blow at me with a cane ; I put my staff out , and he fell over it, and I fell with him; and my brother watchman came to my assistance, and we secur'd him; the porter, he staid by the things; we took the prisoner to the watch-house; he had got a great-coat on, and his face black'd all over; he wash'd his face, and delivered a tea-kettle, out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100028"/> of his pocket. I search'd him, and found four large spoons, a marrow-spoon and two large teaspoons in his pocket, and the tap-borer, file, nail-nipper and dark-lanthorn, he had some of the things fix'd in the back part of his breeches which he deliver'd to us.</p>

            . I was the first person that saw the pr isoner, I was at work in the New-Market, being a ticket-porter; I had followed the prisoner a good while before I let Treadwell know of him, he had been up one alley and down another , and seem'd to be heavy loaded, and as he went along I heard something rattle; seeing him, he made a stop in Bear-alley, as if he was making water. I passed him, and look'd at him, and went on to Treadwell, and said, there is a man that looks very suspicious to me to be a thief; he is very hard loaded. While I was talking to him the prisoner moved into another place; we went and took him, and I assisted in bringing him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>On the 25th of July in the morning , I was going down Gray's-inn-lane, being out late with a friend that was going to sea; I turn'd into Fox-court to make water, and saw two men standing there; they saw me, and went away; then I saw a large bundle lying behind a pawnbroker's door; I kick'd it, and call'd out to those men, and said they had left something behind them; but I saw them no more; then I took the bundle up, and carried it into Holborn, and carried it down there by several watchmen. I search'd it first, and found these things in the pockets of these coats; it is impossible for one man to take all these things out of a house; I found the file, auger, and dark-lanthorn in one pocket, and the spoons all separate in another. There was one bundle tied up in another, with a cord. I did not think proper to leave the things where I found them. I was going to carry them to Bear-alley, to the house of one Evans.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner many years; he was recommended to our house by an apothecary from Ludlow. I have continued my acquaintance with him ever since he came to town; he was brought up an apothecary. I knew him when he lived with several of the business; he bore an extraordinary good character at each place.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Smith. I was brought up a druggist . I now am a merchant. At this time I owe him money for attending my family.</p>

               <p>Q. Where?</p>
               <p>Chappel. My master is Mr. Foot in Hatton-garden. On the 21st of July I was in <placeName id="t17550910-36-crimeloc184">Drury-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. A private or public house?</p>
               <p>Chappel. A private house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Chappel. I was neither drunk nor sober; I was a little in liquor; not much.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be at that house?</p>
               <p>Chappel. I was in company with some friends at another house; and when I came out this good woman at the bar pick'd me up, and carried me to that house. The good woman asked me what I would give her? I told her I was lock'd out of my lodgings, and would be glad to lie there all night. I did not care where I lay, so that I did not lie in the streets. The prisoner said, I should be very welcome to lie in her bed, saying she had a lodging of her own; so I accepted it. I had my watch in my pocket at that time, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100029"/> I cut a hole in my breeches to put the string through , fearing my pocket should be pick'd for I was afraid it was a bad sort of a house, because I saw there was no furniture in it; and she made so bad an appearance; and there was no candle; we were in the dark.</p>

               <p>Q. How could you see her appearance then?</p>
               <p>Chappel. I had seen her in the street, but could discern but little of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were your buckles?</p>
               <p>Chappel. I had them in my shoes; I went to bed there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lie alone?</p>
               <p>Chappel . No; that good woman at the bar was my bedfellow.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body in that room but her and you?</p>
               <p>Chappel. No; there was not; nor no body else in the house. The woman of the house kept a green-stall (as I was informed afterwards), and was gone out to buy greens, and she left the key in the door, and I step'd out of bed and lock'd it, and put the key in my pocket. The good woman at the bar bid me be careful of my watch, and put it under my pillow; and said also, you have a very handsome pair of shoe-buckles, put them under the bed; and so I did, and put my breeches under the pillow, with my watch in them . I don't think she could see my shoe-buckles; but she said this to know whether I had such or not . I lay there all night, and awaked, as nigh as I can guess, at about five. Then the good woman was gone, I turned on the other side, and found no body with me. I can't tell when she left me. Then I went to put my cloaths on, and instead of finding my breeches and watch, I only found my breeches, and the other cloaths, as I left them .</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any money in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Chappel . I had a few halfpence, and I think a six-pence; all that was gone, only a brass weight, that was remaining in my pocket. I described the woman as well as I could at justice Fielding's. She went by the name of Bucksom Jenney; and she was taken, and carried before justice Fielding, and I was sent for there. She said there she had my slieve-buttons. I had given her my slieve-buttons, and what little money I had, to lie with her. She own'd she lay with me, and got up in the morning before me. She had pawn'd the buttons for 1 s. 6 d. which I had again. She said the watch and buckles were divided among some soldiers, and made away with, and that she received but little part of the gain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find the watch or buckles?</p>
               <p>Chappel . No; I never did: I heard where the buckles were; but I never went after them, fearing my master should have a suspicion of something of this kind .</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember how many oats you had in your lighter, at the time he mentions?</p>
               <p>Davis . I had about fourscore quarters, or thereabouts.</p>

               <p>Q. Was none of that missing?</p>
               <p>Davis. There were none miss'd, neither was I charged with any. When we take corn in we have a meeter's bill, and I always deliver that bill up at the compting-house, when my craft is empty; and if there had been any lost, when I deliver'd up that bill, I should have heard it; but I never did, till I heard Hicks and the prisoner confess it; but I never miss'd any.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear any complaint of bringing short measure?</p>
               <p>Davis. I never heard any complaint; but that my bill and my leading agreed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you land that fourscore quarters?</p>
               <p>Davis. At Trig-stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it loose in the lighter, or in sacks?</p>
               <p>Davis. There was some loose, and some in sacks.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there quite fourscore quarters?</p>
               <p>Davis. I have accounted with my principals for fourscore quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Davis. I am a corn lighterman, and do that business for Messrs. Ratcliff and Topham.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not you the person that took up the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Davis. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. On what account did you take him up?</p>
               <p>Davis. I sent the prisoner to watch my lighter; and on a Saturday-evening I desired him to make haste home in the morning; and I was uneasy he did not come till eleven. I sent my other apprentice to see if my craft was safe; and he returned, and said there were five sacks of malt put into her. I said, that is something strange. I said to the prisoner, do you go, and take care of the goods; but he neglected, and did not go up; but my other servant went again, and returned, and told me, he had convoy'd the craft, and put them five sacks into the barge's cabin. After that I heard there were three quarters of malt lost, from

            . I told Nedriff he must take the prisoner up and bring him to justice, and if he would not, I would never deliver him up his goods. I took the prisoner before a constable; then he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100031"/> told me, he had robb'd my lighter of six quarters of oats. I told him then, I did not know that I had lost any, nor do I know it this hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether in the month of January, there was any oats consign'd to you from the country or not?</p>
               <p>Davis. To be sure there was a great deal of corn in my craft, in the month of January.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you name a particular time in the month?</p>
               <p>Davis. I cannot say what time.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you tell by your books?</p>
               <p>Davis. I have not got my books about me.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you tell what quantity was brought by your lighter, about the 26th of January last?</p>
               <p>Davis. I believe there might be about ninety quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never miss any oats at that time?</p>
               <p>Davis. No; I never did. I have been paid for the lighteridge of all that corn, I never was bated or tax'd a farthing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear any complaint; did they never say, Mr. Davis, my corn does not make out according to the bill?</p>
               <p>Davis. No; never.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you measure the corn?</p>
               <p>Davis. No; it is measured to me, and I bring it up, and deliver it with the meeter's bill, to the compting-house. Then he is to take care, and see whether there is so much as the bill mentions.</p>
               <p>Q. How much of it might be in sacks, about the twenty-sixth of January?</p>
               <p>Davis. I believe there might be forty-five quarters in sacks.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not possible for your servants to take some out of one sack, and some out of another, and make up the quantity of six quarters, and yet deliver in the same number of sacks?</p>
               <p>Davis. I do not know whether it is possible to be done or not; and I know the trade very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon you, upon your oath to say, it is impossible to lose six quarters, and your gentlemen know nothing of the matter?</p>
               <p>Davis. I believe it impossible out of so small a quantity, but it must be missed.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you charg'd with the sacks being missing?</p>
               <p>Davis. No; I am not. But if the right number of sacks had not been delivered, I must have had a complaint about them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has the prisoner to serve of his apprenticeship?</p>
               <p>Davis. He has no longer to serve than February next.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you lose twelve sacks, and yet not miss them?</p>
               <p>Davis. That is not in my province, that belongs the grainery-keeper.</p>
               <p>Q. Do the grainery-keepers measure the oats when they receive them of you?</p>
               <p>Davis. That, that is in sacks, they never measure, that, that is loose, they measure.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the loose corn delivered into the grainery?</p>
               <p>Davis. That I cannot say; sometimes they let it lie in the lighter, and load it away in carts, without putting it in the grainery.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hicks. What time in January did you and the prisoner take these oats out of Davis's lighter?</p>
               <p>Hicks. It was the latter end of January; I cannot say the day of the month, but I am sure, it was in January; it was the first day that the press broke out in the night, for the prisoner was pressed out of a boat, after we had done the fact.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this six quarters you mention, all done up in sacks?</p>
               <p>Hicks. They were; and there were a great deal of loose oats in the lighter, and these sacks were put so as to keep the loose oats from falling over-board.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day, did you sell Lambeth the oats?</p>
               <p>Hicks. I believe it was about nine or ten in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with it?</p>
               <p>Hicks. His servants shot the corn into his own sacks, and the sacks when emptied, were delivered to the prisoner again; and we flung them over-board, at the Old-barge-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How much might there be in Davis's lighter, all in sacks?</p>
               <p>Hicks. I believe there might be a matter of twenty quarters, all in ack.</p>

            . I am grainery-keeper to Messrs. Ratcliff and Topham.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any corn belonging to Davis's lighter consigned to them?</p>
               <p>Peather. At the time this corn was stole, I was ill; there were thirteen quarters missing.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it missing ?</p>
               <p>Peather. I believe it was the latter end of January last, or the beginning of February; but I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100032"/> cannot be punctual of my own knowledge as to the time being ill.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Davis work all your corn?</p>
               <p>Peather . He does; and according to the meeter's bill that comes up every time, and our book of delivery out again; we found we had so much short of what we should have had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know what became of that thirteen quarters?</p>
               <p>Peather . No; we never did. When the prisoner was taken up, we heard he had made a confession; that he had taken the craft up to Black-friars-road, with all the corn in her, which might be about eighty or ninety quarters, and that he and the evidence, took six quarters out, which was in sacks. The prisoner confessed to me in Bridewell, Surry . that he took six quarters of oats out of our lighter.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your missing the oats, did you ever acquaint Davis with it?</p>
               <p>Peather . Yes; he knows we lost the corn.</p>
               <p>Q. How could he know that?</p>
               <p>Peather . Because I saw both my master in the compting-house, examining him about it; telling him, there were thirteen quarters short.</p>
               <p>Q. What said Davis to that?</p>
               <p>Peather . He said he could not tell any thing abo ut it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Davis . When they told you there were thirteen quarters short, what did you say to that?</p>
               <p>Davis. Do you think in my bringing ten thousand quarters in a year, there cannot be thirteen quarters short ? I do not know he ever told me there were thirteen quarters missing, till about three months ago. Then he said our master says, there are thirteen quarters of corn missing in the grainery.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether he did not in a reasonable time after the corn was measured, inform you there were thirteen quarters missing?</p>
               <p>Davis . What may you call a reasonable time?</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did this grainery-keeper inform you, this thirteen quarters were missing?</p>
               <p>Davis. Is that what you ask me?</p>
               <p>Court. It is.</p>
               <p>Davis. He informed me, there is thirteen quarters of corn short.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he tell you that?</p>
               <p>Davis. Never till such time the prisoner was taken up.</p>
               <p>Court. Tell the court what time he told you.</p>
               <p>Davis. I cannot say what month, neither will I say it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Peather. When did your masters inform Davis, of what was missing?</p>
               <p>Peather. It was in the month of February.</p>
               <p>Q. Might these thirteen quarters be lost out of the grainery?</p>
               <p>Peather. I am sure there could not be any lost out of the grainery.</p>

I took up Stanley, on suspicion of robbing my master the prosecutor, on the Thursday after the robbery; he had work'd with my master, I left him in custody of the beadle, and went and search'd his lodgings. The first thing I found was the belows; he lodg'd at the house of William Green; by looking about, I found every thing mentioned in the indictment, exclusive of the spoon and money.

By searching farther, we found a box concealed, and in it things belonging to other prosecutors; then we went to Stanley, and told him what we had found; he said, he could not help it now it was done, and denied any body's being concern'd with him. Then we took him before justice Fielding, and there he own'd the fact; and he had my master's hat on his head, at the same time. I never saw Groom, before I saw him before justice Fielding.</p>

On Saturday the fifth of July, about four in the afternoon, two or three booksellers came to me, and told me they had lost book; that day, a little after came the prisoner to the shop window ; I saw him take two books up, and clap them under his left arm, under his coat. I went to him, and said, friend what have you got here? he said nothing of mine; he went to make a push to run away, and the books fell from under his cloaths . They are called , A journey through every stage of life, (produced in court ) I took him into my shop, then there fell another book from him. but that was not mine; the other two were. I took him before justice Fielding; there he own'd he had liv'd in this way for about six weeks and beg'd he might be sent to sea.</p>

I said, I will be with you, and immediately rung my door bell, and open'd the passage, in order to get at him; he jump'd from the wall into the passage. I called out thief, and watch, no watch came; my own servants came, and a servant belonging to a gentleman, that lives next door. The gate at the farthest end of the passage, that opens out upon Constitution-hill, was lock'd; upon seeing that, I knew the man must be somewhat near; we found some glass broken, and found the bundle of the goods mention'd, hanging on the inside of the wall, on a tenter-hook, the wall being full of them; they were wrapped, up in a blanket; the woman let us in to search the house, where we suspected he was got in from the area; we search'd about, and at last found the prisoner, and seiz'd him in the privy, behind the door. By this time, there was a great crowd of people in the street; we took him to the round-house; at coming back, we thought proper to search the houses near, where he was, to see if he had any accomplices, and we found at Mr. Vernon's, by telling them what things I had found , they were taken from them; and upon going into the room, we found the things tumbled about, and a trunk open, in which we were told, had been some of the things.</p>

               <p>I am a watch-case-maker; having nothing to do. I went to Kensington to see two or three friends. I staid there and drank part of two or three pots of beer; when I came to this passage, I waited at the gate in order to be let through it, a gentleman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100036"/> opened the gate in order to let me through, when I came to the middle of the passage I met two men; they told me the farther gate was open, but when I came there, I found it shut; then I went to get over the gate, as I had often done when a child. I was born there; Mr. Belinger said he would meet me, I went to run back, and fell down an area being a little in liquor, and staid there till Mr. Belinger and some other people came and took me out.</p>

The constable came and said he had found such pieces of copper upon the prisoner; and upon examining about the shop, we missed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your shop?</p>
               <p>Frith . It is on the Bank-side in the parish o f St. Saviour's, Surry . (The copper produced in court) Part of it I can swear to be my master's property. The prisoner was taken before Mr. alderman Chitty, and there he confessed he had taken it, and for an excuse said, he was drunk when he took it.</p>

            . Between twelve and one o'clock in the morning I met the prisoner with this copper in Fenchurch-street near Aldgate. I ask'd him where he was going, and what he had got? He said he had got some wood, I laid my hand upon it, and said, it does not feel like wood; he said, to tell you the truth, it is copper. I asked him where he brought it from? He said he could not tell, or would not tell. I asked him where he was going to carry it? He said to White-chapel. I took him to the watch-house. Then he said he took it out of his master's warehouse, but he did not mention his master's name .</p>
               <p>Q. to Frith. Did he own to you whose property the copper was?</p>
               <p>Frith . He said it was the property of Mr. Stevens, and begg'd for mercy.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Please to ask him whether I did not say I bought the copper on the other side the water?</p>

            . I was in the watch-house, and took the prisoner to the Compter; he would not give us an account how he came by the copper, I went about after that to the copper-smiths to inquire who had lost such pieces.</p>
               <p>Frith. I can't say I had made such strict examination as I have done since. That I am certain is my master's. I have measured one of the pieces to see if I could cut a 17 inch bottom out of it. I have had it in my hand scores of times. We miss'd such as the other pieces, but they not being so remarkable, I will not swear to them, I never suspected him of any such thing before.</p>

               <p>Q. What did she say before she beat him?</p>
               <p>Travilian. She said nothing before she beat him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sent up there to read your books, or to do any thing of that kind?</p>

               <p>Q. How long did she keep her foot upon him?</p>
               <p>Travilian. I can't tell justly, when she let him get up she did not do any thing else to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she do after that?</p>
               <p>Travilian. She went down stairs?</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say after this?</p>

               <p>Travilian. I do not know.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he continue complaining till he went to bed?</p>
               <p>Travilian. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lay with him?</p>
               <p>Travilian. I did, and because he should not die in my arms, I got out of the bed and lay on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he when he was in bed?</p>
               <p>Travilian. He was very hot, and said nothing but, Oh, my belly aches!</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go to sleep?</p>
               <p>Travilian. He did a little while, and then he waked .</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you got out of the bed after you got in?</p>

             was about 11 years old.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in the house?</p>
               <p>Cox. I have been in it about 12 months. Knipe came into the room to me about five in the evening, nine weeks ago to-morrow.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how he came by his death?</p>
               <p>Cox. I did not see it; about five in the afternoon, I was sitting in my room which is on a floor with that the boys were at play in. Knipe came in and pulled off his coat and waistcoat, and shew'd me his arms, and said Mrs. Hughes had killed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what she had done to him?</p>
               <p>Cox. No, he did not, but went to bed directly, and complained of his belly; he said his bowels pain'd him much, and he was very uneasy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing pass in the other room while you was sitting there?</p>
               <p>Cox. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How did his arm look?</p>
               <p>Cox. That look'd very much bruised. Two women brought him up about one o'clock next morning, I suppose he had been down to go to the necessary-house. They put him in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he alive then?</p>
               <p>Cox. He was; and about five o'clock, I heard the words,

               <p>Q. What did they appear to be given by?</p>
               <p>Cox. They both appeared to be given with a stick, his cod was swell'd, and black and green; he was born bursten.</p>

            . I have liv'd in this workhouse 10 or a dozen years; I heard the child cry out in the next room to me, it was in a three pair of stairs, in a garret; it was about six or seven o'clock; I was sitting in a chair by the child's bed side. After he came out of that room, I ask'd him what was the matter? he came out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100039"/> crying: he told me Mrs. Hughes , or mother Hughes, had kill'd him. Said I, how has she kill'd you? he strip'd himself, and shew'd me his arm. I saw two or three ugly marks there, he told me his back was worse; I saw two or three stripes that look'd black and blew; he told me she had thrown him down, and stamp'd on him; he said she had kill'd him, had kill'd him, and he should die. I bid him go to bed, and accordingly he did and I heard him nothing but groan in bed; and at about 11 o'clock, he went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Watson. I know he went out of the room; I saw him, for I was setting upright in my bed. I lay in the same room, within three yards of his bed, two women brought him up to bed again; and when they had put him in, I thought he was very easy and quiet. In about two hours, I heard him groan very much; all he said was, she has kill'd me, she has kill'd me. In the morning, two women came up to look at the child, and told me he was dead; then they searched his private parts, and told me it was black.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did they come up?</p>
               <p>Watson. I believe it was about six or seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the body after it was dead?</p>
               <p>Watson. I never looked at the body after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever speak to the prisoner after the child was dead?</p>

               <p>Primmer. He lay in the garret; but this was down at the bottom of the house. I got up and open'd the door; the child said it is me, mamma Primmer; then I knew it to be the deceased. I went down to him, he lay upon the ground, just within the threshold of the door, flat on his back, holding up his belly with his two hands. I took hold on his right arm, he said O mamma, I cannot stand (the child used to call me mamma,) I am a dying, I shall die. Then Gilmore ran down to me, and we took the child under his shoulders and back, and carried him up to his bed, and laid him down in it; and cover'd him up warm; and in the morning about half an hour after five the bell rung for the boys to get up, and the child was then found to be dead.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time of your carrying him up, and your tucking him up, did he make any complaint .</p>
               <p>Primmer. He never spoke a word more. The people that found him dead, told me he was not cold then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the body after it was dead?</p>
               <p>Primmer. I did, I found he had had a kick in his right groin, and the place was as black as a shoe; it was dented in like the print of a toe of a shoe, into the side of his groin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner know he</p>
               <p>Primmer. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Primmer. She has called him bursten coded dog, a thousand times I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has the prisoner lived in the house?</p>
               <p>Primmer. They talk she has liv'd in the house 15 or 16 years.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any talk with her after the child was dead?</p>
               <p>Primmer. I told her of it. She said if she did kick him, she could not tell whether she did or not.</p>
               <p>Q. What was her employ?</p>
               <p>Primmer. Her business was to overlook the boys when they were at work, and keep them orderly.</p>

            . I am mistress of the workhouse, and have been two years and better. Mabell Hughes's work was to take care of the silk, and the children that spun it; on this Sunday, after the duty of dinner was over; the deceased child was among the rest of the children; he was as well as usual to all appearance, in perfect health . I saw him again at half an hour after three, to all appearance, then in present health; and I never saw him alive after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he bursten?</p>
               <p>E. Cole. He was, but he was very chearful.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe his groin?</p>
               <p>Hart. I did, I observ'd no blackness upon it at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing of a dent ?</p>
               <p>Hart. No, I did not .</p>
               <p>Q. Was he open'd?</p>
               <p>Hart. He was , and we found there had been an inflammation in his bowels, particularly where the rupture was. The child had a rupture, which occasioned a strangilation of the gut that was in the scrotum .</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by strangilation?</p>
               <p>Hart. The gut was tightned by being inflamed, and the gut was a little putrified .</p>
               <p>Q. What do you suppose was the cause of his death ?</p>
               <p>Hart. I imagine it was that blow, or bruise the child had receiv'd .</p>
               <p>Q. Might not these appearances have been without a blow or bruise?</p>
               <p>Hart . They might, but I suppose they were by that, because the child was well before.</p>
               <p>Q. The state in which you found the body, could that arise from a natural cause?</p>
               <p>Hart. It might.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had not heard of the blows given, and you had seen the body open in the state it was; what would have been your judgment upon the case?</p>
               <p>Hart . I should have thought it was from the inflammation upon the parts; but I could not particularly assign a reason why there should be an inflammation there.</p>

            . As they thought the boy was murdered, they applied to Mr. Hart and myself to inspect the body: we found no marks of violence on the outward parts, that might occasion his death. The boy had been dead 3 days, and there appeared no other blackness than what might have been on a body that time. We proceeded to open the body, and found there was a natural rupture. We thought the gut had been forc'd down violently into the scrotum from the laxity of the part, and occasioned a strangulation by the tightness of the part, after great part of the intestine was forc'd down into the scrotum.</p>

               <p>Q. How long might a blow given before his death, be the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Bulcock. It might in twelve hours time, where the bruise happens on such a place as that, it mortifies immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing to lead you to judge there had been violence used or not?</p>
               <p>Bulcock. That would be very hard to say, for the skin was not so much as chased, or lacerated upon the ruptured part. I really did imagine he had fallen against a chest as he came out of the room ?</p>
               <p>Q. Then was there not reason to believe there had been violence used some way?</p>
               <p>Bulcock . Yes, there was great reason to believe there had been some violence in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your judgment on the whole ?</p>
               <p>Bulcock. My judgment is, that the boy had received some blow or injury upon that ruptured part , which I do imagine principally was the cause of his death, though if he had not had a rupture I much question whether it would have been the occasion of his death or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing a boy of that age, without a rupture, and a grown woman was to stamp upon him, would not that be dangerous?</p>
               <p>Bulcock . Whether it would thrust them out of their place, is very uncertain.</p>
               <p>Q. If the boy had a rupture, would it not be the occasion of his death, was a grown woman to stamp upon them parts?</p>
               <p>Bulcock. Yes, I really believe it would.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>They were making a sad noise, and they were given to make away with my work; lay it in one place and another, and drop it about, and throw it into the vault, and that was an abominable thing. I did not do this; it was by his falling between two trunks, against the sharp end of one of them, that it was done.</p>
               <p>To her character.</p>
               <p>Isabella Howlaston. I have known the prisoner ever since I was seven years old, I never heard of any cruelty by her. She has been in my father's house six or seven weeks at a time; she was quite tender to our children. Please to ask the mistress of the workhouse whether any of the people had ever made any complaints to her of the prisoner's cruelties.</p>
               <p>Court. If the prisoner has a mind to call her to her character, or ask her that question, she has a right so to do.</p>

            . Mr. Bradbury desir'd I would come in, and he ask'd me who it was that was at the door; I said it was my fellow apprentice. I was brought up a papist, Mr. Bradbury desir'd I would come in, and he ask'd me how I came to hear him when I was a papist ? I told him my fellow apprentice desired me to come to hear him, or I should not have come; then he said I might come to hear him at Glover's hall Beech-lane .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go and hear n there?</p>
               <p>Hearne. I did ; and the first time he spoke to me there, was the night that Mr. Merideth was buried from the tabernacle ; I do not recollect the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. What past that time?</p>
               <p>Hearne. After the congregation was over, the people were desired to go to the burying, and one Mrs. Hall, was to stay to shut up the Door. Mr. Bradbury ask'd her what she staid for? she said to shut up the door; he ask'd her if it did not go with a spring-lock? She said yes, then he said you may go take the key with you, and I will stay with James here, I want to speak with him. I was leaning my head against the chimney-piece; he ask'd me if I was well, I said very well ; he took me upon his knee, and dragg'd me by the coat, and kissed me; then he put his hand into my breeches, which were torn; then he got up, and put out the candle, and unbuttoned his own breeches, and bid me play with his y - d. This was about 9 o'clock, I told him I was afraid I should have a noise with my master; do not be afraid, said he , if they-scold you, come away, and I will get you another place.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this all that past that night?</p>
               <p>Hearne. This was all that past at that time?</p>
               <p>Q. How many times had you been to hear him before?</p>
               <p>Hearne. I can't tell how many.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you had any conversation with him before this?</p>
               <p>Hearne. We had talk'd together before.</p>
               <p>Q. Who else has been in your company when you have been together?</p>
               <p>Hearne . Mr. Cook used to be in company with us, and other company that used to come to the hall .</p>
               <p>Q. How many days after this, was it you saw him ?</p>
               <p>Hearne. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember your going of an errant for your master?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100044"/>Hearne. I remember my master's sending me on a Friday morning to receive some money.</p>
               <p>Q. How many days after this do you think it was?</p>
               <p>Hearne. I can't tell .</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect as near as you can ?</p>
               <p>Hearne . It was not a great while , I believe about a week after .</p>
               <p>Q. What happen'd there?</p>
               <p>Hearne. I went to receive some money for my master, and going up Tyburn-road , I met Mr. Bradbury, he ask'd me if I had had any breakfast.</p>
               <p>Q. What pass'd between you then?</p>
               <p>Hearne. Nothing pass'd then, but talking about what religion I had been of. I went down as far as Soho-square , and he gave me some books to carry to Mr. Brown's, in St. John-street, at the Rainbow and Dove.</p>
               <p>Q. What religion was you then?</p>
               <p>Hearne. I was a Roman-catholic at that time, I went to Mr. Brown's, and carried the books, and I ask'd Mr. Brown, what o'clock it was; he said twelve, then I was afraid to go home, and so wandered about the streets, till night , and then went to Mr. Bradbury .</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Bradbury know you was sent of a message for your master that time?</p>
               <p>Hearne . He knew I was; I told him I went for some money for my master, and the gentleman was not at home. That night he call'd at Mr. Cook's, that was in company with us, and I went to his chapel, in Chandler's-street, to hear him preach.</p>
               <p>Q. What night of the week was that?</p>
               <p>Hearne . That was on a Friday night, Mr. Bradbury told Mr. Cook, I was to tell my master, I could not see the gentleman, till the afternoon, and could not take the money till the afternoon, then I was afraid to go home. Mr. Bradbury bid me say I could not see, him all the day. After that, I went to Mr. Bradbury's house, and Mr. Bradbury came half an hour after, and ask'd whether it was not truth, that I had not been home; Mr. Cook said yes, then he said we will go along with him; then going up Charter-house-lane, he desired Mr. Cook would go with me, and said, if my master would not receive me in, he would. Mr. Cook went in and told my master. I was at the door with the money; but my master refused me, and would not let me come in that night.</p>
               <p>Q. What religion is your master?</p>
               <p>Hearne. He is a church-man ; then I went to my father's lodgings, and he was not at home, or he would have taken me to my master. His landlord let me lie in his house. The next morning, I wandered about Charter-house-square: and in the afternoon, my master took me in again. Mr. Bradbury desired me to come away, and said , he would get me another master; then I told my master I did not like the trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you tell him so ?</p>
               <p>Hearne. Mr. Bradbury said, if I chose to come away, he could get me a better place; this was before witnesses.</p>
               <p>Q. Who heard it?</p>
               <p>Hearne. Mr. Brown , was one that heard him say so; I came away from my master that same day.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was it?</p>
               <p>Hearne. It was on Saturday; then I went to my sister's in Charter-house-street , where I met with my father; he desired me to go to my master, but I did not; but went to one Newton's in Bartholomew's-hospital .</p>
               <p>Q. Was that by Mr. Bradbury's direction?</p>
               <p>Hearne. No ; it was not. From thence I went to Mrs. Brown's, in St. John's-street, there I met Mr. Bradbury, and told him how it was. He said James, what made you come away in such a hurry, as you have but a small time to serve? you might have staid till I got you a place. Then Mr. Bradbury wanted a lodging for me, and Mr. Stevens got me a lodging in St. John's-street. And one Sunday night, he desired Mr. Whitaker, that lives in Worsley-court , in the Minories, to let me lie at his house, till he could get me in at my master's again, or get me another place.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Hearne. This was on a Sunday, after he had done preaching?</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he ask'd Mr. Whitaker?</p>
               <p>Hearne . I heard him, and I went to Mr. Whitaker's house, that night to lie. Mr. Whitaker said, he had but poor lodging for me; but if I accepted it, I should live there till he got me a master; and on the Tuesday night following, Mr. Bradbury came and desired to know if he could lie there .</p>
               <p>Q. Had you laid there on the Sunday and Monday nights.</p>
               <p>Hearne. I had; and on that Tuesday I was at Glover's-hall, and heard him preach; Mrs. Whitaker told him, she had but two beds, and she supposed he would not choose o lie with me, and my bed was small. He said he would make shift for one night, and he was not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100045"/> well, and did not chuse to go home that night; she said if he was willing to make shift, she was willing to entertain him with what she had.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this conversation?</p>
               <p>Hearne. This was at Glover's-hall in Beech-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does Mr. Bradbury live?</p>
               <p>Hearne. He lives in Stockwell-street , Oxford-market, we went to Mr. Whitaker's, between nine and ten o'clock that night, Mr. Whitaker did not come to the hall that day, and he was surprized to see Mr. Bradbury come to his house, and he desired Mr. Bradbury to excuse him, for he had but poor entertainment for him. Mr. Bradbury proposed to lie with me; but my bed being but a little one, Mr. Whitaker and his wife lay in my bed, and Mr. Bradbury and I lay in their bed.</p>
               <p>Court. Now give a particular, as well as a true account of what pass'd that night.</p>
               <p>Hearne. After we put the candle out, and we were in the bed, he flung his legs about me, and kiss'd me; and first tried with his finger to enter my body, then he tried with his y - d, and did enter as far as he could, and his s - d came from him. The next morning we both got up, and went to Mr. Milward's in Shoreditch to dinner,</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing particular pass there?</p>
               <p>Hearne. Nothing in particular; then I left him, and went back to Mr. Whitaker's to dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go with you there?</p>
               <p>Hearne. No; He did not. I went to the chapel to hear him preach, being Wednesday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he and you lay together after this?</p>
               <p>Hearne. The next time was about a week after, one Thursday-night. Then he said he was not well, and it was too far for him to go.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened that night?</p>
               <p>Hearne. The same passed as before.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him after that?</p>
               <p>Hearne. In about a week after; he lay with me four or five times at Mr. Whitaker's, and he behaved in the same manner every time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you lie at Mr. Whitaker's?</p>
               <p>Hearne. I lay there about six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was at the expence of your lodging?</p>
               <p>Hearne. Mr. Bradbury was.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Hearne. He told me so, for I was not able. After that, he gave me a shilling to go to the Register-office, to have my name registered, to get a place, and I got a place the day after .</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you a character ?</p>
               <p>Hearne. Mr. Brown, in St. John's-street did; it was to Mr. Mayne, a haberdasher, at the sign of the Sun, in the Strand .</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay there ?</p>
               <p>Hearne. I staid there about a month ?</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave him?</p>
               <p>Hearne . Because I used to stay too long on errands.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any intercourse with Bradbury there?</p>
               <p>Hearne . No; I had not. After that, I went to Kensington, to a boarding-school, where I had been before, to see the people; they desired me to stay all night; I staid the Friday, Saturday and Sunday; and on the Monday, I went to Mr. Bradbury's, where he lodg'd; he was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time was this?</p>
               <p>Hearne. This was about three days after I left Mr. Mayne's; they ask'd me the reason why I came from my place. I told them my father had been there, and told Mr. Mayne, I was an apprentice, and then they would not have any thing more to do with me; then they said I might lie at Mr. Kepling's, who is the pew-opener at the chapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lie there?</p>
               <p>Hearne. I did that night; and next morning I saw Mr. Bradbury, he ask'd me the reason of my coming from my place. I said, because I had staid out too long on my errands; he desired me not to tell Mrs. Shore, but still say my father had come, and told them I was an apprentice, and then they would not have me any longer; I boarded at Mrs. Shore's, and lodg'd at the chapel. Mr. Bradbury told her I was a poor lad turned out by my father, and my master, on the account of my religion.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid the expence at Mrs. Shore's?</p>
               <p>Hearne. I paid none; I do not know who did.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it you went to Mrs. Shore's.</p>
               <p>Hearne. It was after I came from Mr. Mayne's, I went to board with Mrs. Shore on a Monday; and on the Wednesday following, after preaching at the chapel, in Chandler's-street, Grosvenor's-square , Mr. Bradbury came down from the pulpit, and after the people were gone, he began to talk bawdy there with Mr. Cook.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100046"/>Q. Did any thing particular pass between you two then?</p>
               <p>Hearne . No; nothing in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Mr. Bradbury live?</p>
               <p>Hearne . He lodg'd and boarded at Mrs. Shore's, and I lay at the chapel, and had my victuals at Mrs. Shore's. On the Thursday night, Mrs. Pickering, who is Mrs. Shore's daughter, said it was too far for me to go to the chapel to lie; and said, I should be there in their garret, this was the night the fire happened in Covent-garden. They desired me to go and see where it was ; I went, and when I came back, Mr. Bradbury was come home; Mrs. Shore desired the maid might go up after I was in bed, and take away the candle; Mr. Bradbury said, he would go up and fetch it himself; so I went to bed; after that, he came up and desired me to come down to his bed, when every body was gone to bed. I went down to his chamber, he was reading in a large book; he told me to get into bed, and he would come presently after. I was got in, he came into bed to me; he did not put the candle out, but let it burn out of itself; there he behaved in the same manner, as at Mr. Whitaker's . I told him it hurt me , and he took it out again, and I felt something run from his body; this was on a Saturday night.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he repeat it any more?</p>
               <p>Hearne. No; not that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he any more?</p>
               <p>Hearne. The next night was in Chandler's-street, Grosvenor's-square, that was on a Tuesday about a week after; then he came to Mrs. Brown's, where I was at supper; I was telling Mrs. Brown what he had done to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell her?</p>
               <p>Hearne . Because after this, he had sent me to Mr. Whitaker's for some linen; and there having the child in my hand, and kissing it, Mrs. Whitaker said, that is the way Mr. Bradbury kisses Billey Cook.</p>
               <p>Q. Then nothing happened at the chapel, till you had told of his behaviour?</p>
               <p>Hearne. No; I had told Mrs. Whitaker, what he had done to me before this; I am going to tell what happen'd at the chapel. I told Mrs. Whitaker, he had done so and so to me; after that Mr. Whitaker went with me to Mr. Brown's, where I told Mrs. Brown of it; there, as I said before, Bradbury came in; then I told him to his face what he had done, and said it was truth.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell this to Mrs. Whitaker?</p>
               <p>Hearne. Because they were talking of Mr. Bradbury's being guilty with somebody else; and they ask'd me why he came to take so much notice of me; and why he lay awake till four or five in the morning, when he lay with me?</p>
               <p>Q. What did Mr. Bradbury say for himself, when you charged him with it?</p>
               <p>Hearne . All he said to Mr. Brown was; what must I do to make you believe I am innocent?</p>
               <p>Q. What said Mr. Brown?</p>
               <p>Hearne . Mr. Brown bid him hold his tongue, as he was going to make many oaths; he said, he wish'd he might drop into the pit of hell or never enter heaven's gates, if he was guilty Then when Mr. Bradbury found I stood it out; he told me, I had robb'd him of two candlesticks; and said, if I did not go along with him to look for them, he would have me before a justice, and transport or hang me.</p>
               <p>Q. Make many oaths about, what did he mean?</p>
               <p>Hearne. About what I had charged him with. Then he said he would hang me about the candlesticks, and he said all I had to do, to clear his character, was to recant. I said because he had threatened to hang me, I would. He went home with me the same night to Chandler's-street, Grosvernor's-square chapel , and he there lay with me , and offered to commit the same fact with me again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he only offer it?</p>
               <p>Hearne. He did do it. Then he did enter my body.</p>
               <p>Q. What night was this? give the court an account of the particulars.</p>
               <p>Hearne. This was on a Tuesday night. First he went up to his own house where he lodged, and knock'd, and said every body was in bed, and he was afraid he could not get in, and said he fansied Mrs. Pickering could not be up at that time of night, and said, I will go and lie with you James.</p>
               <p>Q. Where?</p>
               <p>Hearne. This was in the chapel, we got there about 12 o'clock at night. I went to bed, and there he committed the fact upon my body as I mentioned.</p>
               <p>Court. Be particular.</p>
               <p>Hearne. He put his y - d into my body. There was stuff came from his body. I said I could not bear it. Then he took it out, and said James, your father swears vengeance against you for following me, and says if he ever sees you, he'll knock your brains out. I would have you get away. Then I said, I would very willingly go abroad.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100047"/>Q. Did he repeat it any more that night?</p>
               <p>Hearne. No he did not; he desired me to go to France. On Wednesday night he preach'd at the chapel in Chandler's-street. There were Mrs. Pickering, Mr. Kepling the pew-opener, Mr. Cook, Mr. Bradbury and me. Mrs. Pickering said, James, do you know what you have been doing in accusing Mr. Bradbury, but I will beg mercy for you, and if you'll recant, I will try to get you off. And she drew up a recantation, and she read it to me, and I signed it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the purport of it?</p>
               <p>Hearne. '' Let it be known to whom it may '' concern, that I

             and God '' pardon .</p>
               <p>Signed with my name.''</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you sign this if you knew what you said to be truth?</p>
               <p>Hearne. I did this because he threatened to hang me, and he had told me my father had threatened to murder me . Then Mr. Bradbury made pretence that I should not lie in the chapel any more. Then I was to go to France; but before I went, they said they had lost that recantation, and I must make another. They bid me keep down in the cellar, fearing my father or master should see me; telling me, that if they saw me, my master would make me serve my time in Bridewell . There they kept me in the cellar in the day time, and made me lie in the chapel at nights.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you lie in that manner?</p>
               <p>Hearne. I liv'd so about three days; then Mrs. Pickering, Mr. Kipling, Mr. Bradbury, and Mr. Cook came down to me in Kipling's cellar . There was Kipling's wife and daughter. Mrs. Pickering said, Mr. Cook had drawn up a recantation more to the purpose, and I was to sign it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sign it?</p>
               <p>Hearne. I did .</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you sign it?</p>
               <p>Hearne. I was as much afraid of them as before, because they were so strict to me to keep me down in the cellar. When this was signed, Mrs. Kipling was dead drunk, and her husband was drunk. Then I staid till the Sunday, and went with Mrs. Pickering to the Minories to a smith named Colegate, and she gave him a guinea to pay my passage to Dunkirk. Bradbury had told me that Mr. Brown and my father were looking after me, and it was he that proposed my going abroad.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he propose it to you?</p>
               <p>Hearne. He ask'd me if I was willing to go abroad, or be deliver'd up into their hands , saying if I was delivered up to them, I should be sure to be sacrificed.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did Mrs. Pickering go to get the man to pay your passage?</p>
               <p>Hearne . She went, because Mr. Bradbury was to have no hand in it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Hearne. I heard Mr. Bradbury give her directions about it; he asked her if she knew any man to go along with me. She said she knew a gentleman in the Minories that would go along with me, and before we went she made me write a letter, sign'd as if it came from Dover, for the people were in pursuit of me, and if they found I was got there, they would not inquire after me . I said it must go to the penny-post . Then she said, you must write at the bottom. I sent it by a friend, and desired him to put it into the penny-post, and that I was at Dover, and that the ship was to sail the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Bradbury present when she said this?</p>
               <p>Hearne. I don't know that he was. I set out on Sunday morning from the Minories to go down to the ship, and went in the ship for Dunkirk .</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you continue in France?</p>
               <p>Hearne . I staid there not much more than a month; then I came to England, and walking by Lincoln's-inn chapel , on a Sunday, I met with a man that ask'd me what I was about. I told him I was out of business. He took me home to his house; he made weather-glasses , and he employ'd me to carry them about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Bradbury after this?</p>
               <p>Hearne . I was sitting in Tottenham court-road, in the fields near to a timber-yard , and Bradbury came by. He pretended he did not know me . There was a woman that stood there; I said, that gentleman does not know me he pretends. Then when I was gone he came back, and ask'd where that boy was, and told the person that there were three warrants against him to take him up, as he told me. I met Bradbury about a week after that, as I was sitting in Leicester-fields, and two gentleman came by.</p>
               <p>Q. What were their names?</p>
               <p>Hearne. Hopkins and Millwood. They ask'd me whether Bradbury was guilty. I said he was, then we went to Mrs. Pickering's house. There we met Mr. Bradbury.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they and you to go there?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100048"/>Hearne. Because they said they would have me face to face to him. Then Mrs. Pickering ask'd me what I had against Mr. Bradbury . I ask'd her if she could remember I lay in her house the night that the fire was in Covent-garden. She said I was so wicked, I dreamt of my wickedness, and said she watch'd Mr. Bradbury to bed, and came up to me in the room, and saw me asleep. Then they all called me a vile dog, and impudent fellow.</p>
               <p>Q. Who called you so?</p>
               <p>Hearne. Mr. and Mrs. Pickering did. Then they ask'd Mr. Bradbury whether he would go to Mr. Brown's where the fact was spoke of. He said he would not go near them , for they were devils, but chose rather that it should be spoke of at the hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said there of the recantation?</p>
               <p>Hearne. I acknowledg'd at that time the recantation I had sign'd before was my hand writing, though I persisted to charge Bradbury with the crime. Then I went to Newtoner's-lane , where I had liv'd, after that I went to Mr. Fielding's, and made a charge against Bradbury, and got a warrant, and afterwards I attended the grand jury at Hicks's-hall, and gave evidence, and the indictment was found. I lodg'd at Mr. Brown's, six weeks after that; then Mr. Bradbury sent one Brown a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to lodge at Mr. Brown's?</p>
               <p>Hearne. They came and fetch'd me from Newtoner's-lane , and wanted to be satisfied with my account.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you lodge when the indictment was found?</p>
               <p>Hearne. That was found when I lodged at Mr. Brown's.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave Mr. Brown's?</p>
               <p>Hearne. Mr. Bradbury had taken out a warrant against me, and he set a constable, whose name is Brown, to take me up.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after the indictment was found?</p>
               <p>Hearne. That was about a week after. The constable took me before justice Wright. They came under pretence they had got a coat to give me, which they had bought at Hicks's-hall coffee-house . Mr. Bond, that pretended to be my friend, said he would give it me, and when I came down stairs to them, the constable laid hold of me, and carried me away. Mr. Wright ask'd me then whether Mr. Bradbury was guilty? I said yes. Then he said if I did not take care, Mr. Bradbury would transport me if I charged him with this thing; he said, consider upon it, he has good friends, and I a poor boy, not to run myself into any danger . Then he ask'd me whether it was not spite. After a little time I told them it was, and signed my hand to a recantation, that was made before.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to do that?</p>
               <p>Hearne . Because he said, Bradbury was such a great man, that he could transport me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you write the paper?</p>
               <p>Hearne . No; I did not, but I sign'd it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it read over to you?</p>
               <p>Hearne. Mr. Wright read it over to me; it was what Mrs. Pickering had wrote before, and I only sign'd it again. Mr. Bradbury ask'd me after this, if I was willing to go into the country, till the affair came on; then he and I were friends again. Then he sent me down to Dunstable; I staid there a month, then I was remov'd 10 miles off to Law-hall , and there staid a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen Mr. Bradbury, or any of his friends, since you was in that country?</p>
               <p>Hearne. I have seen Mr. Fulloflove , a ribband-weaver , he came to act in Mr. Bradbury's stead, to see how I went on, and take care of me.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your first Conversation about?</p>
               <p>Hearne. He ask'd me, as I was bred a papist, how I came to hear him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the conversation sometimes was about religion, was it not?</p>
               <p>Hearne. He did then, and at other times talk about religion.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he endeavour to convert you about religion?</p>
               <p>Hearne. No; he only ask'd me how I liv'd, and what life I liv'd while I was a papist.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he never talk with you alone about religion?</p>
               <p>Hearne. No never.</p>
               <p>Q. The first account you gave was when Mr. Merideth was buried; you say you was leaning upon the chimney-piece, that he drag'd you on his knee; did he make use of force?</p>
               <p>Hearne. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he put his hand through a hole into your breeches; did you make any resistance?</p>
               <p>Hearne. No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came to put his hand on your private parts; did you make any resistance then?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100049"/>Hearne . No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him?</p>
               <p>Hearne . I said nothing at all to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you say, he desired you to take hold of his y - d, did you do that?</p>
               <p>Hearne . I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do every thing he bid you do?</p>
               <p>Hearne . I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you acquaint any person of this?</p>
               <p>Hearne . No; not then.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you acquainted any person with this transaction ?</p>
               <p>Hearne. It was a month before I did?</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know these things were wrong?</p>
               <p>Hearne. As it came from a minister, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How old are you?</p>
               <p>Hearne. I am just turn'd of 15 years.</p>

               <p>Q. If any body else had offered those things, should you have thought it a sin?</p>
               <p>Hearne. No sir , I should not.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you was bred up in France, part of your time.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you there?</p>
               <p>Hearne . My father sent me there to be educated in the papist religion , in a college.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your father a papist?</p>
               <p>Hearne. He is.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you instructed in the principles of religion?</p>
               <p>Hearne. Not much.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard prayers read, did you not?</p>
               <p>Hearne. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you never at confessions, and at mass?</p>
               <p>Hearne. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Then did you not know that sodomy was a crime?</p>
               <p>Hearne. No sir, I did not know that.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been giving an account of what Mr. Bradbury did to you; how came you to tell Mrs. Whita ker when you did not think it a crime?</p>
               <p>Hearne. I had heard Mr. Bradbury preach against Sodom and Gomorrha; then it was I looked upon it to be a sin. After which, I told her this affair.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Mr. Bradbury say to it?</p>
               <p>Hearne. He denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you, who had been making this charge and complaint against him, to go home with him afterwards?</p>
               <p>Hearne. Because he charg'd me with stealing two candlesticks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he as he went along, deny he had been guilty of this crime ?</p>
               <p>Hearne. Yes; and going along, I did agree to recant.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to do that?</p>
               <p>Hearne. Because he threatened to hang me; saying two oaths would go beyond mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you acquainted any body else with this , before that?</p>
               <p>Hearne. I acquainted Mrs. Whitaker with it first; I acquainted her from the same reasons I did Mrs . Brown.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to permit him to use any freedoms with you afterwards?</p>
               <p>Hearne. He did it when I was in bed ; and I told him I could not bear it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to bed with him, to commit such crimes?</p>
               <p>Hearne. Because I was afraid of him, and I had no other friend but him in the world to stand by me.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this committed on you?</p>
               <p>Hearne. The first was in the Minories.</p>
               <p>Council. I suppose you can give an account of all that passed between him and you, at that time.</p>
               <p>Hearne . Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any conversation pass?</p>
               <p>Hearne . Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the words?</p>
               <p>Hearne. He ask'd me whether I could bear it.</p>
               <p>Q. And did you bear it?</p>
               <p>Hearne. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all?</p>
               <p>Hearne. He ask'd me, whether I had ever done any such thing to any body else?</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him about his having done it?</p>
               <p>Hearne. No; never. He told me not to speak about it to any body else.</p>
               <p>Q. And did not you know it to be a crime ?</p>
               <p>Hearne. No; I did not.</p>

            ?</p>
               <p>M. Whitaker . I do.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he first to your house?</p>
               <p>M. Whitaker . He came first by Mr. Bradbury's desire; I can't tell the day of the month, but it was on a Sunday. About half a year ago, my husband brought him home to dinner, Mr Bradbury did not know what to do with him, his father and master having turn'd him out. Upon his recommendation, I received him into my house; he three weeks exactly, from that time at my house .</p>
               <p>Q. During that time, how often was Mr. Bradbury at your house?</p>
               <p>M. Whitaker . about four or five times.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any particular conversation between them?</p>
               <p>M. Whitaker . No; I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Bradbury lie at your house in that time?</p>
               <p>M. Whitaker . He did four or five times; the reason why he did it was ; that he was nearer his preaching place, than his own home, and he wanted to spend an evening with my husband. I told him I had a bed, but it was a very small one; where Hearne lay , was up two pair of stairs, he said any place, he did not mind any thing. So I mov'd out of my own bed, and we lay in the little bed, and let him and Hearne lie in our own bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he lie there four or five times with Hearne ?</p>
               <p>M. Whitaker . He did in our bed, and my husband and I above in the other at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he ever wanted to lie at your house, before the boy came to your house?</p>
               <p>M. Whitaker . No; he never has. I never spoke to him before his coming there .</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever want to lie there after the boy was gone?</p>
               <p>M. Whitaker. No, he would not, although I ask'd him several times ; then he would say it was a great way to go, I used to say it was no farther than usual.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any clamour about this affair then ?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100051"/>M. Whitaker . No; there had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing more, relating to this affair?</p>
               <p>M. Whitaker . Nothing farther, only when the boy came after he had been at a place where he was sent to, about three weeks or a month after , he went from our house; then the boy told me, Mr. Bradbury had him about a week out of place; but he was to tell me it was but two or three days, and he wanted to come to lie at our house again. I told him he could not, for I had a young woman that lay there then .</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said then, that affected Mr. Bradbury?</p>
               <p>M. Whitaker. No, nothing was that day ; for Bradbury and the boy came together that time , which was on a Monday . But on the Saturday following, the boy came by himself; then there came in a neighbour with a child in her arms. The boy took the child, and fell a kissing it; I ask'd him what he made such a noise with the child for (he said my dear Billey boy). I said, why do you call him so? he said, don't you know? you don't know what has passed in this house between Biliey Cook and Mr. Bradbury. I said, what ? he said, there has been vile actions committed; he said, on Friday night, Bradbury preach'd such a sermon against sodomy, and lifted up his eyes ; and about half an hour before, he had been acting such a vile action as sodomy; but it was against his will , and Mr. Bradbury, had used him very ill in several things; and that it was in my house. Then I said, Jemmy, if these are lies, it is a sad thing of you, you ought to be severely punish'd for it, if they are lies. He answer'd he'd face it before God and man. I told my husband of it that very night; Mr. Bradbury and they met the next day; but I really don't know the day of the month, not what month.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the boy enter into particulars?</p>
               <p>M. Whitaker . No; he did not . I bid him hold his tongue, and say no more to me.</p>

             . I am labourer in ordinary to his majesty, in the Tower; I live in Woollage-court , in the Great-minories . I have known the prisoner about twelve months.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard Hearne's evidence?</p>
               <p>Whitaker . No; I have not. The first time I saw Hearne and the prisoner together, was in January last, at Glover's-hall, where he preach'd, they seem'd to know each other. I had been there three times, before I had any extraordinary knowledge of him. I went on the second of February to Glover's-hall. A little before the preaching there, I enter'd into discourse with Mr. Bradbury; I heard the boy was turn'd from his master for following him; Mr. Bradbury said he wanted a lodging for him, and where to get one he would not tell; I said, I have got a little bed, and if you let him come for two or three nights, till you can try to get him in with his master again, you may, and he may go home and dine with me, then he will know where to come; and if he does not choose to come, it is very well. I was a follower of Mr. Bradbury at that time , and thought well of him. The boy lay at our house three weeks in the whole; and Mr. Bradbury said he did not choose the boy should be there without paying something; and said, Mrs. Murrey will give two shillings per week and he would give one's and accordingly he gave me twice three shillings. On the first Tuesday after the second of February, Bradbury came to my house; this was the first time he had been there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you over ask'd him to come to your house before?</p>
               <p>Whitaker . I can't say whether I had or not.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from your house to his lodgings?</p>
               <p>Whitaker . I believe it is three miles . When Bradbury came in he said, I am come to lie with James. We spent the Evening together. I said I was afraid the bed would not be sufficient for them; and there were no curtains to it; and it was for one single person. He said, if it will suit you, it will me; I said, you shall be very welcome. I got two little boxes, and made the bed out wider, and my wife and I lay there, and he and the boy in our bed. We went to bed I believe between eleven and twelve, and rose about nine. I heard no conversation after we were in bed; and in the whole he came four or five times, and lay with the boy there while he was at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever invite him to come and lie at your house since the boy went away?</p>
               <p>Whitaker . I have; but he would say, he was low spirited, and not quite well.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you invited him to lie at your house?</p>
               <p>Whitaker. I believe my wife and I have a dozen times. Sometimes he would say, the ladies where he lodg'd had differ'd; and sometimes he was going to have new cloaths; he had always some excuse not to come. Our house is nearer to the hall than where he lodges, by a mile. After this, I think it was on the 17th of April, my wife told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100052"/> me James had been at our house. This was after he had left his place, and about four or five weeks after he was gone from my house . She said, he told her the prisoner had been guilty of such practices as I was very sorry to hear ; and I believe it was the same day I saw the boy, and I ask'd him whether it was truth or not? that is, I ask'd him, whether Bradbury had been guilty of sodomy with him? the boy told me, yes, he had at my house; then I thought proper to take the boy to Mr. Brown's house, because Mr. Brown's daughter was present with my wife when he told her . When we came to Mr. Brown's , we enter'd into conversation; the boy told us, the first night that Bradbury offered any thing to him was at Glover's-hall, the night that Mr. Merideth, belonging to the Tabernacle, was buried . He said after Bradbury had done preaching, there was no body left behind but Bradbury, Mrs. Hall , and he; and that Bradbury said to her she might go; as there was a spring lock she might take the key with her, and pull the door too after her, She went away; and when the door was shut, the boy was leaning against the chimney-piece; Bradbury said, James, you don't look well, and took him on his lap, and kiss'd him; and his breeches were torn, and Bradbury put his hand in there , and pull'd out his private parts; and he went and snuffed the candle, and desir'd him to do wicked things with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What wicked things?</p>
               <p>Whitaker. He said Bradbury lost his s - d. The boy also said, Bradbury did some indecencies at my house; and that

             and Bradbury did so at the chapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you he had been guilty of sodomy with him?</p>
               <p>Whitaker . No; he did not tell me then that he had actually committed the crime of sodomy; he only said, at my house he did bad practices every night he lay with him. He said the night the fire was in Covent-garden, Mr. Bradbury desir'd him to come down from his bed, after the family was all quiet; which he did; and in the morning he desir'd him to go up, that it might not be known by the family he had said with him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he tell you was the last time he lay with him?</p>
               <p>Whitaker. He said the last time was in the chapel, about a week before the time he told it me. He also said, the first time of telling me, Bradbury used bad practices all these times, before Mr. Brown and his wife. Then we consider'd it, and thought we would have Bradbury before the boy's face on the next Thursday, but Bradbury did not come; then we intended to leave him as a preacher. But he did not tell me the particulars till his return from France; then he told me he had committed sodomy with him all these times ; and stood to all he had told me before, and repeated them, with all the same circumstances, and rather more fuller.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the boy describe in what manner he had used him?</p>
               <p>Whitaker . He did describe the offences so as I understood he had actually penetrated him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the boy appear at that time, to you, to be clear, consistent, and uniform?</p>
               <p>Whitaker . He did, to my understanding, very exact.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand he knew the nature of the crime?</p>
               <p>Whitaker. He made me understand what he meant?</p>
               <p>Q. How long was the boy in company with you, when h e first told you of the bad practices committed by the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Whitaker. The first time, I believe, was not above an hour; then he only mentioned bad practice and indecent behaviour.</p>

             . I live in St. John's-street. The prisoner is a preacher; I went to hear him; Mr. Whitaker came to my house, I believe, on the 14th of April, and brought with him James Hearne. Mrs. Whitaker had before acquainted my wife with what the boy had told her. I ask'd Hearne if he knew what it was he accused Mr. Bradbury with, and if he knew the consequence of accusing a minister of the gospel wrongfully? and told him if so, his blood would be at his hand. Then Hearne said, what he had said was true . I ask'd him what Mr. Bradbury did to him? he said, the night Mr. Merideth was buried, he was with him in Glover's-hall after all were gone out but Mr. Bradbury and Mrs. Hall; Mr. Bradbury desir'd her to go, and said there was a spring-lock, and he would take care of the door; she went out, and Bradbury and he went into the inward hall, and while he stood leaning his head against the chimney-piece , Mr. Bradbury sat in a chair; he took him by the coat, and pull'd him on his knee, and kiss'd him, and put his hand in a hole in his breeches, and pull'd out his private parts; and after that Bradbury put out the candle, or snuffed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100053"/> the candle , I know not which, and unbuttoned his own breeches, and did indecent things at Mr. Whitaker's house, but did not explain himself quite fully. After that he said, the night the fire was in Covent-garden , he lay at Mrs. Shore's; that Mr. Bradbury fetch'd the candle down from his chamber, and told the boy as soon as the family were all still, to come down to him; which accordingly he did; and when he went into the room, Mr. Bradbury was reading in a large book, and he bid him get into bed; that he shut up the book, and put the candle in the chimney, and then got into bed to him, and committed bad things; but did not say what. He said also at the chapel;

             and the prisoner often talk'd about very bad things; and they used to be there several times after the people were gone; and they used to talk bawdy , and a great deal of impudence. The boy came to my house on the Tuesday, and the prisoner came in, and ask'd if James was at my house last night till ten o'clock? I said he was, and Mr. Whitaker with him; he flew in a passion, and said, I said before, I'd have nothing more to do with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Bradbury know then what the boy had charg'd him with?</p>
               <p>Brown. I believe he did not. Bradbury ask'd me, if I had any thing to say against him? he thought I was speaking against him ; I said, the person that accused him sat at his elbow; he began to rail against the boy, and call'd him a lying villain, and a great many names. Upon which I said to Hearne , what was that you charged Mr. Bradbury with? he said, sir, don't you remember the time Mr. Merideth was buried, in the hall , when every body was gone but you and I and Mrs. Hall, you sat in a chair in the inward hall, and I stood leaning against the chimney, you took me by the coat, and pull'd me on your knee, and kiss'd me, and I had a hole in my breeches, thro' which you put your hand to my private parts, and after that you snuffed the candle (I think were the words. ) Bradbury fell in a great passion, and said, you sodomite dog, you he-bitch, I'll hang you; he frequently repeated those words. The boy said, what he had said was true; and began, and related the same I have told here.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he then describe the actual fact?</p>
               <p>Brown . He did not; the boy's modesty withheld him. Bradbury said, explain yourself; the boy said, it was not modest there. My wife was by. Mr. Bradbury denied it with great passion and rage ; the boy said, it was truth before God. I believe they were there together an hour and half, or near two hours, after the boy's accusing him. Bradbury said, he would hang the boy, for he had rob'd him; this was after he had accused Bradbury with these practices at several places. The boy ask'd, what he had rob'd him of? Bradbury said, he would not expose him; the boy said, you cannot do worse to me than you have done. Bradbury did not for some minutes explain what he had rob'd him of, till the boy ask'd him again, what he had rob'd him of? then he said, you have rob'd me of two candlesticks in the chapel; the boy said, he saw them in the chapel on the Sunday, but had not seen them since. The boy also had told him to his face, that

             and he, at the chapel, used to be talking great indecencies; and he mentioned several things, as a chair, a table , and hole in the earth. Bradbury said, these things were lies, and kept repeating the words, a sodomite dog, and he-bitch; he told the boy, he was a common sodomite; he said, he would take the boy up; the boy said, he would go any where with him, to any justice of the peace; and said he was innocent of taking the candlesticks. Bradbury seemed to be vastly concerned, to think he should lose me as one of his people; and said, what shall I do to convince you that it is false? he ask'd for a bible, and said, he would swear to his innocence; I said, no, not in my house; then he said, he would take the sacrament of it; and ask'd me, if I would believe him? I said, no; then he said, if it is true, I wish I may go down into the lowest pit of hell ; and that God would shut heaven's gates against him; and that he might not see the face of God. They went from my house that night; and I told the boy to go with him, to look for the candlesticks. I expected, after that, he would have brought the boy on the Thursday, as I told him I had appointed Mr. Whitaker to come then ; but instead of coming, Bradbury sent me an upbraiding post-letter; then I let it alone, and said nothing of it for some time. Afterwards he sent me another letter, which I took to be very ill usage. I sent for him to come, but he never came near my house. After which I went with Mr. Whitaker to Mr. Stevenson, at the hall, Beech-lane, to know the reason of his using me so. I took the boy's father, to inquire after the son; the father ask'd Bradbury, what he had done with his son? he said, he wish'd the son and he had been both hang'd; and that he had never known them. I staid some time after he came out of his pulpit, and he abused me. The next time I saw the boy, was after he came from France. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100054"/> found him in Newtoner's lane , and took him to my house; he there work'd by his father's consent; he was there about six weeks, and when I was out he was taken away by force, as I was told; and I never saw him since till this day.</p>
               <p>Q. to Whitaker. Do you know where the boy has been since the time Mr. Brown speaks of?</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you inquire?</p>
               <p>Hearne . I was at Mrs. Pickering's house, in Litchfield-street , to inquire, as I had not heard of him, or seen him some time; and Mrs. Pickering told me, she heard he was gone to Russia.</p>
               <p>Hearne . Was any body in company with you, when you went?</p>
               <p>Hearne . No; but the second time Mr. Carmichel went with me, then she own'd she had paid a guinea for his passage, and he was gone to France .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say then , you had rather given a hundred pounds , not to have been exposed ?</p>

               <p>Court. If you have any thing to say , now is your time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I took notice of that boy out of an act of charity; he came to hear me at Glover's-hall, and seem'd to appear very devout; and I ask'd his fellow apprentice, who he was; he said, he was his fellow apprentice. I took notice of him, because he said his father threaten'd to hang him because he was turn'd protestant; and his master had turn'd him out, and he must perish if I did not make provision for him. So I spoke to Mr. Whitaker. It will take up two or three hours to repeat all the acts of kindness I did for him, and the ill usage I have had in return from him. He threaten'd he would be reveng'd on me in the kitchen, for my telling the ladies where I live, of an abominable act he had committed with a man; and accordingly went to Whitaker's with what he had rais'd. There are a number of witnesses to prove, that Whitaker first bid him threaten me, and tell me if I would not maintain him they would hang me; this he said times without number. Here are many witnesses to prove, he never charg'd me with the act of sodomy, but indecent actions. I ask'd him in the presence of Mr. and Mrs. Brown, whether he could ever say, I committed the act of sodomy upon his body. No, said he; when I put it close to him. I ask'd him, if I had ever attempted to commit sodomy with him; he said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100055"/> no. I ask'd him, what I had done; he muttered some indecent things; I declar'd as in the presence of God, I was innocent of the charge. The boy, as soon as we got out of the house, fell a crying and wringing his hands, and begg'd for God's sake, that I would forgive him; and said what method may I take to clear your character, pray tell me what I can do? I said I know no method you can take to do it, but if you come to-morrow to the chapel , I'll consult with some of my friends; and accordingly he came, and in the presence of some witnesses, fell on his knees, and begg'd for God's sake, I would forgive him, lifting up his hands and eyes ; and said, he was instigated by the Brown's and Whitakers to do it; and that I was innocent of the charge .</p>

             about four years; he is a preacher. On the 16th of April last, at the chapel in Chandler's-street, after preaching there were Mr. Kepling, Mr. Cook and my self present, when Hearne made a recantation. Mr. Bradbury ask'd the boy, how he could be so villainous, as to accuse him with some indecencies; the boy fell on his knees, and crept along, and said, he was instigated to do what he had done , by Mr. Brown of St. John's street, and Mr. Whitaker in the Minories. That they bid him first threaten Mr. Bradbury, and if he would not take care and provide for him, that he must swear the fact against him; for that his oath would be taken before Mr. Bradbury's, and that they would hang Mr. Bradbury, and provide for him themselves; to the best of my knowledge, these were the words.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any threats or menaces at this time, to induce this boy to make any acknowledgment or recantation ?</p>
               <p>E. Pickering . No; not to my knowledge. He said, he did not do it upon compulsion ; but it was a voluntary act of his own. I look'd upon it as such, and do still.</p>
               <p>Court. Look upon this paper. (She takes a paper in her hand.).</p>
               <p>E. Pickering. This is his second recantation, his first was lost, these are not the identical words of the first; in that which is lost, he clear'd Mr. Bradbury of what he had charg'd him with; and said, it was false and falacious ; that Mr. Bradbury was innocent, and he had grosly charg'd him. I was a witness to this second; it was made at the house of Mr. Kipling by the boy's desire. I was sent for to hear what he had to say, from a clergyman's house, where I was visiting; there were Mr. Kipling, his wife, Mr. Lawrence , and a servant of ours, the boy was sitting . There he declar'd, Mr. Bradbury was really innocent of what he had charg'd him with; and that he was set on by Brown and Whitaker to do what he had done; he was then not under any compulsion, force, or threats . We ask'd him if it was his voluntary act; he said, yes. It is dated the 18th of April. I don't know whose hand writing the body of it is; I am a witness to the signing it. It was read to him, and he had it in his hand before he sign'd it; and he said it was all right, and all true; I have been in company with the boy and Mr. Bradbury divers times; and I never heard him charge him with any ill whatsoever.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a third recantation ?</p>
               <p>E. Pickering. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any proposals made to Mr. Bradbury ?</p>
               <p>E. Pickering. I do; it was on the 14th of June last; the boy's father and one Mr. Carmichel came , and they told me it would be best to give a sum of money , to send him out of the land , for that Mr. Brown had him lock'd up. Mr. Bradbury had lodg'd at my mother's almost three years.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hearne, sen . Was there any proposal made concerning your son to you, at the time you was at Mrs. Pickering's?</p>
               <p>Hearne. There was none while I was present; I left Mr. Carmichel in the house.</p>
               <p>E. Pickering . Mr. Carmichel said, he thought it would be more prudent to give the boy some money to cloath him, and send him abroad; that he might not appear against Mr. Bradbury. I told him I would do no such thing, for that would make Mr. Bradbury look guilty in the eyes of those that knew his innocency. And the old man said, if that could be comply'd with, he would take his child out of bad hands; but said, he did not demand it. I said no, you do not; then Mr. Carmichel said to him, he would step out, which he did; then Mr. Carmichel said to me, it was better to give a hundred pounds, than to have Mr. Bradbury expos'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you one of the persons that follow Mr. Bradbury?</p>
               <p>E. Pickering. No; I do not belong to him. On the 12th of June, the boy came with two gentlemen, Mr. Hopkins, and Mr. Milward; and declar'd the same words as he did before, as near as possible; and said, he was set on by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100056"/> Brown and Whitaker , to swear this against Mr. Bradbury. I heard Mr. Bradbury say to the boy, James, did I ever commit sodomy with you? the boy said, whoever said so? Mr. Bradbury then said, did I ever attempt it? the boy said no, I never thought so; then the boy hung down his head, and said , he wish'd he had never been born, and was sorry he had charg'd a person that had been his best friend.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the boy confin'd in your house?</p>
               <p>E. Pickering. No; he never was confin'd under our roof; nor at all to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the recantations sign'd?</p>
               <p>E. Pickering. The first was at the chapel, another in Mr. Kipling's kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been intimately acquainted with Mr. Bradbury?</p>
               <p>E. Pickering. I have been pretty intimate, and I never heard him speak an ill word, or saw an indecent action by him in my life. He is as modest, sober behav'd a man as can be; I don't believe him to be capable of the crime charg'd upon him.</p>
               <p>Cross examination .</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what it was, that induced the boy to make the first recantation on the 16th of February?</p>
               <p>E. Pickering. He declar'd it was a voluntary act of his own.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what led him to that?</p>
               <p>E. Pickering. No.</p>
               <p>Council. Then I'll ask you by steps. Do you know any thing of his being charg'd with stealing candlesticks?</p>
               <p>E. Pickering. I have heard it since this affair happen'd; but never before Mr. Bradbury was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear of it before the 16th of April.</p>
               <p>E. Pickering. To the best of my knowledge I never-did.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the boy there?</p>
               <p>E. Pickering. He was there when I came, there was Mr. Cook and Mr. Kepling with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who drew up the first recantation ?</p>
               <p>E. Pickering. By the desire of the boy, I made it every sentence from his mouth, and wrote it down; and said, James, is that what you would have said?</p>
               <p>Q. Did the boy appear to be terrified ?</p>
               <p>E. Pickering. No; he did not. Only appear'd to be sorry for what he had done.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to ask him whether it was what he would have said ?</p>
               <p>E. Pickering. Because I thought it was very proper , though I believed it was voluntary.</p>
               <p>Council. Then it was not to satisfy yourself.</p>
               <p>E. Pickering. It was partly to satisfy myself, and partly them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you call that a kitchen, under ground?</p>
               <p>E. Pickering. It is a place under ground, but where people eat and drink, and we call it the kitchen .</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a jack in it?</p>
               <p>E. Pickering. I did not examine the furniture.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it appear as much like a cellar , as a kitchen?</p>
               <p>E. Pickering. I think most like a kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your opinion of the boy?</p>
               <p>E. Pickering. I believe he is a very bad boy.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe it is any difficult thing to make a bad boy recant ?</p>
               <p>E. Pickering. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to go abroad?</p>
               <p>E. Pickering. He had been lamenting to some of Mr. Bradbury's friends, and said he wanted to go away; for his father had deserted him, and he had no way to get his living, and Mr. Bradbury said, he would do nothing for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose guinea was it that paid for his passage ?</p>
               <p>E. Pickering. I beg'd it for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Of whom ?</p>
               <p>E. Pickering . Of my mother.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear the boy charge Bradbury with the commission of the fact?</p>
               <p>E. Pickering. He always denied charging him with that, till his return from France.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be so charitable after you found him to be such a bad boy , to beg a guinea for such a wretch?</p>
               <p>E. Pickering. It was a very great fault in me to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, whether your sending him abroad, was not in order in prevent Mr. Bradbury from being prosecuted for this fact?</p>
               <p>E. Pickering . Upon my oath, I had no motive to serve Mr. Bradbury at all. The boy told me he had a friend in Paris, that had brought him up from nine or eleven years of age; and that his father had deserted him upon the account of turning protestant, and that he had been guilty of bad things; so I sent him to France.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kipling. Hearne had said scandalous accusations against Mr. Bradbury; but what it was I did not know. There was a paper wrote ,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100057"/> and the boy read it; and said, he was very sorry for what he had said against Mr. Bradbury, and he went on his knees , and ask'd him and God pardon. Mr. Bradbury said, God forgive you , for I do; for you are a wicked boy.</p>

               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Kipling. This was on the Wednesday, the day before the paper was lost; about the middle of April last.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he threatened?</p>
               <p>Kipling. No; not in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he put in fear?</p>
               <p>Kipling. I did not see he was in any fear at all .</p>
               <p>Q. What induced the boy to sign it?</p>
               <p>Kipling. I believe he might he afraid Mr. Bradbury might hurt him, for scandalizing him; the boy express'd great sorrow, and cry'd very much. On the 18th of April, I saw him again in my kitchen.</p>
               <p>Council. Look at the paper (he takes it in his hand.)</p>
               <p>Kipling. My name here is my own hand writing , I saw the boy sign this paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any compulsion or force on him, did you observe?</p>
               <p>Kipling. There was none at all, I am certain of it; he appear'd very brisk, it was sign'd by him, after it had been read over, and after he had read it himself .</p>

               <p>Q. Whose hands was the first recantation left in ?</p>
               <p>Kipling. It was left in Mrs. Pickering's hands, that was thought to be lost; the first and second were a near alike for words as could be.</p>
               <p>Q. Who drew up the second ?</p>

               <p>Kipling. There were a pair of candlesticks missing ; but they were found again afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they missing before, or after this charge against Bradbury?</p>
               <p>Kipling. I can't say which ; but to the best of my remembrance, it was after.</p>

            . I belong to the General-post-office. I was by when Hearne signed his recantation on the 16th of April, in a room in Chandler's-street chapel , it was first read over to him, and he sign'd it voluntarily and freely.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he understand it, do you think?</p>
               <p>Cook. He did extremely well.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of a second recantation?</p>
               <p>Cook. I do; he did that, because he heard the first was lost. I was not there before he sign'd that; but after I came, it was mention'd before him, that he had fell on his knees, and he did not contradict it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of a third recantation?</p>
               <p>Cook. I do, I was present before justice Wright when he sign'd it; the justice ask'd him if Mr. Bradbury was guilty, he said he was. Mr. Bradbury was not there then, but he soon came in, and the second recantation was shewn Hearne ; then he hung down his head, and said it was his. Then he was ask'd again, if Mr. Bradbury was guilty, and he said he was not; then he told the justice what he would have wrote down, and the justice wrote it, and he sign'd it voluntarily and freely; and said he was to be the king's evidence, and he would not hurt a hair of his head; and I have heard him once since declare , Mr. Bradbury was not guilty, and that Whitaker and Brown set him on.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100058"/>Q. Where did he acknowledge this?</p>
               <p>Cook. At the Old-bailey coffee-house; and he said, he would never go near them any more, for making him swear falsely against Mr. Bradbury .</p>
               <p>Q. to Hearne. Is this truth?</p>
               <p>Hearne. I don't remember I did say so.</p>
               <p>Court. Recollect yourself whether you did or did not.</p>
               <p>Hearne. Yes; I did say so.</p>
               <p>Q. When?</p>
               <p>Hearne. Yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cook. How long have you known Mr. Bradbury ?</p>
               <p>Cook. I have known him about five years; he has as good a character as any man in London; as fine a preacher as any in town; and as good a practitioner .</p>
               <p>Council for the prisoner.</p>
               <p>You mean he is a virtuous honest man.</p>
               <p>Cook. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Repeat the words the boy said at the Old-bailey coffee-house.</p>
               <p>Cook. The substance was this; that Brown and Whitaker set him on to swear against Mr. Bradbury; and he cry'd, and said, he had used him ill in doing it, and he would go to them no more.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the boy yesterday all the day?</p>

               <p>Q. Was he in custody there yesterday?</p>
               <p>Cook. No; not to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you hear him say this yesterday ?</p>
               <p>Cook. In the afternoon, about two o'clock; I was not in company with him; but I was in the room, backwards and forwards .</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he go at night?</p>
               <p>Cook. I don't know; but he desired to go where he did go.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Cook. Because I was there when the coach drew up to the door, and his father call'd after him, as he got in, and said, my dear son Jemmy, my dear son.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people went into the coach with him?</p>
               <p>Cook. I do not know.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you been drinking?</p>
               <p>Cook. I believe I drank a gill of wine in the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no liquor going forward in the room?</p>
               <p>Cook. There was.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether or no any people belonging to your company had him any time? or how did he come to this house?</p>
               <p>Cook. I was not there when he came; I came about eleven o'clock, and he was there then, with, I believe, an hundred people.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the lad to be ask'd a second time, before justice Wright, when he had said Bradbury was guilty?</p>
               <p>Cook. Because he own'd the recantation was true. He hung down his head, when he said Bradbury was guilty; but look'd brisk about him when he said he was innocent.</p>

               <p>M. Burket. He said it was done from his own inclination, and was what he desired; and I do believe he did it by his own desire.</p>

               <p>M. Burket to the question. The boy came home with many falacies, before any thing of this happened. He was in Mrs. Shore's kitchen; Mr. Bradbury ask'd him, how he could answer so as he did, (he had made him some impertinent answers;) he said, if he did so he would certainly turn him out of doors . When Mr. Bradbury was gone up-stairs, I said, how can you answer him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100059"/> so? he will certainly turn you out of doors: Hearne said, let him if he will; if he does, I know how to match him.</p>

             . I was in the Coffee-house when the boy made this confession; but he made a confession to me in the Poultry-compter. I was desired to go, and bear him company there. I asked him first, if he knew me ? he said, yes, he did, very well ; saying, I saw you received a member into Mr. Bradbury's church . Said I, what has induced you to come now at this time? said he, it is to clear Mr. Bradbury; I said; now James; I am disinterested in the affair; is he guilty, or is he not? the bible was by; he put his hand on the bible, and opened it, and said, he is as innocent as a child unborn.

             . On the 19th of July, the prisoner came to Enfield with some fowls in a sack , and offered the fowls to sale; some were dead, some pick'd, some not pick'd, and some alive. We imagined they were not honestly come by. I being a constable, they informed me of it; before I came, he was got out of the town; I took two or three men with me, and followed him; we found him, with the sack , in the fields, he had got a great bull-bitch with him; the prisoner was under a hedge, near a moat ; when he saw us he ran into the moat , and fell down over head and ears; I had a good deal of trouble to get him out; I carried him, and the fowls, to the justice's and Mr. Turner came, and own'd the fowls. The justice ask'd the prisoner, how he came by the fowls ? he said, he found them in a ditch; then he said, he found them in a barn, in the sack; then he said, his dog found them; then he said, he bought them for eight shillings; another time he said , he came by them by the way of cheapside; and he was in several stories. When we took him, he said, if there was not so many of us his dog and he would have cleared their way .</p>

               <p>I sell brick-dust in the winter-time ; I found this bag with thirteen dead fowls, and three live ones in it; I carry'd them to the brick-fields; I went and bought a pound of steaks from off a neck of mutton, which cost me two-pence. I shew'd the people what I had found; when I went to eat my steaks , they said, O, you rogue, there has been some hen-roost rob'd. I said, if there has I can't help that; and one of them, because I gave him none of my mutton steaks, took me up upon suspicion; I had no body with me but my bitch and my wife.</p>

My wife opened the drawer to him; he look'd among them, and said, he must have one made on purpose; he chose one small one out for a pattern, and said, it must come to seventeen or eighteen shillings; and that it must be done against tomorrow. I got it done. The first time he came in a gold-laced suit; the second, he came in a silver one; very grandly dress'd both times; he ask'd for the ring; I shew'd it him; he looked at it, and liked it very well: he desired my servant might mark it; he then desired to see the drawer again, and said he must bespeak five more, to make up half a dozen for his sister's children; he look'd over the drawer, and shew'd his hands, to shew he took none away. There were none to his mind; but I was to make five according to his direction, against the next day; he went away, but never paid for the first he had bespoke, nor ever came again. In the evening of the next day , he not coming I suspected him. I ask'd for my case the rings were in, and counted the rings, and miss'd two gold rings. I did not see the prisoner till the 15th of August last. My boy going to White-chapel, to my engraver's, saw the prisoner; he inform'd me he saw the Frenchman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100061"/> who bespoke the rings of me. I went and found him, as the boy had said; I challenged him with taking the rings; he said he was but lately come from France ; he took me by the collar, and I took him by his, and said he should go, and give an account of himself, and what was become of the rings; he at first utterly denied being in my shop; at last he beg'd for mercy, and said , he did not steal two; he stole but one. I carried him before my lord-mayor; he confess'd there he stole one, before his lordship.</p>

             was read in court. Then Thomas Palmer, a sheriffs officer, deposed, he tendred the oath in court to the two prisoners, before they gave their evidence on that trial. Then Thomas Gurney, the short-hand writer , deposed; he saw them both sworn on the trial, and they gave in evidence the same as printed in the trial, to which the reader is referred . See No. 281, in last July sessions-paper. Then Alexander Plunket deposed the same as before, on the said trial, with this addition; that the goods Horan told him he had got to carry over to France, were 16 dozen of hard ware, 7 dozen of hats, and 6 dozen of great coats. Then Lockline Bourne was called and deposed the same as on the said trial.</p>
               <p>Philips's defence.</p>
               <p>Plunket certainly was in my room every day for a time; if he missed a day, I used to say to Mrs. Macdaniel, what is become of my thick legg'd cousin; God and my conscience thinks I did not tell one word of a lie .</p>

               <p>He absolutely was in company with one Mackey and me, I have no interest in swearing for Horan.</p>
               <p>Gyles Farrel. I have known the gentlewoman in the brown gown longest (that was Philips) she was captain Talbot's wife; I live at the end of Tottenham-court road, in Maynard's-street .</p>
               <p>Q. What is your business?</p>
               <p>Farrel. I keep a couple of lodging houses.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known her in the brown cloaths?</p>
               <p>Farrel. I have known the gentlewoman ever since the hard frost; I have known the other about a year and three quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the character of Philips?</p>
               <p>Farrel. I never knew, or heard any thing worse, than being a very honest just woman in all her dealings; she liv'd on her means till her husband died. Then she married another man, and that man died; then she liv'd by her needle, and several ways that she had for bread. I never knew any thing of Macdaniel, any farther than being a well brought up, and well behav'd honest woman; that is what I have to say, they behav'd very just to me.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does Macdaniel live?</p>
               <p>Farrel. She is here.</p>
               <p>Q. But where did she live, before she was here ?</p>
               <p>Farrel . I believe this time 12 month, she liv'd by Saltpeter-bank ?</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she live in June or July last?</p>
               <p>Farrel . I can't tell .</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the other live?</p>
               <p>Farrel. The other gentlewoman lodged by the Hercules's-club, by Wellclose-square, she lodg'd with me eight or nine years ago; I lent her money upon her credit, and trusted her for victuals and drink , and she paid me.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of people do you let your lodgings to?</p>
               <p>Farrel. Some to tradesmen, some to apothecaries, some to surgeons ; any body that pays me honesty . My husband is dead, I am an Irishwoman .</p>
