                  </hi> I am clerk to Mr. Breedon, a solicitor, of London Wall—the prisoner was occasionally employed by him to serve writs—on 15th April I filled up the writ of summons, now produced—it is in the Court of Common Pleas—I gave it to the prisoner, and also a <hi rend="italic">prœcipe</hi> of it, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay for the stamp—the <hi rend="italic">prœcipe</hi> is filed in the Court of Common Pleas, and has to have the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. stamp on it before it is filed, and the original has to be stamped and filed and returned to me again, that would then become the original writ in the action, and the defendant would be served with a copy of the original writ—at the time I gave the prisoner that writ it had no stamp on it—he came to my office on 23rd May, and handed me this writ (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), saying that he had served the defendant the day before, as he was coming home from the Derby—I thought it was the original, with the proper stamp, and gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the service—he called again on 25th May, on some other matter, and I told him not to come to the office again, as I understood he had forged the seal of the Court of Common Pleas to that writ of sum<lb/>mons—he said, "I have not, the clerk at the Common Pleas Office must have put the wrong seal on it"—he then left, saying he would come in a few minutes to see Mr. Breedon, but did not return, and I did not see him again till he was in custody.</p>

I had the two rings in my purse; his manager bought one of them for 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and his son the other; he asked his father to lend him a pound, as he had got money in the Post Office Savings Bank, and he would pay him back again, and his father lent him a pound, and he bought the ring. He said, "It is very dangerous for a young man like you to go about London with so much money; you had better leave some with me."I left 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with him, said I should call for it, and next day he went with' me to Lambeth Palace. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did go with him to Lambeth Palace; he came on the Thursday to try his coat on, he said he was going to Lambeth Palace, and asked if I would go with him, and he would introduce me to some of his friends. I was there from eight till ten, but I had no introduction whatever; I saw him standing talking to a gentleman, and he afterwards told me it was Lord Aylesbury. I never had any of his money; I would forfeit all I am possessed of if any one can come forward and say there is anything at all in his statement. I never saw the rings.</p>

                  </hi> I am a silversmith in the Walworth Road—on Sunday morning, 9th June, about twelve o'clock, the prisoner came to my house—he told me he had some plate that he wanted to dispose of, and asked if I could buy it—I said I thought I could if it was all right—he said, "Very well"—I asked how much he had got—he said he thought there was fifty or sixty ounces of it—I said I thought I could buy that quantity if he brought it to me—he asked if he should bring it that after<lb/>noon—I said, "No; I do not do business on Sunday, but you can see me on Monday at any time"—he came on Monday about nine or half-past, and brought a large gravy spoon, four table-spoons, four dessert-spoons, and half a dozen silver teaspoons—he said he had a cruet stand and several other things, and if I would give him the money for those he would fetch the others—he gave as a reason for selling the things that he wanted the money—I had given information to the police before he came on the Monday—I weighed some of the things, tied them up, and handed them to him—he called me a fool—he said I was injuring myself by not buying them, and losing 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I thought it was better to lose 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. than run the risk of losing my character—he said it was all nonsense, I need not be frightened—I said it was not nonsense, I did not like the appearance of the things—he said he could disfigure them if he wished, and at the same time he bent the large spoon double to break it—I said, "Do not do that, you will spoil it"—he said, "Oh, it ones not matter, shove them into the melt pot"—he said, "You need not fear; no one knows anything at all about them, for they came from the other side of the water"—he said that no one knew him, nor where he lived, for he did not allow any one to know where he lived, he generally did his business at public-houses and such places—this is the handkerchief he brought the things in—he wrapped the large spoon up in this hand<lb/>kerchief, and put it in his coat pocket—while I was talking to him Robinson the policeman came in—my assistant had gone for him—the prisoner attempted to get out of the shop—the constable asked him to stay a few minutes—he became very much excited, and wanted to know what for—he asked me if he could get out the back way—I told him I had no back door—he drew from his pocket some of the spoons as he waited with his back to the counter, and wanted to give them to my wife, who stood behind the counter—she of course would not receive them, and the policeman turned round and said, "How many have you of these? "—I found this gravy spoon wrapped up in the handkerchief behind a clock in my place when the policeman took him away—he threw half a dozen teaspoons into the street from his pocket while the policeman was there.</p>

In consequence of information, I went, about nine o'clock on the morning of 10th June, to Mr. Hill's shop—I looked through the window before going in—the prisoner was standing close to the door as I went in—he tried to pass out into the street—I prevented him, and said, "What are you offering for sale? "—he said, "Let me pass, will you? "—I said, "I want to know what you are offering for sale"—he said he should not tell me—I asked Mr. Hill what it was; he did not tell me for some time, and the prisoner rushed past me into the street—I forced him back into the shop with a deal of trouble and sent for assistance—I saw him place some spoons on the counter and heard them jingle—I then asked him what he had in his possession—he said, "Nothing, you can search me"—I proceeded to do so, I found he had some spoons in his pocket behind—he immediately forced his hand into his pocket and pulled out half a dozen tea-spoons, and threw them over my head into the road—another constable arrived and we took him to the station with the spoons—this gravy spoon and handkerchief were brought to the station by Mr. Hills—the prisoner was very violent before we took him away.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner here stated that it was about a week before he left.</hi>) The prisoner left on Saturday, 15th June, and therefore I suppose it would be the 8th; at that time another clerk was in his place, and the major portion of the entries are in the writing of the new clerk, only a few are in the prisoner's writing—his instructions were to enter every sum he received in the out cash-book, and my memory does not serve me that there has ever been arny exception besides this—he did not give me notice—he did tell me that he was about to apply for a vacant berth at Liverpool, but I did not write a testimonial for him—it was not in consequence of that that he gave me notice—the new clerk came a week before the prisoner left—the prisoner did not at my request remain a week after his time expired, in order that he might explain to the new clerk his duties; he said that he had some leisure time, and he should be happy to give any assistance to Mr. Wilkinson—I said, "I shall be happy to remunerate you; "but he said, "I do not require it"—I think he came every day—there is not a small sum due to him, not that I am aware of; he left on the 15th—I gave him a cheque in settlement on the 17th—it was after he received the cheque that he came to assist the new clerk—he was several days doing that—there is not 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to him for money paid that I am aware of—I have balanced no accounts with him—he never paid money, he would receive money—if he did pay anything he would ask the petty cash clerk for the money—if the petty cash clerk was out, and he wished to serve his master, he would pay the money him<lb/>self—I had two written references with him.</p>

               <p>out who were the makers of these notes, so that he might give me informa<lb/>tion, and he might be arrested—he told me that he would have to return the notes to Powell that night, or else take back to him 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave him back the notes, after taking the numbers and dates—this is the paper upon which I wrote them—I told him I wished he would give me some proof that what he had been telling me was true, and he volunteered to take the notes to Whitechapel, and give them back to the man of whom he had received them, in my presence—I told him to be careful what he did with them, and that if he did not return them to the man or bring them back to me, if he was ever found dealing with them, or if he fell into the hands of the police with these notes, it would be the same as if he was uttering them—I went, according to his appointment, to the place he indicated, a public house in Whitechapel, close to his house—I waited there an hour and a half, but saw nothing of the prisoner—I never saw him again to speak to him until June this year—on 1st June, in consequence of a communication, I went to a certain place in Whitechapel, where I saw a man named Prosinowski; he made a statement to me, and produced a forged rouble note, which I have here, marked B—the note which the prisoner sent to me I did not return to him, I paid him for it; I gave him the full value, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this note marked B is one of the four notes which the prisoner produced to me in April, and of which I took the particulars—in consequence of what Prosinowski told me I sent for the prisoner there and then, and he came to where I was—I had this note in my possession—I said to the prisoner in Prosinowski's presence, "This man is found in possession of a forged twenty-five rouble note, which he says you gave him this evening to utter"—the prisoner asked to see the note—I produced it, and at the same time cautioned him that whatever he might say might be used against him at a future time—he looked at the note and said, "I did not give it to Prosinowski, and I never saw it before in my life"—I said, "That cannot be correct, because the note in question is one of the four notes you brought to me in April last"—he said, "No, it cannot be one of those notes, because after I left you I was so frightened that I tore up the four notes I had shown you, and threw away the pieces"—I asked him if he had any papers about him—he produced this book, and in it I found an entry of the number of the note marked B—I asked him if that was in his handwriting—he said it was—I asked if he knew the note this number referred to—he said he did not—it is written in pencil—I then took him into custody—I afterwards went to the place where he lived in Leman Street, and searched, and in the room occupied by him I found this other book, in which are entries of the numbers of the four notes that he brought to me in April last—two of the numbers are repeated—on 3rd or 4th November last I saw two notes, the numbers of which corresponded with two of these four that the prisoner brought to me—they were brought to me by somebody else, a person living in the prisoner's house.</p>

                  </hi> I live in the Commercial Road, and am a photo<lb/>grapher—I have been in England eighteen years; I am a Russian Pole—I have known the prisoner since 1853; he was in the habit of calling at my house; he did so in November last year—he said to me, "I have got some business, if you like to do with it; I think we can get a good bit of money"—I said, "What kind of business is it? "—he said, "I shall tell you bye and bye"—he went away then—he came again another time, and I said, "Do you know what kind of business it is? "—he said, "Yes, I will tell you, only you must not say for anybody; I have got some Russian notes, you know about Russia (I had been in Russia seven years), you know how much it is in Russia; if you like to go to Russia, I don't mind supplying you with Russian notes very cheap, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

"—he said, "Yes"—he turned round into another room, and brought me two or three twenty-five rouble notes—I said, "I am afraid of this sort of business, and I don't want to do anything of the kind"—he said, "Oh, you are a fool, they are very good indeed, nobody can detect them"—I said, "That might be, I don't know much of these notes, they may be good or they may not, only I am afraid; I don't want to do such a business, I never done such a thing, and I don't want to do it"—he spoke to me about it several times; he used to come to my house—he said business was very bad—it was middling, but I declined it—he asked me to go to Russia—I said, "Why don't you go? "—he said, "I must not go, but I will send my wife with you if you like"—I said, "No, I don't want to do such a business"—I declined it several times—I can't say when I first gave information about this—he came to my place one Saturday with two young men, to take his likeness, which I did—after that Mr. Nathan came to my place; I then said something of what had occurred.</p>

                  </hi> I am a solicitor, and have offices in Essex Street, Strand—I live at No. 8, New Ormond Street, Bedford Row—about ten o'clock on the night of the 11th May I arrived at my door—I knocked and then turned round—there is a light on the pavement about two yards from my door, and another one on the opposite side of the street—just as I turned round the prisoner came and attacked me—another man was with him, and I think there was also a boy—the prisoner Mruck at me with something,</p>

               <p>but I warded the blow off with my stick, which broke it—I said, "Halloa! what do you want to do? "—he struck me about the body and head, and seemed to be trying to get at my throat—he then struck me a very heavy blow on the shoulder, I believe with a life-preserver, which knocked me down—while down he kicked me, and gave me another blow on the knee as hard as he could, which completely disabled me, and I could not move—I had in my pocket a gold watch, which was attached to my waistcoat by a gold chain, and while I was down the prisoner jerked it away with great force—they were worth about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I got up and cried out, "Stop thief! "—I went and found two policemen, and they had to take me home—a surgeon came and found my shoulder was dislocated—I have not seen the watch and chain since—on Whit Monday I went to the House of Detention—I recognised the prisoner out of ten or eleven prisoners, but I did not say anything there—I saw him at the station with four others, and amongst them was Crawley, and I was of the same opinion that he was the person—I asked the jailor to put his hat on—the night he attacked me he wore the same coat as he has on now, and he had on what is called a Fenian hat.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Mack's Defence.</hi> I was in a public-house, and was the worse for liquor. Holden fetched me home, and when we passed the prosecutor's door he called Holden a thief, and I, being the worse for liquor, struck him. I do not believe Holden had anything at all to do with it.</p>

                  </hi> I am potboy at the Woolpack tavern, Hart Street, Cripplegate—the prisoners have a room next door; I know them all—about the end of February W. Bulkley came in, and asked me to mind a horse and trap, which was just outside No. 2—I did so, and W. Bulkley brought from a dozen to eighteen white parcels out of the cart, and put them in the passage of No. 2, Hart Street—it was between six and seven o'clock, I should think—Batterham came afterwards and asked me for Mr. Bulkley; I said, "He is inside, going up stairs"—I knocked at the door, and Wilford Bulkley said, "Who is there? "—I told him the gentleman with the furry waistcoat from Easton's—he said, "Tell him to wait till the proper time in the morning, ten o'clock"—R. Bulkley was at that time inside the door of No. 2—Easton's doors were open at the time these parcels were brought out—Batterham stood by the tavern door—W. Bulkley came down about a quarter of an hour after<lb/>wards, and I told him again it was the gentleman with the furry waistcoat; he said, "Well, if he wants me, tell him to call at the proper time in the morning," and then he drove off in the trap with his brother Richard—on the second day afterwards I saw both the Bulkleys again, near dinner-time; Wilford asked me to mind their horse and trap—R. Bulkley brought these parcels down the staircase and put them into the trap, but they had changed the papers; they were white when they were brought in, and now they were brown—from twelve to eighteen were brought out—I noticed the size of them, they were the same as I had seen before—the two Bulkleys came to No. 2 during the week—I saw Richard Bulkley change some of the papers when he was carrying them down.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of James Barnes, who keeps the Grapes public-house, Fore Street—I know Batterham and the two Bulkleys—I have seen the two brothers together, and I have seen the elder brother and Batterham together at our house—they used our house about six weeks, from about the middle of October to the last week in November—parcels hare been left at our house from time to time by a porter, whose name I think is Frost, which Batterham and W. Bulkley took away, and the elder Bulkley brought parcels to the house, which he took away himself—no explanation was given to me why the parcels were left—in consequence of directions from my husband, I directed W. Bulkley, about the middle of November, not to bring any more parcels to the house—they came to the house it times after that, but not so often.</p>

"—he said, "Do not say anything, get him away, "meaning the person in the front room—while she was gone he said, "Do not tell her what it is"—I searched his room, but found nothing relat<lb/>ing to this charge—I afterwards went with Fork to 77, Stanhope Street, Hampstead Road—Wilford Bulkley opened the door—it was about a quarter to two in the morning—he said, "Halloa Smith, halloa Fork, what is the matter; oh! I see what you have come about; come up stairs"—when we got up stairs we told him we should have to take him in custody for being concerned in stealing a quantity of curtains from Messrs. Easton's, and that he had disposed of them to Mr. Johnson in the Edgware Road—he said, "That is right; have you got <hi rend="italic">Dick?</hi> I said, "Yes, he is in custody"—he said, "You will find it a fearful affair, and there is about twelve or fourteen in it"—I saw these two curtains (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) hanging in the window, and said, "Why, there are two of the curtains there"—he said, "Yes, that is one pair of them; I had two pairs of them one pair I burnt, for I was in Dolly's chop-house last Saturday; I stood behind Thompson, and heard him tell Mr. Brown that they had got a fresh clue in reference to the curtains, and I went home and burnt the other pair, and made up my mind to leave my residence to-morrow morning at eleven o'clock"—this was Tuesday morning at two o'clock—we took him in custody and charged him with stealing and receiving fifty-one pairs of curtains—after the first remand I went to 2, Hart Street, searched the grate, and found this quantity of tickets partially burnt.</p>

               <p>his stock was correct that. With regard to the damasks sold to Messrs. Johnson, the prosecutor missed no goods till they saw my invoice. He was taken to Messrs. Nathan's and saw four piece of rep and some damask, and recognised all he saw, and wishes you to believe they are his employer's goods, though they were sold eight or nine days previous to the stock-taking. If he has lost the goods there is nothing to prove that I am connected with them. The Nathans during the last three years have paid me over 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. My brother never knew anything at all about this; he received 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. every Monday morning, and was only a paid clerk; he had to attend to the office in my absence, and he never forfeited to the extent of a farthing in any of the transactions.

               <p>we should then see it in the book—we had a man named Edwards in the employment in March—I should say that the entry of 245/8 of stair carpet<lb/>ing, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., is not his writing; it looks more like Mr. Batterham's—this is Ed wards's writing, "March 6 th, J.O. Beales, Monkwell Street"—that looks very like the same writing as the 24 5/8 of stair carpeting—Beales's entry is more like Edwards's writing than anything I have seen—it looks very like Batterham's writing, and it also looks like Edwards's—Edwards left about March, for irregularities; he was an assistant in the carpet department—everything from every department goes into this book—between January and March Thompson was in the handkerchief depart<lb/>ment; he had an assistant, his name is Scott I think, he is not here—Scott makes entries or authorises anybody to do it.</p>

                  </hi> I am a warehouseman, carrying on business in partnership, in Old Change—the prisoner Jarvis was in my employ—on the 13th May we called him up, when the officers were there, into our private counting-house—I said to him, "Jarvis, I think it is right that I should tell you that, besides being in the presence of my brother and myself, you are in the presence of two officers of the police, and I should advise you that to any question that may be put to you you will answer truthfully, so that if you have committed a fault, you may not add to it by stating what is untrue"—I do not say those were the precise words I used, but that was the meaning of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I think that was not quite all you said to him, was it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think that was all, unless you can jog my memory—I did not say to him, "We know you have been robbing us"—to the best of my belief, I did not say, "You had better tell the truth, "that word was put into my mouth when Jarvis was before the Magistrate, but I am as</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186707080051"/>
               <p>positive as I like to be of anything that I did not make use of that word "better" at all—I was asked, when the word was put into my month, if I did not make use of it, and I said, "I really cannot say whether I made use of the word, I may have done, but I don't think I did"—I do not think it was at that part of the conversation that I made use of the words we knew more than he thought—I had showed him some papers—I did not follow that up by saying we knew more than he thought; that was afterwards—I did not say it before the paper was pro<lb/>duced—I am satisfied I did not say so before he opened his lips—I do not believe that, after advising him to answer truthfully, I said, "Frank, we know more than you think we do"—I think I said it after I produced the paper, not at that time, to the best of my belief—I am as positive of it as I like to be of anything—I do not think I made use of the word "better" at all—I did not say so at Guildhall—the question was put to me by the solicitor for Jarvis, "When you advised him to make use of the words' you had better, "and I said, "I believe I did not say so"—I do not know whether I may or may not have used the words in answer to Mr. Wontner's question, but they were words put in my mouth, not words I made use of myself—I said I may have said so or not, but it was my belief I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>, <hi rend="italic">upon this evidence, objected to any statement of Jarvis's being received: a confession must flow voluntarily from the mind of the person making it; at all events, it must not be the result of an impression created in his mind that he may be benefited by what he shall say; neither would it be admis<lb/>sible if made under the impression that he might suffer if he did not make it; there were authorities to sustain both propositions, and, after alluding to the cir<lb/>cumstances of the present case, he referred to Reg. v. Williams, 2 Denison's Crown Cases, p. 433; Reg. v. Warring ham, 15 Jurist, 318 j and Reg. v. Gar<lb/>ner, 1 Denison</hi>. 329. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STRAIGHT</hi> (<hi rend="italic">on same side</hi>) <hi rend="italic">referred to Reg, v. Shep<lb/>herd,</hi> 7 <hi rend="italic">Carrington and Payne</hi>. 579, <hi rend="italic">and urged that, if the acts and circum<lb/>stances of the case were taken in connexion with the observations, there was clearly sufficient in the nature both of a threat and promise to exclude the con<lb/>fession.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">is contending that the evidence was admissible, stated that the authorities referred to, were overruled by later decisions, Reg. v. Baldry,</hi> 2 <hi rend="italic">Denison</hi>. 430; <hi rend="italic">Reg. v. Sleeman, Dearsley</hi>. 249; <hi rend="italic">Reg. v. Parker, Lee and Cave</hi>. 42; <hi rend="italic">and Reg. v. Zeigert, Sessions Papers, Vol.</hi> 6, p. 163: <hi rend="italic">the principle upon which these confessions were excluded, was, if any worldly advantage was held out, or any worldly harm was threatened, calculated to lead to an untrue statement; in the present case there was a mere exhortation to tell the truth, which could not be calculated to elicit an untrue statement.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">further called attention to Reg. v. Miller,</hi> 3 <hi rend="italic">Cox's Criminal Cases,</hi> 07, <hi rend="italic">and submitted that if the conduct of a person in authority, such as the prosecutor in this case undoubtedly was, was calculated to impress the mind of the prisoner that he would be benefited by anything he could say, that was an inducement of the strongest kind, and sufficient to exclude any statement made in consequence of it. The</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">RECORDER</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">would certainly not exclude the evidence: the only hesitation he had was whether he should reserve the point; it was assumed as a matter of course that a confession was coming, but he could only assume that that was coming which the prisoner believed to be the truth.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said you advised him to answer any question; will you tell us what you then asked him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The next question I asked him was whether he knew Richard Bulkley—he told me he knew him when he was living in our house—I asked him whether he</p>

               <p>had seen him since—he told me that he had been to Richard Bulkley's house, and had also been with him to Goode's, on Ludgate Hill—I then asked him if he had ever corresponded with him or written to him—he said, "No, I have not"—I said, "Supposing I can show you a letter, what would you say then? "and I produced a piece of paper with pencil writing on it—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be the piece I showed him—he then told me it was his writing. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>—"Dear Dick,—On account of circulars, I shall not see you till about sir o'clock to-night. Wait till I come. F. D.") I then asked him whether that was the only one he had written—he said he thought it was—I then showed him this slip of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which had been given to me by the officers—he said, "This is not my writing, it is Richard Bulkley's, it is too good for mine"—I then said, "Jarvis, be careful what you say, for we have compared it with your writing, and we believe it to be yours"—I find I have made an omission, after the first letter I said to him, "Take care, Jarvis, we know more than you think we know."(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">on this renewed his previous objection, but the Court decided on receiving the evidence.</hi>) I told him we had compared it with some of his writing, and believed it to be his, and he said it was his. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>.—"Frank Jarvis—Leaf and Co., 39, O.C") I think I then said, "You have heard of the robberies which the Bulkleys are connected with; now, Jarvis, I am going to put to you a question, Have you robbed us? "—he said, "I will tell you—I have"—I then said, "Of what have you robbed us? but, in order that there may be no mistake about it, I will take it down in writing from your own mouth"—he then detailed to me whet he had taken, fifteen or sixten dresses of moiré antique, and about fifteen pieces of bonnet glacé—I asked him whether that was all—he said, "Yes"—I asked when he committed these robberies—he said before Christmas Day, 1866, and had continued doing so until the early part of April—I then asked him how he got them out of the house—he said he had taken them out sometimes one, and sometimes two pieces at a time in a parcel—I asked him whether he had received any money for them—he said he had—I asked how he had received it—he said he met Richard Bulkley in the street, and received it from him—I believe that was the whole of the conversation—we afterwards went to his room, his box was searched, and my attention was called to a very large quantity of gloves for a private person to have—they were gloves that had been used—I asked him if they had relation to any property of ours—he said they had, that they had been given to him by Richard Bulkley—I asked when—he said when he was living in the house—Jervis has been with us for four years and three or four months—he came on the 1st February, 1863—I think Richard Bulkley was with us about two years and nine months, he left, I think, in October 1866, but I am not quite clear about the date.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the money paid at se<lb/>parate times? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; when I went there first I would not buy the silks, because I did not think they were exactly suitable—I said I would endeavour to sell them—all the bargains were with Wilford; I had nothing to do with Richard—he came to me and said that his brother had some goods that he wanted me to see—I completed both bargains with Wilford—the money I paid to Richard wile he brought the goods—he asked particularly for the money that day, as his brother wanted it to meet a bill—I did not want to pay them till the goods were valued—I treated entirely with Wilford Bulkley, simply paying Richard for his brother.</p>

                  </hi> I am a buyer in the employment of Messrs. Leaf and Co. in the Spitalfields department—Jarvis was the junior assistant employed in my department—Richard Bulkley was in the employment while I was there, not in the same department—I think he was in the glove department—I have looked at the two pieces of ailk produced by Mr. Allan; one of them has my initials on it—I marked it when I bought it—that mark would remain on it if it was sold—I cannot say that this has not been sold—the stock is very large—we have just taken stock, aud there is certainly a considerable deficiency—I took stock myself personally—this piece of light blue moire antique, produced by Mr. Russell, is of the same colour and quality as w": have in our stock—our wholesale price for it is 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—here is another piece, the price of which is 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard.

               <p>and quality, that is all I can say—our stock is very largely deficient of bonnet silks; we keep a list of them, and our list is altogether defective—that might arise from their not being marked off; but there is a large deficiency in the total amount of stock—I have no means of knowing what deficiency there is in moire antiques—this pattern is the same quality as the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, and the same width—it is similar to these goods—it is one of Kemp and Stone's manufacture—3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard is the cost of this article—I cannot tell whether they have been sold at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I never bought them at that—I think I have sold some as low as 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. but not of these colours—we have none of Kemp and Stone's moire antiques—those are Soper's—I know nothing about Kemp and Stone's No. 1 quality—there is a piece of dark blue here, that is not of the same quality as our goods—I do not think it is the same make we deal in—the other goods are such as we have in stock and plenty of them.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With reference to the moire antiques, you say you cannot tell whether the stock is deficient or not, how is that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We do not keep an exact detailed account of every different section of the stock—the bonnet glaces constitute a very large portion of our stock, and we have a list made out to see how certain colours sell and which do not sell, and that list from time to time is rectified by one of the young men in the department, and when we were told we had been robbed we found that list very deficient indeed—the list shows goods that are not accounted for by ordinary sales—the stock generally being deficient, I cannot say whether the moiré antiques are deficient or not.</p>

"(meaning the black silks)—he said, "No, they are from the French glacés, or bonnet silks"—I then said, "I am about to ask you a question, please yourself whether you answer it or not; what did you get a yard for the moire antique?

"—he said, "Yes, Mr. Driver, of North Buildings, "and that which he had laid down at Mr. Holmes's was a portion of what he had originally laid down at Mr. Driver's, and he bought it of Mr. Driver again—at that time Mr. Easton came down with a list of the cash sales, and told the prisoner he had found an entry on the cash sheet of Howes for so much money, I cannot recollect what, and Howe said, "That is it, I remember it very well"—I then told Mr. Easton to go and see who Mr. Howes was—he came back and said it was Mr. Howes, of Curtain Road, for some Brussels carpet—Mr. Easton looked through the book and found the name of Driver for thirty-five or thirty-six yards of Cork carpeting—I then told the prisoner I should take him into custody, and asked if there was any property at his house—he said yes, I should find a piece in his room—I did not find any there, but I found this large piece in Mr. Pigeon's room—Howe helped me in looking through the book—I did not find the name of Holmes there at all.</p>

"—some boys behind us then hallooed out, and Hayes left Moore and went down by Stink House Bridge into the crowd, where the sailor was—Moore went round Lantern Street, took his coat off, and kept it on his arm—I told a man to rim after him; for he was the man who had got the money—I did not see Fitzpatrick do anything to the prosecutor, but he was against him when I saw him—that was nearly a quarter of an hour before I heard the cry of "Stop thief"—the prosecutor was very drunk, and had a cut over his left eye—I did not see how that happened.</p>

"—I said, "Between four and five"—I put him in the cell—he said he felt queer; the train shook it up—(we went by train to Loughton)—I said, "Shook up what? "—he said, "The stuff I have taken"—I told a constable to give him a dose of physic; I had received some physic at Epping, and brought it with me—I then went to Buckhurst Hill—from instructions I had received from Mr. Patteson, I went on to the Freehold, and saw this dagger lying in the field—I got over and picked it up, and about a yard from it I saw this piece of lead—there were marks of blood on the dagger, and also on the lead—near the lead I found this piece of string; it was not attached to it—this leathern sheath was on the dagger when I found it, but the</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon at Buckhurst Hill—on the morning of 21st April I was called to see Matilda Griggs at her father's house—I went up stairs and saw her lying on the bed—I proceeded to examine her—upon first examining her I saw nothing but a mass of blood, in fact the whole of her back was covered with blood—she was being stripped—I called for some water and began to wash away the blood, and I found wound after wound—I found eight wounds on the back—I then asked her if she was hurt anywhere else—she said she had been stabbed on the left breast—I examined that, and found three wounds on the inner part of the left breast; they were in three spots, close to one another, one very close to the nipple—I next examined her hand, and found two punctured wounds on the upper part of the thumb; I should say all those wounds were done by some sharp-pointed instrument—I examined the depths of the wounds as accurately as I could—the one out of which I extracted this brass end of the sheath was nearly three inches deep—that was at the back, just on the side of the right blade-bone; that was a slanting wound, not straight through; the others were in several places, and of the depth of not more than an inch, with the exception of one wound which penetrated the lung; that was rather deeper, but it would not have been prudent to judge how deep, or I might have done mischief—the wound out of which I took the brass sheath was on the shoulder blade, from left to right, supposing him to be standing behind her, low down on the left side that penetrated the lung—I will not be certain whether it was the right or left—that was sufficiently deep to touch the lungs between the ribs; the thickness of the interval was from three-quarters of an inch to an inch—the girl is a fat girl—in my opinion the wounds may have been caused by an instrument of this character, they were of a three-cornered nature, such as a bayonet, or such as this dagger is—I then examined the head, and found two wounds of a different character, contused wounds, on the upper part of the head, more towards the back—they might have been caused by such an instrument as this piece of lead with a sling passed through it—altogether there were fifteen wounds on her body, eight on the back, three on the</p>

               <p>breast, two on the hand, and two on the head—there were marks of blood on the dagger when it was first presented to me—I did not see any on the lead.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Mrs. Griggs.</hi> It was on the Sunday as she went away on the Thursday.) She complained of a little bodily illness—I am not able to express an opinion whether all the wounds were inflicted with the sheath or the dagger—I should say not, because the wound from which this end was extracted was of a larger character than the others—looking at the wounds themselves, I should say that all but that one had been inflicted without the sheath; they all presented a very sharp appear<lb/>ance, the other presented an oval appearance, namely the form of the sheath—no part of this remained in the wound—I extracted the whole of it—I should say that was the first wound inflicted—the others were decidedly done with the unsheathed weapon, that is my opinion from the nature of the wounds, they were three-cornered wounds, this was of an oval shape—they could not have been inflicted with the brass point on—I say that with certainty; they might have been inflicted with this leather part of the sheath remaining on; that would not interfere with them.</p>

                  </hi> I am a farmer and milkman, of Rushey Green, Lewisham—the prisoner has been in my service twenty months—it was his duty to carry out milk to customers, and account for it daily, when he returned—on 22nd May he took out milk in the morning and never returned—he did not account to me on 13th May for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 14th May, or for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the 18th, from Mr. Hall—he did not account for a shilling received from Mr. Hall that month.</p>

               <p>had dined between two and three, and had nearly half a pint of stout and two glasses of port wine; that was all I had drank the whole of the day—about a quarter-past five I was proceeding from Roehampton to to Putney Heath—that was the road I had been constantly in the habit of going on certain Wednesdays, not every Wednesday—my attention was called to some footsteps of persons walking behind me in the same direction as myself—I heard them before they were in sight—they were the footsteps of more than one person—there are gas lamps in the road, about 180 yards apart; it was between two of these lamps that I heard the parties coming behind me—I turned round to look after them, and by shading my eyes with my umbrella I got a very fair view of their faces as they approached the first gas-lamp I came to—I then passed that lamp, and about forty yards beyond the parish lamp is the lamp of Ash<lb/>burton Lodge, and between the parish and that lamp I looked round about three or four times to have a view of the parties who were coming behind me—seeing a recess at Ashburton House, I stood up in it, shading my eyes with my umbrella, and only ten feet from Ashburton Lodge lamp I had a full view of the men from the parish lamp to the Ashburton Lodge lamp—the prisoner was the near side man and the shorter of the two—I watched them as they approached me, came opposite to me, and advanced beyond me—I stood still until they had passed from twelve to twenty yards; I then walked after them in the same direction for about seventy yards—they then parted company, the prisoner turning to the near side, the taller one into the road—the prisoner approached me with a few hasty steps, and with a polished instrument, loaded, an instrument glazing in the gas-lamp—he struck me on the left side of the head, cutting my left ear open; he then struck me two blows with the same weapon on the right side of the head, giving me a wound of about two or two and a half inches long, from which the blood flowed freely; he then struck me on the top of the head—meanwhile his companion came up and wrested from me my umbrella, with which I had endeavoured to defend myself—having lost my umbrella, I pressed my arm and hand against my side, so that my assaitant behind should not get his hand in to feel the bulk of cash I had—he drew his hands down my side, and felt a weight in my skirt coat pockets; they were very bulky—he tripped up my heels, and I fell on my back; I rolled over on to my left side, so as to give them all the trouble I could, for the sake of getting time to protect my cash—in rolling over I threw my right arm over, and the prisoner caught me a blow on the thumb with the life<lb/>preserver, which gave me a bad thumb for three months—the prisoner then stood on my neck with his right foot, and his left foot on the bottom of my bowels—the man behind mo raised my overcoat and seized my undercoat, and ultimately tore out the skirt-pockets in this way (<hi rend="italic">producing the coat</hi>); he tore up the two sides and then across the top—while the pri<lb/>soner's foot was on my neck I had some difficulty in breathing, and I offered some resistance—he then struck me three hard blows in front of my head, breaking it in three places—I coolly said, "Take all, but don't murder me"—I repeated this twice, knowing at the same time that what they were tearing from me was of no value—I was not struck afterwards—they left me immediately, tripped over a little rill of water at the side of the road, and scampered across Putney Heath—there was a ledger and a book of poems in my skirt-pocket, both bulky—I picked up my umbrella and a glove; I had a thick riding-glove on this hand, and the other glove was off—after finding my umbrella and glove I walked to the Green Man</p>

               <p>public-bouse, which is about five minutes' walk from the spot where I was attacked—I was going there on business—I was known there, and they sent for a cab for me, and I drove off to the doctor's—I did not go to the police-station that night—I was afraid of the consequences of the bleeding—I went from the doctor's home—I had no opportunity of seeing the face of the man who held the bludgeon in his hand while I was on the ground—I had his face in my eye while I was there, but I did not see it—I swear positively it was the shorter man—I have not a doubt about it—the prisoner is that man—the men had gone on from sixty to eighty yards before they turned back—they were not out of my sight—they only went from tea to twelve yards beyond me before I went on my journey—I did not care about being attacked in front—I wanted to avoid being attacked behind—I felt that I should be attacked—I did not lose sight of the two men from the time they passed me under the lamp at Ashburton Lodge till I was attacked—they were never more than twenty yards from me—on the 9th March I was shown a number of men in Newgate, in two separate yards—they were prisoners, dressed in the usual every-day dress—in the first yard I saw about twenty-five men—they were told to march round, so that I could have a view, of them as they passed me—I said there was no one there I knew—I then went to the other yard; there were about twenty men there, dressed in the ordinary way—they were marched round in the same way, and directly I saw the prisoner I knew him to be the man—the yard is about 150 feet long by fifteen wide—the door opens in the middle—I saw the prisoner as he turned the corner at the right-hand side at the top of the yard—he was then about fifteen feet from me—I knew him directly—I watched his walk along the top of the yard, down the side, across the bottom, and up the remainder of the side near to me, and as he passed me I signed to the warder that that was the man I wanted—the warder did not know my business—I afterwards saw him at Wandsworth, about the 9th or 10th April; that was about a month afterwards—he challenged me that if he was allowed to alter his clothes I should not know him—I accepted the challenge—he disguised himself by blacking his neck and the sides of his face and the top of his head, and changing clothes with some casual paupers that were there—there were seventeen in number—the signal was given, and I walked in and I picked him out by his face, and said, "You are the man"—I did not see him alter his dress—I was aware that he was changing his clothes, because I did not depend on his clothes—I knew his face—he blacked his neck and face, so as to give him<lb/>self hair where he had none—I picked him out immediately—I have not seen the other man since to my knowledge—I had a better view of this man's face and figure, and he attacked me in front, that is why I have such a full knowledge of him.</p>

               <p>driven in a fly from the hotel to the doctor's that night—the driver never asked me if I should know the men if I saw them—he never spoke to me—it is not true that I said to him I should not know the men again—I never talked to the man—I did not say to Superintendent Butt that I should not know the two men again if I saw them—I never said so to anybody—no entry to that effect to my knowledge was made in any book at the station—I have never expressed myself to the effect that the man who robbed me was in the service of Young and Bainbridge—at one of the hearings before the Magistrate I asked to be allowed to retire from the case—I assigned as a reason that there were two or three persons who I expected would have identified the prisoner, but they did not—there were two men who said they saw the men and could recognise them again, but on being shown the prisoner they could not identify him—it was not in consequence of that that I said I would rather withdraw from the case—that fact was brought to my knowledge before I told the Magistrate so, but that was not my reason for wishing to retire from the prosecution—I did not assign it as the reason—I gave a reason—it was that I was not prosecuting from any revengeful feeling, although I got the worst of the fight—I considered I got the best, and as the public were not support<lb/>ing me in the prosecution, I would rather withdraw from it—I was prosecuting on public grounds, thinking that such a man should not be ✗<lb/>large, and as I was not being supported by any other witnesses I thought I would retire from the prosecution—I did not put the police to watch any of Young and Bainbridge's servants—I gave no such directions—I did not give them directions to watch for a certain man there—I did not tell the policeman Meiklejohn to watch at Young and Bainbridge's—this arises from the circumstance of my seeing some loose men at a public-house where I called on my journey, and I wanted to know whether those men lingered about the premises the whole of the day, and it was proved that they did—that was simply to know their whereabouts—they were none of them Young and Bainbridge's servants—I did not mention a man formerly in Young and Bainbridge's employment of bad character—I say most em<lb/>phatically that I gave no instructions to any of the police with reference to a man formerly in Young and Bainbridge's employ whom I suspected—this occurred in January—I was not taken to identify the prisoner till the 9th March—the police did not tell me they had a man in custody—it arose in this way: I inquired if there were not some men in prison who had committed robberies in the neighbourhood of Wimbledon; I was told there were, and I said, "No doubt these are the men who robbed me"—I went to Newgate, and the result you know—the man I picked out was engaged in the Wimbledon affair—I said before the Magistrate that the man who robbed me had on a funnel-shaped hat, that is a hat similar to my own; they both had funnel-shaped hats, I mean an ordinary hat—the Magistrate said he had never heard it called a funnel-shaped hat before, 'that he had been wearing a funnel-shaped hat all his life and had not known it—I cannot say positively whether the man who attacked me had hair on his chin—he had no whiskers, but he lowered his head and threw his chin into shadow, so that I could not tell shadow from hair—I have measured that place since—it was a drizzling rain that night and dark—there was no moon, at least there was a moon, but it was cloudy and it was not out—I went a second time to Newgate to see the prisoners walk, because I knew his gait so well, and, being so serious a matter, I could not be too strongly impressed that I was right—the second visit made me still more</p>

               <p>positive, if there was any room for it, because I noticed the man's legs, his shoulders, his neck, and his gait particularly—the taller man made longer strides—the prisoner tried to walk in his step, and he walked a little out of his usual stride—I have not been discussing this matter with any of my friends nor with the police—of course I have thought a good deal of it—it was pretty nearly beaten into me, it nearly cost me my life—I cannot say that I have been thinking over the matter much further than turning the man over in my eye, and satisfying myself more and more that he was the man—I had described the man minutely to two or three persons before I picked him out—I should have retired from the prosecution even at the last moment if any doubt had crept into my mind—I should not hare with<lb/>drawn from it if I had had the Magistrate's permission to do so, because while I was addressing the Magistrate, Mr. Mayo, the prisoner's solicitor, was also addressing him and challenging me to identify the prisoner, and I immediately said I should consent to the case going on—if Mr. Mayo had not interposed I should have retired, to have saved the trouble of prose<lb/>cuting, and I know what that trouble is—this is the third session I have been here—I was attended by two doctors—Dr. Jefferson is the only one here—I did not say to either of the doctors that I could not identify the men who had robbed me—I should say I had never seen the men before that night—certainly I had no occasion to mark him—I may have seen him.</p>

"—he said, "No, I could not; for there were two of them, and they came behind me and knocked me down senseless"—Dr. Jefferson was close at hand at that time—I do not know whether he heard him or not—I asked him the second time about it because I am about a good many hours of the night, and I might very likely see any one—I mean to say that I asked two or three times—I had no reason for asking him the second time—he said he thought they had got a cart just below—and when I went home that night one of our men told me he saw two men go by in a cart with a grey horse—Mr. Thorne told me he thought there was a grey horse just about there—I swear that Mr. Thorne mentioned about the grey horse to me—the third time I asked him if he should identify the men was at Dr. Jeffer. son's—I asked him once at the Green Man and twice at Dr. Jefferson's, as he was getting into the cab; I asked him one after the other—it was after he had talked about the grey horse that I asked him the third time—he was getting into the cab at the time—I do not know why I asked him the third time—I cannot give any reason for it—I had two subpoenas to come here—I received this paper on Sunday night I think, a month ago last evening—I do not whether that is a month or five weeks ago—that was the first time I was asked about it since the 9th January—I heard that the prisoner was charged at Wandsworth and remanded, but no one came and questioned me about it—I heard that Mr. Thorne had got him locked up, that was all—why should I go to the police? I knew nothing about it; it was no business of mine—I heard that Mr. Thorne had picked him out and identified him, but I did not know the man; this is the first time I have seen him—I thought it odd that he should pick out the man when he told me he could not identify him, but I did not go up about it; it wait no business of mine.</p>

"—two young men came through the parlour from the shop, and ran through the passage into the street—I followed them in my night-clothes to the corner, calling "Police! stop thief! "—I cannot swear to them, as they hurried through so quickly—I have seen the prisoner about the streets—he is about the size of one of them—I followed them and saw a policeman follow close upon the same men who went out at the door—I did not lose sight of them—I had seen the parlor doer safe at twenty minutes to twelve, and the outer door was fastened—I went into the shop and saw two clocks and a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> Lying on a jacket, and about half an inch of tallow candle burning on the counter—they bad drawn the padlock from the staple, and I fonud it under the door—I also found this key (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which fits the frontdoor, and another key, which they had hidden under the mat With the padlock.</p>

I sat down under a tree three-quarters of an hour before the policeman came up, and if I had opened the man's shutters I should not have sat there. I had no tools to break into any house. It would be impossible for me to walk that distance without the policeman seeing me go by the house. There was no mention of the shelf or the boots before the Magistrate.</p>
