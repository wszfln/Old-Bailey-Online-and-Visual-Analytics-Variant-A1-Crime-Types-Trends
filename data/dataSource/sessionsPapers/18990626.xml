I am the wife of Percy Reece, of 88, Clarendon Street, Paddington—on Friday, May 26th, I was in the Old England public-house about 11.55—the deceased came in—we were there for a few minutes—some beer was called for, and as it was placed on the counter the prisoner looked through the door—I had known him and his wife for some time—he called his wife—he said, "Come along, Alice; it is time you go home"—she did not go for a minute, and I opened the door for her, and she went out; as she was going out I just, pushed her through the door—it was only a friendly push—she was all right in regard to drink—I poured the boer I had called for into a can, and was going to leave the public-house with it, when I heard a scream, and then another—when I heard the first one I was at the bar taking the change up—the second scream was as I went through the door—they were loud screams—it sounded like a woman; it was really a shriek—it came from the direction of the corner of Ranelagh Road—I went in the direction—I saw two men standing on the right side of the road, not close to</p>

               <p>the deceased, who was in a kneeling position on the pavement—I saw a rare qyanitity of blood on the pavement—I knew her condition of pregnancy—she made a statement to me—with the assistance of Mrs. Milne, I helped her upon her feet, and took her home—there were traces of blood from where we found her to her house—she was taken down to a room in the basement—eventually she was taken up the area steps—there was blood on the steps—she became unconscious, and never spoke again while we were with her—the prisoner was not at home when I got there—I never saw him after he looked in at the door of the public-house.</p>

In October, 1897, I entered George Gabriel Wolffs employ as a clerk—the office was at 25 and 26, Redcross Street—neither of the sons were in the business then, and no other clerks, only three packers—there was no description on the door—the business carried on was marking ink, and competitions in missing words—I opened the letters—there were postal orders in them—there were about 500 a day, and they gradually increased up to 900or 1,000—the orders were for 1s. 3d. at first, and then 1s. 6d. each—on November 9th, 1897, there was a fire behind the office, and we had to turn out, and the business was moved to 39, Grosvenor Road, Highbury, where Wolff lived—when I first saw Seigmund Wolff he used to take part in the business, but I did not see Adolf at all—the business went on till January 5th, 1898, when we left Highbury and went to 82, Sidney Avenue, Milton Street—it was called 82, Milton Street on the note-paper, but for the Dream book it was "Sidney Avenue, Moor Lane"—that was the same houue under another name—there was no plate outside the door about the Dido dentifrice—the business ini reased at Milton Street—the first competition was in marking ink, No. 1—that closed in December, 1897—the 2nd marking ink ran into 1898, and the 3rd from April 30th to July 31st, 1898; No. 4 from August 8th to October 31st; and No. 5 from October to January 28th, 1899—No. 6 was current at the time of the arrest—the first Petroline began in March, 1898, and ran to June; No. 2 from July 14th to September 30th, 1898; No. 3 from October 11th to Decem<lb/>ber 31st, 1898; and there was another Petroline competition running at the time of the arrest—the correspondence was not dealt with at High<lb/>bury—the three defendants used to bring it from Highbury—I first saw Adolf at Milton Street, but not taking part in the business—when the business was flourishing 25 to 30 clerks were employed, not all lady clerks; some were packers—most of the 1,000 letters a day contained postal orders—I did not see a book in which the names of the winners were recorded—with the exception of the gentleman who won a bicycle and killed a dog with it, I did not dear of other consolation prizes—a consolation prize was 2s. 6d.—all through 1898 the postal orders were for 1s. 6d., and 1,000 letters a day would be the average—2s. was sent in the Dream book competition—I studied it; it has not given me bad dreams—the Dido dentifrice, No. 2, began in January, and was current at the time of the arrest—the Petroline was madein the office in pails, and Adolf assisted in making it—I never tried it—the dentrifice was also made there in pails but not in the same place—it was made of chalk—Gabriel made both the black and the red ink—there was no business in the marking ink apart horn the competition, except sometimes it was "Repeat order"; that would give them another chance, if they sent another postal order; if not, we did not send the marking ink.</p>

I am an electrical engineer—I am agent for Geoffroy and Delore, of Clichy, France—my offices are at 16, Wool Ex<lb/>change—I first saw the defendant on April 10th, when he called and gave me this card, "Herbert Adams, Electrical Engineer, 46, Brigham Street, New North Road, N."—he said he was an electrical engineer, and had been in business in a small way some years, and said, "I shall be placing an order with you; my reference is Mr. Fisher, 16 and 16A, Dean Street, Soho"—I knew the firm—on the 11th he came for some electrical cables—between April 11th and May 4th he gave me several orders—he said he wanted the cable for installation work, amongst others the lighting of a church, which I do not remember, and a private house near Ascot; and the cable was to be taken by the first train from Waterloo—that was on a Saturday in April; I think 29th—some orders were in writing, and some verbally—I think I had 1 order by post—I supplied £65 worth of goods to the order of Herbert Adams—in May a man called representing himself as a buyer for Owen and Kemp, electric lighting engineer, of 140, Sloane Street, S. W., and 146, The Grove, Denmark Hill, S.E.—the next day, May 4th, he gave me a written order for different sized wires and cables to the value of £75 odd—he said the cables were to go straight to the American Oil Works at Purfleet, and he would call with a cart in one or two hours to take them away, and the rest were to go to some grove in Brixton for the installation of electric bells—the wire is sold by the mile or 110 yards the 16th of a mile—he afterwards came with a man and a cart, and took the goods away—I have never been paid—I made inquiries—I afterwards went to the Marlborough Mews Police-station, and saw cable I estimated at the value of £35, which formed part of the order I executed to the order of Herbert Adams—I applied for a warrant—I at<lb/>tended at Moor Lane Police-station, where I saw wire to the value of £6, forming part of Owen and Kemp's £75 order—the same day I went to 58, Fenchurch Street, the premises of West and Co., electrical engineers, where I saw cable to the value of £50 or £60, part of the order of Owen</p>

I have never been in Twine Court in my life. I swear before God I am innocent. I want to call Mr. and Mrs. Smith." <hi rend="italic">Marsh says</hi>: "On the morning of the 15th I was passing up Leman Street with Isaac Levy. At the corner of Commercial Street we accosted another man named Harry Parr. As we accosted him two detectives wished to know what was in the parcel we were carrying. Levy replied, 'Washing.' I said to the detective, 'Do not open the parcel in the public street; either take us to the Police-station or a quiet place, and there examine it.' He told me he should do as he pleased, and he opened the parcel. I complained about being shown up in the street. He threatened to pick me up hands down, whether I was innocent or guilty. He trod on my heels, pushed me, and otherwise assaulted me. I took the parcel to Commercial Street Police-station, and there lodged a complaint against the detective. As I did not know his name, the inspector told me he could give me no advice, and told me to find his name and then come back to him. The same evening, about 9, I was in the Russian Eagle with Levy and several other companions, when Detective Richardson and the one who had opened the parcel of linen walked in. Richardson stood looking at me for the space of 40 seconds. He was on the point of leaving me, when the other detective told him to take that fellow down. Richardson then asked me my name, I told him. He told me I should be wanted for highway robbery. I said, 'All right' On the way to the station I asked him where it occurred, he told me at Twine Court. I said I knew well enough where it was. I have made a mistake. I mean it was on the morning of the 20th, not the 15th, that I was stopped with the linen, and the evening of the 20th when I was arrested. On the 15th I was with Isaac Levy and a woman (Sarah Chattaway) at the bottom of Leman Street. The time was half-past 3 by the Co operative Stores' clock. I and Levy went to my father's house, to polish our boots, put on a clean shirt, have a wash and come out again. Wo came out about 25 past 4 and went up Brick Lane, and there we stayed for the remainder of the day. I wish to call my stepmother if she is in Court; she can tell you the neighbour's name."</p>

I am a chartered accountant of 110, Cannon Street, in partnership with my son, Mr. Frank Tingle—I was ap<lb/>pointed liquidator of the Coolgardie Company in August, 1897—I had the carrying out of the reconstruction agreement, in which the Coolgardie Company was to be reconstructed into the Kalgoorlie Company—I was familiar with the cluse under which shareholders in the old company were to be entitled to have shares in the newcompany—for the purpose of carrying that into effect I caused circulars to be issued to the share<lb/>holders</p>

               <p>in the old company, inviting applications from them, if they de<lb/>sired it, to become shareholders in the new company on the basis of the old company—in response to those circulars I received a number of ap<lb/>plications from persons who were, or professed to be, <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> shareholders in the old company, and allotments were ultimately made to the writers of the applications to the extent of 146,848 shares in the new company out of the 150,000 which it was my power to allot—there then came forward a number of applications greatly in excess of the authorised issue of shares in the old company—one application came forward which opened my eyes—it was for 10,000 shares from the banking firm of Brown Janson, and Co.—the number of those shares were 5,061 to 10,000, 10,301 to 10,360, 15,398 to 20,397—that application reached me on November 5th, 1897—the first information I got in regard to the exist<lb/>ence of those shares was from a managing clerk to some stockbrokers, named Galloway and Pearson, on November 5th, 1897—I had seen Mr. Clifford from time to time—I had been in constant communication with him at the office of the company—I did not hear of Messrs. Brown, Janson, and Co. having forwarded to Clifford transfers of 2,850 shares under the date of October 13th, 1897, or of his having given Brown, Janson, and Co., any receipt for those transfers—he told me nothing of it—I expect they are in my possession now, but I did not have them till a long subsequent date—it should be entered into the books of the company—there were no more transfers then; the oompany was in liquidation—if Mr. Clifford received the receipt he should have entered the fact of its acknow<lb/>ledgment in the transfer<lb/>book—this company had a transfer<lb/>book, and in the ordinary course of business it should have appeared that a receipt had been given for the transfers—Mr. Clifford never informed me of the re<lb/>ceipt of the transfers, and I have never seen them—my conversation with the stockbroker's clerk led me to see Sir Alfred Kirby the next day—I had frequently seen Sir Alfred between then and the date of my appointment, and alpo Mr. Arthur Kirby—No. 70, Cornhill, the registered offices of the company, was, in fact, the business office of Sir Alfred—in conse<lb/>quence of the excess of applications, I referred the matter to the directors of the new company, and, upon their instructions, I caused a search to be made in detail, and the result was to satisfy me that there had been other cases of excessive issue of shares over and above the authorised capital of the old company—there had been two sets of certificates in existence in relation to the same shares, and there were certified transfers in existence, showing that the same shares had been dealt with by means of certified transfers twice, and I discovered that there had been a dealing with shares which were not in the transferors' names in the books of the company at the date upon which those transferors' names appeared—Mr. Tomlinson is an example—he was a clerk in the service of Sir Alfred Kirby—according to the books of the company, he never was registered as a shareholder in the company, but, notwithstanding that, his name appeared upon transfers as the transferor of shares which he held in the company—the first instance of his name ap<lb/>pearing in the books was as a transferor of shares which he did not possess—there was a statutory meeting of the new company held on December 22nd, when I was instructed by the shareholders and the directors to</p>

               <p>make a fall investigation into the affairs of the Coolgardie Company, and to report the result of that investigation to them—it was a lengthered in<lb/>vestigation, involving a very detailed and a somewhat difficult inquiry—I. entrusted the greater part of that to my son and partner, Mr. Frank Tingle—it was not completed until the middle of March, 1898—we made the discovery that there were share certificates in existence contem<lb/>poraneously, which were duplicates, and which related to 18;184 shares, and in addition to those I discovered that 14,000 shares were claimed by holders whose title was derived from transfers certified by the secretary to the company—some of them had been issued with the certificates attached to them—the transferee had got the transfers and the certificates, but he had never come to the office to register them; they were in addition to the first 18,000—I found a duplication in the Coolgardie Company of 32,184—the Coolgardie Company was registered on November 14th, 1894, and the first minute is dated November 24th, 1894, which says that Mr. Doolette and Sir Alfred Kirby were invited to discuss the contract to be entered into with Mr. Arthur Kirby, and after the meeting some modi<lb/>fications of that agreement were discussed and agreed to—on January 10th, 1895, I find a minute in which Sir Alfred Kirby and Mr. Doolette were invited to join the board; and under the date of April 29th, 1895, I find a minute: "That the Board authorise the sealing of the agreement as between the company and Mr. Arthur Kirby," and the seal was fixed accordingly—on May 31st there was a board meeting, and there is a minute to the effect that 20,000 shares, numbered 70,001 to 90,000 were allotted to Mr. Arthur Kirby, as vendor's shares, as part payment of the purchase money payable to him under the agreement of April 29th, 1895—on July 22nd, 1895, there is a minute of another board meeting, in which it was resolved to allot 5,000 shares to Henry Carroll, 5,000 to McLaughlin, and 5,000 to Kennett—at that meeting Sir Arthur Kirby was present as director—the number of Carrol's shares were 15,398 to 20,397—McLaughlin numbers were 10,301 to 10,360 and 5,061 to 10,000, Kennett's 20,398 to 25,397—I do not know who those three people were—in the minute<lb/>book, under date of November 28th, 1895, Clifford was appointed secretary to the company—Sir Alfred Kirby was in the chair—Clifford remained secretary down to the time that I was appointed liquidator—it was in July last year that, criminal process was first issued in this matter at the Mansion House—the delay was caused because the proceedings were heard at a number of adjournments, and they were seriously interrupted by the continued illness of Sir Alfred Kirby.</p>

Clifford, C.T., July 14th, 1896"—the transfer is registered on July 23rd, 1896—the certificate was issued to Mr. Baker in respect of those shares; it is not signed by Sir Alfred Kirby, but it is countersigned by Mr. Clifford—it is the same number as the share re<lb/>ferred to in Arthur Kirby's affidavit—abstracts 36 and 37 show the dealing by McLaughlin and Carroll with their lots of shares; they were prepared from the same source—I produce a transfer, dated October 31st, 1895 (exhibit No. 78), by which Carroll transferred all his shares to Brown, Janson and Co.; it includes the same numbers to which I have been speaking in exhibits 36 and 37—he conveyed the 205 also—he conveyed the whole 5,000 shares to Brown, Janson and Co. on October 13tn, 1895—Attached to the transfer is the certificate issued to Carroll—I produce a similar transfer of all his shares to Brown, Jansen and Co. by McLaughlin on October 30th, 1895—one t ransfer purports to be executed by McLaughlin, and the other by Carroll—these transfers have never been registered—they were subsequently brought to my father's notice at the time of the liquidation—an application was made by Brown, Janson and Co. to register them—I find on October 30th, 1896, McLaughlin transferred 1,000 shares, Nos 5,061 to 6,060, to Messrs. Woolner and Jones for 5s.—this synopsis represents the dealings with these shares—exhibit 44 shows that the shares transferred to Messrs. Woolner and Jones, and which are in the bundle of transfers to McLaughlin, were transferred to Mr. Smith—the details in connection with that are shown correctly on exhibit 44—the transfer to Smith is by Arthur Kirby—I do not find that Arthur Kirby ever acquired those particular shares in any way—this is the cer<lb/>tificate (39) which was issued—the transfers and certificates dealing with these shares are exhibits 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, and 44—the certificates are all. signed "Alfred Kirby,'* and countersigned "M.

M.J. Clifford"—in most cases the cer<lb/>tificates are signed by Sir Alfred Kirby and countersigned by Clifford—I find that 18,184 shares have been duplicated; that certificates were actually issued by the company in respect of that number of shares, and that number does not include shares which were deposited with persons who subsequently failed to register those shares—there is a considerable number of such cases—an example of that is the shares transferred to Brown, Janson and Co.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant, of 16, Tokenhouse Yard—I had a conversation with Arthur Kirby just before the allotment of shares in the Coolgardie Co—to the best of my belief, it was Arthur Kirby—he asked me if I would have a few shares put in my name—I objected at first, afterwards I consented—he did not give me any numbers of shares—I understood them to be a small quantity—after that I frequently saw Arthur Kirby and Clifford—they came in relation to the execution of transfers of these shares—Iasked Clifford if the transfer was in order, and he assured me it was, and I asked Arthur Kirby the same thing when he came, and he gave me the same assurance—I asked them both, "Now, is this transfer in order?"—on one occasion I said to Clifford, "I am signing these transfers, and I think it would be as well if I kept the registered numbers"—he replied, "That is quite unnecessary; the things are all in order"—the numbers were attached to the transfer—no transferees were named in the transfers brought—I am not sure if the consideration money was in—I never received 6d.—I did not pay for them or receive them—I understood I was the nominee of Arthur Kirby—I executed a number of transfers in this way—I remember the transfer executed by me to Brown, Janson and Co.—that was an instance in which the transferees names were in the transfer—that was exceptional, and, I believe, before Clifford was secretary to the company—I saw that the number of shares on the transfer was 5,000, and T told Mr. Kirby that I was not aware of such a large number of shares in my name—he said, "Oh! that is all right; you are my nominee"—I do not know what the object of having nominees is—I never borrowed any money on these shares—I did not regard them as mine to deal with, and I left the dealing with them entirely to their raal owner, Arthur Kirby—I had no idea what was being done with my shares—I did not know they had been hypothecated to anyone for the purpose of raising money—I read in the <hi rend="italic">Financial</hi> News the report of an action brought by the old Coolgardie Company against Dane's Discount Bank, about September, 1896, I think—in that report was some reference to myself and to Arthur Kirby, saying I was his trustee for 1,000 shares in the Coolgardie then—that was evidence given by Arthur Kirby—next time I saw Arthur Kirby I said, "I was surprised to read that report in the <hi rend="italic">Financial News</hi>; you stated that I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant, at 72, Bishopsgate With in—I was a director of the Coolgardie Mint and Iron King Mining Company from the beginning of the company to its reconstruction—I was present at the meeting of May 31st, 1895, when 20,000 shares were allotted to Arthur Kirby; I signed the minutes—I was present at the meeting of July 22nd, 1895, when 5,000 shares were allotted to Henry Carroll, 5,000 to Joseph Eenry Kennett, 5,000 to Hubert McLaughlin, and 3,000 to William James Bradley—I allotted those because the cer<lb/>tificate was drawn up in the certificate-book, and we were instructed by the solicitor that it was in accordance with the contract that they should be allotted, I believe—I should say they were allotted at Arthur Kirby's request—our custom as to the registration of the transfers and issue of new certificates was that one director took the transfer-book, another the certificate, and another the certificate-book, and called over to each othe the numbers of the shares in the transfers—when issuing new certificates in place of old ones, the old certificate had to be put on the table of the board-room, marked "cancelled," with a stamp—that was not always done; sometimes we were assured by the secretary (Mr. Lakeman) or Mr. Clifford the certificate was in the outer office—Clifford gave us that assurance—I frequently asked about the company's books—I was gener<lb/>ally told they were not completed, owing to the absence of accounts from Australia, but that they were being written up—sometimes the secretary told me that, sometimes the solicitor—to my knowledge, no certificate was ever signed or sealed without the transfer being certified—it was Clifford's duty, as secretary, to certify the transfers—I do not think an auditor was called in till just before the reconstruction, when Messrs. Tingle and Co. were called in—I asked the secretary what they were doing, and if the books were complete, after they were called in, and he said they were making up the accounts; they could not be quite completed by the reconstruction meeting, because there were certain papers not to</p>

I do not know whether Arthur Kirby was present at the discussion in February, 1896, but our books show a discussion took place—the books do not show that Mr. Bradley had anything to do with it—I was not present—discussion would naturally take place before a loan would be granted.</p>

               <p>I seen it; I believe it was put in at the Mansion House—if certificates or transfers are sent out in duplicate, the day must inevitably arrive when those shares must be eventually presented for registration, and when probably the company will be called on either to pay twice over or to re<lb/>pudiate one or other of the duplicates—anybody cognisant of business would know that—the new company was reconstructed with the same number of shares, and an invitation was given to all old shareholders to become shareholders in the new company; that was inviting discovery that there were duplicates—if those duplicates existed it would not be a prudent course to issue a new company without a further issue of shares—we saw no list of duplicates drawn up when suspicion arose that dupli<lb/>cates had been issued, whether by mistake or otherwise—it would have been a prudent thing to have issued a new company with a larger number of shares, and have reserved some of those shares to meet the duplicates; but it would not get over the difficulty, because the original capital was £150,000, and therefore you have only to meet £150,000 in the reconstructed company—it would be wise, if you had the opportunity, to issue a new company with a capital of £180,000 inatead of £150,000, and reserve £30,000 to issue against the duplicates that had been already issued; that would be a way out of the difficulty, and conceal the fraud—I saw Arthur Kirby's share account and the ledger account, which is a very muddled account—Arthur Kirby would have nothing to do with those entries in the company's books—they do not run in sequence of dates—the ledger account, when it is care<lb/>fully scrutinised, shows the issue of duplicate shares—I was 3 months in<lb/>vestigating these accounts; they gave me a good deal of trouble—I have no reason for thinking that blank transfers were not executed; we have heard that Mr. Elmore had a blank transfer—I believe it is a usual way of doing business—it is a common practice to deposit blocks of shares, without the name of any transferee with various persons, brokers for in<lb/>stance, who hold the shares, and await a favourable moment for selling them—in some cases a long interval may elapse before the favourable time comes—transfers in this case have been put a good long time before they were registered—on the registration you see in the books who are the owners of the shares—Mr. Messenger got a call on 50,000 shares, I be<lb/>lieve; I do not think there is any documentary evidence of that at all—I should not find it by any entry in the book; it would not affect the com<lb/>pany—it would be only when the shares were realised that Messenger would appear on the books as the certified holder of the shares—I cannot say whether he had a blank transfer up to that time—I cannot say if on May 25th, 1895, Messenger had a blank transfer of 50,000 shares—Messenger, according to the register, held no shares till August, 1895—if he had a blank transfer of 50,000 shares in May, and he registered some of them in August, the first entry in the books would be the registration—nothing would appear in the books about the blank transfer—the transfer would be produced (for the purpose of registration—the shares (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) were transferred to Messenger on August 17th 1895—the first large block was of these 5,000 shares, according to this book, that Messenger got from Arthur Kirby—that was January 14th,. 1896, I think—I cannot say that was the first transfer to Messenger—the date of the transfer is very often the date of registration—I do not know</p>

               <p>that Messenger had a large block of shares transferred to him as far back as May, 1895; I cannot say one way or the other—it would not go in the books at all—the date in the books would be that of the registration—there was no transfer for so large a number as that, not in one line—Messenger would have a separate transfer for each one he registered—he had 1,000 shares transferred to him in a block, and having sold 100, he came to register 100—he would produce the transfer for 1,000, and he would be certified as holding 1,000; the 100 would be registered and transferred out of the 1,000—supposing he had a call on 50,000 shares, he would have a right to demand at any moment a blank transfer of 100, 200, or 300—in speaking of the books, I was only talking of "share" books—I presume they start from the allotment—I should have the allot<lb/>ment-book—the first shares were allotted on November 24th, 1894, and that would be when these books would start—Arthur Kirby would been<lb/>titled, <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi>, to £13,000 in meal or malt.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The old company went into voluntary liquidation, and there was a reconstruction—the new company had a different board to the old company; on the board of the new company were 2 directors (Sir Alf.'ed Kirby and Mr. Pomeroy) who had belonged to the old com<lb/>pany's board—the 3 new directors were Johnson, De Rose, and Tweedy—a condition was inserted that the directors of the new company were to receive shares in the new company at 6s. 6d. paid—that condition in the agreement led ta the investigation which was followed by the discovery.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Brown, Janson and Co. bankers, of Abchurch Lane—T produce a copy, duly certified under the Bankers' Evidence Act, of Arthur Kirby's account with us; it is headed "Stray Shot Account," beginning 1892—it is taken from the ordinary books of the bank which are in use there—I have examined it and certify it to be correct—under date November 24th, 1896, I find an entry in the account that we discounted bills amounting to £6.000 for Arthur Kirby to meet an overdue promissory note of about £5,000—we took as security for that advance 5,000 Stray Shot shares and 10,000 Coolgardie Mint and Iron King shares—those shares had been in our possession since 1895, and they formed part of the security for the loan of £6,000, which appears in our books under date November 21th, 1896—I also produce another account of Arthur Kirby, from January 1st, 1896, to August 14th, 1897—it is a duly certified account—it shows that on February 11th, 1897, we discounted bills for Arthur Kirby to the amount of £4,600—the securities are enumerated in Lloyd's underwriting policies; amongst them are 2,850 Coolgardie Mint and Iron shares, Nos. 70,201 to 71,000, and 89,020 to 89,069; and 2,000 shares, Nos. 18,898 to 19,897, and 7,061 to 8,060—we sent the transfer of the 2,850 shares to the company on October 13th, 1897, I believe—we received this receipt for those shares—this is transfer by Arthur Kirby to our firm of 800 shares, Nos. 70,201 to 71,000—this is a transfer by Mr. Kenett to our firm of 2,000 share, Nos. 21,697 to 23,697—exhibit 46 is a certificate that was issued to us in respect of those shares—at the time we took these transfers we considered they were in respect of valid shares.</p>

               <p>shares—10,000 shares, 5,000 belonging to McLaughlin and 5,000 to Carroll, or in their names, were deposited with us in September, 1895, in respect of a loan of £12,000—I believe we got a deposit of 20,000 shares for the loan of £12,000—I cannot tell you if of those 5,000 were in Bradley's name, 5,000 in McLaughlin's, and 3,000 in Bradley's; the books would tell; they are not here—I cannot be positive whom I saw with reference to that first transaction; I think it was Mr. Bradley—I do not think it was Arthur Kirby—I do not say he may not have come, but he did not transact the business—part of that loan was paid off in November, 1895, by the sale of 10,000 of those shares—£10,000 was the first loan we made in May, 1395—I think it is very likely that when we made that loan of £10,000 those 20,000 shares were deposited, I feel pretty certain they were—there was a Lloyd's policy also by way of security—I believe that the 20,000 shares, or a great many of them, belonged to Carroll and McLaughlin, but I am not perfectly certain—£10,000 was the whole amount of the loan—after that there was another loan of £12,000, when the £10,000 loan was paid off, about September 25th, 1895—I cannot say that Mr. Bradley told me that those 20,000 shares were Arthur Kirby's shares, as vendor; I have always understood them to be so, but who told me I don't know; it was what was represented to me—I think I saw others than Mr. Bradley in the transaction; I think Sir Alfred Kirby was there—I do not say Mr. Bradley told me at the original trans<lb/>action that the shares were Arthur Kirby's, as vendor; I understood it—I cannot say if I saw anyone else—I cannot say if Arthur Kirby or his father was there; I have no remembrance of it; it is a long time ago, and I interview 20 or 30 people every day—the £10,000 loan was paid off; no part remains unpaid—I believe it was paid off by the sale of 10,000 of these shares; we did not sell them—they were taken up out of our hands by a cheque—I don't know if they were sold or not; he may have got an advance on them—interest and so on was paid—I think we got £9,000, and £1,000 remained unpaid, and was renewed—I said before the Magistrate, "I don't think any part of that original loan remains unpaid; no part remains unpaid"—I thought so, but you are asking me that which I cannot tell—I am only following our books as best I can—I believe it was paid—when it was paid we had no right to retain the other 10,000 shares; they ought to have been handed back, and they would have been if they had been demanded; they were not asked for—it did not escape our attention—the 10,000 shares we retained were in the names of Carroll and McLaughlin; we had been told they were Arthur Kirby's vendor's shares—we have not yet given them up; we have them now—I cannot say if we brought the fact of our possessing those 10,000 shares to anybody's attention till this investigation began; I don't re<lb/>member our giving any notice at all—those 10,000 shares were quite distinct from the 2,850, shares which were deposited as partial security for the £4,600 advance—I saw Mr. Bradley, Mr. Fleming, and Arthur Kirby about the £6,000 loan—I think I only saw Arthur Kirby about it once, when the transaction was completed; that was after negotiations bad gone on, before the ultimate contract was arrived it—Mr. Fleming and Mr. Bradley conducted the negotiations—Arthur Kirby's signature was essential to the performance of the contract; I do not think he</p>

               <p>took any part in it except putting his hand to the cheque and the bill—I don't think I knew whether the money so raised went to the com<lb/>pany or not; I knew it did not go to Mr. Arthur Kirby—I do not remember the £4,600 transaction at all—the £6,000 transaction is im<lb/>pressed on my mind by the fact that I refused it at first, and Mr. Fleming came and asked me to do it, and pressed me, and on that account I did it—Mr. Fleming is a friend of mine; he is an underwriter—I can answer nothing about the £4,600 further than that we made the loan—I should think it was the same sort of thing as the £6,000 loan, and had the same relative features—Sir Alfred Kirby was not, to our knowledge, at that time a man of great wealth—he was well known to us—I had known him a good many years—I knew then he was no longer a man of wealth—I had had banking transactions with him for a good many years—I knew Arthur Kirby was his son.</p>

I do not think we were the com<lb/>pany's bankers—I do not think we had an account with them then; I am not quite sure of that—it was not in our capacity of bankers that in the first instance the 20,000 shares were brought to us to secure us for the loan—I have had that name before me so often I cannot tell whether we had the account or not—all the original transactions were carried out with Mr. Bradley—from first to last I had nothing to do with Clifford, I think; I should not know him—I should think the deposit of 20,000 shares was by Bradley—I think Stonham and Messenger paid off the first loan of £10,000—I did not know at that time that they were acting as brokers to the company—at the last account I knew it—I believe Mr. Bradley nego<lb/>tiated all the loans—I cannot tell who paid off the second loan; I think it was paid off—the £6,000 loan is not paid off yet—we retained the 10,000 shares for the £12,000 loan, and we also retained them for the £6,000 loan after—the other was paid—the 10,000 shares were retained in the case of each loan, and never parted with—it was not likely that we should notice that 2,000 of the 10,000 shares were duplicates; not suspecting anything, we should not look to see—it never entered our heads to look at the numbers—it had never happened to us before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The first loan was £10,000, on a deposit of 20,000 shares, in May, 1895—it seems by this memorandum that £9,000 Was repaid, leaving a balance of £1,000—originally I think the whole £10,000 was paid off—our accountant, Mr. Rawlins, will tell you—it has all been discharged now; but in September, 1895, £1,000 was outstanding on that loan, according to my memorandum—on September 25th, 1895, we made a fresh loan of £12,000 on what amounted to be a re<lb/>deposit of those 20,000 shares, because they remained in our hands, among other securities—I think the whole £10,000, the first loan, was paid off at maturity on October 15th, 1895—I do not think that by September 28th £22,000 had been advanced—the loan of £10,000 was paid off—a fresh loan of £12,000 was made on the remaining part of the 20,000 shares—£4,000 of that was repaid in December, 1895, and the balance of £8,00 remained owing down to November, 1896, the date of the loan of £6,000—£6,000 is now due—the shares deposited in September, 1895, for the loan of £12,000 remained with us down to November, 1896, as security for £6,000—there were a great many alterations down to November 24th</p>

               <p>capital—it was to have an available working capital of not less than £30,000; that was the agreement with the Australian vendor—the subscrip<lb/>tions which came in were very small—the directors, including Mr. Doolette, negotiated for some time, and eventually arranged for a loan from Brown Janson of £10,000—I carried that out with Brown Janson—the £10,000 went to pay part of the purchase money to the Australian vendor—Arthur Kirby went to Stonham and Messenger, who had the right to call on 50,000 shares in the company at 17s. per share—by means of that option, the £10,000 was repeated to Brown Janson, and the whole £20,000 was paid to the Australian vendor, and, by a second option, the full £20,000 was provided for working capital—the vendor required £30,000, so that, in the end, the £30,000 was provided by the sale of vendor's shares—everybody interested in the company knew perfectly well of the loans—Stonham and Messenger exercised their right of call, and with the proceeds of that exercise Brown, Janson and Co. were paid off—when that was completed I gave up my active interest in the affairs of the company—this transfer is the last one I initialled; it is dated April 22nd, 1896; I initialled it on May 2nd, 1896—when I left, every<lb/>thing was in order; most of the transfers were intialled by Clifford as accurate; he had been in the habit of initialling them up to that time—from the date of his appointment he attended the board meetings; he was responsible for the minutes—three directors were always responsible for those transfers as well as myself—the further duplication did not come under my notice till the company went into liquidation—I was consulted by Sir Alfred Kirby professionally about it, after this prosecution was started, when I learned the number—at that time the shares were de<lb/>livered to Stonham and Messenger—all the shares had distinct numbers—they did not have a number of transfers with the numbers of shares on them; they simply had the right of call; they never had blank transfers given to them to hold—there is no more difficulty in keeping the account than of keeping an account of £ s. d.—if Stonham and Messenger ex<lb/>ercised their right they simply sent down the number of shares required, and the company's officer would fill in the transfers, indicating the shares—I believe there was one case for a small amount in which they had a blank transfer, with regard to the number of shares transferred by them; the transfers coming forward contained the name of the transferee, and the company would add the name of the transferor, and the distinct numbers of the shares—this document (102) shows that 3,140 shares were duplicated; I thought it was a mistake—the 6,748 shares mentioned would be available for the purpose of rectifying the 3,140 duplicated shares—I do not think there were 6,748 after allowing for the duplication.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">W. J. BRADLEY</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re<lb/>called</hi>). The only transfers I ever asked Arthur Kirby for were for the purpose of loans made by Brown, Janson and Co.—I never knew of any other duplications than the ones I mentioned before, and if they are examined they will be found to be correct—I never asked Arthur Kirby to sign one duplicated transfer—I am quite prepared to take the responsibility of the preparation of the affidavit of September 15th, 1896, if I did so, and if I did not it was prepared by one of our clerks—it was prepared upon instructions, and I can find out by whose instructions—the only transaction in which I was mixed up in reference to shares in this company was for the benefit of the company, and not in the transac<lb/>tion which related to the loan to Sir Alfred Kirby or Arthur Kirby—I never had anything to do with that—my only interest was to look after the company, and see that the money required was provided—it is absolutely untrue to say that I knew of the duplication of the 3,000 shares—when I did ascertain it I understood that Mr. Lakeman, the accountant, would have all those shares put straight—they were put straight, and I never heard any more of anything being wrong till after the liquidation—I had nothing to do with transfers after the last one that I initialled—I was never present at any board meeting when any transfer was passed—I only attended to business which concerned me—my impression is that transfers were always taken at the end of the meetings, and I left before the transfers were touched—if I had had the least suspicion of the duplication I should have told the directors immediately, and had all the books examined—I have no recollection of saying in the British Tea Table Company's refreshment room that the contents of exhibit 102 should not be communicated to the directors, as it would only cause a bother, and the matter would right itself—the only time Clifford said he wanted to leave the company was after the liquidation, when he said he could not get his salary paid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ELLIOTT</hi>. I did not tell the directors of the duplication of the 3,140 shares which I knew of—the accountant said it was a mistake, and that he had put it right—I do not know now that it has not been put right—I do not know that duplicated shares passed to Stonham and Messenger—I did not have an office of my own at the offices of the com<lb/>pany—Sir Alfred Kirby put a desk at my disposal in his room; I did not frequently work at that desk—I do not know that I spoke to Mr. Wace more than 20 times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I did not mention the duplication which I knew of, because I thought it was only a clerical error, and had been put right—every transfer I had to do with I initialled, and I think I am right in saying that every transfer is correct—the last transfer I initialled was in April, 1896.</p>

About 7 p.m. on May 23rd the prosecutor came to the station, accompanied by the boy Smith—he was bleeding from cuts in the face, appeared very dazed, and his hand was much swollen—in consequence of what he told me, and the lad's description answering to what I knew of the prisoner, I arrested him in Gravel Lane about 7.30—he said. "What is this for, Mr. Smith?"—I said, "I arrest you for violently assaulting a man and robbing him in Peter Street"—he said, "That is right; I suppose someone has put you up to this. I did not have no watch"—I instructed the officer Pusey to hold his hand—I found he was feeling down to his pocket, and I felt the watch in the pocket—he jumped in the air and struck Pusey behind the ear—I closed with him, and then commenced a struggle—in the struggle I tore his trousers and pulled the watch out of the hole in his pocket which had the watch in it—I blew my whistle for assistance, and three officers came—he was very violent, and showed none of his present emotion—I saw no signs of intoxication.</p>

I am a furniture dealer, of 150, Lower Mortlake Road, Richmond, opposite Mrs. Wise—on May 20th, about 6.20 p.m., I was sitting in my shop—my attention was drawn by the screams of the children in Wise's coffee-house—I ran over to the house, and found the prisoner kneeling on Mrs. Wise, under the kitchen table, with a knife in his hand, trying to cut her throat—I tried to pull him off, but he was too heavy, and I got a chair and hit him across the back with it—I could not shift him, and I went out and called for help—somebody came in, and he was eventually got off—Mrs. Wise walked out of the house, streaming with blood—the poker was lying underneath them—we shut the prisoner into the room until the police came—he did not say anything during that time to me—when I first went in I said to the prisoner, "What are you doing, you scamp?"—he only glared round at me.</p>
