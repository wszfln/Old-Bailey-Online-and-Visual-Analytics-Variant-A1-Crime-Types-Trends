                  </hi>. I am managing foreman to Messrs. Batey and Co. The prisoner is one of our travellers—he goes out with a van—he starts every morning with a van full of stock, which it is his duty to take to our customers, and to receive payment, and to hand the cashier the money which he has taken for the bottles sold—on Friday, May 27th, he took out goods to the value of £35 1s. 6d.—he is on round No. 69, which includes Earlsfield and Wandsworth. He brought back goods to the value of £7 0s. 1d.—if goods are sold from the van on credit, the customers give to him in return a voucher signed by them—he gave us no vouchers or money—I saw him in the paying-office, and thought he was in a semi-state of drunkenness—afterwards I thought he was shamming—he had to account for goods to the amount of £28 1s. 5d.—I did not see him taken off the van—I felt his clothes and found no money, but 2s. or. 3s. dropped on the floor when he was being carried in—I saw the strap of his satchel round his neck—it was cut (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I went to the police-station and made a communication to the inspector, and when I came back I had him locked in the paying-room office, and gave some instructions to the yardman, and went to his district to try and get some information—I did not return to the yard that night—I saw him next morning about seven o'clock, and asked him about the money—he said, "What money?"—I said, "The money you took yester-day"—he said, "I have not got any"—I said, "You have taken about £28, have you taken any vouchers?"—he said "No"—I said, "So you have actually taken it in hard cash?"—he said, "Yes, that is it"—I asked him how he lost the money, and he said a man asked him to have a dink, which he did, after which he could remember nothing—that was the only explanation he gave—I gave him into custody—no other van man goes that round.</p>

"February 10th, 1898. Dear Sir,—Your letter to hand. I have been ill. Everything is all right. I will call and see you on Monday morning. <hi rend="smallCaps">S. F.

(<hi rend="italic">Two other letters and two telegrams from the prisoner to the witness were read, promising to call on different dates.</hi>) I gave "Mr. Metcalf instructions to prepare a goodwill, and on January 18th the prisoner called on me with the deed, and asked me for £3 10s. for pre<lb/>paring it, and £1 1s. for Mr. Metcalf's charges, and I paid him £1 4s. 10d.—he said that as I had not an account with Mr. Metcalf it would be better for me to pay it.</p>

I am a Prussian subject, and have been a lieutenant in the Prussian Army—I am now in the Reserve—my father died this year; he had property in Prussia—I was dependent upon his allowance up to 1896—I knew Herz in Berlin—I was staying here in 1896 at the Hotel Berkeley, and had some dispute with my father about my expenses—I was dining at the Berkeley in July, and Herz came in—I gave him three rings to pawn for me, and he came back with £130, and said that it was the money he got for me, and gave me a receipt similar to this. (<hi rend="italic">A contract note for</hi> £130, <hi rend="italic">dated July</hi> 29, <hi rend="italic">for a diamond, a pearl, and an emerald ring. Signed, st. Herz</hi>, 55, <hi rend="italic">Bernard Street., Eumll Square.</hi>)—I was staying with a lady there, and gave the ticket to her—some time afterwards I wanted more money, and handed Herz more jewellery, a cigarette-case, a pin-box, a long chain, a scarf and other articles, and asked him to pawn them with the same pawnbroker—I wanted them put on the same receipt, but could not find it—he went away with them, and came back and said that it was too late to pawn them with a pawnbroker, and he had left the jewellery with a friend of his, and brought me £30 or £40—soon after that I left for the Conti<lb/>nent, taking with me Webb as valet, who sometimes acted as my secre<lb/>tary—in September, 1896, I was in Paris, and instructed Webb to write to his brother-in-law about the jewellery, and I also wrote to Herz, as Webb told me that flerz wanted a letter from me—my letter was that he should hand over to Stevens the receipt for the jewellery which he hid pawned for £170—I received no answer from Herz—I was then ordered to Italy by a doctor—I was in communication with my solicitor in refer<lb/>ence to the matter in 1897, and was asked to come over to give evidence, but was forbidden to travel—I came afterwards—I always paid Herz for his services—I have never received the jewellery back.</p>

               <p>jewellery and Herz—I went to find Herz, but he was out; I found him at the Cafe Monico, and old him I had received instructions from Mr. Marmdorf—he said that there were no pawn-tickets or receipts, he had pawned them with a friend, and if I would give him the money he would bring them, and that £170 was required—that was about the last day of September—I made an appointment to meet him next day at Frascati's, and took with me this crossed cheque for £160 in favour of Herz—I asked him for a receipt, and gave him £10, making £170—we went to the Post Office, and I saw him write this receipt: "Received from Mr. Stevens £170 to take the things out for Mr. Marmdorf: R. Herz, 55, Bernard Street"—he said that his German bankers would not cash the cheque, and I accompanied him to the bank, initialled the cheque, received the money, and paid him in notes and gold—he said that he was going to his club friend, and would bring back the jewellery—he did not name his friend then, but he afterwards said Fred Arnold—he brought back some jewellery, but not the three rings—he said that Mr. Arnold was out of town, and on the Monday he would accompany Mrs. Arnold to get them out of the Chancery Lane Safe, where they were locked up—I wrote to him and received this reply from him—(<hi rend="italic">Dated October</hi> 27<hi rend="italic">th. Stating that he had written to Mr. Arnold, who would positively hand over the jewellery on October 2nd. Signed "R.

I have to go to Nottingham, and when I come back I will get the goods"—(<hi rend="italic">Another letter stated</hi>: "I have seen Mr. Arnold, and have given him to the end of the week.

Hoare &amp; Co, 11, Billiter Square, E. C."—the parcel ought not to have been on Curtice's van, but was to be delivered by our own van—from inquiries at West Sraithfield I went to Blackfriars Bridge Station, and found Fisher and Thompson—I said, "You are Curtice &amp; Son?"—Fisher said, "Yes, sir"—I said, "You have been to Spencer, Turner and Boldero's to-day for a load?"—Fisher said, "Yes, these are some of the goods on my van now"—I had asked a policeman to go with me—I said, "L shall have to take you to the Police-station"—the policeman arrested Fisher end thompson.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in charge of the engrossing and lithograph<lb/>ing Department of Skipper and East, Great Tower Street—they engrave notes for the National Bank of the South African Republic—these two copper-plates are available for producing a water mark similar to that of the £10 notes of the South African Republic, but it would be an imperfect resemblance—the process on these two sheets of paper is one by which a bank-note can be photographed on a plate, and that plate afterwards used for engraving—two of these impressions appear to have been made from the plate—this paper could be reduced to the thinness of bank<lb/>note paper by what we call calendering.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That is a process to make the water-mark, and it represents it very nearly, but it is not as it would be done by a profes<lb/>sional engraver—the water-mark is larger than that on the original note, but you must make an allowance for shrinkage, because it is printed wet—this is on glazed paper and very hard—it is evidently intended for printing from copper plates—I should call it a fairly good printing paper</p>

               <p>—it is not a bank-note paper—the whole of this work is more like that of an amateur than of a skilled engraver,—the photographic process on these papers are to be found printed in Mr. Herbert's book, and refer to any kind of reproduction.</p>

O."—I sent a reply and a sample—I received another letter on 13th, headed in the same way, to which I replied, and on 15th I received an order to deliver to bearer three pairs of tyres, and stating that they would want fifty pairs—I received the letter of 19th ordering fifty pairs—we delivered six pairs to a man who signed our book in the name of Dawson—the value was £1 12s. £4 12s. was the amount of the next consignment, and £9 12s. a third, the total being £15 16s., including pumps—we have never been paid—three of these are our pumps that we supplied.</p>

I am the wife of Thomas White, and live on the second floor at 6, Carlisle Street, Lisson Grove—the prisoner lived there on the ground floor, and took in washing—she had a little shop there—I knew the deceased as a neighbour; she was engaged by the prisoner to do washing, and she had washed for the prisoner up to about mid-day on June 9th, when the prisoner discharged her—on that afternoon, about 2.30., I was in the Cornish Arms with the deceased—the prisoner came in, and said to me, "I can fight you"—I did not speak to her; I was too frightened—she took no notice of the deceased—the barman came into the compartment and put her out of the public-house—she went to the next compartment, and was talking: I could not tell you her words; I was too frightened to listen—I think she addressed her words to me; she took no notice of the deceased—the barman and the manager of the house came to that bar and put her out</p>

I live at 6, Manning Place, Marylebone, and am a labourer—the deceased was my wife—on June 9th I last saw my wife alive at 6 p.m. at the front of No. 6, Manning Place, where we lived—I went upstairs to get my tea, as I had just come from work—she stood at the door—after having my tea I went into the yard and then had a wash and came back into the yard again, and after that I stopped there till about 8.5, and then I went to the barber's shop to get shaved—as I was coming out of the barber's shop I met Clancy—he spoke to me, and in consequence I went to 6, Carlisle Street with Clancy—in the passage I found my wife unconscious, lying with her head towards the street<lb/>door—a policeman came shortly afterwards, and my wife was taken to the hospital—I had not assaulted, kicked, or done anything to my wife in the way of violence on that afternoon or evening—the first time I went to 6, Carlisle Street I found her lying in the passage.</p>

When I paid her her money I heard her and her husband having a row in the passage, and I heard him kick her. She has been drinking with the woman upstairs all day"—I had made no accusation against her when she made that statement—I took her to the Police-station—after<lb/>wards I returned to the room, and behind the same door where I had found the prisoner I found this polishing-iron—I handed it to Inspector Allison in the same condition in which I found it—when I found the prisoner in the room on the ground floor I saw no one else there—I searched both rooms—I saw nothing of the prisoner's husband in the room at the time.</p>

We came in, shut the door, and locked it again. I got nothing to say regarding the woman's death. I did not strike her, and did not cause that woman's death, Dorothy Dickinson"—I received this polishing iron from Cull, and handed it to Dr. James.</p>

I am a laundress, and employ people to work for me. Mrs. Murphy was employed by me to wash and iron. On Thursday, June 9th, she came in at nine o'clock in the morning to work. Everything went well until the woman White came downstairs and kicked up a bother, and would not keep out of the washhouse. I told Mrs. White to go out of the washhouse, and she would not do so. She made a terrible noise and bother, and called me foul names. I told Mrs. Murphy to go, and I would pay her her money. It was then twelve o'clock. She did not attempt to go. I said, 'Mrs. White does not like your being here.' Murphy said, 'Very well,' and went and got her shawl. I paid Murphy, and told her to come in the morning. In the afternoon, about three o'clock, I went to get half a pint of ale, and on going to the Cornish Arms public-house I saw Mrs. White and Mrs. Murphy there. I then went home. They afterwards came to the house and caused a crowd to collect. This was at five o'clock. Mrs. White and Mrs. Murphy came into the passage. I went into my room and locked the door. About eight or a little after my husband came in. He said to me, 'What's the matter?' I said, 'I do not know.' He had not been in more than ten minutes, when there was such a kicking and screaming in the passage violently. Mr. Dickinson began to cry, and I told him not to make me worse with them than I was. I was ironing in my room, and I had to stop my work. Then out came, the man White swearing and holloaing in the back yard, and washing his hands. I opened the window of my room, and asked bin what was the matter, and he said, 'Look at Mrs. Murphy, look at her now. She was not like that a little while ago.' I shut the window, and then there came a knocking at the door. Mr. Dickinson said, 'Don't open it.' I said, 'Open it and see what's the matter; there's something wrong here.' Mr. Dickinson opened the door, and I looked past him, and I saw Mr. Murphy standing leaning on the banisters, and his wife Julia Murphy was lying on the floor with her head on the bottom step. I said to my husband, 'There's a woman there drunk,' and he pushed me in and locked the door. I opened the door again and looked. Still Mrs. Murphy was lying on the ground, and still Mr. Murphy was standing, and I then walked down the passage and opened the street-door, and I called a policeman, and he came in. I then went into my room, and locked it again. A knocking came at my door. I did not at first open it, thinking it was the people outside. When I opened it a policeman was there, and he took hold of me, and said, 'I am going to take you into custody for causing this woman's death.' Then I</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at St. Mary's Hospital—on June 9th, about 9.5 p.m., deceased was brought to the hospital—she was dead—on June 11th I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination under the Coroner's order—the superficial injuries I found were an abrasion at the right angle of the mouth, an abrasion over the bridge of the nose, an abrasion below and outside the right eye, an abrasion on the forehead, and a contused and lacerated wound at the outer angle of the right eyebrow; on the temple a small contusion—the skin was broken—this polishing iron might have occasioned that contusion; it is consistent with its having been occasioned by it—I should say it was a fairly severe blow; it would require some force—the contusion was the gravest of the external injuries—the others were more or less superficial and are con<lb/>sistent with having been caused by a fall—I opened the skull—there was no fracture of the skull and no injury to the brain, it was normal—con<lb/>tinuing my examination I found that the spine in the neck had been broken in two places, one about an inch above the other—the piece of the spine broken out was wedge shape, the base of the wedge being forward—I think death was due either to such a severe concussion of the spine in that region or to the temporary pressure on the spinal cord leading to arrest of breathing—I think the injury to the spine caused the death—the injury over the right eyebrow would have occasioned the fracture of the spine in that woman, and so the death—her spine was quite peculiar, the bones of it being welded together as the result of spinal disease—in places the bones of the spine had become absorbed, pro<lb/>ducing a thin, rigid, and brittle spine, and the forcing of the head back<lb/>wards, by means of violence in front, towards the spine would have caused the peculiar fracture of that spine as I saw it—I should say the force of the blow came from the front—having regard to the peculiarity of the spine one blow would have been sufficient to cause death—in my opinion if this had been a normal spine death would not have ensued on such a blow—the rigid and diseased condition of the spine was a contributing cause to her death.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Anchylosis is the medical phrase for such a condition of the spine—I would hardly say that very slight violence indeed would cause the fracture of a spine in such a condition—I believe a case is recorded of a lunatic throwing back his head to avoid food being given him, and fracturing such a spine—it would not require much force to cause such a fracture, having regard to this woman's spine—the deceased weighed about ten or eleven stone—I can only say the skin over the eyebrow was parted—it is possible that if she fell on the edge of one of the stairs the injury would be caused—the superficial injuries on the face were all on the right side except the one over the bridge of the nose, which was central—they were all on the same side as the wound on the forehead—in my opinion those abrasions at the side of the face were the result of a fall, not the result of direct violence in any way—it is possible that fracture of the vertebrae of the spine would not cause immediate death, but that the person might have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189807250051"/>
               <p>got up, or moved and fallen—I don't think the bruises on the back of the head had anything to do with the cause of death—I could not say whether that might not cause one of the fractures—it is fair to say that with the spine in that condition, with marks of violence about the face and head it is impossible to say whether direct or indirect violence caused the death.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> All the superficial injuries were consistent with having been caused by a fall, including the injury on the back of the head—they were all on the right side—I think it is very improbable after such an injury as the fracture of the spine that the woman could have got up and fallen a second time.</p>

I was living as a barmaid at the Railway Tavern, Three Colt Street, Limehouse, with my aunt, the late Mrs. Truett—her husband's name was George Truett—he was in bad health, and on May 28th and for a little time before that he was living at Elstone, near Bedford, and my aunt, Augusta Caroline Tniett, was left in charge of the public-house—I assisted her in the business—the prisoner is George Truett's brother—about a fortnight or ten days before May 23rd I saw the prisoner at the public-house—he asked to see my aunt, but he did not see her at that time—he called twice that day, but saw her the second time—I heard no conversation between them—I did not see the prisoner between then and May 23rd—this telegram was delivered on May 14th at the public-house—a prepaid form of reply accompanied it; no reply was sent—on the afternoon of May 23rd I was in the house—it was my aunt's custom in the afternoon to take a rest; she left the bar about two—at the back of the bar there is a bar-parlour, with a couch—the door at the back of the bar-parlour opens into the kitchen—it is possible to get into the kitchen from the street—in the counter there is the usual counter-flap—by lifting that up a person can go from the public-house side into the bar, and then into the bar-parlour—on that afternoon my aunt went and laid down on the couch; I was left looking after the business—about three o'clock the prisoner came into one of the compartments, and I served him with some ale—he asked if Mrs. Truett was at home—I said "No, she is not"—I thought he was referring to his own wife—he then walked round to the kitchen door—I went into the bar-parlour—my aunt was asleep; I woke her—I had some conversation with her, and then locked the door com<lb/>municating</p>

I am a solicitor, of 85, Gracechurch Street—I was one of the executors of the will of Robert Truett, the prisoner's father; he died early in this year, and his estate then had to be realised and divided equally between his three sons, Charles, James, and George; after the will had gone to probate the estate was equally divided between them, and each was paid his fair share—there was a proper deed of re<lb/>lease, a proper set of accounts got out, and each of the residuary legatees signed the accounts, and each executed the deed of release and were satisfied with respect to the executors—accounts vouching that were found on the prisoner—these are the receipts, showing that each has been paid—I cannot see any reason he had to complain of an unequal division of his father's property—he never complained of the executors—there was always something peculiar about him, a sort of dissatisfaction with every<lb/>body and everything—I don't believe he thought the executors were doing him justice, but he never told me so—I always looked upon him as an intagonistic client; I never looked upon him as sympathetic; if be could have found fault with me he would have done so, I think.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Laurel Villas, Felixstowe Road, Lower Edmonton—I am the prisoner's son-in-law—on May 23rd, 1897, when the prisoner's father died, the prisoner was living with us; he came and told us on the following day of the death, and said his father died hard, and tad a very rough time of it—the same night I went and sat up</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189807250056"/>
               <p>in the bedroom with him till he went to sleep because he was so upset—I do not know that he mentioned that he saw anything in the corner of the room—I remember he said he could see his father in the corner of the room—he was in a very nervous state, and I tried to cheer him up—I had to keep his hand in mine till he fell asleep—for a week he continued to talk about it, and it seemed to affect him a lot—he said his father had left £600 in the safe for him, and that the deceased and a Mrs. Roberts had carried it downstairs—he was every day saying we were poisoning him, and that there was stuff being pat in his food—sometimes when I came home from work and did not feel as though I wanted any supper the prisoner would not have any supper, so just to satisfy him I used to eat something, to show there was nothing the matter with it—he said there was someone in London sending down people to get him out of the way—he was not drinking when he said those things, so far as I know—his wife said I should have to bring in a doctor to him—he said, "You bring in a doctor here, and I will throw him out, and you after him"—he was continually taking linseed oil and Epsom salts to make him vomit—he used to go into the garden and try to be sick after his meals and before, because he said we were all ad<lb/>ministering something to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This vomiting was a week or two after his father's death—everything I have been speaking of dates from his father's death—he had been rather strange before, but that was when he had been drinking—he drank very heavily at one time, on and of: sometimes he would keep himself right, and then he would go on again, perhaps for a week or a fortnight—I 'believe he gave it up—I could tell whether he had been in drink by the expression of his face, and he kept indoors of late—the latter part of his time with us he did not drink—I had him under my observation when I was at home, and my wife said he had not been out all day—before his father's death be gave up drink; I don't think he has broken out since: only once, in April this year, I fancy—he only came home drunk once; I spoke to him about it afterwards—it was only one day; next morning he said he was very sorry—I did not see him the worse for drink after that—I was not living with him in April—he left us on April 4th, I think, and did not come back any more—I do not know if he was drinking to excess in May just before he committed this offence—I did not see him—he had been away then—I had not seen him after April.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I am a teetotaller—from the time of his father's death I think he was only under the influence of drink on one day—when he was sober he made the statements about persons following him, and about his food, and so on.</p>

                  </hi>. I have no occupation; I am twenty<lb/>eight years old—my father is the Rector of Holywell, near St. Ives, in Huntingdonshire—I came to London some years ago, and was articled to a solicitor, living upon an allowance from my father—in 1893 I made Honour's acquaintance—he was then carrying on business as a money<lb/>lender at 26, Moorgate Street, in the name of William Dent, and also at Canonbury Villas, in the name of William Shakespeare—I borrowed small sums from him, giving him as security my bills or promissory notes—about July, 1894, he alleged about £40 was due from me—I then re<lb/>quired a further small advance, and on my applying for it he suggested I should sign a bill in my mother's name—I objected to it at first—he told me it would never be shown to any one; it would never be known—upon that I signed in Honour's presence my mother's name, R. Norgate, on two bills of exchange for £25 each, I think, or £30 each, I cannot remem<lb/>ber—I got for them some of my old overdue promissory notes back, and some small sums of money—between that date and the end of 1894 I had other transactions with him of a similar nature, obtaining a small sum of money and giving him a bill signed in the name of my mother or father—they were all signed in his presence in 1894—about Christmas, 1894, he was threatening some proceedings against me on those bills, and it being pressed, I telegraphed this message addressed to Milton 131, Jermyn Street, "Writing you to-night; do nothing until you have had letter"—I followed that by this letter dated December 27th, written from Holywell Rectory—<hi rend="italic">-(Stating that he would catt on Monday, as he wished to arrange about the last documents and redeem them, and a cheque and pawn-tickets; that he had wired that afternoon, an he was particularly anxious that his mother should not know about the form the bills were in, and hoped that Milton would not write to her</hi>)—on January 7th, 1895, Hon<lb/>our commenced an action in the Mayor's Court, London, against my father and myself on one of the bills for £20—my father spoke to me about the matter—my mother came to London, and we went to Honours office in Moorgate Street—in my presence my mother paid Honour £20—subsequently she paid him a further sum of £60 at Canonbury Villas (where he lived) to settle this action, and all claims that he had at that time—his clerk handed her the bills I had signed in her and my father's names—my mother told him at Moorgate Street that she had not signed</p>

Norgate—I had mentioned to him in December, 1894, that I had a reversionary interest contingent on my surviving my father and mother—I paid the February and March instalments of £4; when the third month's became due I was unable to pay it—Honour then suggested I should ensure my life for £200, and he would take the policy, and pay the premiums, in substitution of the promissory note—I told him I could not pass the doctor for an insurance—I was suffering from disease at that time—he told me I could be insured for £200 without medical examination—he gave me some pamphlets on life insurance without medical examination; of the Caledonian office, I think—I was introduced to Monson at Honour's office in the name of Wyvill—I first met him at Honour's about that time—I had several interviews with Honour about the policy—he told me in Monson's presence that Wyvill was a partner in Lumley and Co., insurance agents in Shaftesbury Avenue, when he introduced us—soon after Honour introduced me to Metcalfe at Honour's Jermyn Street office—he told me Metcalfe was trading as Lumley and Co., of Shaftesbury Avenue, and he would arrange the policy—either that day or soon after, at Honour's office, I think, Metcalfe produced a form of proposal—I do not remember on what office it was—I fancy Metcalfe filled up the form from particulars I gave him, and I signed it—it was a proposal for £200—that was about the beginning of April, 1896, before April 9th—Metcalfe took the form away, and I have not seen it since—that was the only form of proposal I ever signed or saw—about that time I wrote out this draft assignment of a policy for £200—Monson had a book on life insurances, with forms in it, I think, and he handed it to Honour in my presence, and Honour handed it to me, and pointed out this particular form, and told me to draft an assignment of a policy from it, and I wrote out this draft—the date was left for some blank day in April, 1896—I saw Metcalfe soon afterwards in the neighbourhood of Honour's office—he told me he had arranged the policy, and that he should want me to endorse the cheque for the premium which. Honour was going to give him, and to assign the policy to Honour when they got it—a day or two afterwards I met Metcalfe again at Daish's restaurant, in the Haymarket; he produced this cheque for £27 on the Capital and Counties Bank, signed by Urbanowski and Co.—I endorsed it—I said it was a large premium for an insurance for £200—he said it was owing to my not having been medically examined they charged a bigger price, and that he was getting a commission out of it and</p>

               <p>he would share it with me and Monson—later that day I met Metcalfe and Monson at the Victoria Hotel, Panton Street, and we had lunch together—Monson paid for it—he had some gold in his hand at the time; I could not say the amount—he gave me £3 and Metcalfe £3 from the £10 commission—Metcalfe told me to go to Honour's office, and later that afternoon I went there by myself for the purpose of assigning the policy—I saw Honour and his clerk, Winters—some blank forms of assignment were produced; I had to sign one, and I signed this. with my ordinary signature; it was then in blank—the £1,000 was not in it then—when I had signed it Honour told me the signature would not do, and he gave me this, a slip of paper, with my name, Percival Edward Norgate, written on it in someone else's writing; I did not know whose writing it was—Honour told me I must sign an assignment in that writing—I then signed some more blank forms of assignments; this is one—I made an attempt to imitate this writing—Honour said it was no good; it was too much like my own signature, and he suggested that I should practise the writing on the piece of paper, and for that purpose I took it away—I never after that date ever signed any other form of assign-ment; Honour asked me several times to do it, but I never did—I do not remember whether Winters attested my signature or not—I kept the piece, of paper until July or August this year, when I handed it to Mr. Sydney, a solicitor, of New Inn Chambers, Wych Street, who was acting for me at the time—on the day I signed the assignment form Monson gave me this, form of private friend's report, and told me to get James Winters, Honour's clerk, to fill it up as a reference for me; and Winters in my presence filled it up and handed it to me—I kept it—I was to have given it hack to Monson, but I did not see him—I afterwards handed it to Mr. Sydney, with the slip of paper—I don't think Winters asked me any thing; when filling up the report—as to the question and answer, "Are his habits in every respect strictly regular and temperate, and have they always been? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, as far as I know "; that was not a fact; Winters knew differently—some time after I saw Monson, and said that Winters had filled up the private friend's report, I had not got it in my pocket, should I send it to him—he said it did not matter, that they had sent in another—subsequently, in November, at the office of the Norwich. Union Assurance Company, I saw these two private friend's reports—one is signed "Fred. Perceval, Sherwood's Hotel, Adam Street, Adelphi," and the other "James Winters, Moorgate Street"—the signature, "James Winters" is not in Winters's writing, which I know—I believe, it to be in Monson's writing—I have seen him write—I do not know anyone named Fred. Perceval—the signature on this proposal form, which was sent to the insurance office, "Percival Edward Norgate," was not signed by me—it is the same writing as that on the slip of paper handed to me by Honour—I never authorised anyone to fill in a proposal form. like this for £1,000—I don't know anything about it—I did not, on April 23rd, 1896, go before Dr. Hastings Stewart, or any other doctor, for the purpose of being examined—I did not sign this paper, which purports to be a doctor's medical report on Percival Edward Norgate—the signature is in the same writing as that on the slip of paper—in July, 1896, I had not paid any further instalments off the promissory</p>

E. Norgate, to receive my husband's bills in exchange for my promissory note for £120, which I have given him to hand you. Yours truly, B.

               <p>—I cannot tell whether in the interval Monson received instructions from Winters to fill up another document—I may have filled in myself the pro<lb/>poeal form for £200; I have not seen it since Metcalfe had it—I don't think I filled up the names of two friends; I don't believe I filled up much more than my age and the ages of my brothers, sisters, and parents; just the formal part—Monson told me to get a private friend's report filled up by Winters, and I did so—I never heard of the name of Perceval till I went to the company; I did not fill in that name and the address "Sherwood's Hotel"—I do not know a Mr. Perceval; I have never seen him, to my knowledge; he has never been pointed out to me—I saw Winters at the Police-court; he did not give evidence there—I subse-quently saw Monson, and told him Honour had given me the slip of paper—I do not know who had anything to do with the personation and who had not—I did not see the amount of money that was divided at the hotel afterwards—I understood the amount of the commission was £10—I have since seen the cheque for £6 10s.—I don't know what money Monson had out of it; he had some, in his hand—Mr. Sydney told me that at some time in 1896, about September or October, Monson went to him—about September Mr. Sydney would have known of the personation—Monson knew Mr. Sydney was acting for me—in 1897 I was anxious that the whole matter should be settled—I did not know any of the Hobsons—I knew one by sight—I may have seen them, but not that I am aware of—Honour, Bentley and I talked it over together, and we were all trying to settle it, I think, and it resulted in the settlement in 1898, partly through Bentley, I suppose—Monson saw Mr. Scudamore, my mother's solicitor, about it—I don't know on whose behalf he saw him—that was two or three days before the visit to St. Ives—he was then try<lb/>ing to settle matters—I went to the company and saw the manager in December, and they knew all about the personation then, because I told them; every one knew it—the company brought their action in July, 1897—it was believed that a young Hobson had done the personation.</p>

               <p>matter to no one, and I only mentioned it to Mr. Frayling because he was a personal friend of mine just before I went to the West Indies for my health—we had taken steps to have the policy quashed in the Chancery Court—the first I knew of a writ being issued was when I saw it in a newspaper in Barbados, about October, 1897; I was away for seven months, from May till December, 1897—I had been to the Highlands, and came back and spoke to Mr. Frayling, about July, before I went to the Barbados.</p>

I now practise at Albany Courtyard, Piccadilly—on April 23rd, 1896, Metcalfe called to arrange for the examination of an applicant for insurance in the Norwich Union Office, and gave the name of Norgate as that of the applicant—I made an appointment for the same day, and the same day a person calling himself Percival Edward Norgate came to be examined—I think he came alone, I am not certain—I put to him the questions, and took down his answers on this form, and he filled it up in my presence, Percival Edward Norgate—I then medically examined the person—he appeared to be sound—I made this report to the insurance office, report<lb/>ing that he was a healthy person, and insurable at the ordinary rates—that person was not the witness, Percival Norgate; it was some one quite different—I did not hear any more of the matter till an appoint<lb/>ment was made for me to meet some one at Mr. Enmett's office, a few days before November 3rd—on November 3rd I saw Norgate at the office, and saw he was not the same person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Mr. Morrison, manager of the Westminster Branch of the Norwich Union life Office—I saw Met<lb/>calfe at my office in April, 1896—about April 24th I received from him this proposal to ensure the life of Percival Edward Norgate for £2,000, which was altered to £1,000—the name of Lumley and Co, appears at the head of the front page as the name of the agent introducing the pro<lb/>posal—it was signed Percival Edward Norgate—by Mr. Morrison's in<lb/>structions I authorised a clerk to hand some private friends' reports to Metcalfe, and two of them were brought to the office filled in as they now appear in the names of Winters and Percival, by Metcalfe I believe—on: April 20th I saw Metcalfe at the office—he said a lady had an interest in the policy which was being taken out on Norgate's life, and asked me to write a letter to the lady, whose name he gave as Madame Urbanowsky, saying that if the policy were taken out on a certain table it would be world-wide and indisputable—in consequence I wrote this letter of April 27th, and handed it to Metcalfe—(<hi rend="italic">This letter stated that if a policy was taken out under their guaranteed bonus table at a premium of</hi> £30 10s. <hi rend="italic">for</hi> £1,000, <hi rend="italic">it would bean incontestable world-wide insurance.</hi>)—on the next day,</p>

               <p>April 28th, Metcalfe came to the office and paid the premium on this world-wide policy—the premium was £30 10s.—he paid it with this cheque for £27—he was entitled to ten per cent, commission as agent—I gave him credit for £3 10s., the deficiency on the cheque, and handed him a cheque for £6 10s. payable to and endorsed by K. J. Metcalfe or order—a policy was then made out and executed by my office for £1,000 on the life of Percival Edward Norgate—afterwards there was an applica<lb/>tion for an order to lodge the policy in court, and Honour lodged it—this is it—I believe it was given to Metcalfe when it was executed—in paying the commission and giving instructions for the issued policy, I believed it was a genuine proposal form of Percival Edward Norgate, and that the private friends' reports were genuine, and that Percival Edward Norgate had been examined by the doctor—I only saw Monson once at our office, in the beginning of 1897, when be brought a letter from Messrs. Lumley and Co., in Metcalfe's writing, dated January 26th, and waited for an answer—(<hi rend="italic">This stated that he could introduce a case of</hi> £3,000 <hi rend="italic">upon the life of a gentleman, aged fifty-five, but that he must ask for a com<lb/>mission of £2 per</hi> £100 <hi rend="italic">assured, as he had to pay away 30s. per</hi> £100, <hi rend="italic">and could get £'2 in the City; that a proposal form should be given to the bearer, who would see it was filled in and the proposer examined, and also two private friends' reports; that he had told the gentleman to be examined at</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. STEWART'S</hi>, <hi rend="italic">as the most convenient place.</hi>)—I should say the whole of the filling-up on the proposal form signed Percival Edward Norgate, is in Metcalle's writing—in answer to the letter of January 26th, 1897, only a proposal form was handed to Monson; I did not comply with the request to hand out the private friends' reports—I told Monson we should require to see the proposer; that was in consequence of what has come to light about Norgate.</p>

P. Powis—the proposal in the name of Roland Bateman did not go on—the premium was never paid—I never saw Bateman—I believe I saw Powis—I do not know whether application for the premium was made to Madame Urbanowsky—a renewal notice was sent to her by the head-office at Norwich by the clerk.</p>

                  </hi>. I was managing clerk to Mr. Scuda<lb/>more, solicitor, of 79, Gresham Street—in February, 1898, I went with Mrs. Norgate and her son to Honour's office at 139, Jerrayn Street—the Rev. Mr. Norgate went, too, but he waited outside—Mrs. Norgate remained in the front room while Percival Norgate and I inter<lb/>viewed Honour in the back room—I discussed with Honour the question of the settlement of the £120 promissory note—Honour at first asked £300 or £400—there was considerable discussion, and after Mrs. Norgate came into the room he consented to take £150 in cash and a joint and several promissory note for £60, signed by Mr. and Mrs. Norgate—certain docu<lb/>ments were then drawn up, which Mr. and Mrs. Norgate signed; the re<lb/>lease I had drafted and had copied before I left my office, and the other was dictated to me by Honour—he wished to have introduced a release of all liability as affecting himself with regard to the £1,000 policy in the Norwich Union Office, and that I objected to, and I told Mrs. Nor<lb/>gate not to agree, and she accepted that advice and did not agree—I then produced this form of release, which I had already prepared, which Hon<lb/>our signed in my presence and I attested his signature—I asked Honour to let Urbanowsky sign in my presence, but he said it was impossible, and if we left the document he would forward it on—it was left with him and was afterwards forwarded on with this signature—I never saw Urbanowsky—I was managing clerk for some years to Mr. F. C. Sydney, of New Inn Chambers—he was Mr. Honour' solicitor in 1895—I was in his employment for three years or more up to the early part of 1896.</p>

Honour, too!"—I said "Yes"—I had read the name of Honour in the warrant—I then went to 9, Aruudel Street, Haymarket, where a room was pointed out to me as Monson's—with the keys I had taken from Monson at the station I opened a drawer in the room, and took from it papers, and from the room some books and papers—this is one of the books—they have been kept by me since—on that same Saturday evening I went to 131, Jermyn Street, where I found Honour in an office lie occupied on the first floor—I read to him two warrants in which his name was—he said "Who granted the warrants?"—I said "Mr. Lushington"—he said "Who is the prosecutor?"—I said "The Public Prosecutor"—he asked if he might send for Mr. Newton, his solicitor—I said yes—I took him to Vine Street, where he was searched—on him a key was found—I said "Where are the keys of your safe?"—he said "I don't know, perhaps the wife has them"—afterwards he said, "I think they are in the cupboard, of which this is the key"—I went back to Jermyn Street, and the key of the safe was produced to me by Mrs. Honour—opening the safe, I took possession of a quantity of papers and books, some from the safe and some from the cupboard, the key of which I found on Honour—I took those back to the station—when Metcalfe was brought in, about eleven, he said his name was Albert Ives Metcalfe—I asked him if in 1896 he was trading at 146, Shaftesbury Avenue, as Lumley and Co.—he said yes—I read the warrant to him—after that the charge was read over by the uniform inspector on duty to all of them—Monson said "I see"—Honour said, on being asked for his occupation, "I was a money-lender; since couple of months I have given it up; I am buying property now and buildings; I am dealing with house property"—he said his age was forty—on the charge being read over to him, he said to one charge, "This is a lie," and to the other charge, "That is an absolute lie—all lies"—among the papers I took possession of at Honour's office were</p>

Dent, 26, Moorgate Street; and Mr. Shakespeare, Canonbury Villas, and some blank she it of foolscap paper signed at the bottom "Josephine Urbanowsky"—I have known Honour by sight for about two years past—Urbanowsky was a woman I believed to be his servant all along at Jenny Street—I have seen her going in and out as if marketing, and dressed as a servant would be dressed—it was not from her, but from Mrs. Honour that I got the key of the safe—I saw Urbanowsky when I arrested Honour and asked her her name, and she told me she was Josephine Urbanowsky; thatt was not in Honour's presence—I have known Monson about two years by sight, and about one year to speak to—I have seen him enter and leave Honour's office, at 131, Jermyn Street—on October 26th, 1897, he came to me at Vine Street Station and made a statement—at 9, Arundel Street, the address Monson gave, I found exhibits 57, 58, 59, 60 (<hi rend="italic">Letters from Stanley Hobson addressed to Monson</hi>), and a great number of other documents—I have seen Monson write and can identify his writing—I believe exhibit 12 (<hi rend="italic">The private friend's report signed James Winters</hi>) to be in Monson's writing, and I am positive the signature James Winters is—I found among Honour's papers a number connected with the proposed insurance of Powis, including this proposal and this letter addressed to H. H. Powis from the Norwich Union, and signed Bruce Morrison.</p>

I consider I have the right to search the rooms of persons who are in custody, without a search-warrant—I have not got the opinion of the law officers of the Grown nor of Mr. Wontner—it is the custom of myself and my brother officers—I saw Metcalfe several times on the Sunday after his arrest in the cells, and talked to him—he talked about his wife and family, and I allowed him to write a letter to his wife and sent it for him, and he talked about being allowed to have refreshments in the cell—I did not suggest to him that if he made a statement I would put it before the Treasury—there was no conversation about a statement—there was no suggestion that he should assist me, as Norgate was doing—I did not tell him that the Treasury did not want to hit him, but they did want to hit the other two, not a word about it.</p>

Nash;" nothing else—the signature on this agreement, "Bertrand G. Nash," is my writing—all this other writing was not here when I wrote my name on that day, but I recognise that as my writing—the word "secretary" was not there when I wrote it—the seal on that document of the Lydenburg Consolidated Mines was not there when I wrote my name—I did not see that seal put—that is the document I signed at that time—I did not know I signed a document—that that was the only one I signed at that time—this is a duplicate to that agreement, that signature, "Bertrand G. Nash" is my writing, but I do not recollect signing it—it was not done at the same time—I do not know when it was—I did not sign at any other time my name to some document—I cannot tell how my name comes there—I did not know that I was secretary of this company—someone drew their finger cross and told me to write my name there—that was at nine o'clock at night—I got 6d. for it—I did not see who gave me the 6d., it was put on desk in front of me.</p>

                  </hi>. My address is 46, Gray's Inn Road—I know the defendant Lupton; I got employment as a clerk in September, 1895, at a company he was connected with called the African Gold Concessions and Development Company, Limited—on September 12th I was asked to go from the African Gold Concessions to 3, Newman's Court, Cornhill, by Mr. Lupton to act ns clerk to the Lydenburg Consolidated—when I got to Newman's Court I found on the door the name of the company, and in the office of the company some of Lupton's clerks: Frederick William Crick, William Neales, and William James Thomas; they were people I had known before at Lupton's—I took charge of the office—I found there a complete set of books; suitable books for a company, nicely bound and gold-lettered—they were all clean when I went there; there were no entries in any of them; and amont them was a minute-book, bound and lettered like the others—the duties I did when I first went to the office were receiving and giving receipts for transfers—I attended</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189807250089"/>
               <p>the meetings of directors; I am not certain as to the date of the first meeting of directors I attended; it was about a month after I went there—I attended about three meetings—I continued in the service of the company up to December 4th, 1895—I made some entries in the minute-book while I was there—I got the material from one of Lupton's clerks; it was given to me on sheets of foolscap—it had been recently copied; I believe he was copying it from some other material, the ink was wet when I got it—I made entries into the minute-book from these memo-rand a so received; they did not relate to meetings at which I had been present—I was not able to enter the dates of them—I entered up these meetings about the middle of October; they were all entered up at the same time—I remember there was a meeting on September 4th, and some question being raised as to the dates of the meetings—all the directors were present; that was Colonel Lambart, Major Prust, Mr. Coward, and Mr. Stephenson—they wanted to know why the minutes were entered up without dates; I said the meetings had not been held; someone said the meetings had been held, and the result was there was some unpleasant<lb/>ness—I tendered my resignation; at that time I was secretary—at the time I resigned I had got the memoranda from which I had entered up the minutes; they were in the minute-book as well—I gave them to Mr. Thompson, my successor; he was secretary after me—he paid me what was due to me; and gave me a £5 note in addition—I signed some paper when I handed him these foolscap writings—in going away I left behind me not only the memoranda from which I had entered up the minutes, but also the minute-book in which I had made the entries and every other book—during the time I was there there was no allotment of shares; I was given to understand an allotment had been made, from one of Lupton's clerks, I forget which—there appears in the books an allotment of 100,000 shares, split up into five lots of 20,000 each; that was in the books when I was there, 20,000 to James Pope; I believe he was James Arthur Comper; I think he was the same man—William Thomas Wallace was an allottee of another 20,000; he was Walter James Wall, one of the clerks at Lupton's—Comper was clerk to Lupton—George White was another allottee of 20,000 shares—I do not know him—I do not know Cecil Stanley—Harry Valentine is the last, he was myself—that distinguished name is a family name—when I came there transfers came in, and receipts were given for the transfers—certificates for shares were issued—the share ledger was kept there by me—I find that by September 30th 7,569 shares had been sold for £14,780—after September 30th, and up to the date of my leaving, certificates for further shares were issued referring to sales of about £6,000—up to the time I left, during the whole time I was acting there, when the transfers of shares were received and certificates issued, James Pope was in all cases the vendor—this bundle of transfers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) marked No. 11, are the transfers that I received during the time I was secretary—the transfers came in from September 13th down to December 7th—the transfers in this bundle. No. 1 to No. 168, were passed by the directors on October 7th, 1895—October 17th was the first meeting of directors that I was present at—this minute-book was not at the office of the company during the time that I was there—this is not the minute-book I left behind me, and therefore it is not the minute-book that I had</p>

               <p>entered up—the entries go over the time I was there—looking at that minute-book, I see that at a meeting on August 29th, 1895, it is repre<lb/>sented that I was appointed secretary on that date—I may have been appointed, though I was not actually acting as secretary—I know nothing of it—I know nothing of the signatories at the first meeting that was held on August 22nd—I did not come in contact with them in any way—at the meeting which is said to have been held on September 2nd, 1895, it appears there that the secretary was instructed to write to the vendor requesting immediate transfer of the property of the company, but I had nothing to do with the company at that date—I was not pre<lb/>sent, and, not being instructed, I did not, of course, write to the vendors—on September 12th I went there, and the first meeting I attended was October 17th 1895—on September 2nd I had no communication of any sort or kind with the company—on September 2nd it says here, "The secretary reported that the offices of the company had been duly registered," that is not true—the next meeting at which I am represented as being present is September 5th—it is there resolved, "That the secretary be instructed to call a statutory meeting to be held at the Cannon Street Hotel on October 15th next, at 2 p.m., and that lie be and is hereby authorised to engage a room at the place specified for that purpose, and to give due notice to all share<lb/>holders of the same"—I was not present at that meeting—no such instructions were given to me on that date—I did not engage any room at the Cannon Street Hotel—I did not give any notice to the share<lb/>holders of the meeting—this minute-book, so far as I know, was not in existence at the time I left—I said that the first meeting of directors I was present at was the one on October 17th; I am afraid I was wrong there—I have no recollection of dates; this book is the only thing that will assist me as to the dates—I see no meeting was held on October 4th—I received three weeks' salary from Lupton, that was all after September 12th—after three weeks I used to pay myself out of moneys coming from the registration fees—I do not recollect any meeting on October 10th at which I was present; there may have been a meeting; I was present at three or four meetings; it is a long time back to recol<lb/>lect—there was no meeting that I was present at in October at which there was a representative of the vendor of the company—I believe there was a meeting at which I was present when the subject of the appointment of the manager of the mine was discussed, but I have no recollection of it; the subject was mentioned at one meeting as to appointing a manager—I never saw the manager—only the four directors and myself were present—I wrote a report in the minute-book of the meeting at which I was present—I remember being spoken to with regard to a meeting that was to take place at the Cannon Street Hotel by Mr. Coward's office-boy about eleven o'clock; I do not know the date; it might have been October 15th—that was the first that I heard of the meeting being held, and in consequence of what the boy said I sent off telegrams to the directors in the terms of this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>) addressed to Colonel the Honourable O.

               <p>except the books—I kept the seal of the company; it was produced at the board meetings—after I had left the company I saw the minute<lb/>book; that was on some occasion when I visited the offices of the company—I saw a clerk there named Lewis; the first seventeen meetings in the minute-hook (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are in the handwriting of Lewis—I knew a clerk named Abbott in the African Concession; the entries from eighteen to twenty-five are in his handwriting—I know the handwriting of the de<lb/>fendant Stephenson; the minutes of the meetings 32, 33 and 34 are in his handwriting—I know the handwriting of another clerk, named Con<lb/>nelley, who was in the African Gold Concession; the minutes of the meetings 36, 37, 38 and 39 are his writing; 26 to 31 are in Thompson's writing—while I was there I made a return of the shareholders in the Lydenburg on October 29th, 1895; that is a correct return of the share<lb/>holders as they appear as the shareholders of the company—the signature in the Strickland agreement of September 5th was the signature in the writing of the defendant Stephenson; the same applies to the duplicate of the agreement—I should not like to say I knew Mr. Coward's hand-writing—during the time I was there between September and December I saw one or two advertisements in the newspapers with reference to the Lydenburg companies; they were not inserted by me—as secretary, I did not insert any matters in the Frees; I did not insert a report of the statutory meeting of October 15th—when I sent out notices for a meeting there was always one held; in fact, a meeting was held on De<lb/>cember 4th, where I had a interview—I do not think I made an entry—I was not invited to resign in consequence of severe indisposition—there was a meeting again on December 5th; I was not present at the meeting, but I was on the premises—when I say there was a meeting I have no authority to say there was a meeting, but the directors were there at a meeting, but I do not know whether that was a meeting or not; I had resigned then—I was called secretary <hi rend="italic">pro tern.</hi>; I wished it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR EDWARD CLARKE</hi>. During the time I was there there were two, three, or four meetings of directors—I cannot remember whether there were two, three, or four—I have not the slightest recollec<lb/>tion; there may have been more than four, at which I was present—I hare no idea as to the dates upon which they took place—I have no memoranda of any sort or kind to aid my recollection—I have mentioned one subject difscussed, about the appointment of a manager—I cannot tell what date that was—the name of Hamilton, I believe, was mentioned</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189807250093"/>
               <p>as a manager—I have no recollection of hearing mention of what Mr. Hamilton was—his name was mentioned in connection with the appointment of an engineer—however many of the meetings of directors there were Mr. Lupton was never present at any one of them—I could not recollect the date of the meeting at Cannon Street, apart from suggestion—with regard to the meeting on October 15th, somebody had come the day before with the message which would have enabled me to send out the letters re<lb/>minding the directors of the meeting by the previous night's post—I say candidly I was not giving the company the attention I should have done at that time; it is probable I may have had instructions to call the meeting some weeks back—I had not done so—the message did not go out until the day of the meeting—as far as Colonel Lambart was con<lb/>corned that was too late—Mr. Lupton was not at that meeting—so far as I know Mr. Lupton had nothing to do with the speech which was made by Major Prust—I had heard of the agreement called the Strick<lb/>land agreement some time before September 12th; some time before I went there—I had not heard anything of the negotiations about that agreement—the early part of the minute-book that was produced to me was in Mr. Lewis' writing, not the memoranda of the early meetings of the directors; they were in Mr. Mackenzie's writing—as to the material from which Mr. Mackenzie made those I did not see in whose writing those were—I said in my examination "I attended the meetings of the Lydenburg directors and I kept the minute-book. I wrote it up from the agenda. I prepared the agenda on foolscap paper"—I prepared the agenda paper—I wrote it on foolscap, and having at the meeting noted down what was done on the agenda paper would write out the minutes from that—that would be the ordinary and proper course—I put the foolscap a on which I prepared the agenda with the papers I received paper Mr. Mackenzie, handed them all on to Thompson—I do not remember the time I had the first conversation with the directors upon the subject of the minutes—we have had one or two words with the directors—I had entered up in a book what purported to be the minutes of the earlier company—at each meeting of the directors the chairman ought to sign the minutes of the previous meeting—I noticed that in the book that was before me the minutes were signed by Major Prust and Colonel Lambart—in other books than that there were entries of the earlier meetings of this company which had been signed by Colonel Lambart only—minutes of meetings which had been held before I went there on September 12th appeared in their regular order, signed by Colonel Lambart—I have spoken of the transfers of shares coming in as early as September 13th—no share certificate was delivered out from the office till October 18th—the directors had done nothing with them they had been signed at the board meeting, but their certificates had not been handed to the public at all; the public never received their certificates till after October 17th; they were never delivered out—I do not know that I quite understood what was the object of putting large batches of shares in different names—the object would be, when trans<lb/>fers of those shares were made that it should not appear that they were all coming from the same person; that would be the idea, I suppose—that suggests itself to me as the natural reason—whether the shares were worth much or little it would be desirable that it should not be</p>

               <p>known that one person was selling all the shares—those mentioned, Pope, Wall and so on, were clerks; I do not know that they represented those individuals; I have only seen some of their writing—I went in another name, Valentine—I have no recollection of signing that name—if those shares, held by me in that name, had to be transferred, I would of course, have signed that name—it did not occur to me that there was anything dishonest or improper in that—it would not affect the value of the shares whether they were split up into twenty lots.</p>

                  </hi>. I was employed as secretary of the Lydenburg Consolidated Company in December, 1895; before that I had been employed at a company called the African Gold Concessions—I went to the Lydenburg about December 11th; Mr. Lupton told me to go there—I was employed at the African Gold Concessions as secretary and also with a seat on the Board of Directors—at the Lydenburg Company I became the secretary; upon going there I saw Marshall, the last witness—I settled with him, on the instructions of Mr. Lupton—I paid the money due to him for salary and also gave him a sum of £5—when he was going away he handed me any written memoranda that he had—when I took up my work with the company I had no knowledge what ever of what had taken place before I went to the office; I knew nothing at that time with regard to the property of the company—I found a set of books there, the ordinary books of a company—I did not personally take up the work in connection with the receiving of transfers, giving receipts, and so on; I had a clerk to do it under me, named Lewis; he was the first clerk—as the directors, I saw Colonel Lambart, the Chair<lb/>man, Major Prust, Mr. Stephenson, and J. M. Coward—an arrangement was made as to my salary with the directors—I saw Mr. Willie Watt, as representing the solicitors—he used to attend at the office as the solicitor to the company—as to whom was present at the first meeting of the direc<lb/>tors, I could only answer by seeing the minute-book; I do not remember it—I do not remember ever seeing that minute-book—I have a very in<lb/>distinct recollection about that circumstance, but I fancy I was told it was at the solicitor's—I did not bring a minute-book with me, but after-wards I brought a blank book that was turned into a minute-book—I brought the book on my own initiative, the actual book, but I was in</p>

               <p>structed or told there would have to be a new minute book written up—I think it was principally the gentleman who attended as solicitor, Mr. William Watts, who told me that—that was the only one I ever came into contact with at the Lydenbure—I think the minute-book had been taken away before I came; I do not remember seeing it—I cannot remember if I asked for it, but it is very possible that in asking for the different books I should have asked where is the minute-book; at that time I was very busy—I cannot remember if I asked Marshall for the minute book—it was a blank book, and under the instructions I received from the gentleman who was acting as solicitor, Mr. Willie Watts, who supplied certain memoranda and an old minute-book for it to be written up from, I told the clerk Lewis to write it up—I was supplied with the old minute-book after I came there; whether it was brought to me after I went there I cannot remember—I cannot remember the appearance of it; I was in doubt all along about that one; I cannot remember whether it had a green rover or not—Mr. W. Watts Landed it to me—I instructed the clerk Lewis to write it up in accordance with these memoranda—this is the minute-book—the gentleman who re<lb/>presented the solicitors, Willie Watts, instructed me to where it up—this is the book that was written up—Willie Watts took away the old book—I think he took away the memoranda as well, but they were not so much in my possession as in the possession of the clerk Lewis—the first entry in that minute-book purports to refer to a meeting held on August 22nd—I never saw the signatures—so far as I know they were obtained by William Watts; he took away the book for that purpose—he brought it back signed as it is now—it is signed by four out of the seven signatories—there is an extraordinary general meeting signed "Buckland "; that was obtained in the same way—the next meeting is signed "O. G. Lambart, Chairman"—that was signed after all these previous meetings had been written up—the first meeting at which I appear to have been present was the meeting of the 11th December—it would be very shortly after that that all the back minutes would have been signed up—they were signed as they appear to be signed there now, by Lambart, Stephenson, and Prust—the book was passed round at a board meeting some short time after I became secretary and was signed up—I never saw the Strickland agreement—William Watts was present at the meeting of December 11th—I see there the entry in the minutes: "The secretary was instructed to ascertain from the solicitors as to the due registration in South Africa of the property of the company from the vendors; also to write to Mr. Hamilton, the manager at the mine, respecting the same "; that is down here—I do not remember writing to the solicitors—I do not remember whether I did or not—I wrote to Mr. Hamilton—this was a copy of a letter of 11th December, 1895—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>) "Mr. Hamilton, manager, Surkersboschkop.

HAMILTON</hi>"—that was the only communication I ever had with Mr. Hamilton during the time that I was acting as secretary; the only communication or letter—I never found at the office of the company any report from a mining manager or mining engineer—what purported to be a report, read at the statutory meeting of October 15th, never came into my possession—from the time that I became secretary, transfers came in from time to time—the next meeting that I was present at was December 17th—William Watts was present at that meeting—the transfers were placed before the directors, and certificates for shares were sealed and issued—I reported the fact that I had written to the company's solicitor and also to Mr. Hamilton—the next meeting of the company was on January 8th—William Watts was present at that meeting, and transfers were produced to the directors and the certificates sealed and signed—I see the secretary reported on the disturbed state of South Africa, and the solicitors did not think it advisable at present to send the money out there for the due registration of the company's property, bat same would be done immediately it was safe so to do—that was a statement made by Mr. William Watts—I also reported at that meeting that a month's fees of directors had become due from the 4th inst., and I was instructed to pay the same—the money to pay the directors was to come out of the bank, if there was a banking account at that time; I forget whether there was a banking account at that time—I should have to apply to Lupton for the money—on January 22nd another meeting was held—I reported that I had been unable to open the banking account owing to financial arrangements not being completed; financial arrange-ments with Mr. Lupton—there was another meeting on January 27th; I think this financial arrangement refers to the half-a-crown agreement, but I will not be certain—a sum of half-a-crown was to be paid to the company in respect of every share that Mr. Lupton sold; there was some Agreement to that effect, and I think that refers to it—that arrangement was not completed; I am speaking from memory, but I think that is what it refers to—for every complete share 2s. 6d. was to be paid by Lupton, as he sold his block of shares—I have not got transfer 241 here—that is a transfer of 500 shares from James Pope to Walter Richard Burgoyne Watts—to the best of my knowledge Pope was a clerk in Mr. Lupton's office—in a great many of the transfers of shares which were placed before the Directors and passed, James Pope appeared as the vendor—there was a</p>

               <p>meeting of the company on January 27th in which the position of the company was discussed, and the fact mentioned that the company's property had not been yet duly registered in Africa—at that meeting William Burgoyne Watts was present—there was another meeting on January 29th at which Watts was also present—at that meeting I reported that I had sold 100 shares of the company to Mr. Lupton—having sold the shares to Mr. Lupton I opened a banking account at the London and South-Western Bank, and cheques were paid to the directors Lambart, Prust, Coward, and Stephenson, and also a cheque for myself, and a cheque for office expenses—there was another meeting of the company on February 8th—the banking account was, to begin with, £100—on February 5th I reported that the balance at the bank was £36 19s. 7d.—the directors' fees and the secretary's salary would came the account to be overdrawn—I was instructed to obtain a small loan not exceeding £15, so as to enable the cheques drawn that day to be honoured—I am not quite sure where I got the loan, but I think I lent it myself—sufficient money was paid in to enable the cheques to be cleared—I see it was £12 I paid in to make up the deficiency—that was sufficient to meet the cheques drawn at that meeting—the balance was a few shillings—that was all that there was in the bank at that time—at that meeting I reported that the promoters of the com<lb/>pany had made an offer of half-a-crown a share, in order to provide working capital for the company—that is what was called the half-crown agreement; it was the agreement I was referring to—that offer was ac<lb/>cepted—there was a stipulation that some of the money was to be paid at once; £400 or £500, I think—at that meeting I was granted leave of absence not exceeding four months from the 15th inst., upon my pro<lb/>viding an assistant-secretary—at that time I was going to Cape Colony for the African Gold Concession—at the same time I was to look for this property—I was present at a meeting on February 10th, when I produced the company's cash-book and the office cash-book for the inspection of the board—I was present at the meeting of February 12th—William Watts was present at both of those meetings on February 10th and 12th—the half-crown agreement was discussed at the meetings of February 10th and 12th—a resolution was passed that the £12 due to the secretary be drawn out of the first funds coming to the company—I was also present at the meeting of February 14th—this minute occurs on February 12th: "On the discussion of the affairs of the company the solicitor reported that the draft agreement for the payment of 2s. 6d. per share, for providing working capital, had been approved, but upon the engrossment being produced Messrs. J. V. Turner Lupton and Co, Limited, had objected, and struck out clause 3, and after some discussion the solicitor advised the board not to accept it in its present condition, more especially as one of the signatories of the document was not a director of the said firm of J. V. Turner Lupton and Co., Limited, and the solicitor further advised that taking into account the present critics that of the company, counsel's opinion should be taken on the general position of the company"—I do not recall that at all—I have no recol<lb/>lection; I have some recollection of the circumstance of the draft agree-ment not being approved of—I have no recollection of what the critical</p>

               <p>position of the company was, or of counsel's opinion being taken; I have no recollection about counsel's opinion, but I have a distinct recollection of the position of the company not being registered as being a critical position—I mean not registered in South Africa—at that meeting of February 14th William Watts was again present—on that occasion the half-crown Agreement which was produced and signed by Lupton and Co. agreeing to pay half-a-crown per share on 76,862 shares standing in the name of his nominees, was read with a provision that if the half-crown per share was insufficient to provide the necessary expenses of the company that Turner Lupton and Co. were to provide sufficient for working expenses—that agreement was ordered to be signed and sealed—it was also resolved "chat Mr. W. H. Thompson be instructed to register the company's property in the Transvaal, also to look into the matter of the new property offered, and to employ experts to report thereon, and it was agreed that all Mr. Thompson's travelling! hotel, and other reason-able expenses were to be paid by the company "; the new property offered to the company was some property at a place called Pilgrim's Rest; offered by a man named Gomm—no step was taken with regard to that—at that meeting there were transfers—the letters from Mr. Gomm were given to me to take with me for the particulars of the property, but nothing further was done with that—I went as far as Johannesburg and Pretoria—I did not get to Pilgrim's Rest; they sent me no money—I left England shortly after that, on the 15th, I think, the following day, Saturday—I left a clerk named Abbott to act as secretary in my absence—I got back to England, I think, in the early part of June, 1896—while I was out there I did not get to Surkersboschkop, because, I had no travelling expenses—I fancy I located the position properly when I was up at the Government offices; I have not visited it—I never met anyone who had been on the property there—I supposed the property to be in the Barberton district—that is just outside the Lydenburg district; they adjoin one another; the celebrated "Sheba" mine is in the Barberton district—while I was there in March I think I wrote home to the board of directors; anyhow there is my copy letter-book—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a copy of the letter of March 9th, 1896, from Cape Town—it is to the directors of the Lupton Company—when I returned home I gave them an account of what I had done while out there with regard to the matters that I had reported to them in the letters—that is one of the letters I sent to them while I was away—(<hi rend="italic">The witness read the letter</hi>)—that is a copy of the communication I received in answer to my request for reports—I never got any reports—that may be the answer I received from the directors to the letter that has been read; I do not remember seeing this before, but the Post Office arrangements at Johannesburg are not good; it purports to be an answer; it would be the right answer to my letter;—I took steps to carry out what I suggested in my letter, employing a raining expert, who could test the property in my presence; I made arrangements when I was in Johannesburg—when I say I made arrangements, I got as far as arranging how much he would charge to come with me—it never get beyond that, I had no money—accordingly I returned to England, and resumed my attendance</p>

               <p>at the meetings of the company on June 5th; that would be about the date—on June 5th I reported the result of my journey to Johannes burg and Pretoria to arrange as to the registration in South Africa of the company's property, and informed the board that I had made the necessary sworn statement in the Transvaal Government office as to the purchase and payment, and had obtained a copy of the official chart and survey map of the district, so as to locate the geographical position of the property, and by my presence on the spot had effected a saving to the company of £150—I left the official chart and survey map in the company's office when I resigned—I never saw them after I left the company's office—I located the geographical position of the company's property in Barberton—I am hardly competent to say that is a good place for it—I located it in Barberton, with the assistance of one of the officials in one of the offices I the Pretoria, and Philips' map of South Africa, at a farm marked clearly on the Government books and papers as Surkersboschkop B—as far as my memory serves me only two Surkersboschkops are on the map, A and B—I am only speaking from memory now; I think the size of the farm is 1,200 acres; it is a very large piece of property, with a good water supply—a map was sent out to me to help me to find the placo; I wrote for one—this is it—it is Philips' authentic map of South Africa; I think I located it very closely, but it is very hard to judge without going on to the pro-perty—roughly speaking I gut 300 or 400 miles from the property; they do not measure by miles out there, but by so many days' journey—I calculated it at eight days' journey, having no railway makes it so long—I did not go on because I had no money—I was present at another meeting on June 19th—I reported then that the balance at the bank was £11 16s. 2d.—cheques had been drawn for directors' fees, £74 7s. 6d., secretary's salary, £10 16s. 8d., office cash, £10—I reported that I had paid into the company's bank £100 received from J. A Comper, Esq., for 100 shares—Comper was one of Lupton's clerks—I was present also at a meeting on July 2nd, and reported that the balance at the bank was £6 15s. 9d.—cheques had been drawn for the secretary's salary and office cash account—I reported the receipt from Lupton and Co. of the sum of £200 in respect of the half-crown agreement—200 shares were allotted to Lupton's nominees—I also reported the purchase of 60 shares of J. A. Comper, Esq., for £60, the shares were allotted to him—Comper was Lupton's clerk—I was also present at a meeting of June 16th—when the balance got down to £6 15s. 9d. I was instructed to negotiate the sale of 400 shares at par to discharge the debts, and also to forward the necessary money to Pretoria to pay the transfer and registra<lb/>tion fees—on July 29th I reported that I had sold 400 shares to H. S. Adams, Esq.—that was a fictitious name for Lupton—it meant Lupton—cheques were drawn for directors' fees, my salary, and a cheque for the solicitor in South Africa, £190, and part of the expenses of my journey was paid and the rent of the office, &amp;c.—I also reported that I had carried out all the instructions given me by the board relating to financial matters', and also that I had, in conjunction with J. M. Coward, Esq opened negotiations with certain parties as to disposing of a small portion of the company's property at a price showing a fair profit, and I was in-structed to continue the negotiations on the basis of selling 100 acres at</p>

               <p>about £1,500 cash, so as to provide the necessary money to start developing the company's property—at that time, July 29th, 1896, nothing had been done, to my knowledge—it was to start developing the company's property, and I was further instructed to report progress in the matter at the next board meeting, which was resolved to be held at the-beginning of September, the month of August to be used as a vacation—the; certain parties that I was negotiating with were the Umtali Gold Reefs Com<lb/>pany and the Abercorn Beefs—those companies were Lupton's—I nego<lb/>tiated with the boards of directors of both these companies—Mr. Coward was a director of both companies, and Messrs. Burgoyne Watts and Co were the solicitors—on September 9th there was a meeting, at which I was present; at that meeting I tendered ray resignation—I had nothing further to do with carrying out these negotiations in any shape or form; I took no further step in the matter whatever—at all the meetings at which I was present the two defendants, Coward and Stephenson, were present; I do not think I can say at all of them without referring to book—on July 3rd, June 5th, and January 29th Coward was not present; he appears to have been present on the other dates when I was there, and Stephenson appears to have been present on all occasions—up to the time that I left the company William Watts was the man I always saw there as the solicitor—Coward, besides being a director of this company, was director of the African Gold Concessions, the Umtali, and the Abercorn; I knew him in connection with the <hi rend="italic">City Times</hi>; I understood him to be the editor—it is a difficult thing for me to say that I knew he was the editor, as I had no personal knowledge, but he was always, in my idea, the editor, and everybody I came in contact with thought so—the offices of the. <hi rend="italic">City Times</hi> were in the same building; Mr. Coward was there, and sometimes a clerk—when I resigned I asked Mr. Coward about it; Colonel Lambart spoke to me privately, and said it was the wish of the board I should resign—at a board meeting I asked for an explanation why I was being got rid of, although I resigned, and Lanibart's reply was that, in conjunction with Mr. Fife, I had been talking about the companies with outsiders; I think those are the words—Fife was not a secretary of some of the other companies; he had been secretary of the Umtali, but had resigned.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR EDWARD CLARKE</hi>. I do not remember seeing Mr. Lupton at any of these board meetings—so far as the minutes are entered in my handwriting, and purport to record what took place, they truthfully record it—as far as I am concerned, they contain a true record of what was done by the company—this book was made up from previous memoranda; the previous minute-book purports to contain entries of the minutes of the board meetings that had taken place in the early part of the life of this company—I do not remember whose handwriting they were. in because I saw very little of it—when it was banded me to re-write I handed it directto the clerk—I could not say whether he was Lewis—I have no recollection whether the former book was written by Lewis; I handed it to the clerk to re-write: that is to copy in this book what was found in the other, with memoranda, which I was given to understand were cor<lb/>rections of errors—I asked the reason of its being re written and I was told it was to correct errors, and that it had better be re-written entirely</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189807250104"/>
               <p>—as far as I know, the earlier entries in the present book correspond, in point of date, with the entries that there were in the original minute. book—to the best of my knowledge I think they do, because it was one written up by the clerk Lewis, and I read it over with him to see he bad entered it up correctly, with the book which it was made up from, and the memoranda, to see we had got the minutes according to the proper dates and numbers, and to see that he had correctly entered in the second book the entries of the first book, with these corrections—these having been so written up, they were signed by the proper persons, who would have signed them in the original book—there must have been some signatures in the original book—I should have noticed if there were a series of minutes without any chairman's signature to them; I am positive there must have been—each minute would show who was in the chair, and, therefore, whose name ought to be signed to the minute of the previous meeting, so that that book was made complete up to date—the memoranda from which the corrections were made were not destroyed, I think—I think they were given back to Mr. William Watts with the old minute-book, but I should not like to swear what became of them—there was no use or importance in them after the minute had been once put in proper form; I do not think I should attach any importance to them—I did not want them for any purpose—there were some papers handed to me by Mr. Marshall—to the best of my recol<lb/>lection I simply took those papers; I am not quite sure whether I tied them up or not, but I put them into a desk; I do not think I looked at them—I never saw any report in the office from anybody, but at the same time I do not remember looking through these papers—I heard that Mr. Hamilton had made a report on the entire property of the Lionsdale, of which this formed a portion—I did hear distinctly there was a report on the Lionsdale estate, and this formed a portion of the estate, and I endeavoured to get a report, but I never got it—I inquired from the secretary of the Lionsdale Company; I went to see him personally—I could not give you his name; I do not think I ever knew it; we always used to address one another as "secretary"; he might not have known mine—I endeavoured to communicate with Mr. Hamilton when I was in the Transvaal—I did not distinctly 6nd out where he was at that time, but the manager of the British and Transvaal Financial Corporation, to whom I obtained an introduction when endeavouring to locate the pro<lb/>perty, told me that Mr. Hamilton was somewhere about Cape Colony, but nobody knew where, and he said, "I can quite understand you having no answer to your letter"—I did job apply to the solicitors of the Lionsdale for a copy of the report; I applied to the secretary only—Mr. Dale, of Corn-hill, is the secretary, I think—I did write to Dale, Newman and Co.—I applied to them as well as applying to the secretary—when I was in the Transvaal I did not get nearer to the Lydenburg district than Pretoria—from Lydenburg, roughly, I calculated it at 600 miles distant, but I might have been mistaken; they do not calculate by miles; when you make inquiries, they say it will take so many days—to get to the Lydenburg property from Pretoria would take, I think, six or seven days journey—this map was sent to me—the Lydenburg district is a large district at the extreme east of the Transvaal; if you look a little north of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189807250105"/>
               <p>Lydeuburg you will see a place called Pilgrim's Rest; that was the spot I was supposed to make for—it is "Pilgrim's Rest"; gold "underneath it" that was where the property that the Lydenburg thought of buying was situate—Lydenburg is a name applied to a very large district—that does not include the Barberton district, where the Sheba mine was found; Barberton is just below Lydenburg—it appears to be a small township, but it is spoken of as the Barberton district—this is a map from Philips—I marked the position of the Surkersboschkop on the map, where the little cross is—that is on the Komati River—I ascertained that not from anybody connected with the company, but by reference to the officials in the Transvaal—the place I went to was the Court House, the Law Offices of the Transvaal—there is a detailed map of the Transvaal there; it is kept in sections—I did find Surkersboschkop—I found a farm called Surkers<lb/>boschkop, and one part was called Surkersboschkop A, and the other part Surkersboschkop B—I found that property was one of exceptional excellence in regard to water—the Komati formed a boundary of the property—the Komati River runs down towards what is called Komati Port, which is the frontier station of the Transvaal, and only a short distance by railway to Delagoa Bay—the railway from Delagoa Bay to Pretoria is the most important channel in that part of the world; I mentioned in one of the letters I wrote home to Mr. Lupton the importance of the place being opened up by a railway—when I went there I found from this information that the state<lb/>ments made with regard to the advantages of the situation and for pur<lb/>poses of trade, as well as from the water supply, were in fact true—I was there in connection with the registration of this company at Pretoria—I did it myself with the exception of paying the fees; they were sent on afterwards by cable—I do not know from personal know-ledge, because it was done after I left the office—that was all that was necessiry to complete the title of the company; everything else was in perfect order—Surkersboschkop B is a little to the right-hand side of Johannesburg and Pretoria.</p>

I left Cape Town on May 13th, 1896, and it takes eighteen days to get to Southampton—when I came back I went and saw Mr. Coward, and found him ill in bed—he had been very ill for some time; I went to his private residence—he had very bad health indeed; I might mention that at several board meetings he had to lay on the floor, he was so bad—I thought he was dying—he was always most anxious for the company and to push it forward—he certainly was <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> doing his best in the interests of the company while he was acting as director—as a matter of fact, I did not know he had resigned the position of director of the two companies, Umtaliand Abercorn, at the time the sale took place; I had left the com<lb/>pany at that time—of course I had no actual knowledge that he was the editor of the <hi rend="italic">City Times</hi>; I took it for granted; he was spoken of as such—I do not know that it was a company.</p>

Lupton and Co, I have, in accordance with your esteemed directions, instructed the solicitors to issue a writ at once for £500 under the clauses of the agreement dated February 14th"—it is a letter from Mr. Thompson to Mr. Stephenson—I wrote that letter, or I caused it to be written; it was done under my directions.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RUFUS ISAACS</hi>. I never saw Mr. Walter Burgoyne Watts in relation to the Lydenburg on any circumstance whatever—the negotiations for the sale to the Umtali and Abercorn Reefs were after my time—I am trying to remember exactly; I fancy I am right in saying no communication passed to the solicitors, Burgoyne Watts and Co., because at that time, so far as I know, the matter was only just mooted of effecting the sale—the effect was, as far as I remember, nothing—this is the transfer with respect to the 500 shares of pope to Walter Burgoyne—I have some experience of transfers—there would have been no difficulty, in making that transfer for those 500 to Walter Richard Burgoyne Watts, solicitor, to the name of Mr. Watts; we accept all transfers in any name—there was no liability of any kind, and it would not matter to the com<lb/>pany at all—very often I have seen a transfer in blank of shares to be filled up.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. TRAVERS HUMPHRKYS</hi>. I had seen Mr. William Watts before I met him at the office of the Lydenburg on December 11th—I thought he was a solicitor in partnership with his brother—I should gather when I went on December 11th to the Lydenburg Company's office that he had attended a meeting of the Lydenburg—he was not introduced to the meeting—I understood he had attended before as solicitor—I have no accurate recollection of when I received the old minute-book—I knew that I had it at some time or oiher, and it must have been after I became secretary—I have no recollection of the actual receipt of it—I do not re-member being in communication with Mr. Marshall before I took up my duties as secretary; I might have walked into the office once or twice, as he was an old clerk of mine—I recollect Mr. Marshall giving me some memoranda—I do not think I looked at them; I have no remembrance—the minute-book was complete in itself without the memoranda that Mr. Marshall gave me as far as my memory serves me, but I am only speaking from memory—I do not think it was a minute-book in the office—it ap<lb/>peared to be a complete minute-book apart from the memoranda which Mr. Marshall handed me—he gave it me at the same time that he gave me the material from which it was made up—when I got the minute-book it was complete in itself—I remember that there were some of the meet<lb/>ings that had not got dates—possibly it was with respect to the filling in of those dates that I went to the office of Messrs.

Burgoyne Watsand Company supplied me with a power of attorney when I went out to South Africa to register the property in the company's name—that was given me by Mr. William Watts—that was the last thing that the solici<lb/>tors had to do as far as I was concerned with the company—when I came back from South Africa they ceased to have anything to do with it, as far as I know; I do not recollect having anything to do with them.</p>

Howgate, 31, Grosvenor Terrace, York—he is a shareholder, I presume, from the tenor of the reply to a letter—I had heard from him: this appears to be a reply to a letter from him: "Dear Sir,—In reply to your letter I am instructed to write and inform you that far from the shares of our company being at such a low ebb, the business of the company has been of such a nature as should have improved their value. The only reason to be ascribed is that a large block were issued upon the market at a time when it was least able to absorb them, and as the shares had to be released the quotation has fallen to its present value. Speaking unofficially I should say the shares are absurdly low and will soon recover"—the second letter is November 23rd 1896, to Mr. T. Craddock: I presume he is a shareholder from the tenor of the letter—it is a reply to his letter apparently: "In reply to your favour the 20th inst., I beg to say that we have no information of any importance to send the shareholders. Owing to the unsettled state of affairs in the Transvaal, the progress of mines, etc., has been much re<lb/>tarded. At the same time the directors hold a very good opinion as regards the future of the company. The date of the general meeting has not yet been fixed"—that is all—those letters were written by a clerk at my dictation—I had instructions to write them from the directors as to the general tenor of the letter; the wording, of course, was left to myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I became secretary of the Lydenburg Consolidated on January 27th, 1897—I have got the entry in the minute-book of the meeting of January 27th—it is not the only meeting in my writing; there is another—I made entries with reference to the meetings of January 6th and January 27th—I was appointed secretary by the directors—I was employed by another company at the same office—they met at that office—the company was the Anglo-African Gold Properties—I do not think I ever attended any board meetings of the Lydenburg—I had no salary; I expected to get some; I put in a claim at the Receiver's office for what I considered due, and I shall expect to get paid—I have not got any salary up to now—I do not remember who told me to be secretary—my' salary was not fixed—there was no written agreement—someone came to me and told me I was secretary, I forget who it was—I continued secretary of the other company as well—I was able to bear the strain of both positions—when I became secretary of this I obeyed the directors' orders of both companies I was working for—I do not remember where I got the material for entering up the meetings of January 6th and 27th, but I think it would be from the chairman, Colonel Lambart—I cannot say that when I became secretary I took possession of the books of the company—I saw the cheque-book and countersigned the cheques; at board meetings I expect—I did not attend any board meetings, but after the meeting was over cheques were produced for me to sign—I attended no meetings at all, but I did write in two meetings from materials given me by someone—I signed the cheques on the various dates I suppose on which they were drawn—I signed all the cheques after the 27th I most probably received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it bears my endorsement, and most probably this one (<hi rend="italic">another</hi>)—it is merely an endorsement for filing—that letter was in my possession at the office of the company—the letters that came there addressed to me as secretary of the company would, as far as I remember, be handed to one of the directors or the chairman—I did not see the pass-book of the company until the liquidation, and never had the cheque-book in my possession—the cheque of January 27th 1897; for £8 15s., to Coward, I was directed to countersign—I do not know how it was or who it was told me to sign it the next cheque is for Major Prust for £8 15s., I countersigned that in the same way—on</p>

               <p>March 31st there was a cheque for directors' fees, £50—there is no entry of any minute sanctioning the drawing of that cheque—the next cheque is for £182 15s., February 3rd, drawn to L. S. Lupton, and is countersigned by me—I do not remember how it was or when it was I did that, only on instructions—there is no record of any board meeting where that payment was sanctioned—it might have been one of the directors who asked me to countersign that cheque—the next cheque is for £179 5s.; that was countersigned by me in the same way, and also the last cheque of March 31st for £74 9s. 1d.—I was asked to do it at the office of the company; that is all I remember about it—I wrote this letter of February 10th, 1897: "Dear Sir,—I shall be ex<lb/>tremely obliged if you will let me have per return the resignation asked for, unless you are prepared to attend the meeting for winding-up, which It is intended to call as speedily as possible. I shall also be gad if when you are in the City you will call upon me with reference to another com<lb/>pany.—Yours faithfully, <hi rend="smallCaps">L. S.

He has the whole history of the company, and can give it you right off.—With kindest regards, yours very truly, <hi rend="smallCaps">L. S.

               <p>Limited—Lupton is the only person I have known in connection with the business—amongst other printing work I have printed circulars and supplied the wrappers—the business of the addressing of wrappers is done by other firms; the wrappers are then returned to me, and I should deliver the circulars to Post Office vans—this circular of October 16th, 1895 was printed by me for Lupton, I believe; I recognise my printing—the manu<lb/>script would be supplied to me, and we should send it out with the proof—I printed 126,200 copies of that circular, and banded them and posted them—the price £190 is exclusive of the postage—I received a cheque on account from Turner Lupton and Company on October 14th—I believe the circular of November 2nd is our printing; we printed 200,000 copies of it, bonded, folded, and stamped them—the cost of the issue of that circular was about £340—I printed 50,000 copies of the circular of February 12th, 1896, and folded them for envelopes at a cost of £53 16s.—I remember a paper called the <hi rend="italic">City Times</hi> being started in Jan<lb/>uary, 1894; I had an interview with Lupton about it—I gave him an estimate for the printing of it; I printed the first number—it was a weekly paper; the offices of it were at Copthall Buildings—I knew Mr. Coward as editor; he supplied me with manuscript for the paper—those we delivered were delivered at 5, Copthall Buildings; most of them were folded, banded, and handed over to the Post Office van—I keep a file of papers that I print only for about twelve months; in consequence of the accumulation I must get rid of them—the <hi rend="italic">City Times</hi> after it had been started some little time was turned into a company, and the account ap-pears as the proprietors of the <hi rend="italic">City Times</hi>—the number of copies I printed weekly varied considerably; sometimes I printed as few as 1,000 or 1,500, and sometimes 50,000—for the week ending August 24th, 1895, I printed 1,500—on August 12th, 1895, I printed what was called a special number, at the order of Turner Lupton and Company, Limited; it was issued in four or five days; it amounted altogether to something over 900,000: 200,000 odd per day—those were delivered into Post Office vans—that special number cost £2,270—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the inside sheet of that special number; we were paid for the printing and despatch of that special number by Turner Lupton and Company, Limited—I had £500 on August 30th, £500 on September 3rd, and on August 22nd 1,000—the accounts for the, ordinary weekly number were sent to the office of the paper at 5, Copthall Buildings, to be passed by Mr. Coward—I printed another special number of the <hi rend="italic">City Times</hi> on August 27th, 503,405—in addition to printing circulars and those special numbers, I also print and supply books for companies—I supplied the set of books for the Lydenburg Company, a complete set of books—I supplied them on the order of Turner Lupton and Company, Limited; it is an item of £4117s. 6d., to the Lydenburg—taking the two together, the first account was £29 7s. 6d.—I do not seem to have supplied a minute-book—I en-graved a seal for them—I also supplied books for other companies for Mr. Lupton.</p>

Burgoyne Watts—the vendor appointed them—we did not provide for their remuneration—Mr. Lupton introduced me to them—I think it was at his office I first saw Mr. William Burgoyne Watts—I was introduced to him as the solicitor to the company, and I supposed he was—the directors decided at one of the meetings at Lupton's to take offices at 3, Newman's Court—that was in the same building that Stephenson's place was—I had not been connected with other companies much at that time—these were early days—as far as I can recollect Mr. Stephsnson said these offices were to let at Newman's Court; he knew of it because he had offices of bis own in the same building, and we considered they were suitable offices and we took them—the rent was to be paid by the Lydenburg Company, out of money provided for the purpose of keeping up the expenses in England by the vendor; that was the arrangement, I take it—by this minute-book there appears to have been a meeting held on August 22nd—I do not know any of those gentlemen who were signa<lb/>tories to the memorandum and articles of association: Mr. Raichlen, Mr. Robert Evans, Mr. H. Buckland, and Mr. Emery—I was not present at any meeting where they elected me a director—I was to pay 7 1/2 per cent of my fees or salary for my introduction to this company, and being made a director of it—I was to pay that to Stephenson; so far as I was concerned, with reference to this company only—by the minute-book a meeting appears to have been held on August 29th—Colonel Lambert was proposed as chairman—I remember that took place—I see also it was proposed that Alfred Ernest Marshall be appointed secretary <hi rend="italic">pro-tem.</hi>, but I cannot remember when he was appointed—I see there that Mr. Marshall is represented as being present at a meeting on August 29th—I cannot fix the date when Mr. Marshall was first present at any meeting of the company; it was some little time after the company had started—I do not understand how it was that he is represented as being present on August 29th—the next meeting appears to have been held on September 2nd—I see here "it was resolved that Mr. Hamilton be asked to undertake the duty of managing engineer to the company and that the</p>

Nash was an office-boy of Stephenson's—he never attended any of the meetings of the company I was present at—I did not appoint him secretary, or have any knowledge that he was secretary—at these early meetings the solicitor to the company was always present—he did advise me as to the conveyance, the acquisition of the property, the agreement—I only knew one Watts—I got notice of the meeting of October 15th, but I do not recollect that it was by telegram—in consequence of some notice I got I went to the Cannon Street Hotel with regard to the meeting that was required to be held by statute—the first thing was I found that Colonel Lambart, the chairman, was not going to be present, and I was asked to take the chair—I know the statutory meeting is a meeting held within a certain time at which the shareholders are invited to be present—I am not certain when the transfers were signed, it would be in the minute-book—I found Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Coward there—I was under the impression that Mr. Lupton was at that meeting, but I cannot swear to it now; I have heard he was not, and I will not undertake to swear that he was—there was the secretary and from eight to a dosen altogether there—I do not know who the others were—I was asked to take the chair; I demurred to doing so at first; it was a very awkward position to be in two minutes before the meeting to be called on to preside at it—I thought that Colonel Lambart would be there, of course, and I was placed in a very awkward</p>

               <p>position, but I did go into the chair and explained to the meeting how I was circumstanced; I said I had no idea I was going to he asked to pre-side; I had no speech; I knew nothing about it, and I could do nothing I told them, but read the notes, or rather it was a type-written short speech prepared for Colonel Lambart—I heard no objection to it—I read the type-written notes; they were brought to the meeting with the different papers, not by a member of the audience; I take it the secretary brought them—they were placed on the table before me when I took the chair, I should say the secretary placed them before me—I read the notes and the report—the necessary steps were taken; the fact of the meeting having been called together and the notice that was read by the secretary—the speech was: "The Act of Parliament compels us to call you together, and although there may be opinions as to the use of such a meeting, I think it is a very wise one, and one that should be compulsory, even within less time than the four months"; that was the introductory observation—it was my first experience of taking the chair at a statutory meeting—I only knew at that time that a report had been made by a man of the same name, Hamilton, which was one of the reports we saw at one of the preliminary meetings—there had been no engineer appointed for the Lydenburg at that time—This reads: "The directors are in negotiation with several financiers"—I do not know who they were—we had not employed the engineer to give an unbiassed and thoroughly impartial opinion—(<hi rend="italic">The engineer's report was here read</hi>)—a considerable amount of work had been done on the property before it came into our possession—this would read as if work was being done on the property, but there is no pretence that we ever did any work—I understood that an engineer was reporting what had been done by someone else before we got posses<lb/>sion of it—I said that no doubt the report was highly satisfactory, aid invited any questions—a question was asked, "Does the company propose to work the whole of the property?" and I gave the answer that, of course, we never intended to work the whole 1,200 acres as one mine; our <hi rend="italic">raison d'etre</hi> was to be a promoting company; we should have sold blocks, to form subsidiary companies, to whomsoever would purchase—I did not know that this report of the engineer and this meeting were going to to made public—I did not in any way sanction the insertion of this in the newspapers, or authorise the secretary to do it—I did not know it was done at the time—I learnt that afterwards—I did not retain possession of the notes of the speech and the report, they were taken away with the other papers and books—I never heard any remark with regard to the report by either Mr. Stephenson or Mr. Coward—I did not discuss it with them to my recollection—I took it then, and I take it now that that report was one of the reports before us at the preliminary meetings; there were four or five reports of different mining experts—I had no reason to disbelieve that it is one of the reports I saw originally nor have I now—it was read as a report of "our engineer"—I was pre-sent at the meetings held on October 17th and December 5th—at the meeting of December 5th it is said, "The solicitor produced copies of the agreements spoken of at last meeting and informed the board that the transfer of the property to the company is in course of completion"; that statement was made by Mr. Burgoyne Watte, the solicitor—I have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189807250117"/>
               <p>forgotten what those agreements are, or what has become of them—Mr. Marshall, the secretary, was dismissed about the end of the year—I remember a question about the writing up of the minute-book since at the Police-court; I knew nothing about it before that—I do not remember that when Mr. Marshall was there the minute-book was written up by him, and that all the minutes were signed at the same meetings, or a question being raised as to the insertion of the dates at which the meetings had taken place—I never heard Mr. Marshall say that the meetings had never been held—I do not know what became of the original minute-book—I did not know that there was a minute-book like the other books, gold lettered outside "minute-book"—I do not know where that minute-book came from that is before me—I remember Mr. Thompson coming there as secretary in place of Mr. Marshall—I think he was recommended to us by Mr. Lupton—Mr. Lupton was present at a great many of those meetings; we used to send for him to his office—if was wanted information either about the company or about the title of the company, we applied to our solicitors—we sent for Mr. Lupton for a special specified matter—we found after the com<lb/>pany started, some little time before we could get it registered in South Africa, certain fees had to be paid in the Transvaal, and those fees, we were told, amounted to £400; we had no means of getting the £400, and getting absolute possession of our property, unless we got it from the vendor; we were in no position to sell shares, we had no way of raising the money in the state of the market at that time—having an interest in the company, I followed the thing with interest—the vendor's shares were being dealt with in September—50,000 shares were allotted to the company—they remained as unissued shares—if things had remained prosperous in South Africa, as we expected, those shares would be sold—we had power to sell them—we had no power to sell shares in this way, that we could not sell shares under par—it would be absurd to try to sell shares at par in a prospecting company in the state of the market at that time—we had the transfers, so that we must hare known at the end of August and throughout September that the public were having the benefit of shares transferred to them—on October 17th we had passed 168 transfers—those shares were sold by Lupton; he could sell at any price he liked, but we could not—I knew shares were being sold; I never knew they were sold at a premium—the money that was to be provided for developing the property was to come at some time from the sale of our shares—we were first to sell our shares, and with that money employ people to develop the property, or by a sale of the land—we never meant to sell the whole; we should keep the beet as the Lydenburg Mine; the choicest part of it—in the meantime, until we were prepared to do that, the public were getting the shares and we were passing the transfers; we realised that, and that we were signing certificates for shares—I never looked at the price shares were being sold for; I never saw a quotation for that mine—up to this time we had not been able to open any banking account—I remember there was an attempt made to place shares in Glasgow, but on what date I am not sure; that was later—it was not worth taking shares at that time; those were to be the company's shares—up to January 22nd we had not</p>

               <p>opened any banking account—a meeting was held on January 22nd, 1896—that was the beginning of the banking account; we started with £100—on January 29th the secretary reports that we had sold 100 shares of the company; I understood that they were sold to Lupton—with that £100 the banking account was opened, and then cheques were at once drawn for the payment of the directors' fees and secretary's salary and office cash; those would be the first fees that were paid—I became a director at the end of August, and fees were paid to us as directors month by month—our fees must have been paid from some source before there was any banking account—we were paid all the time I was on the board; when I left the company there were no fees due—the directors' fees came from Mr. Lupton—I knew we were having our fees paid by Mr. Lupton up to the time that this banking account was opened—when the account was opened and the £100 was drawn upon, the result was to leave a balance of £35 19s. 7d. on February 5th—cheques were drawn at that meeting for £10 18s. 9d. for Colonel Lam-bert, £8 15s. for Major Trust, £8 15s. for Mr. Coward, £8 15s. for Mr. Stephenson, and £10 16s. 8d. for Mr. Thompson; but there was only £36 19s. 7d.—we passed a resolution or instructed the solicitor to raise a small loan temporarily, not exceeding £15—I take it that he paid £12 into the bank, and we were all able to take the money at that time—I examined the pass-book and cash-book from time to time when we met—I remember the arrangement being entered into to finance the company by putting 2s. 6d. a share on the shares sold by the vendors, Turner Lupton and Co., Limited—that contemplated that a very large number of shares would have to be sold in order to keep the thing going—that agreement was discussed at one or two meetings, and then I find on March 4th a meeting where transfers 251 to 260 were passed, and cer<lb/>tificates issued, and then again cheques drawn for the directors' fees and the secretary—then, again, there was a meeting of April 1st, where trans<lb/>fers were again passed. 279 to 286, and certificates issued and cheques again drawn for the directors' fees and petty cash—on April 15th at a meeting there is a minute that it is desirable that a director should pro<lb/>ceed to Glasgow regarding negotiations of some shares, and it was agreed that a cheque for five guineas for travelling expenses should be drawn, and an attempt to place the shares there, which was unsuccessful—at the meet-ing of April 29th transfers were again passed and the bank balance had got down to seven guineas—then there was a meeting on May 5th, where it is reported that cheques had been drawn for different matters, but apparently there was no money at the bank to meet them; then Mr. Thompson returned from South Africa and was present at the meeting on June 5th: he is down here—I remember his report; I do not remem<lb/>ber a map; he had obtained a copy of the official chart—the secretary's salary was £10 16s. 8d., and the office cash was £10; there was ap<lb/>parently not the money; then it was reported that 100 shares had been sold to J. A. Comper, Esq.—those cheques were cashed, and that brings the balance down again to £6 15s. 9d.—I see a report of a further sale of shares on the same date—on July 16th the balance in the bank was £6 15s. 9d.—Mr. Scholtz is the attorney at Pretoria—on July 29th I find that it is reported that shares have been sold to H. S. Adams</p>

               <p>Esq.; £300 and £100 respectively was received from Mr. H. S. Adams—I do not know who he was, or whether he was a real person or not—we were enabled to draw a number of cheques upon that date—I take it that Adams was a fictitious name, and that that was money coming from Mr. Lupton—I see here that the secretary reported that he had carried out all the instructions given him at the last board meeting, and that he had in conjunction with Mr. Coward opened negotiations with certain persons as to disposing of part of the property—I do not remem<lb/>ber that; I was not present, nor at the next meeting on September 9th, nor at the meeting on September 10th or 11th—I was not present at any meeting where there was a negotiation to sell part of the property to Mr. Wilson—I do not know who Mr. Wilson is—I had no notice of these meetings at which these negotiations were to take place on Sep<lb/>tember 10th and 11th, and did not know of them till afterwards—I do not say that I had not notice of the 9th—I was living at Kensing<lb/>ton—on September 10th I was not in London; during all that time I was in Herefordshire—I remember a discussion taking place as to irregular meetings which had been held—the meetings of 10th and 11th were impugned as irregular—those are meetings at which Mr. Coward and Mr. Stephenson appear to have been present—I do not know any-thing about the meeting of the 10th; that is one of the meetings I was not at—I heard afterwards, when it was an accomplished fact, that the property was sold; I understood that Mr. Beall acted for the pur<lb/>chasing companies, the Umtali and Abercorn—he was never employed by me or my directors, as far as I know—there was no resolution to employ him to my knowledge—I did not know he had been employed until after the thing had occurred—I do not know who had the £100 commission—I did not have any of it, and knew nothing about it—the question of the commission and these meetings was discussed at a later date—on October 28th I was not there—I was there again on December 4th—at that time 582 transfers and certificates were issued, numbered 316 to 318, and certificates 579 to 582—in Dacember, 1896, things were looking better—the property was going to be developed when there was sufficient money in hand to do anything—was had at that time, from the sale of the property, £915 in hand—I was there on January 6th, and cheques were drawn for directors' fees, and a cheque for Mr. E. Beall, £35—I do not recollect at whose instance; I have no recollection of it—the last meeting I attended was January 27th and se last thing apparently done was to draw cheques for directors' fees—that was the date of my withdrawal from the company; I sent in my registration in December; I was asked to hold over for a short time, and I attended two meetings in January after that, and then confirmed my resignation; it is not on the minute-book—the last fees I got were on January 27th—I did not get further fees after I had resigned—I remember receiving a letter from Mr. Lupton inviting me to send in my resignation, and saying he would like to see me about another company; I have some recollection of his asking me to meet him; I have never thought of it since—I went twice after I resigned, that was including January 27th—I went to two meetings after sending in my resignation—my letter was written in December—I was asked to hold back my resignation for a short time;</p>

               <p>I think the idea was about the appointment of another or two other directors in place of Colonel Lambart and myself—I did not attend the winding-up—I severed my connection with the company absolutely until the company was being wound up, and in the course of the winding up; I did not see the Strickland agreement.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR EDWARD CLARKE</hi>. I had no acquaintance with Mr. Lupton before I went into this company's business—I was in no way connected with him or under any obligation to him of any sort or kind, absolutely independent—so far as I know, Colonel Lambart was in the same position—I never received any shares or anything of that kind from Mr. Lupton—I never had any shares in it—on having this matter proposed to me I con<lb/>sidered the proposition to the very best of my ability, before I agreed to lend my name to it as director—whatever name was used as the name of the go-between between the vendor and the company, I understood that Mr. Lupton was the real vendor—I do know it is constantly done; that a nominee is put forward as the vendor; and that fact would not have suggested to me then, nor does it suggest to me now, anything improper in the business—we were informed that this property was being obtained from the Lionsdale Company at the first preliminary meeting when I was making inquiries—I never heard what was actually paid in money by Mr. Lupton for this property—as a matter of fact, in the bargain that was being made with the company of which I was to become director, Mr. Lupton was not to receive from the company any cash at all—the company was to have 150,000 shares—100,000 of these shares were to belong to Mr. Lupton, the vendor—that left us with 50,000 shares to sell, which we should be entitled to sell at par, but could not sell under as it is not legal—if the South African matters had gone on in the prosperous way we then contemplated, those 50,000 shares, if issued to the public, would have given us ample capital for developing the property—it was the contemplation that the company was formed rather to make other and smaller companies, than to embark on the work of gold-getting and quartz-crushing ourselves—the idea was, as we developed, to sell portions of the property—we meant to develop the property first—it would have added to the value for selling the rest—will should have appointed a mining engineer, a mining expert, and we could have had the property well explored, and on part of it we should have employed, on our behalf, workmen, and we should have appointed a manager, and begun some sort of mining operations, and then sold other parts in blocks to subsidiary companies finding some other names as godfathers and godmothers—it was to be what is commonly called a parent company—there was no prospectus—we got our information from the reports we had before us, from the mining experts—I cannot recall the names of the persons whose reports we had at that moment—of course, I remember the name of Hamilton—I think I should remember the names of the others if they were repeated to me, but I cannot say—I do not know if Mr. Pouter was one of them—I do not recall that name—I think I can say I know both the names, Furlonger and Day—not Howitt—Hamilton I know—the report of Mr. Hamilton, the mining</p>

               <p>engineer, was one of the reports put before us—I do not remember the reports sufficiently to say as an actual matter of fact it was the same report that I read at the meeting, but I have no reason to doubt it—that was the Mr. Hamilton with whom it was afterwards resolved to open communications about this property—we decided that Mr. Hamilton should he appointed managing engineer of the property—there is only one Mr. Hamilton in the case—that is the Mr. Hamilton who made this report—I had not the least reason to doubt that this was a valuable property—having regard to all I have seen and know about its situation and opportunities for development, I am still of opinion that it is a valuable property—until the shares were issued Mr. Lupton was providing the out-of-pocket expenses, so to speak, of the company—that was the perfectly. well-known arrangement entered into by me with perfectly good faith, and so far as I know entered into in perfectly good faith by all the other gentlemen who were parties to it—during the autumn of that year, 1895, a change came over the South African market—unfortunately for us it took place almost immediately this company started—I should think within a fortnight or three weeks—if that change in South African affairs had not taken place which came about in September or October, 1695, I have no doubt we would have been able to have developed this property and make this a prosperous company—I did not make any objection to the statement which I made at this statutory meeting being published—so far as I am concerned my statement was an honest one, made to all or any persons interested in the matter—I had not the slightest objection to its being published—the effect of this change in South African affairs was to send down the prices of all South African stocks, and when it had taken place it became clear that we could not place the 50,000 shares at par—it would have been absurd to try—it would have been impossible—an attempt was made at Glasgow—I did not go to Glasgow—Mr. Stephenson, one of my colleagues, knew Glasgow very well—I do not know if he went to Paris, but he went to Glasgow in order to try and place those 50,000 shares—unfortunately the moment had passed for that, and it could not be done—quite at the end of that year the Jameson Raid came, which quite stopped all hope of doing business in South African affairs and absolutely destroyed, the future we expected—we were hung up, as about a hundred other African properties were at the same time—though we found that the title to the property was in order, before it could be registered certain fees had to be paid to the amount of about £400—we also became aware that in the early part of the year 1896 the registration of deeds of this kind was practically stopped by the Transvaal Government—when things had quieted down and things were settled we hopel the market would revive—I believed that the property had in itself such real value that when this exceptional state of things had passed away it would justify the expectations we had formed, and it was in that belief that we sent Mr. Thompson out to Pretoria in order to secure the registration of our title to the property—he did go there—he made inquiries and found out all about the property, and he got the registration of the deed subject to payment afterwards being made of the fees—was sent out those fees, and the registration was completed—the deed of registration was sent to us and was received by</p>

               <p>us in this country, as appears by one of the minutes—I do not know of anything we left undone that we possibly could have done in order to carry forward the development of this place—there is no reason that I can see other than these exceptional incidents in South Africa that caused the failure of this company—I do not know whether this report is Mr. Pouter's (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I could not swear that this is one of those I saw—I have no reason to doubt it, the name Norrey is perfectly familiar to me—although I do not remember having seen the Strickland agreement, I knew from an early period practically what it contained—I should not have any hesitation in signing it—I he no reason whatever why that agreement should have been signed in a hole-and-corner way, if it was so—it is of 5th September, carrying out the conditions of purchase—I see no reason for any secrecy—I cannot imagine what can have been the object of it; it is a perfectly straightforward agreement, and if I had been there at the meeting (I think I can say the same of Colonel Lambart), I could take no exception to it—it represents what we knew, the terms of the purchase—I am aware that the original agreement is filed at Somerset House—there were options put before us very early in the history of the company, I remember, by Mr. Lupton—it was for a very large block of land in the Lydenburg district—I do not remember if it was for 28,000 acres; I know it was for something very big—we could have had the advantage of those options of the right of purchase—they were put before us at an early period—if the directors at their meetings wanted to communicate with Mr. Lupton they sent to his office to ask him to see them—it happened very often, because he was rather a difficult man to get hold of—he was a very busy man and his time was not always our time—when these South African difficulties checked the progress of the company, we had to find money from time to time for different purposes, sending Mr. Thompson out, and so on—it all wanted money, and that was the reason of what we call the half-a-crown arrangement; an arrangement that for every share that was sold Mr. Lupton should pay half-a-crown to the company, he having agreed to bear the expenses of the company in the interval before it got property of its own and issued its own shares—that was the mode adopted for supplying the company with money—it did not occur to mean at the time that the agreement was made that there was anything improper about it—it was under the advice of our solicitor—it was in fact a method of carrying out the engagements into which Mr. Lupton had entered—it was only a method adopted for paying the fees in South Africa—and he did, in fact, supply money the company needed for sending out Mr. Thompson, and so on, up to the time when £1,200 was realised by the sale of a portion of the property—I do not see any-thing that we could have done beyond examining the reports which bad been made with regard to ascertaining the value of the property—it was not suggested that I should go out myself—I believed that those reports were given by persons qualified to speak on the subject—I believe so now—so far as I know the other persons who were joining in the promotion of this company were relying on the same materials as I was—neither of them pretended to have any personal knowledge of the Transvaal—neither Mr. Lupton nor anyone else in the company represented that he</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBSON</hi>. Of the moneys the company was receiving from Mr. Lupton, every penny was applied by the company to the purposes of the company—no part of the money paid by Mr. Lupton to the company went into the pocket of any individual director—Mr. Lupton paid it to the company for the company, and was applied for the company—I had known Mr. Stephenson socially over two years before he introduced me to this company—it was a social, not a business acquaintance—I was introduced to him by a relation of mine—I saw the reports, and attended two preliminary meetings, and then made inquiries and satisfied myself—that is the short history of my joining the board—I saw what Mr. Hamilton's report was—it was put before me and my fellow directors at the preliminary meeting—I had no reason to doubt that it existed, and I have no reason to doubt now that such a report was made—the property we were buying was part of a larger property—the Lydenburg was part of the Lionsdale, which was, as I understood and believed, a property in course of development—the Lydenburg shared in that general development which had been reached by the Liousdale—after I joined the Board I was informed at these preliminary meetings of the terms on which the property was to be sold by Mr. Lupton—he was to have so many shares, the company was to have the remainder—if the time had remained favourable to the issue of fresh shares it was the intention of the directors to frame a prospectus and go to the public with their 50,000 shares—we did not expect to get the public to take the 50,000 shares, except on a prospectus—that is the usual course; gentle-men who join the Board have to satisfy themselves by private inquiries and personal inquiries, and if they are satisfactory and they join the board, then they issue a prospectus—and that was the course which would have been followed in this instance had the market remained favourable—since the September of that year (before the Jameson Raid) there was more or less a panic<lb/>striken condition in the South African market—a good many people out there knew what was going to happen, though a good many people here seem not to have known what was going to happen—that affected the market—I certainly never understood there was anything wrong in signing transfers which gave Mr. Lupton possession of those shares—I knew the terms of the Sale, and the general substance of the agreement for sale, though I have not seen the document itself—the company never made any attempt to put any of their shares on the public—Mr. Stephenson was a director with me—in the course of my transactions with the company I never saw anything to lead me to doubt the honesty and good faith of Mr. Stephenson or of any of the directors—I have no doubt that some such resolution as this was passed at the meeting of October 17th: "The secretary was instructed to write to the solicitors of the company respecting the due registration of the title, and asking them for office copies of the various agreements entered into by the company, to be placed in charge of the secretary"—I do not doubt the accuracy of the minute at the meeting on December 5th, which says: "The solicitor produced copies of the agreements spoken of at last</p>

               <p>meeting, and informed the board that the transfer of the property to the company is in course of completion"—I understood we were taking the ordinary sreps to complete our title and secure our registration—nothing remained to secure possession of the property that we did not to the best of our ability do—at a meeting on January 8th, it is stated: "The secretary reported that in consequence of the disturbed state of South Africa the solicitors did not think it advisable at present to send money cut there for the due registration of the company's property, but same would be done immediately it was safe so to do"—that is correct—the raid took place on December 31st—January 8th was the time at which no one could send money to the Transvaal, and certainly not for the purpose of registering a company in the Transvaal Republic—at a meeting on January 27th, "It was resolved that in view of the company's property not having yet been duly registered in Africa, this meeting be adjourned till 2 o'clock p.m. on Wednesday next, to further consider the state of affairs"—and at a meeting on January 29th, "The secretary reported that he had, in conjunction with the solicitor, made inquirie and ascertained that in consequence of the prohibition issued by President Kruger in the Transvaal, it was impossible for the present for any pro<lb/>perty out there to be transferred or registered from one name to another, but that as soon as the prohibition was removed all steps were to be taken to enable the company's solicitors to complete the due registration out there"—that is so—that was a political measuid of President Kroger, President Kruger being more or less then in a state of war, as a political measure, would not have any new companies registered or transferred—on June 19th there came a letter: "The secretary pro<lb/>duced a mail letter dated May 21st, 1896, from the company's solicitors at Pretoria respecting the fees necessary for due registration of the property in South Africa, and having regard to the present condition of the company's finances"—the registration was to be paid by Lupton—we got the money for the registration from Lupton and spent it on the registration—"It was resolved that the solicitor be instructed to at once enforce, by all legal methods, the agreement entered into on February 14th last."—that was the agreement with Mr. Lupton—we were going to take proceedings against Lupton to get the money—because we had not got it then—we did not take action against Lupton—he found the money—he supplied half-a-crown per share on the shares sold by him up to a certain number, and claimed from us under that agreement to receive shares at par value equal to the number of half-crowns—if he sold 100 shares, that would be £8 we should become entitled to, and thereupon we had to transfer to him eight of the company's shares—under that arrangement the registration fees were paid—the half-crowns we so received went to the purposes of the company alone—at the next meeting the secretary reported the balance at the bank to be £6 15s. 9d., and that there were certain payments overdue, viz., rent, directors' fees, &amp;c., but that he was negotiating the sale of 400 shares at par, which would enable him to discharge said debts; also to forward the necessary money to Pretoria to pay the transfer and registration fees, and he was instructed accordingly—the minute of October 16th says, "The secretary also reported</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189807250125"/>
               <p>that Mr. Beall had communicated with Mr. Scholtz, of Pretoria, South Africa, with reference to the titles of the company, and that gentleman's reply would be laid before the board on receipt of same from South Africa"—on December 4th, 1896, the minute is: "A letter from Mr. Scholtz, of Pretoria, was produced, together with title deed of property, which was ordered to lie on the table until next meeting"—the title was completed and the registration was completed in due time—I see at the meeting on September 2nd, 1895, there is a retolution "That Mr. Hamilton be asked to undertake the duty of managing engineer to the company, and that the secretary be instructed to write him to that effect, and also inquire of him what remuneration he expected"; but I cannot say that I remember it—I believe that under the Companies Act an agreement like thin of September 5th for the purchase of this property most be filed at Somerset House—every shareholder who liked to go and look at the agreement could see it.</p>

During the whole time I was con<lb/>nected with the company I never saw Walter Burgoyne Watts, the solicitor, neither at the meetings or anywhere else, from first to last—I think the last date upon which any representative of his attended our meetings was March 4th, 1896—we went on without a solicitor—the minute of September 10th, 1896, says: "The minutes of the last meeting were read and confirmed. The transfer of part of the company's property sold to Mr. Wilson for £1,200 were perfected, and the purchase money received. Commissions connected with the sale of the property were limited to £100, and ordered to be paid. Mr. Beall, solicitor, attended on behalf of the company to see the transaction carried out"—I was not present at the meeting—from the minute I have no doubt—on October 6th the minute reads: "It was resolved that Mr. Beall be instructed to write to Mr. Scholtz, solicitor, of Pretoria, South Africa, with reference to part of the property sold to the Umtali Gold Reefs Company, Limited, and Abercorn Company, Limited, also with reference to the title of the company"—Mr. Beall was then acting as solicitor to our company, and acting for the Umtali Company, I believe, acting for both—I do not consider we had any other solicitor acting for us at that time—it would have appeared if we had one—I never to my knowledge made any attempt to see Mr. Walter Bichard Burgoyne Watts.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> This was not the first company I had been connected with—I had had very little experience before in mining, I have had some experience since; in four or five of a similar nature—I regarded everything done in connection with this company had been done in a business-like way—looking back, nothing could be done better; I have nothing to be ashamed of; with the materials on our hands, I do not know anything that we did not do—I knew the shares of this company were being dealt with on the market—I knew Lupton was dealing with his own—the only cause of failure of this com-pany was the Jameson Raid, that and the previous slump with everything in South Africa—the slump took place before political disturbances—early in September, 1895; it was unfortunate; I can almost fix the date because it was almost immediately after the company was brought out—by the slump I mean everything connected with the company went down—the purposes of the company for which the money was applied were the secretary and office expenses—salaries to the secretary and office rent; it was applied always to the keeping up of the company, directors' fees, registra<lb/>tion of title—the company never spent anything in working this mining property—it was never opened at all by this company—so far as I know it was never opened at all—I only believed it was ever opened at all by the reports that were placed before us—I think Mr. Hamilton's report will bear out that workings had been done upon it; we did not suppose there had been any development—it was more of a prospecting company—we did not suppose that the 1,200 acres that we purchased had all been developed—on 2nd September, 1895, there was a meeting at which I was present—it was resolved that Mr. Hamilton be asked to undertake the duty of managing engineer to the company, and that the secretary be in-structed to write him to that effect, and also inquire of him what remu<lb/>neration he expected—up to that time our company had no engineer—I have no recollection of a letter from Mr. Hamilton before October 15th—in the account of the meeting of 15th October in my speech I say: "At any rate as far as this company is concerned, although no actual business is transacted, it enables the directors to lay before you the exact position of the company's affairs and the report of</p>

               <p>the property which has been made by our engineer"—the engineer there referred to was Mr. Hamilton—we had no engineer then—it ought not to have been "our engineer"—Mr. Hamilton was the engineer of the Lionsdale, that sold the property to us; so I understood—the report read at the meeting is the report that was placed before us—I do not know if it was made by him as engineer for the Lionsdale when the Lionsdale sold us the Surkersboschkop—I do not know who employed him to give a thoroughly unbiassed and impartial opinion of the property in a report relating specially to the Surkersboschkop—I only knew that that was the report of Mr. Hamilton, and I suppose it was a report of that property, and it was the report that had been placed before us—our company had no engineer then—it had resolved to have one—when I had finished reading the document whish I read out as the report of the engineer I replaced it on the table—the secretary took it up, I fancy—it would be taken with the books and papers—I do not know where it is now—I did not know that it was missing—the speech handed to me was type-written—I did not speak extempore—I read a type-written speech—I will not swear it was handed by Mr. Lupton, but it was handed to me going into the room—I read the engineer's report to the meeting; I remember that—I never have seen the original of the document I read as a report—I know that batteries are used for crushing quartz—there was no battery at Surkersboschkop B. to my knowledge—I know what shafts and stopes are—I do not know if there were ever any shafts and stopes on Surkers<lb/>boschkop B.—I never heard of any—I know that there are some statements in the document which was read as a report about batteries and shafts and stopes, and that a dam had been formed, and a race—it is in Hamilton's report—I never from any other source during the time I was director of the company heard about these batteries, stopes or shafts, nor the dam nor the race—the battery has not been started—we never worked the property—it had never been worked to my knowledge beyond the report—assuming that the report refers to the Surkersboschkop, then some work had been done on it unless we are to disbelieve the report—we had some apparatus of some kind for crushing and so on—"there is a stream running through the valley in which the present works are situated which supplies the greater part of the water to be used in them; is joined at some 300 yards below the battery by another stream of equal volume; from this point the mainstream forms the boundary line"—I suppose it would—it is 9 feet thick, I see—I was not present at the meeting on June 19—I was a director at the time—the last entry in the minute is "That the solicitor be instructed to at once enforce by all legal methods the agreement entered into on 14th February last to provide the necessary funds for the company"—I suppose the solicitor there referred to was Mr. Burgoyne Watts—I never heard of any other solicitor except Mr. Watts acting for the company except in special matters of the Umtali and Abercorn—practically we were without solicitors in the latter months of the company's existence—I never knew the circum-stances, but I believe Mr. Burgoyne Watts had withdrawn from the company some time in 1896.</p>

It was before the slump in the market took place in September that we had those options—in November it was worse than in September, going down and down every day—when I went into this matter I did not hear of Strickland's name—I do not know what the property was—I knew it was the Surkersboschkop farm, in the Lydenburg district, of 1,200 acres—I knew from what I was told—I did not see any papers in confirmation of that story.</p>

Mr. Prosser brought the matter under my notice—he had nothing to do with Mr. Lupton as far as I know—it was not any circulars or newspaper article that specially induced me to buy these—Prosser was a man who confessed he was under an obligation to me, and he spoke to me about the amount of money he was making in mining shares, and that there was a great boom on at the time, and I thought that I should like to have a little speculation, and he took me to these brokers and suggested buying these shares—it was the general boom that induced me to go into shares as a speculation—I really do not know the exact month I bought them—I did not buy them with the idea of taking them up at all. It was only when I found I lost so much money that I took them up, which was not probably until a month or two afterwards—I said at the Police-court that Lupton looked more straightforward than the man I saw at the office—office the man I saw had a very hang-dog expression about him—I think he knew the whole thing was a swindle.</p>

               <p>shares were purchased of Lupton, we only took the names—the share we bought we did not want they made up—the monetary difference between the shares I bought and sold was £9,000—I have not checked those figures, I have not taken them out at all—I cannot tell you the sum for which I sold the shares without taking it out—I have never taken it out—I can tell you the number of shares I have bought and the number of shares I have sold—roughly the figure would be about £9,000—I do not think it would take very long to ascertain it, I will do so.</p>

Lupton and Company, Limited, in other shares—buying and selling—there was nothing exceptional in these transactions—it is the same sort of account that we have for other people who are dealing in shares—selling and buying shares—no one confines himself to buying or selling any particular class of shares—the highest price mentioned here is for the 400 shares on 11th of September at 2 3/8—that is the only transaction of the kind—at I that price Lupton &amp; Company bought 400 shares—they bought for a higher price than they ever sold for—there is nothing unusual in dealing in shares before a company actually comes out—it is very well known that there is dealing beforehand—it was an ordinary outside broker's business.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> No transfers were ever taken of the shares bought; we took names for the balance—the effect of buying shares that are not wanted is that you have a fortnight running for the account—people buying at 1 5/8 sell them before the end of the account at 2; they take the difference—they do not want the shares—it is simply a transaction for differences—that tends to keep up the market—all buying tends to keep up the market.</p>

Turner Lupton &amp; Co., Limited. No part of my property has, however, been transferred or otherwise assigned to that company"—the receiving order was made on the 25th January, 1893, and there was an adjudication on the 15th March, 1893.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RUFUS ISAACS</hi>. If a resolution had been passed by the shareholders of the company to wind up voluntarily, it would be see out in the petition—I do not know if it was so, I have not read the petition—the petition is the first-thing on the file—they could present a petition for a compulsory winding up—the Court would have nothing to do with it—it would be wound up by the liquidator himself, who is appointed by the shareholders, but an application can be made to the Court—after that any person or shareholder who opposes can petition the Court for a compulsory winding-up order or supervision order—the result of which is that if there is a supervision order the mere winding up is continued by the liquidator, but subject to the supervision of the High Court—a creditor can always press for a compulsory winding-up order apart from a supervision order—in this case I find that a compulsory winding-up order was made—the order is on the file—Mr. Grimwade was the liquidator appointed by the shareholders voluntarily—the petition was presented on the 4th of May, 1897, by George William Fowler Tomlin, a shareholder of the company—it was heard on Wednesday, the 19th May, and the compulsory order was made—that application was supported by the affidavit of Mr. Walter Richard Burgoyne Watts, and that was the object with which that affidavit was filed—Mr. Tomlin was a shareholder—he, in fact, was not a creditor at all, but a shareholder—Burgoyue Watts at this particular date was not a shareholder, in May, 1897—the affidavit has been read—I was not in court when the petition was heard—a com<lb/>pulsory winding up order was made—the last paragraph of the order is this, "And it is ordered the costs of the said Walter Richard Burgoyne Watts be taxed and paid together with £15 15s. in respect of the costs</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189807250142"/>
               <p>of W. Tomlin, and £10 10s. the amount allowed by the court in respect of the said company out of the assets of the said company"—the petition was presented by Mr. Tomlin; the company appeared, and Burgoyne Watts appeared as a creditor—the order as to costs was £15 15s. to Mr. Tomlin, and a sum of £10 10s. to the company, and they ordered Mr. Burgoyne Watts' costs to be taxed and paid to him out of the assets of the company—that is on the petition that was heard on the 19th of May—it was a shareholder's petition—the only affidavit of any creditor in respect of the petition to wind up compulsorily is Mr. Walter Richard Bargoyne Watts—I cannot say if this is the Official Receiver's file—the printed statement of affaird made by the Receiver after the order is on the file—in the statement of affairs there are two unsecured creditors for £208 15s.—one of them was the secretary, I think, Mr. Scare—in order to get a public examination of the directors it is necessary to have a compulsory winding up order under the Act of 1890, on the Official Receiver's report—it can only be got if there is a compulsory order, under section 8—under a supervision order there can be no such order made.</p>

                  </hi>. In 1892 I entered the service of Lupton—he was at that time carrying on the business of an outside broker—I remember towards the end of 1892 his bankruptcy, and in 1892 I remember the business being turned into a limited liability company—I audited certain books, the cash book chiefly—I was paid 30s. weekly—I was there from ten till five, not after five—I had occasionally work in the evening—when the business was turned into a limited company I signed the memorandum and articles of association and became a director of the company called James V. Turner Lupton and Company, Limited—I had shares in the company—they were given to me—as a matter of fact money was handed to me to pay for the shares by one of Mr. Lupton's brothers—after I became a director of the company my salary continued the same, and I always received it—from time to time Lupton had six brothers employed in his office, never all at the same time—there was a clerk there in the employment named Mackenzie—Mackenzie and I sat in what was called the general office—there was another office called the telephone office—a clerk named Coraper and another clerk named Cries sat in that office—I knew Coward first by his coming to the office—I cannot give a date for it—I have seen him at the counter often before he was in any way connected with it—after he became connected with the business he had an office—for a short time he was in a small room we knew as the private office—that was only for a week or two, and after-wards he went downstairs in the basement in the same building; the <hi rend="italic">City Times</hi> office it was after; but whether it was at first I will not be</p>

               <p>sure—I knew Watts by sight—the one I took to be the clerk I knew as Watts, and the other I knew as Burgoyne—there were a dozen clerks sometimes, counting the boys, in Lupton's office—when Coward went downstairs to the <hi rend="italic">City Times</hi> office there was nobody employed in the same room with him; I think there was in the same set of offices—when Turner, Lupton and Company, Limited, was first started, I believe Stevenson Lupton and Woolaston signed the cheques for a few weeks, and after that I signed with Stevenson Lupton—I believe Mr. Woolaston, the chairman, signed first—I did afterwards—I thought they, would be required in the course of business, and I knew my signature would be required; so I signed—I had the key of the safe; I could get the cheque book whenever I wanted it—I do not think Woolaston could—nearly all the cheques drawn were entered in a book before pay day, and a man would come for a cheque and perhaps I should draw it and perhaps I should not—I have drawn cheques there—I have drawn cheques for the purposes of the business, not for any other purpose—I often signed blank cheques—the only times I can tell you when I signed any particular number was when I was ill in bed, and then I signed fifty at a time on two occasions—at other times I never counted them—I signed what I thought was necessary—when the thing started I was a director, so were Stevenson Lupton and Carlton Woolaston—Stevenson Lupton is not the defendant—there were three directors—after a time Stevenson Lupton ceased to be a director and left London altogether—I continued to sign cheques up to Decem<lb/>ber 5th or 6th, 1895—I was not in the office all the time—Lupton controlled the business of Turner Lupton and Company, Limited—he managed for the limited company—the limited company consisted of the shareholders who held shares—I could not tell who held shares—we had a meeting of the shareholders—there was a Mr. Simons at the meeting—he was connected with Ind, Coope &amp; Company—he was a shareholder; I think he held 50 or 100 shares—as an accountant I should not call it a balance sheet, but a statement of affairs was made up every fortnight, after every settlement—there was never a balance sheet of the company—I never saw a balance sheet such as would be produced at a meeting of shareholders—Mr. Mackenzie was a shareholder, and Crick, I believe, and Comper—I do not know who Andrew Wilson was—I do not remember what the capital of the company was—while I was there there were some companies promoted—the Lydenburg I believe was—I went round to the office of the Lydenburg—Mr. Lupton asked me to go—the reason he gave me at the time was that there was no one in the office when he had just come from there, and would I go over, and I went and stayed there one day, and the next day I was asked to go again, and I did go—I went there every day except Sunday for rather more than two months—I did very little of the business of the company, the secretary did the work; I was not there to do the work—if the secretary was not there then I gave a receipt for the transfers to whomever brought them, and took the fees—I was there practically all day except when I went out for an hour in the middle of the day—unless I went out for ray own requirements I was there—I was there part of September, October, November, and part of December—in September and October I do not remember a board meeting being held, but then they might have held one</p>

               <p>—when I was out I often stayed out an hour and a-half at dinner if I required to—I was a director of Lupton and Company; I remember a meeting on December 5th of the Lydenburg—I heard talking in the private office; I was not at the meeting; I was in the outer office—the talking attracted my attention; the doors were closed; I could not hear what passed—after this Marshall left, he told me he had resigned when he came out—after that meeting Lupton sent for me to Copthall Buildings, and I went—I believe he asked me why I had made such a damned fool of myself—his idea was that I had been at the meeting, and had said something I ought not to have said, but I was not there—I think he said I bad better stay away—I did not go to the office again after that, neither the office of the Lydenburg nor Turner Lupton and Company—I took my salary in lieu of notice for about six months—I went on drawing it every week—I went and called for it—I think on one or two occasions it was sent to me—I was drawing my salary down to June or July, 1896—that was when I first heard that Turner, Lupton and Company was being wound up—I made an affidavit—my salary ceased at about that time—I do not know who commenced the litigation about the winding-up; Woolaston told me about it—during the time I was away for the six months taking my salary I did not sign any document at all—I transferred my shares to someone—I signed a blank transfer—Mr. Lupton had got a private office.</p>

I was in Mr. Lupton's office—I never saw Bertrand Nash there, except one evening when he came and wanted to get employment for night work—when he was there I believe he signed his name on a blank piece of paper to see whether he could write well enough for the work, and then he was told he was not old enough and he was given 6d. and sent away—on that occasion he only signed his name once—he did not sign any agreement or witness anything—I remember in 1895 the introducting to the office of this Surkers boschkop property—it belonged to the Lionodale "Company, which was represented by a Mr. Cummings—I believe he is a director of various companies in the City—he is to be found in Gracechurch Street——5,000 was paid by two cheques, one of—1,500 and the other of—3,500—that would be in September, 1895, I think—a firm of solicitors were employed on behalf of the Lionsdale Company; a firm at 77, Cornhill, Dale, Newman and Hood—at the time of the introduction of this property certain reports were in the office with regard to it—I saw them—I under-stood they went to the Company's office afterwards—I saw them tied up together in a packet; they were all kept together, and when the Lyden-burg Company was started they did not continue to be at Mr. Lupton's office—I knew of negotiations going on with regard to options of other properties besides the Surkersboschkop—Mr. Solomon was the gentleman from whom those options were obtained—I do not know where he is now—I believe he came from South Africa—there was a good deal of money paid to him, I should think, in respect of those, between—6,000 and £7,000, by Turner Lupton and Company—I saw the papers referring to the options—I cannot say what language they were in; they were certainly in a foreign language—I believe the area the options covered was something near 30,000 acres; I understood that at the time—Lupton and Company had a large business in shares, and when blocks of shares were taken, whatever company it was in, they were usually put in the names of the clerks—that was for the more convenient dealing with the transfers—the shares of about 100 different companies were dealt in at one time—when they acquired a quantity of shares they put them in the names of the clerks for convenience, and if they had them for sale—I never signed the name of Pope; some shares were put in that name—I remember Colonel Lambart and Major Prust coming on one occasion—the reports</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189807250147"/>
               <p>were taken into the private office to them; I think Mr. Lupton was present—I took them in and also the documents relating to options—they were taken into the room when Colonel Lambart and Major Prust were there.</p>

The transfer to Mr. Stephenson was in April, 1896—that would be seven or eight months after the incorpora<lb/>tion of the company, and after all the agreements and so forth that I have been speaking of—Nash wrote his name on an ordinary scrap of paper—it was not an agreement or anything of that sort—I cannot say Mr. Stephenson was in the private office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The reports went to the Lydenburg Company's office—the options I speak of were in writing—I believe they went to the Lydenburg Company's office too—the signature of Bertrand G. Nash to this agree<lb/>ment of September 5th, 1895, I should think is Nash to writing, I could not say definitely—I do not know if the Lionsdale Company was taken for the Noltzykof Company first—it was another promotion of Lupton and Company.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the Senior Official Receiver under the Companies' Winding-up Act of 1890—in that capacity I acted as liquidator of the Lydenburg Consolidated Mines, Limited—I had to examine into the books, accounts, and the business of the company generally—I made a very full examination of the history of the company from us promotion to its liquidation—I never got any reports upon the property of the company—there were no deeds of any sort, or any options over any properties—no deeds of any sort or kind came into my possession, the agreement of 5th September, the Strickland agreement, is on the file—I never came in contact with any person named Strickland—I examined the directors and Lupton—I reported to the Court the result of my enquiries before the examination—the order, for examina<lb/>tion was made on my report to the Court—the further report was made before the public examination of the directors and promoter—subse<lb/>quently the matter was brought to the attention of the Treasury, and I laid the information in the case, on which process was granted—at the commencement of my inquiries I communicated with Lupton as the promoter of this company, and I received this letter from him (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), dated May 24th, 1897 (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"To the Official Receiver in Companies Liquidation, 33, Carey Street, Lincoln's Inn. Sir, <hi rend="italic">Re</hi> Lydenburg Consolidated Mines, Limited In reply to your letter of the 22nd inst., I beg to inform you that I was not concerned in the promotion of this company, nor has the company had the am of my offices at any time. Evidently you have been misinformed. I am, dear sir, yours faithfully, L S. Lupton."—I have in the course of my investigation of the affairs of this company had the particulars with regard to the statutory meeting that was held on 15th October, and the report that was read at that meeting—with regard to this property I should have been prepared to sell it if any one would buy it—the difficulty is to get any offer at all, because I have nothing to show that I have got any title; but the Lionsdale, who were the original vendors, offered £100 fow it.</p>

               <p>whether it is registered or not, and that money it is not in my power to spend—I have no reason to doubt that it is registered—the Noltzykof Company bought from the Lionsdale, and at the request of the Noltzykof the Lionsdale transferred direct to the Lydenburg—it would not be unusual for a person or company to buy a property and then have it transferred to the ultimate purchaser—it is done in landed estates every day—I have no reason to doubt that £5,000 was paid to the Lionsdale—I have communicated with Mr. Cummings.</p>

Turner and Company, Limited—up to May 9th, 1893, it was J. V. Turner, Lupton and Company, Limited—up to 5th December, 1895, it was J. V. Turner and Company, Limited—the signatures we honoured on the account of J. V. Turner and Company, Limited, were S. Lupton and E. Mackenzie—at a later date there was Mr. F. Neales' signature—in May of 1893 the persons authorised to sign cheques were Louis Simons Lupton, and W. F.

I am an Examiner in the Department of the Official Receiver in Companies' Liquidation—I have examined the books of the Lydenburg Consolidated Company and the share transfers—I have them here—the company was registered on 24th August, 1895—up to 30th September, 1895, I find that 7,569 shares were transferred out of the name of James Pope for a total consideration shewn on the transfers of £14,780 14s.; up to the 7th December, 10,981 for a consideration appearing in the transferred of £20, 135s. 6d.; up to 14th February, 1896, 12,138 shares had been transferred; the amount is only increased by £22 10s.—all those shares were transferred out of the name of James Pope—of that total number 1,429 were transferred for no ninal considerations, 500 of them being to W. R. Burgoyne Watts—the consideration shown in this transfer (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is £50—I have said nominal consideration; it is £50 for 500 shares; it is a part of the shares standing in the name of James Pope—687 shares were transferred to Mrs. Josephine Florence Lupton—the considera-tion on the face of the transfers for that was £10; dated the 23rd July, 1896—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189807250150"/>
               <p>7,862 shares were standing in the name of James Pope 15th February, 1896—they were transferred into the name of Comper, I believe on 14th February—that exhausted all the shares in the name of Pope—there were sales by W. R. Bnrgoyne Watts of the 500 shares held by him between the 2nd March and the 21st July, 1896, at £342, I believe—from the 19th June up to the date of the winding-up order further shares were transferred into Com per' a name to the amount of £460—that would make an aggregate of 8,322 in the name of Comper—1,942 shares were sold for a consideration of £885 11s. 10d.—of those 1,942 shares, 400, I think, are Mr. Stephenson's—the consideration for that is five shillings—£885 would represent the price of 1,942 shares, deducting the 400 from 1,942—of the 400 shares transferred to the defendant Stephenson, 299 shares were sold for £449 10s.—at various dates between 17th April, 1896, and February, 1897 there was a sum of £801 17s. 6d. paid to the company by Turner, Lupton and Co., and £111 11s. 3d. paid to the company for directors' fees—£1,200 was paid in respect of a sale of property to the Umtali and the Abercorn companies, £12 was lent to the company by Mr. Thompson, the secretary, and £42 10s. came from various sources—that makes a total of £2,167—the directors' fees paid according to the cash book were £654 15s. 6d.—the secretary was paid £196 10s.; there was commission to somebody for £100 and £33 15s. returned—I have included the £33 15s. in the statement of monies received for them—monies were paid to Turner, Lupton and Company amounting to £451 9s. 1d.—I do not know what it is for; there were fees of registering the company in South Africa and other amounts which I put in the same heading amounting to £354 Os. 7d.—there was a payment of £353 made to both the solicitors, and £204 8s. I have pot under various odd headings, making a total of £1,996 3s. 2d,—£171 16s. 7d. was the balance at the date of liquidation.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the Metropolitan Police, New Scotland Yard—on the morning of the 9th March, I was with Sergeant Harris, at Highgate, and had a warrant for the arrest of Lupton; I saw him come out of a house atighgate, I followed him to the City, and stopped him at Broad Street Railway Station—I said, "I think your name is Lupton." He said, "Yes, Louis Simons Lupton." I said, "I am Inspector Richards, and this is Serjeant Harris from Scotland Yard. I have a warrant for your arrest for conspiracy in con<lb/>nection with the Lydenburg Consolidated Mines, Limited." He said, "Can I go to my brother's office." I said, "No."—I took him to the Police-station—the charge was entered, and read to him—he said nothing. About half-past eleven on the same day I went to 77, Gresham Street and there saw Walter Richard Burgoyne Watts. I said to him, "Is your name Waiter Richard Burgoyne Watts?" He replied, "Yes" I said, "I am a police-officer and have a warrant for your arrest in con<lb/>nection with the Lydenburg Consolidated Mines, Limited." He replied "I do not know anything about it. I am a creditor for £1,200. I do</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189807250151"/>
               <p>not understand it. I know nothing about it"—I took him to Bow Street Police Station—on the way there, he said, 'I do not think I registered the company. I never attended any of their meetings." The charge was read to him at the station? Re said, "Yes, all right."—On the 10th March, at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, I went to tit. Michael's Alley, Cornhill, and there saw the defendant Stephenson in a public hones called "The Jamaica"—I said, "Stephenson, you do not remember me."He said, "No, where did I have the pleasure of meeting you," I said, "Your name is Stephenson," and he replied, "Oh, yes" I said, "I am a police-officer. I have a warrant for your arrest." He said, "Are you joking"? I said, "Certainl not." He said, "What is it for"? I said, "It is a warrant in connection with the Lydenburg Consolidated Mines, Limited." He said, "I know." I said, "cannot read the warrant here, come round to your office"—we went round to No. 3, Newman's Court—I there read to him the warrant, charging him with conspiracy and fraud. He said, "I know nothing about it Well, of coarse, I do now you have read that." I said I would search the office—I found the writing desk was locked, and I asked for the key. He replied, "I have not gut it." I took hold of the desk as though I was going to break it open. He asked, "Must you do that"? I said, "Yes." He then handed me the key. While I was speaking somebody came into the office and spoke to him-something was said about the case coming on at Bow Street—Stephenson said, "Have you found out anything, captain"? The captain replied, Yes, they come up again to-day at Bow Street, at 11 o'clock." Sergeant Harris said, "You have made a slight mistake." I said, "Yes, it is 4 o'clock," I then told the gentleman who we were, and he left the office. The defendant said to Major Prust, who came to the office, "Watts got up the whole thing." On the way to the station he said, "Coward intros used me to Lupton, and he afterwards told me that Lupton was an unprincipled blackguard. It was rather too late then. "I subsequently searched the desk in Stephenson's office. On the 13th May, I arrested the defendant William Prank Burgoyne Watts at the Bow Street Police Court---a warrant had been issued that morning charging him with being a party to the conspiracy—on the warrant being read, he simply said "Oh"—subsequently he had some conversation with me—when I searched the desk at Stephenson's office I found some books and papers—I found a cash book showing monetary trans-actions with Lupton and Co. and Major Prust; and a rough note in Stephenson's handwriting, apparently for entry in the minute book of the Lyldenburg; in reference to the appointment of Mr. Briggs as secretary; this letter from Mr. Coward, My dear Hunter,—Had we not better elect your man as secretary and give notice to the bank, otherwise we shall not be able to draw any cheques.—Yours always, J. M. C."; and this extract from the minutes with regard to the appointment of secretary; and a letter on the <hi rend="italic">City Times</hi> paper, 32, Fort Crescent, Margate. September 9th. "My dear Stephenson,—Sorry to hear of your accident why did you not let me know before? I am recuperating down here, so have only just got your letter, consequently could not inform L. of your inability to see him to-day, but I doubt not Tuesday will do. Have the matter perfectly clear on the lines I wrote. Hope you are better by this.—Yours</p>

               <p>faithfully, J. M. Coward. The company's seal is in my office for you if you want it. Shall be up on Friday morning"; also this from Lambart to Stephenson about the 7 1/2 per cent.—then there is a telegram which had been addressed to Mr. Lambart about the meeting of the 15th October: "Kindly attend meeting of Lydenburg at Cannon Street held to-day at 12 o'clock, noon; a letter on the paper of the Lydenburg Consolidated from Mr. Thompson with reference to the notice of a meeting, and later on with reference to a transfer. Then there is a letter to Stephenson as to Mr. Thompson having seen Mr. Lupton with reference to making arrangements for opening a banking account and a communication from Thompson. Later, there is a letter from Lupton with regard to the transfer of Lydenburg shares and a letter from Abbott of the 1st April, saying that "Lupton's brother had no instructions to pay cheques to the Lydenburg." Then there are notices of meetings and other documents. Then there is a letter from Coward to Stephenson: "I can't very well issue special numbers to puff your friend's wares. I said the matter would appear in next issue, which is to-morrow. Your friend called yesterday, and I told him so. After all, where do I come in?"—Mr. Stephenson occupied the offices which I entered about 30 years I think—I had no search warrant—I never ask for a search warrant when having to break an office desk when I arrest a man—I think when I arrest a man I am entitled to search his premises without a warrant.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. TRAVERS HUMPHREYS</hi>. I have been in charge of this case from the very commencement—I was present at all the hearings at Bow Street except one—there were about 12 hearings altogether—I was present on the second hearing on the 18th March, when Major Trust was called as a witness—quite at the commencement of his examination I remember Major Trust saying that he had never seen the defendant Walter Richard Burgoyne Watts—he was then the only person of the name of Watts in the dock—at that time the defendant William Watts was in Court—he stood up in order that he might be identified as the person who had attended some of the meetings of the Lydenburg Company—I saw him in attendance from that day for the nine following hearings at Bow Street up to the 13th May—I heard in the course of those proceedings that William Watts was to be called as a witness on behalf of his brother—he told me—no warrant and no applica<lb/>tion for a warrant against him was made until the 13th May, the tenth hearing at the police court.</p>

               <p>Lydenburg Concessions coming into our office—it came into our office and I recollect the memorandum and articles of association being prepared—Herbert Horsfall was the conveyancing clerk in the employ of Messrs Burgoyne Watts and Company—he has died—he prepared the memorandum and articles of association in our office—I remember the agreement of the 5th September which has been referred to here as the Strickland agreement, 1895 Horsfall prepared that—the word "inclusive" there is in Horsfall's handwriting—that would be in the ordinary course of his work as conveyancing clerk, when he examined it with the draft, no doubt—I went to the office of the Lydenburg Consolidated with that agreement—I went to the office of the company and fetched this agreement away for the purpose of registering it—it required legislation under the Companies Acts at Somerset House—in August and September, 1895. Walter Richard Burgoyne Watte was in attendance at the office—it continued for some months before August and after September.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. TRAVERS HUMPHREYS</hi>. William Watts was my senior managing clerk—in receipt of a weekly salary—I attended a meeting of directors at the Lydenburg Company's offices on December 5th, 1895—I went with Watts—he did not appear to know Mr. Stephenson or Colonel Lambart, but he knew Mr. Coward—he was introduced at that meeting by Coward to the other directors—he did not appear to have met them before—the 5th September agreement, the Strickland agree-ment, was among the documents produced—my recollection is clear upon that—there appears upon the back of this document "Copy on brief 4th December, 1895" that is in pencil and in Horsfall's handwriting—the copy having been made on 4th December, it was produced to the directors ou 5th December in my presence—I recollect Mr. Thompson, when he was made secretary of the company, calling at the office of Burgoyne Watts and Co.—he asked me for dates on which meetings had been held by the Lydenburg Company—he said he proposed to write up a new minute-book—I had the old minuie-book at that time—I gavehim what dates I could—he then went away and brought me back the new ininute-book when it was written up—he said he had been to see the signatories, when they would not sign the book—some of them were known to me—to my knowledge they were not known to Mr. William Watts—I was asked to get them—they did not know Mr. Thompson—it was only a formal resolution that they had to sign—I went to those gentlemen, and they signed the minute a in my presence, and I took the book back to Thompson—I never saw the old minute-book again—I last saw it in Thompson's possession—he brought it down when he came to the office to ask for the information—he must have taken it away again to make up the new minute book. He could not make it up without.</p>

Turner Lupton and Company, Limited, was the client in connection with the Lydenburg who brought the Lydenburg out—I knew Mr. Lupton, his managers and clerks in connection with Turner Lupton and Company, Limited—We have had instructions at times from Mr. Lupton—I know that Lupton and Company, Limited, is registered as a company</p>

               <p>under the Companies Acts—I knew it was a limited company—I do not know that I was at the office when we first had any business for Lupton and Company, Limited—I have seen Louis Simons Lupton frequently—not very frequently at the office, but in the street down Copthall Buildings way—I should think he was a client of Burgoyne Watts—Burgoyne Watts registered four or five companies for him—not fifteen or sixteen—there was the Lydenburg—there was the Jumper Extension—not the African Gold Concessions—the African Gold Mining Company—he acted for several companies that had nothing to do with Lupton—there may be some more—some of them did not get further than the registra<lb/>tion of the company—we registered the Abercom Keefs—and the Umtali—we acted as solicitors to the African Gold Concessions—I do not remember having played any part beyond that of a clerk—I did not purchase from the African Gold Concessions property that was to become the property of the Abercom—all I did was to act as trustee for a company to be formed, called the Abercom, I believe, It was as trustee for a company to be formed—I do not know in what capacity I was doing it—it was only a formal matter—I only know I was acting as trustee—the agreement was prepared and registered by Burgoyne Watts &amp; Co.—I was described there as an insurance agent—I was clerk to the solicitors, Burgoyne Watts &amp; Co., but I was an insurance agent as well—I do not know upon whose instructions the memorandum of the 5th September was prepared—Horsfall prepared the draft—I could not tell where he got his instructions from—this draft agreement was sent over to Turner Lupton &amp; Co., Limited, for the signature of Mr. Strickland to be obtained to it—at that time Burgoyne Watts &amp; Company were the solicitors to the Lydenburg—I think we were not present when the agreement was signed—it is signed by the directors and witnessed by the secretary—after it was signed I took it up to be registered—I got it from the office of the company—we were solicitors to the Lydenburg, we did not know who the secretary was—we had no idea what Mr. Nash was, we made no enquiry—this is my writing upon the agreement as witnessing the execution of it by the directors, but I did not witness it—"witness to the signature "of so and so—that is in my handwriting—my name is not on that—"witness to the sealing of the Lydenburg Consolidated Mines, Limited," and there is a signature of George Strickland—I wrote the whole of that in—that was not before I sent it, but when the agreement was handed to me—after it had been executed by Stephenson &amp; Coward, directors of the company—I did not know who Bertrand G. Nash was—the agreement was handed to me—it was fully executed, that is to say, the signature of Stephenson, Coward &amp; Nash were all effected—Somerset House will not accept the agreements unless they are in, unless there is an attestation clause in—that is their rule—it is witness to the sealing of the agreement and to the signing of the name of Mr. Strickland which took place in the presence of Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Coward—I wrote in there Nash as witness to the signature of Strickland—I got this agreement completely executed in this way from the office of the Lydenburg company—I cannot say from whom—I know I got it, because I first registered it—I first knew that Bertrand G. Nash was a boy of twelve years of age at the police court—the duplicate agreement came from my possesion—I have not added in</p>

               <p>any attestation clause—I see here, "After deducting the actual registration fees received, our costs amount to £250, which include the drawing, preparation and printing of the articles and memorandum of association, also approving the title of the company to the property acquired by them, and the intricate work done since the formation of. the company"—I really could not tell what the intricate work was—after that letter of March 11th Mr. Burgoyne Watts did not get money from Mr. Lupton—I believe he got on 25th March a cheque for £150, bat it has nothing to do with this—it was a coincidence if he did receive that money. I do not know that he did—I could not say what it was for, I know it was not for this because costs were proved in the winding up for 200 guineas—one objection to deliver a bill of costs was that the directors had not acted upon the advice that Mr. Watts gave them, and our bill would have shown that Mr. William Watts gave them certain advice which they did not think fit to take, stopping the company going on without any working capital.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> We gave the directors certain advice as appears by the minutes—that would not affect Watts—the firm of Burgoyne Watts at the same time as I was there engaged in a large number of matters in no way connected with Turner Lupton and Company—I was there from 1887—during that time they carried on the 01 unary business of solicitors—they were solicitors to other companies apart altogether from these—part of a solicitor's business is to prepare memoranda and articles of association—he takes his instructions from whoever is concerned, and simply prepares them on that—Mr. Horsfall was in the employ of Burgoyne, Watts and Company about six or seven years—when he died last March he was about forty—the firm consisted of Mr. Walter Richard Burgoyne Watte—he started as Burgoyne Watts and Company in 1887—he was the only partner—his brother was only managing clerk, my senior—in April, 1894, we received instructions from Mr. Schloss to register a company called the <hi rend="italic">City Times</hi>—as a matter of fact there was some hitch and a question of the rights of the paper that could not be transferred, and the company was not registered till November, 1894—when the company was registered Lupton and Turner Lupton and Company were not our clients; we bad not been introduced to them at that time—we were not brought into connection with Turner Lupton and Company until December, 1894; not in connection with the <hi rend="italic">City Times</hi> at all—it was in connection with the African Gold Concessions, I believe—I was generally an outdoor or an indoor clerk in Burgoyne, Watte and Company's office—except what I saw from going through the office I should not know what the in<lb/>structions were that were given.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the Magistrates at West Ham Police-court—I produce certified copy of the depositions taken by me at West Ham Police-court on May 26th on a charge of stealing a bicycle against John Bagalay Adcock, a witness in this case, also exhibits re<lb/>ferring to that charge—Harvey was called as a witness for Adcock—he signed the deposition, and I have the original signed by the Magistrate as well—the charge was dismissed on June 27th—this is my note. <hi rend="italic">Francis Harvey says</hi>: "I am manager at Mile End depot, and have been thirty years. Prisoner is also in same employ, and has been eighteen years, not under me. He is an auditor, and attends twice a week to audit the accounts of the depot. On May 7th I purchased a second-hand Maynard bicycle from a man named Payne, of 13, Floriston Street, Bow. He is a dealer. He gave me a card. I have had previous dealings with him. I paid him £4 13s., and he gave me the receipt produced. The bicycle produced in court by Hutton is the one I so bought on May 7th. I handed bicycle to the prisoner. He said, 'I have friends who require bicycles, and as you have already sold me one, I think I can sell this.' I allowed him to tike it away." <hi rend="italic">By the Magistrate.</hi> I put price at £7, prisoner to have commission of 10s. I did not go on this bicycle. It stood in office from 7th to 16th. I have bought seven altogether. I have two boys and two girls, and I wanted one for each and myself. I have seven bicycles now. I bought most of them of William Payne, and I have I think a receipt for each one at home. I paid Payne in cash for the machines at the time. I have sold two machines, one to Adcock and one to a friend of his, before this one. I got £6 each for them. I gave him a receipt. He gave me the money in two amounts. I think I bought all seven from Payne within past twelve months. I did not like Rickett Smith's names coming out—that's why I objected to its being known. Payne is a bicycle dealer, and a tradesman near me told me he had bicycles to sell.</p>

I sold the second bicycle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to Mr. Adcock, the prisoner, about February 10th, 1898. I produce the receipt. I bought it of Payne. It is one of the seven I bought. I bought it, I think, in December, 1897. All seven bicycles I purchased are second-band machines, Payne brought me other bicycles beside the seven. I never went to Payne's until after the prisoner was arrested. A coffee-house keeper recommended him to me. I have four bicycles at my place now." The seven receipts handed in by Harvey, in addition to five, which were not exhibited, but which were retained by the Court, are:—"May 7th, 1898, W. Payne, 13, Floriston Street—Bought of W.

I live at 4, William Street, Woolwich, and am of no occupation—I am seventy-three years of age—on July 19th, about 11.40, I was in Union Street, on the right-hand pavement, and the prisoner, whom I did not know before, came across from the Duke of Sussex, and walked before me about thirty yards, and then heard him footsteps, and went on about forty yards, and saw him by a lamp poet—he struck me on my chest, and took hold of my watch—I held it, and he broke the chain—I afterwards found the watch in his pocket, and the chain broken, and a compass and wheel attached—I value them at £6—I gave £8 15s. for them—the prisoner ran down Union Street—I gave information, and on the Thursday afternoon I picked him out from a lot of men at the station.</p>
