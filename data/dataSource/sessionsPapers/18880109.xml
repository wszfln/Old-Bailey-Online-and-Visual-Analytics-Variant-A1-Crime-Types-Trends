I am landlord of the Foresters' Arms at Heston, some distance from Brentford—on 19th December I came home after 10 p.m., the prisoner and other men were in the tap-room—I went in to have some tea and dinner, and afterwards went into the tap-room—the prisoner was talking to my son and one or two others—they had got an old gun of mine to pieces, but were doing nothing with it—the prisoner made a very disgusting remark, and my wife and children being by, I told him if he did not use better language than that he had better leave the place—he made some remark to me—I said he had better go—he told me I could not put him out—I said I had as leave knock his brains out as look at him—I then took him by the collar and put him out—I took up the stock of the gun but did not use it to help the prisoner out, I put it down before I took him by the collar—he went away, and 20 minutes or half an hour afterwards came back with a double barrelled gun and said "I will show you what I will do," he was holding the gun in both hands upwards and had cocked it—I jumped up and took hold of the barrel, and took the prisoner by the collar with my other hand, and I and my son put him out; in the struggle after we got outside the gun went off, the prisoner had hold of the gun at the time by the stock, and I had hold of it then about the middle—as soon as the gun went off some of the others wrenched the gun away from us both—I held the prisoner on the ground, the others pulled me away from him, and he went off, and I did not see him again till the police brought him back about 3 o'clock in the morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker's assistant, at 31 King Street, Twickenham—on 16th December, about 9 a.m., the prisoner came in and said that he wished to pay two shillings off a watch which was in the window for sale—he gave me this florin, and I gave him this receipt—after he left I was going to put it in the till, and saw that it was bad—I put it on one side, and in the evening he came again, and said that he wished to take the watch and pay the balance, eight shillings—he tendered four other bad florins out of this purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said "Where did you get this money from?"—he said "I had it in wages; two shillings was given me this morning and the other four this evening by my employer; I am house boy at The Laurels, Belmont Road"—I said "The first florin you brought me was wrong, and the other are wrong"—he said "If you won't say anything I don't mind telling you the truth; I picked them up in the Arragon Road in an old purse"—that was not five minutes' walk off—I went to the station, got a constable, and give him in charge.</p>

On 16th December, about 8.30 p.m., Mr. Lee came to the station, and I went with him to his shop and saw the prisoner there and purse on the counter containing five counterfeit florins—Mr. Lee said "This boy has passed this money to me; he has told me one or two different tales about them; first he said that his master gave them' to him, and then he said he found them in the road"—I took him to the station, and found on him an old bank book and 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I said "Have you any more bad money"—he said "No"; but in the cell I requested him to remove his boots, and in his left boot I found a counterfeit florin—I said "What about this?"—he made no reply.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I made inquiries, and found that he has a very good character—he had cashed one florin that morning, and bought a pair of skates for ninepence—he had been page boy at The Laurels 12 months, and before that he was at Mr. Bowen's a greengrocer, at Twickenham, and seven months at another place.</p>

I am surveyor to the Guardian Fire Office—on 26th September I went to 24, Goodman's Yard, in consequence of this proposal—the premises were then closed—I went again on 6th October; the prisoner was there then—I went over the whole house; there was a single room on each floor with the exception of the ground floor, where a small part was partitioned off, and a shed communicated; the two top floors were absolutely empty; in the first floor there was an iron bedstead, rather a common one, with a little bedding on it, two or three cheap prints on the walls, and two chairs; I have no recollection of anything else—the shop was a small chandler's shop for the sale of grocery and provisions, very little stock, a wooden counter, scales, and a five-gallon can of paraffin—the prisoner went over the house with me—I went into the cellar, there was nothing there but rubbish, nothing insurable—I said to the prisoner that I supposed he had got more property coming in—he said yes, that was so, he was waiting to see how the business answered before he had all his furniture in—I formed a very rough estimate of the value of the property, between 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the outside—the fittings and scales and the shop would be the most valuable part—I reported unfavourably and the insurance was not effected.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">These were both signed Paul; the first stated that as to the reference they had applied about, the name should be Martin and not Mott; and the second stated that the above lady was highly respectable and in a position to pay the rent, and that having known her a considerable time he considered her a desirable tenant.</hi>) Shortly after that Martin came again—I had previously given this agreement to her to get executed, and she brought it back as it now appears—she said that her name was Mrs. Martin—she gave her name as Mott in the first place, but afterwards she said she had made a mistake and her name was Martin—that was between the time of her first calling and the time of her taking the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am solicitor to Mr. King, who was interested in 73, Elsham Road—in consequence of instructions received from him I called on 20th August at 73, Elsham Road; Smith opened the door, I asked for Mrs. Allen; she said "Mrs. Allen is at Brighton;" she would be returning from Brighton that day, which was Saturday, or possibly not till Monday—she asked me what was my business; I said I wished to see Mrs. Allen personally; I left my card, and when Mrs. Allen returned from Brighton I should be glad to know, that I might call and see her—I called at the house several times between the 20th and 27th; I rang at the door but no one opened it—on 27th Smith opened the door to me, and in reply to my question said that Mrs. Allen had not returned from Brighton, she was still there and my card had been forwarded to her (that was the card I had left on the 20th), but that Mrs. Allen had replied that she did not know me or my business, and she would like to know what I wanted—I then asked Smith if she would kindly give me Mrs. Allen's address at Brighton and I would write to her; she refused, and said "If you want to write to Mrs. Allen you must write here, and your letter will be forwarded"—I then asked her if she could give me Mrs. Allen's solicitor's address, as I wanted to see her on legal business, and it might save her trouble; she declined to give me the name of her solicitor—I asked her for her own name, she declined to give it—I was not satisfied with what I had seen; Mr. King instructed me to levy a distress, and I instructed Mr. Green to levy it—about 6 o'clock on the evening of 27th August Martin called on me in the Elsham Road; she gave the name of Smith, and said she had come with reference to the distress which had been levied at 73, Elsham Road, and although she herself knew little about the matter, she was a very great friend of Mrs. Allen, and had come to see me on her behalf—she said she had just left Mrs. Allen, who was at St. Stephen's Square, Notting Hill; I said I had called at 73, Elsham Road that morning, and that the person who opened the door told me Mrs. Allen was at Brighton; Martin said the person who opened the door was only a servant, and you cannot expect servants to know the movements of their mistresses; I observed "At all events I should have thought servants would know whether their mistress was in town or out of it"—in the result, I said the distress would have to proceed—at that time a man was in possession—she told me Mrs. Allen had in fact taken the house, but that she had never lived there, and she was a great invalid, and the house was not good enough for her, and she had sub-let it to a Miss Smith, who was a lodger, and that I had levied a distress on the goods of a lodger, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188801090042"/>
               <p>they were therefore in a very serious position—I said "If so, it would be just as well for Mrs. Allen to pay the distress out and make things comfortable for her lodger; "Martin said no, Mrs. Allen would do nothing of the sort, and that the distress must proceed; I said it would she said "Well, the distress may proceed, but remember you have not got possession of the house"—I asked Martin for Mrs. Allen's address and the number at St. Stephen's Square; she said "Oh she is not going there to night, she is going to some other square"—I asked her to give me the name and address of Mrs. Allen's solicitor; she refused to do so, and then she left—I was present at 73, Elsham Road when the goods were removed under the distress, I only saw the two female prisoners there—it was early in September, there was a great disturbance—I asked both prisoners where Mrs. Allen was; I think Smith said "Go and find Mrs. Allen yourself; do you think we carry Mrs. Allen about in our arms?"—she said they had paid their rent, and the cheques they had in their possession would show they had paid their rent promptly; I said "Where is the Mary Agnes Smith?" and she said "That is Mary Agnes Smith," pointing to her, "and I am Margaret Smith"—when the goods were being removed their manner was very riotous; they used the most disgusting, abusive, and filthy language to me, to the bailiff, and his man—a crowd assembled outside, and they addressed the crowd from the top of the steps—the goods were forcibly removed—on 8th October I was present when the prisoners were arrested; I went with the officer for the purpose of identifying them—they were arrested at 41, Talbot Road, Bayswater—Martin said a great deal when she was arrested—she said it was all a mistake; that Mary Agnes Smith had signed the lease of 7, St. Laurence Road for and at the request of Mrs. Martin, and that Paul had signed the lease of 75, Elsham Road at the request of Mrs. Allen; that was said in Paul's presence, who admitted it—she said to him "Is that not so, Mr. Paul?" he said "Yes"—I think on 8th October she said Mrs. Martin was in Dublin, and that she had only left for there a few days ago—when we first got there Paul was not there; I asked for his address and she said although he had been in the habit of calling daily she did not know his address—afterwards he came in and was arrested.</p>

               <p>see the man who was in possession—on Monday, 31st, I was served with another document, a declaration made before a solicitor by Mary Agnes Smith, by a solicitor's clerk—afterwards I told Smith I had received another notice; it was a most unusual thing, I should have thought one was sufficient—I could not say what she said—I have seen her write—this is her signature and writing to the best of my belief. (<hi rend="italic">This was a similar declaration to the last, but was sworn before a Commissioner named Davison</hi>—on 2nd September the goods were condemned by two appraisers in the usual way—the female prisoners were present, and behaved more like mad people—Smith fell on her knees and called on the Almighty to curse the whole of us; she said she had never asked for a curse to fall on anybody without its coming—Martin used very violent language, and prevented us getting to the doors to get the goods out—there was a vast amount of confusion—there were some persons outside and three constables, I think—they addressed the crowd from the steps of the house—I received this letter from Mr. Graham Gordon. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he was instructed by Miss Smith, a lodger, to apply for the restitution of goods illegally seized and that he gave him notice not to dispose of them, to any one pending the hearing of the application.</hi>) No proceedings were taken at Hammersmith Police-court as a matter of fact.</p>

On Saturday morning, October 8th, at half past 10, I went to 41, Talbot Road, in company with Mr. Rossiter—I saw the two female prisoners; I told them I was a police officer, and was going to take them into custody on a warrant for conspiring together with a man named Paul, to defraud; I read the warrant to them—Martin said "We know nothing about conspiracy"—Smith said nothing—later on Paul came in at the front door, I said "What is your name?"—he said "Paul, "I said "I am going to take you into custody on a warrant for being concerned with these two other persons, "and read the warrant to him, he said "I was asked to sign the agreement, "Martin said "You remember, Paul, you signed it for Mrs. Allen, "Paul said "Yes"—I sent the female prisoners to the station later on, on account of their aged mother, who looked very infirm; she said she was not safe to be left in the house by herself; I tried to get some one to take charge of her, ultimately the mother had to come with us to the station—Mrs. Ingram was sent for afterwards, and undertook to take charge of the mother—I thought the mother did not look in her right senses at the time—she was afterwards brought up before Mr. Bennett as a person wandering, and by his directions was sent to the workhouse, she is now well looked after at Caterham Asylum.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 24, Elvaston Place, Queen's Gate—I engaged Clark as my servant in 1886, and in the summer of 1887 I took him to Scotland as travelling servant, and stayed in some private houses, but chiefly in hotels, and early in October I was in private lodgings in Edinburgh with Clark—I had given him notice on September 9 to leave on October 9—I asked him if he had made any arrangements—he said "No," and that he should leave service—previous to leaving Edinburgh I sent to the bank, Messrs. Williams, Deacon, and Co., for my pass book, and with it they returned my old cancelled cheques—I looked through them, found them correct, tore most of them in half, and put them in a waste paper basket, to which Clark had access, and I think he saw me do it—I always kept my cheque book in my portmanteau, among my clothes—nobody could know of it except Clark and myself—he used to help me, pack my clothes, and he always had access to my trunk when it was unlocked—my cheques are all numbered the same—he packed up my things, and we came to London on October 27—he left my service the next morning; he said he was going into Suffolk—on November 4 I received an intimation from my bankers, and went to the National Bank, and saw one of the managers—I saw Mr. Lander, and arranged with him that McRae should meet me on the following Monday morning—on the same evening I received a second communication from my bankers, that another cheque had been presented—I then put the matter into the hands of the authorities at Scotland Yard, and went with Sergeant White to the Masons' Arms—Mr. Lander, the landlord, came in, and said that McRae had come—he was shown in, and Sergeant White said "Where did you get this cheque from?" producing the one for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—he said "I got it on Brighton racecourse from a man who I was betting with; the horse I backed won; I remained close to the man, not knowing him, and asked for the money, he told me that I must take the cheque, in part payment, or take nothing: some roughs gathered round us, and I thought under the circumstances it was better to take the cheque"—Sergeant White asked him if he knew anything about any other cheques which had been given on Brighton racecourse—he said "No"—White said "Don't you know anything about a cheque drawn for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—he said "Yes, I do, but I do not think that has anything to do with me"—he was asked if he knew a man named Couchman—he said "I have an appointment with Couchman at 12 o'clock to-day at the Red Cap public-house, Camden Town"—it was then arranged that Sergeant White should accompany</p>

I do not remember saying "I offered to recommend him as steward on board a Peninsular and Oriental steamer"—I heard my deposition read, but I did not notice that—I am familiar with Clark's writing, and when I applied for a warrant I swore that the writing on the body of the cheques was his—Mr. Lander told me that he knew McRae well, and that he was a person of thorough respectability, and had asked him to pass the cheque through his bank, and was to call and inquire to see that it was all right—I told Mr. Lander that the cheques were forged, he was to see McRae, and make an appointment with him, and I went then to meet McRae—McRae said that he met a man in the train, whom he had seen before, and told him he had taken a cheque at Brighton races, and the man told him that he also had one—I do not remember White saying "Do you know where the man is to be found?" nor his replying "Yes, I have to meet him at the Red Cap, Camden Town, at 12 o'clock to-day"—I did not go with White to the Red Cap—I went with White the same day to Scotland Yard, but refused to charge McRae—I saw McRae again at Scotland Yard the same evening, the 7th—I first swore an information on Saturday, November 5, I think—there were three hearings before the Magistrate, and McRae was admitted to bail.</p>

I asked him for the money, and he gave me a cheque for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the rest in cash. I declined to take the cheque, and was pulled about by some roughs"—I said "Do you know anything about another cheque?"—he said "No"—I said "Not a cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—he said "I was coming up in the train, and met a man named Couchman whom I had previously known, and he mentioned the fact that he had taken a cheque on a racecourse. I said 'So have I. 'He said 'Mine is only for a <hi rend="italic">tenner?</hi>"—I said "Do you know where Couchman is to be found?"He said "Yes, I have to meet him at 12 to-day at the Red Cap, Camden Town, and repay him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I borrowed from him the night we came up from the races. "Iwent with him to a public-house in Edgware Road where the cheque was cashed, and he lent me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he produced the book, and said "I picked it up in the bar; it is not all my writing in there"—I pointed to an entry in it, "J. Whiteley, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," and told him that it strongly resembled the endorsement on the cheque—he made no reply—I returned the book to him—he then went with me to meet Couchman—we met him at 12 o'clock, and I asked Couchman how he became possessed of the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—he said "I was at Brighton Races, and backed a horse called Spud for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 5 to 1, in the shilling ring; the horse won, and when I went to receive my money the bookmaker, a short dark man with bushy whiskers, tendered me a cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and my 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. stake money. I objected to take it. The man said it was all right, and I took it"—they then accompanied me to Scotland Yard, where we met Mr. Melville—after McRae was charged he gave me back the pocket-book—I had asked him on the 7th to write his name and address, and he wrote this</p>

Brighton races were on November 3rd—a horse called Spud did win a race, and the price was 5 to 1—I have been on duty on racecourses—he did not tell me that he had copied the entry in the book off the cheque, but he said "I put it in there directly I got the cheque"—he never refused to do anything I asked him to do—he gave me Couchman's name, and the information about him being at Mr. Ridley's house, and he volunteered to go with me to Scotland Yard, but I should have taken him there if he had not—I had no difficulty in finding him—he said to the inspector that he had not tried to change the cheque, but he asked his friend to pass it through his bankers—he gave a correct address, and I made inquiries about his character which were satisfactory—he was taken on a warrant and released on bail—he appeared here last session to take his trial, and the case was adjourned.</p>

I live at 37, James Street, and am assistant to an oilman—on Saturday night, 27th November, about half-past 12, I was going home, and in Compton Street, at the corner of Dean Street, I saw the prisoner fighting with another man—the police interfered and drove them away—the prisoner ran round Frith Street with his coat on his arm—when he got his coat on again he came back again to the corner of Frith Street, and they had a light there—they were again disturbed by the police, and they went on to Cambridge Circus—I followed them, from curiosity—when they got about the middle of the Circus the prisoner turned round and gave Hart a blow in the mouth, and then walked away towards the Dials with two or three more—Hart was behind him, about a foot, close behind him; he was not doing anything, only walking behind—Hart fell on the back of his head—I am quite sure that the prisoner is the man that struck the blow—Policeman Snell came up, a cab was fetched, and Hart was taken to the hospital, and the witness Borgas gave prisoner into custody—I went with them to the station.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant E</hi>). About 12. 15 on Christmas morning I was on duty in Shouldham Street, Marylebone, and was called by the landlord of the Norfolk coffee-house to assist in ejecting a number of men—on going there I saw the prisoner there, and a number of others—at the landlord's request I put them all out—when outside they were dancing and jumping about in a very disorderly manner, and making use of bad language—the prisoner said "What the b——hell right had you to interfere with us?"—I said "It is Christmas morning, and your liberty and dinner with your friends would be of more use to you than quarrelling with me, as I am simply doing my duty"—I was then surrounded by the whole of the prisoner's friends; they were about to attack me, and I took my lamp off my belt and turned the light full on, and kept it in my right hand attempting to defend myself; finding I could not get rid of them, I said to the prisoner "Civility is lost upon you; I shall have to put you away," and I shoved him with my open hand in the side of the face; he immediately turned round and took something from his breast pocket, and struck me in the chest, saying "Take that, you b——"—I felt a stab and a stunning sensation for the moment; I was aroused by some man asking if I was stabbed—at the same time the prisoner, who was standing at the corner, said "You b——s——; I have done you"—I said "I have not done yet; now you shall suffer for what you have done"—he ran away; I ran after him—he ran through Freshwater Place into Homer Street, where I saw Policeman 171 B standing—I cried "Stop thief"—I saw the constable grab at him and miss him—he gave chase—they went on about 30 yards, and both fell—I got up to them, and the constable said "For God's sake hold him; I am stunned"—I eventually secured him—on the way to the station the prisoner said to his friends "Take me away from the b——s——," and threw himself down—Beal and another constable were behind him at the time, and the prisoner threw his foot up and kicked them repeatedly at the side of the head and face—we were pelted by the mob—a stone hit my helmet plate, and bounded from there against a plate-glass window and broke it—eventually six or seven constables came from the station, and carried the prisoner in—I was sent out to execute other duties, and returned to the station about half-past 1—I then opened my coat and found myself covered with blood—there were cuts through my coat, tunic, and two woollen shirts—I felt very faint and queer—a doctor was sent for—I am still under his care—I have suffered a great deal of pain—I did not come out for 10 days.</p>

               <p>the policeman with his open hand smacked him on the face, and said "Do go on now"—the prisoner then ran into the middle of the road, and the policeman too—the prisoner went up to him, and said "I am ready for you now, you b——," and aimed a blow at his chest, and I plainly saw a blade in his hand, as it happened immediately under a street lamp.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 9, Pemberton Road, Islington—I was called to the police-station on 3rd January, and found the prosecutor suffering from wounds on his head and face, and a superficial wound over his left eyebrow about half an inch long, and another at the left side of his chin about the same length, also superficial, but the edges of the cut on his chin were ragged—his right ear was slightly bruised and swollen and tender, and there was a small crack in the cartilage of it about a quarter of an inch long—his neck and jaw around</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188801090064"/>
               <p>the right ear were also red and bruised—on the same evening I examined the drum of his ear, and found that it showed signs of recent injury—I am not at all certain whether he may not have some trouble with his hearing afterwards—the other wounds are quite trivial.</p>

The wound with the ragged edges might have been the result of a kick by a boot; the others might have been inflicted with the fist or by the boot—I think the one on the ear must have been done with a boot, or something like that, as it is unusual for the cartilage of the ear to be cracked in that way, and it shows also very considerable signs of violence.</p>

About 12 o'clock on 27th November I went to Mrs. Golder's house, 1, Sump Court, Cheyne Walk, Chelsea—I said to her "Have you got anything in your room that does not belong to you?"—she has only one room; her nephew, Frederick Golder, and Wright lodged with her—she said "I have nothing but what "belongs to me"—I searched her room, and found on the female's bed (which she was sleeping on in the earlier part of the morning, when I had gone there previously and arrested Frederick Golder) a down pillow in a case, a blanket, a comb, and other articles, all of which Mrs. Morton has identified as her property—I said to her "How do you account for these?"—she said "A sailor chap brought them here and left them; I don't know where he had them from"—I said "Have you seen a paper weight representing five or six dogs, silver or metal?"—she said "Yes, it was on the mantelpiece"—I said "Who put it there?"—she said "I don't know, one of the lads"—I also asked her about the comb, and she said she knew nothing about it—I then arrested her and told her the charge—she said "I did not know they stole them"—when charged at the station with receiving goods stolen by Honeyset and Golder she made no reply—about a quarter to 11 the same day I went to Cook's house, 6, Halstead Road, Fulham, a private house—I saw him in his back yard—I said "I am a police officer; I shall arrest you for receiving, well knowing them to have been stolen, a quantity of stair carpets, a Brussels carpet, a rug, a sealskin dolman, two clocks, and various articles of wearing apparel"—he said "From whom?"—I said "From four lads, three of whom are now in custody at Chelsea"—(I made this note just after I gave my evidence before the Magistrate; it is not a copy of the depositions, I made it from my recollection)—Cook said "What are their names?"—I said "Wright, Golder, and Honeyset, and a lad named Champ, not in custody"—he said "When?" I said "About three weeks ago"—he said "I know nothing about it"—I said "I shall search your house"—he said "You are quite welcome to do that; there is nothing there, only what belongs to me"—I searched, and found four pillow cases, two curtains, two towels, a table napkin, a piece of flannelette, a spirit bottle, a dress skirt, a toilet cover, and four petticoats—those have been identified by Mrs. Morton—they were all in a cupboard and box in Cook's bedroom upstairs, except the spirit bottle, which was in a cupboard downstairs; the bottle had this stopper in it—Cook, his wife, and two sons occupy the whole house, I think—I saw some dogs there, but my sergeant, who was with me, found the dogs there—I arrested the prisoner; he said nothing, nor when charged at the station.</p>

                  </hi>, the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, Metropolitan Police Office, 4, Whitehall Place, 12th November, 1887. "Those notices were very extensively posted in all parts of London on the day they were issued—on the morning of the 12th I received instructions as to my conduct on the following day—in accordance with those instructions, I went to Trafalgar Square on the morning of the 13th—I was in command of 100 constables—the spaces of the Square within the parapets and the line of posts was kept clear by the police on that day—they were so stationed as to leave the footpaths round the Square perfectly clear, and the men under my command were posted at the south-eastern corner of the Square to keep the line of posts there—during the day a very large number of persons assembled in the neighbourhood of Trafalgar Square, and as the day passed along they increased—at about 4 o'clock I estimated the number as from 20, 000 to 30, 000 collected round the Square, and the approaches—there was no disorder whatever until about 4 o'clock—of course there was considerable difficulty in keeping the crowd moving, and getting, the vehicular traffic through, but no disorder, or any attempt to attack the police—at about 10 minutes past 4 o'clock I was standing in front of my men opposite Morley's Hotel—I was looking in the direction of the National Gallery—there was considerable commotion, and I heard more commotion than I had heard before, behind me; I turned round, and I saw the prisoner Graham and also saw Burns there, in a conflict with the police who were under my special command—I had never seen Mr. Graham before; he was close to the police with his hat off—in my opinion at that time there were about 100 or 200 persons in the attack—some of the police had their staves out—I had not given any order to that effect—I saw sticks raised in the air and flourished about; in fact, there was a general scrimmage—I did not observe Graham doing anything, but I saw Burns,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188801090071"/>
               <p>who I well knew—he was then in the water table, just outside the footway, fighting with his fists violently and furiously at the police, who were repelling them—by the water table I mean the little gutters that run in the outer edge of the footway—he was facing the police, close to them, and striking out—I called out to several constables who were near him, one of whom I knew, "Hold him; that is Burns"—that was to Stapleton of the L Division, and I afterwards endeavoured to go to them, but I had some difficulty as the crowd was great, but I went up and caught hold of him by the back of the collar with my right hand, and I said to him "Burns, I was told you were coming to do this"—he replied "I am not Burns"—we then conveyed him through a cordon of the police to the Square—Mr. Graham was there at the time—Burns then said, in answer to something said by somebody else, "Well, I am Burns"—I then handed him over to Sergeant Sheppard, who was inside the Square in charge of a body of police on reserve—at this time there was confusion and disorder outside the Square—I went back to my post directly—they became very disorderly—there was shouting, hooting, and yelling up and down—the mounted police were endeavouring to break them up, and shortly afterwards the Life Guards came up, at least they appeared—there was no disorder up to the time that the attack on the police was made—after that it became very serious indeed—the mounted police tried to break up the crowd, but they failed—the Guards appeared shortly afterwards—in my judgment I think it had become necessary that they should be called out—looking at the character of the crowd and what I saw, I think that a meeting in the Square would have led to a breach of the peace; at all events, I feel convinced that had that multitude been permitted to assemble there serious consequences might have arisen to the peace of the inhabitants and to the neighbourhood generally—in my opinion there were all the elements of disorder there—I don't think they could have been dispersed or controlled without danger of a very serious conflict—I had the opportunity of observing the character of the crowd—there was a fair sprinkling of respectable persons, but the majority, in my opinion, consisted of what we term the London roughs, men of the lower class, who by their appearance and demeanour were ready for anything—in my judgment the assemblage of such persons in large numbers would constitute a public danger—if the attempt to break through the line of police had been successful I have no doubt it would have led to most serious consequences, and I had serious doubts that they would have broken through, if the men had not stood very firm—I was certainly afraid at that moment, owing to the large number of people who appeared determined to force the police ranks—a large number of persons were taking part in that attempt—my line of 100 men were four deep, extending about 30 feet—having had some intimation of what might take place, I had requested that the reserve should be brought up, and we then stood seven or eight deep, with the reserve in the Square; that strengthened my corner.</p>

As far as I could see the crowd of 20 or 30 persons who were gathered together in the Square when this conflict took place were London roughs—of course I saw a large number of people on the other side of the Square, and I could not define what they were—up to that time there had been no disorder, no attempt on the police ranks, only shouting and horseplay—my men were stationed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188801090072"/>
               <p>in the line of the granite pillars, on the asphalte of the Square, in a semicircular form, opposite Morley's Hotel—I think the footpath there is about six or seven feet wide—between my men and the outside would be six or seven paces, I think—I did not see the defendants advance across the street, nor did I see the first collision with the police—I could not say who struck the first blow—I did not see Mr. Graham strike anybody, I did not see him do anything—he was actually in custody when I first saw him—his hat was off; I could not say whether he was carrying it in his hand or not—I could not say whether he had gloves on; I was dealing principally with the other prisoner—I do not think he had a stick, but I really could not say—when the 100 people or so were following I saw sticks in the air—I cannot say I saw any one hit with a stick—there was a considerable crowd—I did not see any policeman hit with a stick—none of the 100 people were arrested except the defendants, as far as I am aware—the 100 people did not come to our way—I was looking towards the National Gallery—there was considerable confusion afterwards—they did not attempt to break the line of police again—the confusion consisted of shouting and yelling and rushing up and down—I heard a window broken afterwards; I could not tell who broke it; it was at the Grand Hotel—I could not tell you the number of police in the Square; I can tell you the number on duty that day preserving order; I should think there were probably about 1, 500 police in the Square, but I could not say—the conflict lasted, I think, about two minutes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Burns.</hi> I saw you struggling wildly against the police, endeavouring, I believe, to get into the Square—I could not say the effect of the blows; you certainly were striking at them—no constable complained to me of being assaulted by you—you were not charged at Bow Street with assaulting the police; you were charged with riot and inciting to riot, I think—I did not see Graham and you approach the Square at first, I only saw you after the conflict had commenced—I gave evidence at Bow Street—I did not see you and Graham arm in arm—I saw you striking out violently—it is impossible for me to say whether one man arm in arm with another could have a conflict with the police in two minutes, I could not define anything of that sort.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There was a very considerable difference between the character of the crowd before the attempt was made on the police and the crowd approaching behind the defendants—we were appealed to by respectable people after this attempt, to help them put of the way—the crowd behind the defendants appeared to me an organised body coming on purpose—I did not know any of those persons; Burns was the only man I knew.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This notice was read as follows: "</hi> Metropolitan Radical Federation. A great demonstration will be held in Trafalgar Square on Sunday, 13th November, at 4 p.m., to demand the release of Mr. William O'Brien, M. P., and other Irish patriots.

James Timms, 6, Queen Anne Terrace, Battersea Park, S. W.") I had not been on duty in Trafalgar Square at all before 13th November, not in connection with any of the meetings; I came there specially for the 13th—up till 4 o'clock all the centre of the Square within the posts and the stone parapet had been kept clear all day from 10 a.m.—there was a cordon of police round the Square—on the east, north, and west there are stone parapets as well—I am not quite sure whether there are stone posts, I forget for a moment—there are steps at the north-east and north-west corners—you enter at the south on the level on both sides of the Nelson Monument—up to 4 o'clock no attempt had been made to force the Square—I went on duty at 10 o'clock—a large number of people had assembled outside the police up to 4 o'clock; they had been moved on by the police in attendance—in my opinion the crowd opposite where I was stationed from 2 to 4 o'clock consisted of a great number of roughs and a great number of respectable people—it appeared to me whenever the roughs saw the opportunity of a great crowd assembled together they hustled people and came up and pushed against the police—there were police outside the cordon who were keeping the mob in order—I was inside the Square—they kept the pavement clear opposite to Morley's Hotel, and helped people who wanted to go along—up to 4 o'clock the first I saw of the defendants was that I saw Graham and Burns coming across the road arm in arm by the post-office by Morley's Hotel—I heard Graham shouting "Now for the Square," but I saw them before that, I saw them coming a short distance away—he was in the roadway when he shouted; his head was turned towards the Grand Hotel on the other side of the street, and he appeared to be shouting to the crowd, who were following, to follow him—all the people in the street seemed following him; all the heads were turned that way—I saw sticks in the hands of the people following—I heard hissing, and people shouting generally—when they got close up to the police the place was full of people, and their heads were turned towards the Square, and they appeared to me to be coming for the Square—I could not say how many were following—Graham and Burns tried to get through the cordon of police to get into the Square—just before they got to the pavement on the Trafalgar Square side Burns let go the arm of Graham and got behind him, kind of pushed him forward—I was a little distance off, and could not see if he pushed him hard—Graham and Burns tried to light their way through the police; I did not see any actual blow struck, but I saw them fighting with their fists as though to try to get through—the people were shoving and pushing behind, and were shortly afterwards dispersed by the police—they waved their sticks at the police—I saw Graham pass through the ranks, he was in custody then—I saw him afterwards at the police-station—Burns said at Bow Street, while he was waiting in the room, "We attacked you at your weakest point"—I should estimate the number of people outside the cordon of police, all the way round the Square, at 4 o'clock, at 40, 000 or 50, 000—I certainly think if that crowd of people had been allowed to get into the Square there would have been danger of serious disturbance to the public peace—they could not have been dispersed without danger to peace and property—Graham seemed excited when coming across the</p>

               <p>Square, but he seemed calm and quite quiet afterwards, when in the Square—I noticed stones thrown before and after—I did not know Graham or Burns before—I saw the police draw their staves—I gave the order because the crowd was so great and the police were being struck at in such a manner with sticks and stones, and I thought it necessary—the police were being struck at with sticks, and stones were being thrown before I ordered them to draw their staves; it was in consequence of that the order was given—it was necessary, in my opinion, in consequence of the way the mob was behaving at that part of the Square—the mob that followed, when Graham shouted, came from the Strand.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ASQUITH</hi>. I first saw the defendants after they had crossed the Strand and were by the post-office at the corner—I did not see them on the refuge in the middle of the street—they appeared to advance in front of the people who were accompanying them; I could see them quite clearly; I don't think there were many people in front of them; there might have been people in front of them, there were people about there—the people who hit at the police were not accompanying Graham and Burns, that was another part, lower down; they did not seem to be following Graham and Burns at that time—I cannot tell if any of the persons who accompanied Graham and Burns hit the police with sticks; there was a general scrimmage, and the people following Graham and Burns fought for three or four minutes; they did hit them with sticks—I cannot give you the name of any policeman who was hit with a stick—I am not aware that any person was arrested at that place for hitting a policeman with a stick—the police got off the pavement a short distance to meet the crowd generally—I did not see who struck the first blow; I cannot say—I heard Graham say <hi rend="italic">"Now</hi> for the Square"—there was a good deal of noise and shouting going on at the time—all I heard him say at that time was "Now for the Square"—when he was crossing the road I did not hear him say "We are come to hold a meeting in the Square"—I did not hear him say "The Square is as free to the people as to the police"—I don't think Graham had got his hat on—I did not observe whether he was holding it in his hand; my impression was he threw it in the air when he shouted—I did not notice whether he caught it again—I don't know if he had it in his hand when he was arrested—I don't know if he had gloves on—I saw him pushing with his fists, but I did not observe whether he had gloves on—I did not see the police use their staves on Mr. Graham—I saw he was wounded when he was taken in the Square after, the scrimmage was over; he had a cut on the top of his head; I did not see blood flowing, I saw the doctor attend him—the people who followed the defendants appeared to come from the direction of Charing Cross Station principally—I cannot say if they were part of the crowd already collected, or a fresh contingent; they all made a rush at once; I was in the middle of the Square the whole of the day—I did not hear Graham say "You need not kill me, boys; I am quite willing to be arrested"—the scrimmage lasted three or four minutes—no attempt was made afterwards on the part of the crowd to break into that part of the Square where I was.</p>

On the afternoon of 13th November, I was on duty at the south-east corner of Trafalgar Square, under the orders of Superintendent Hunt—I was standing in the line of police next to Maitland—about 4, or a little after, I saw persons advancing towards our line; they came from the direction of the Strand and St. Martin's Lane—I heard one shout out "Now for the Square; "I did not see who it was that shouted that, I could hear it shouted above the noise—I saw Mr. Graham about five or six yards from me, I did not notice Burns—Mr. Graham was coming straight for the police ranks, we were standing firm at the time they came in contact, with us; we simply kept our ground—I had not my staff drawn—I did not notice any staves drawn at that time—Mr. Graham was fighting his way, putting up his hands so (<hi rend="italic">describing</hi>) to fight his way through—I put up my hands to keep him back; he said he had as much right to the Square as the police, and he struck me in the mouth with his clenched fist; it was a violent blow, it made my lips swell, and it cut my lip a little, the inside of my lip; my helmet was knocked off close to the kerb—I did not arrest him, he went off to my right—I picked up my helmet—the crowd was so great it pushed him away to my right—there was a considerable number of persons whose force was brought to bear upon the police—I saw no more of him till he was in the Square in custody—he had on brown kid gloves when he struck me, and a brown hard hat, a hard felt hat—I saw several sticks raised, coming in the rush—there was a rush on the police at the</p>

I could not say whether I was standing between 100 and 108, I was standing near them under the command of Superintendent Hunt; Superintendent Giles's men were at the same place; I think they were nearer the column, I won't be sure; I think they were just to the west of Hunt's men, I don't think Hunt's men went quite as far as the Havelock statue, they were next the parapet at the south-east corner—I could not say how many squads there were between Giles's men and the Nelson Monument—as I was stationed there, I saw the two prisoners coming towards the police from Morley's Hotel, crossing the roadway at the bottom of the road that comes down past Morley's Hotel; they walked slowly until they came to the kerb, then they made a rush at the front line of police, of which I was one; they were followed by a crowd, several of them had sticks; Graham said "Now for the Square, we have as much right there as the police," at the same time—I am quite sure that he had his hat on when he struck me—we were standing at the entrance from the Strand, in the Square; I was about three yards from the kerb, on the pavement, I was not against the pillars, I was at the opening—I know the little rows of granite pillars that go along the Square—it might be about six or seven feet, perhaps, from those pillars to the kerb at the outside of the pavement—I was six or seven feet from the kerb—Mr. Graham had crossed the pavement before he came up to me—none of the police to my knowledge had advanced to the kerb, I should have seen them if they had, if the line had been broken I should certainly have seen it—I can say that they did not, they remained in line, as they were before, they certainly did not move forward to meet the defendants—I did not see any of the police hit Mr. Graham, I saw afterwards that he had a wound, I did not see it done—he was four or five yards from me when I first saw him; about that, of course, I did not measure the distance, it might have been two, three, or four yards, I cannot say exactly; it might have been either—he had not hold of anybody's arm to my knowledge, I mean I did not notice it, I did not see whether he had or not, the crowd was so great that I could not see—I did not see Mr. Burns there at all—I did not notice him—I was standing on the left of Martel, Maitland stood next me on my right, we three were next to one another.</p>

I am head waiter at the hotel—on this Sunday afternoon, at 4 o'clock, I was in the coffee-room over the post-office, and saw Mr. Graham who I knew by sight, in the Strand—he turned round to the crowd, raised his hand, and begged the crowd to follow him—I do not think he had a hat on—the street was full of people, but there was a good space where the mounted police were—he then turned towards the Square, and the crowd followed him—I only saw him get as far as the first row of police, and he seemed to come out towards me—this may have been about 20 yards from the Havelock statute—I saw a scuffle, but my view got blocked directly, and I went to another window facing the Square, and saw Mr. Graham being taken through the lines of police into the interior of the Square—one of the officers took a handkerchief from him, and seemed to wipe his face with it, and he took it out of the officer's hands and waved it in a southerly direction—I did not notice Burns—there was a very great crowd at our coffee-room window—it was about 5 o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I do not reside in England; I have been a banker in Australia—on Sunday, 13th October, I was at the Grand Hotel, Charing Cross, and was outside the window, on a ledge on the fifth flat—that is in a direct line from Morley's up to the Church, and I saw all that went on during the collision with the police—up to four o'clock I saw the police stationed in the Square, and saw no attempt to break through them up to that time—a knot of five or six people coming from the Strand first attracted my attention; they were then about three yards from the kerb-stone—I cannot identify any of them—they went towards the refuge, which is almost in the line of pavement I have spoken of, and remained 15 or 20 yards from it in earnest conversation about 20 seconds—(the mounted police had passed through and through the crowd)—they then went forward to the refuge, and I saw one man place his left hand on the right shoulder of a taller man than himself and shuffle along; it was not a decided run—they shuffled forward with a quick, short step till level with the refuge, where they halted for a second or two, followed by three or four only—the same couple then made a run across to the nearest pavement, the south-east corner of Trafalgar Square, followed by about 200 people, who came from the pavement near Morley's Hotel—they produced sticks, and there was such a clattering of sticks and such a noise; they failed to get into the Square—the sticks were brandished in the air; I was 60 or 70 feet above them—they went towards the police; there was a great scrimmage—the police held the field for a minute and a half—I cannot identify either of the prisoners as men whom I saw at the refuge, but I think I saw Mr. Graham there—I think he is the man who was pushed—I cannot identify the man who had his hand on his shoulder—I saw several attempts to pull mounted policemen off their horses, and saw some of them struck with club sticks and ordinary sticks—they did not like to attack the men, but vented their spleen on the horses—I am accustomed to crowds of 100, 000, and I am sure there were half that number in the Square and the Strand and up the Strand—I could see a quarter of a mile up the Strand, and up Whitehall and Cockspur Street, and beyond St. Martin's Church 50 or 100 yards, because I was up a great height.</p>

I was on mounted duty on Sunday, November 13th, and about four weeks previously I had been on mounted duty in the Square, and had seen these assemblies from October almost daily to November 13th—they varied in size, but on some occasions they amounted to considerable numbers—it had been necessary to keep a large force of police either near or in immediate readiness—the assemblies were sometimes very disorderly, but I do not know many of the people who were there—in my judgment the assembling of such persons together was dangerous to public peace and order—it was necessary for the police to follow them when they moved from Trafalgar Square in other directions, for the purpose of safe-guarding the neighbourhood—these assemblies interfered with the ordinary use by the public of the thoroughfares round Trafalgar Square—on Sunday, November 13th, there was a very much larger crowd there than I had seen before—I was there from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., and between 3 and 4 o'clock we had to take action to keep the crowd back to allow the traffic to move, which was seriously impeded, and when we endeavoured to do so there was shouting, yelling and stone-throwing, and I was struck by a stone twice—I did not actually see the encounter between the assailants and the police; I was in the other part of the Square, by the Nelson monument; I saw the rush; I saw that there was action, and I saw the defendants brought inside—after that commotion I endeavoured again to keep a way for the traffic, and to keep people moving, and it became necessary for the public safety that the Guards should be brought out.</p>

There is, I think, no Englishman living, of any party, that will uphold the Government in ordering the police to assault the speakers at a purely political meeting. It is only owing to the fact that some of our men did not arrive in time that the meeting was not held. As it is, this day's work will serve to open the eyes of the masses to what is going on in Ireland every day. One thing I wish you to contradict, that is, that the crowd cheered the Life Guards; the crowd hissed them heartily. Where the cheering came from—and I saw well, being a pri<lb/>soner in the middle of the Square—was from a knot of loungers in the Union Club and the Grand Hotel. This, however, is to be expected, as these gentlemen have seldom seen their masters, the people, so much in earnest as to-day. The whole conduct of the Government was a scandal to a civilised country. I would have undertaken to hold the meeting peacefully with only 50 constables present. The matter shall not be allowed to drop, and I will address a meeting yet in Trafalgar Square of 100, 000 people, and the Government of the day, I care not which it is, will be too glad to allow me.—I am, Sir, your obedient servant, R.

Starting from Charing Cross just before four we reached the Square at the corner of Morley's Hotel at four. We were immediately recognised by the people, who got behind us, and we attempted to go through the cordon of police drawn up at this spot to resist any attempt. The people behind us were repulsed; and Graham and I were struck by the police of all grades, Graham being deliberately struck on the head by a constable with his truncheon, sustaining a scalp wound of an inch and a quarter long, and receiving several blows from the clenched fists of others. My injuries simply consist of several bruises on the head, but no cuts. We were kept in the Square for half an hour, and kept our pledges to speak in the Square by formally announcing to those present, police and men in custody, that we spoke in maintenance of the right of free speech and public meeting.

On 13th November I was in charge of the police in Cranbourne Street—I saw a procession coming from the north and going towards Trafalgar Square with banners and a band, about 4 p.m.—there were about a thousand making their way towards the Square, and I saw some one in the procession with a stick, with which he knocked a constable down—he was taken in custody, and afterwards convicted—the police stopped the procession from getting down to the Square as well as they were able—part of the procession forced its way through so as to get down to the Square.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis; I have held the office since 1886—I have had the matter of the meetings in Trafalgar Square in October and November under my personal notice and consideration—I attended personally from time to time, and saw the character of the people attending the meetings, and I also obtained in the course of my duty, information from my superintendents and inspectors with reference to the meetings—before November 8th the character of the people attending the meetings was such as to require extra precautions—in my judgment those meetings were a source of danger to the peace of the neighbourhood—it was with my knowledge and authority that the bands of people who left the meetings were followed by the police—in my judgment that was necessary to preserve the peace and to protect property and persons—before November 8th the mobs of people attending the meetings became more and more organised every day—that, in my opinion, very much increased the danger and risk to persons and property—we had always to send sufficient police to prevent their doing damage; it always increased the number—I issued the proclamation of November 8th with the sanction of the Secretary of State and the Chief Commissioner of Works, Public Buildings—the proclamation was issued with a view to preventing disorderly proceedings—that notice was posted all over London—it had come to my knowledge that on November 13th processions were intended to converge on Trafalgar Square—in my opinion, having regard to my experience on the days immediately preceding November 13th, there would have been most serious danger to the public peace—having regard to the character of the people who attended the meetings in the past, I think it would have more than taxed the powers of the police—with the sanction of the Secretary of State I issued this proclamation prohibiting processions passing through the streets on Sunday—on the Saturday night I also took steps to insure the attendance of a Magistrate in case the Riot Act should have to be read; I also arranged with the authorities for the attendance of troops if necessary—having regard to what had passed on previous days in connection with the meetings, in my judgment these</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188801090087"/>
               <p>precautions were absolutely necessary—on Sunday morning I attended in Trafalgar Square—there was a large police force there, about 2, 000 round the Square, and in the immediate neighbourhood considerably more; the Square proper was entirely cut off by a solid row of police all round—I made the dispositions myself, and I went to see that they were carried out—in excluding persons from the Square after 10 o'clock the police officers were acting under my authority—I was present in the Square up to three o'clock—I received communications almost every minute from all sides, of processions approaching—at three o'clock there were 10, 000 people present, perhaps more—it would have been a most decided danger to the public peace to have allowed them to take possession of Trafalgar Square—in my judgment it would have been most hazardous to allow organised processions to approach—up to three o'clock the people were kept moving on—mounted police were required to prevent the obstruction becoming permanent—when I left the Square my arrangements for the cordon of police being maintained were still being carried out—shortly after four o'clock I received a communication from Trafalgar Square, in consequence of which I communicated with the military authorities, and the military were called out—the Riot Act was not read—the disorderly crowds, requiring police superintendence and control, remained in the neighbourhood till about 6. 30—the people were most disorderly till about 6. 30, when they gradually quieted down and I ceased to be anxious—a considerable number of police in the neighbourhood of Trafalgar Square were injured.</p>

I was not in Trafalgar Square when anybody was wounded—the hollow of the Square was empty; it was surrounded by police—I was not there after three o'clock—all I have told you subsequently is from reports which have come to me—I have no personal knowledge after three o'clock, but I do know what I have stated with regard to calling out the military—I was present at some of the earlier meetings; I cannot say whether they were held with a political object—I should not say that they were held with reference to the alleged grievances of the unemployed working-men of London, I should say that they were meetings of roughs; the topic of the speakers was sedition—it was not in my hands to prosecute them for that; several cases were brought up before the Magistrate, but I do not know of any prosecution for sedition—I cannot say what a political meeting is—other things were mixed up with seditious speeches, and I cannot say whether the meetings were political or not—they were generally held on Sundays—the placard of November 8th is still in force; it has not been withdrawn, nor has another proclamation been substituted for it—an additional proclamation as been issued; I have not got it here—it was issued, I think, on the 14th; I am not quite certain. (<hi rend="italic">A proclamation of November 8th was here produced</hi>) This is it, I thought it was the 14th.

               <p>greater proportion of professional thieves than is usual on such occasions, and I am satisfied that they were so, and the statements of my officers led me to believe that—there were cases of theft, window breaking, and so forth; I cannot give you the dates—some were arrested in Trafalgar Square for breaking windows; I don't say for stealing purses—a great number of watches changed hands on that occasion—I am satisfied that the men were organised; they could be got together very suddenly; they could get together in 10 minutes something over 1, 000 men—they began to wheel in turning, in an organised manner, and I say that that showed an organised disposition—I do not think that was due to the fact that among the unemployed there are a considerable of Army reserve men—it was a disciplined organisation with a view to looting shops—no shops were looted, because the police prevented it, and surrounded them so that they could not—I believe there was an attempt to loot a shop in Oxford Street, but not in Trafalgar Square; it would be impossible with the police round them, but I was not there—the officers have made no statements to that effect—I proclaimed a meeting on Lord Mayor's Day, 1886, by placards, as I did on this occasion—I did not forbid the meeting—there were a great many meetings, and some persons were put upon other persons' shoulders in the middle of the Square—there was a large crowd in Trafalgar Square on that day, that was certainly not forbidden—I don't recollect whether I took any action after the meeting of November 9th against the persons who spoke on that occasion—I gave orders that at certain points no speeches were to be allowed, and those speeches were not delivered—the plinth of Nelson's Column was not one of the prohibited places—after the proclamation of November 8th registers were left at all the police-stations for the unemployed; it was never given out publicly—it did not appear in the papers, and I don't thing it became a matter of public notoriety—I opened registers, but I said nothing about it—a considerable number of the unemployed registered themselves at the station—I don't think any of those were the same individuals who had been beaten or knocked about by the police prior to the opening of the registers—there was no unusual distress at that time that I know of—I cannot say now my particular reason for opening the registers; I may have had a dozen reasons—I thought it might be advantageous to the really unemployed it was represented to me by several different persons that it was well that we should distinguish between the really unemployed and those persons who called themselves the unemployed—I don't believe there had been exceptional distress amongst the poor and unemployed—the people who slept in Trafalgar Square had increased during the winter, because people brought food there—they had not before food was brought there—it was not entirely on one ground; it was the whole circumstances that led up to this meeting that led me to suppose a serious riot would occur—I deny that it was a political meeting throughout; I believe it was seditious throughout—I saw the placards, but I don't believe all they say—it is my duty to read the placards about any of the meetings I prohibit, and I form my own conclusions upon it—there might be a little politics in these meetings—whenever there was any disorder the Square was cleared; when they were orderly no notice was taken, and matters took their usual course—when the meeting was disorderly, and a breach of the peace had been committed, we dispersed the meeting, and perhaps where a breach of the peace was imminent—I</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I do not pretend to be a lawyer—by the proclamation of November 8th, I prohibited meetings in Trafalgar Square, and also the delivery of political speeches—I considered that the proclamation of the 8th November was absolutely necessary—both proclamations are equally in force now, but the 13th has a wider application than the 8th; it is more full—I do not think that danger to the public peace and order depends solely upon what is contained in the placard calling the meeting—I gave directions that these thousands of mobs of people were to be followed and surrounded so that they could not loot—I thought that was absolutely necessary—in my opinion, having to deal with people who attend such meetings, it is not safe to wait until a breach of the peace has been committed—I should not like to take the responsibility to do so.</p>

                  </hi>, M. P. for Cardiff. K. C. B. I was at Morley's Hotel on the afternoon of November 13th from shortly after 3 till about 5 o'clock—during the whole of that time, with the exception of a very short interval, I was looking on to the Square—the crowd was very large, but showed no signs of any disposition to disturbance—it consisted of surprisingly young men and very big boys—a few minutes after 4 I saw Mr. Graham—he was standing on the pavement in front of Morley's Hotel—the other defendant was near him—they were arm in arm, and they rushed across the carriageway towards the opposite pavement, there being a great many omnibuses and vehicles moving past at the time—when they reached the pavement the police rushed forward, and before Mr. Graham stepped on the pavement he was struck by the police, and before he reached the position which the police had occupied his head was bleeding—I saw him strike no one, but his arms were thrown up as if in self-defence—after he was secured, and when he was perfectly helpless in the hands of the police, two policemen in succession stepped up from behind and struck him violently over the head, for no cause that I could see—not more than a dozen persons seemed to be associated with the defendants, but after they had moved forward a score or two of other persons pushed after them apparently through curiosity—then there was a large movement in the crowd, as there had been previously whenever the police made a movement—I have no doubt whatever that it was the police who struck the first blow—Mr. Graham had come up to the pavement, but had not stepped upon it when the police came forward and struck him—I did not see any one with Mr. Graham strike the police with sticks—as compared with other crowds this was most Certainly not a disorderly crowd—there was a great deal of movement, but it was mainly occasioned by little bodies of the mounted police galloping about to disperse the people—there was no violence—when the military came</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188801090090"/>
               <p>up the crowd cheered the display, and seemed in the best of tempers—they thought it was part of the play of course—there was, in my opinion, no occasion for calling out the military, and I was never more astounded than when I saw them brought out to such a crowd—omnibuses and other vehicles were plying about the Square continually at this time—it was while I was at the hotel that the window was broken; at the very end of the time, I should think an hour after this incident—I did not see how it was broken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Burns.</hi> I have never seen a London crowd that I know of, but the proportion of big boys and young men was very large, much larger than any crowd I have ever seen before; very much larger than I have seen in a provincial town—I can hardly see how there could be a riot by a crowd of people let in to an open space with no buildings—I think the resistence by the police to the people who wanted to get into the Square accentuated any desire to commit disturbance; at the same time I thought that the police were acting in accordance with their instructions, and were trying to keep people out of the Square—I saw you arm in arm with Mr. Graham—I did not see you strike the police or make an assault upon them; in fact, from the moment the police pushed forward on Mr. Graham and yourself you both, and he in particular, seemed to me to be treated with most astonishing brutality by the police—the police advanced as you approached; they were arranged at the back of the pavement by the small pillars—they advanced quite across the pavement, and the first blow was struck before Graham or yourself were on the pavement—their act anticipated any assault, even if you intended it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. I was called for the defence at the police-court—I was a member of the last Government—on the afternoon in question I was out walking with my son and a foreign gentleman—a friend of mine had been staying at Morley's Hotel a long time; I was not quite sure if he had gone, and I went to call to see if he had—there were windows on both sides of the room I was in—the particular incidents of Mr. Graham's movements were observed by me from the western window—the number of persons in the room varied very much—perhaps there were a dozen sometimes, including waiters, but never more than a very few—I cannot tell you who they were, I have no idea—I saw the manager of the hotel—I think at the very end of the afternoon I saw a gentleman with a note-book, but I am not sure about that—I saw no one taking notes; if there had been I must have observed him, because there were so few persons in, the room—my friend was not there; he had just left—I went in to see if he was there—I had so much difficulty in getting into the hotel that I preferred waiting till the mob cleared away before I got out—when I went in I naturally went upstairs to the coffee-room—except my son I do not know the names of the other gentlemen there, nor of the ladies—there were one or two ladies occasionally—when I say I had not seen a London crowd before I mean I had not seen any crowd for the mere purpose of a meeting, only on Lord Mayor's Day—I saw young lads with thin sticks in their hands touching the horses; I saw no other sticks—I can't say there were no others—there were about 50, 000 people there—I saw no one with any other kind of stick—I have not the slightest doubt that the police struck the first blow—I have not said that I made</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188801090091"/>
               <p>no complaint of the actual arrest of Mr. Graham, only in the sense that I presume the police on the spot were bound to arrest anyone trying to get into the square; I don't think I have said anything of the kind; I cannot have said that—I describe the way in which Mr. Graham and Mr. Burns went across as a rush towards the police—the mounted police cleared the way dozens of times—I can't say that they had cleared it just before they crossed, I did not notice; I may say this, that the clearing of the road simply resulted in the moving of the people; as the horse-police advanced the people were bound of course to get off in front of others and closed in behind them—I should not think the roadway had been cleared a few seconds before the defendants crossed, but I am not positive about that—I knew from the newspapers that Mr. Graham was coming there that day, in no other way; I was very sorry to see he was going—I did not know that Burns was going there; I never saw Burns till he was a prisoner in this case—I cannot give the names of any of the persons who accompanied the defendants—I do not know Mr. Hyndman by sight—I think the eight or twelve persons accompanying the defendants seemed to be a little more intimately associated with those persons than the mass of the crowd, more than the score or two that followed them, it seemed to me to be so—they came from the crowd about in front of the hotel—all of them came from the pavement just in front of Morley's Hotel—I did not notice the score or two of persons until just about the time of the defendants' presence; there was nothing to distinguish the smaller number from the others; I merely thought it was a personal indiscretion of his—there were some 10 or 12 more intimately associated than the score or more who appeared to be connected with them, and then a general following of the crowd, a general movement, not so much a following—the number who actually crossed the road was not 200 or 300—I don't think a considerable number followed behind—in that case, as in many others during the day, where ever there was a point of excitement there was a general movement—I could not give an estimate of the number who joined in the general movement towards the point of excitement—I have said it was my opinion that the police on the spot were bound to resist the rush in which Mr. Graham joined, and to master and arrest him; I have said so now—the defendants headed any rush there was—at the time Graham started from the refuge he had his hat off—a stone parapet comes down the east side of the Square, and running in a line with the kerb there is a line of stone posts, about 4 feet high—the left wing of the police was next to the end of the stone parapet—they formed a cordon in front of the posts following the curve of the pavement, about 6 feet or 7 feet back from the gutter—the rush came from the corner between the refuge and Morley's Hotel—the first ten or fifteen files of police next the south-east parapet stood, firm, and the men next to them towards the Nelson Monument were advanced across the pavement—I think the police at that time were six or seven feet deep—100 men would be about 12 or 13 files, each man being in the front rank—my complaint is that after he had been arrested violence was shown to him, and in the arresting him too—I think Burns was struck—I think he could not have escaped—I think the scrimmage hardly lasted so much as a minute and a-half or two minutes—I think it was certainly net more than a minute before they were at the back of the police—I should not think it was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188801090092"/>
               <p>from two to three minutes before the blows were over—all blows were over when they were through the police, because when the men struck him behind they were through the police—they did not strike him after he was through—when the men from behind struck him they were actually captured—there was not very much yelling and shouting at this time—I have had experience of riots where the shouting was very much worse—I saw the 10 or 12 people from the first moment of their moving, when they were just by the pavement of Morley's. Hotel, or near it—I did not recognise any of the other body that appeared to be connected with them—I took no interest in them at all—I was there by accident—my attention was particularly drawn to Mr. Graham by my son exclaiming "How they are giving it to that poor fellow!"</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>, I am not a lawyer—I had no opinion as to whether the police had a legal right to arrest Mr. Graham to prevent his entering the Square—I thought the police on the spot, who were acting under orders, as a matter of discipline, were bound to obey orders—Mr. Graham was in the middle of the police when the blows were struck from behind—more than two policemen then had hold of him—two held him—he was entirely incapable of movement, or of raising his arms—I did not say I make no complaint of the mode of his actual arrest.</p>

I live at Crosby House, Lewisham, and am a merchant—on 13th November I was in the Strand on a retreat in the middle of the street between the Grand and Morley's Hotels at from five to ten minutes past 4 to the best of my recollection—I saw both defendants passing down towards the Square arm in arm—Graham had his hat in his left hand—to the best of my belief his right hand was through Burns' arm—they went towards the Square—they came from the direction of Charing Cross—I stepped from the retreat to go towards St. Martin's Lane—just as they were coming up I passed close in front of them—they walked fast across the street with a few followers behind them—Graham said something; I did not hear what—the police closed round them, and I lost sight of them—I got pushed away by the crowd—I did not see Graham strike the police, or attempt to strike—at the time Graham came in contact with the police he was about a yard from the kerbstone, I think; on the asphalte road—there was a very large crowd indeed there—it was a usual London crowd that you see at open air meetings, but there seemed a large preponderance of boys between 16 and 20—they appeared to be sightseers—I saw no organisation whatever—the only element of disorder I saw was hooting the mounted police while they were charging different sections of the mob.</p>

               <p>that day alone, arriving at Charing Cross about 3.45—I was endeavouring to make my way to the front of the National Gallery when this happened—I knew Graham and Burns by sight previously—I had seen Burns once, and had seen Graham often in the House of Commons—I do not belong to the same club that he does—I had never spoken to him in my life—I only knew him by sight—I did not know any of the 10 or 12 persons who were with them; I did not recognise a single person—when Graham came in contact with the police, about a yard from the kerbstone, I was three or four yards off him—I was not among the persons who had followed him across; I had crossed from the retreat towards St. Martin's Lane—I should think the 10 or 12 persons were followed by 30 or 40, but they were further behind; they did not seem to belong to them—I was in St. Martin's Lane when the contact took place between Graham and the police—I saw no blow struck by Graham or Burns, or by anybody—I saw truncheons raised, but I was too far off to see what they were being used for—I saw no truncheons used—I saw no truncheons till I got further up the road, being pushed away by the crowd—directly that rush was made across the street the crowd surged across the roadway, and swept me up towards St. Martin's Lane; that was when the prisoners crossed the street—it was a lot of people standing about there that surged after them—directly the rush was made they surged towards that spot—I did not expect to see Mr. Graham there that afternoon—I was not looking for him when I saw him—I had read in the paper that he was coming.</p>

I live at Montgomery Street, Hammersmith, and was formerly for seven years and five months in the Metropolitan Police Force—since then I have been for between two and three years in the Newcastle Borough Police—on 13th November I went to the Strand, as my daughter, who is in service in the Strand, was coming home that afternoon, and knowing of this meeting I thought it would be advisable to escort her home—shortly after 4 o'clock I was standing opposite Morley's Hotel at the south-east corner of the Square—I was just on the path, just at the corner of the granite stone parapet where you turn to the right to get on the Square—I was on the same side as the police, and was being passed along by them when I saw the defendants come from the direction of the Strand arm in arm—Mr. Graham had his hat in his hand; I could not swear which hand—he had his gloves on—when they got within two or three yards of the police that were protecting the Square a portion of the front-rank men sprang out, one constable struck Graham across the head with his truncheon, several others struck him with their fists—I noticed Burns throwing his arms about a good deal in protecting himself from the violence of the police—when Graham received the blow on his head he put his arm up apparently to hold his head—up to that time he had not struck at or attempted to strike the police, if he had I should have been bound to see it—I received a blow on my hat from a policeman's fist at the same time of the occurrence; they did not seem to care who they knocked about that day—I was just close up to Burns then; I was glad to get away from it after receiving the blow—I had great difficulty in getting away from the police—I was being passed along by the police there before the defendants started—I don't think it was possible for anyone to hear what was said, the noise was so great at the time; there was shouting and cheering—I should think between 50 and 70 persons were following the defendants across the road; it might</p>

               <p>be 100, but there was a large quantity of persons that turned their heads in the direction of the Square when Graham and Burns got near the place—those people seemed to come from the direction of Charing Cross, from the Strand—I could not say they were following Graham and Burns—I did not see anyone strike at the police with sticks—there were walking sticks, small canes, and some of them larger perhaps, in the hands of several persons.</p>

I am an engraver, of Gordon House, Newnham Street, Whitechapel—on 13th November I was in Trafalgar Square—I had an appointment to meet a friend at Waterloo House—I arrived there about half-past three, and went to the corner of Morley's Hotel at the top of the Strand—when I got there I saw a large mob—the mounted police were charging the mob, putting their horses on to the pavement—I did not see the defendants at the time I was at Morley's Hotel—I met a friend there, and the police charged, and I ran across the road, and got side by side with the police drawn across the Square, facing Morley's Hotel—I stood there, looking towards St. Martin's Church, then I heard some police at the back of me call out "There is Burns;" that was about seven or 10 minutes past four, as near as possible—when the policeman said that there was a nasty expression used, and I looked round and saw a crowd coming towards the Square—I saw Graham walking with Burns towards the Square, coming towards the spot where I stood—at that moment the police rushed from the front rank, put their hands to their truncheon cases, and rushed at them—several policemen had their truncheons out, and I saw one blow delivered on Graham's head with a truncheon; there were other blows, but they missed him—Graham had not his hat on; it was impossible for Graham to strike or to attempt to strike the police, for the police rushed on them before they had a chance, even if they wanted it—after that I jumped on a' bus driving round from the direction of Charing Cross towards St. Martin's Church.</p>

I live at Stebbington Street, Canning Town—on the afternoon of 13th November, about 4 o'clock, I was in front of the Grand Hotel—my attention had been attracted by the repeated charges by the mounted constables up and down the Strand—about 4 o'clock my attention was attracted by hearing cheers, and looking in the direction from whence the cheers came, the easterly direction, I saw Graham and Burns walking arm-in-arm in the direction of the south-east corner of Trafalgar Square—Graham had no hat on—when the two defendants arrived at the kerbstone of the south-east corner of the Square, about a dozen or so constables immediately sprang from the ranks with drawn truncheons and attacked the crowd, and used their truncheons indiscriminately, making more particularly for Graham and Burns—Graham's right arm was linked with Burns's left, and, as I say, directly they set foot on the pavement they were immediately surrounded and wedged in by constables, and I saw Mr. Graham repeatedly struck heavy blows on the back of the head, on the top of the head, and on the face—Graham never even attempted to strike the police either in defence or in retaliation; as a matter of fact, where there was a chance for either of the defendants to strike a blow at the police was when they arrived at the kerbstone, but neither of them lifted a finger either in their defence or retaliation—after they got on the pavement it was a matter of impossibility for them to strike the constables, as they were completely wedged in, and I saw constable after constable, whose services were in no way required for the arrest of the two defendants, step out of the ranks and deliberately strike Graham particularly thunderous blows on the head, a sight that made me almost sick to witness.</p>

                  </hi>, M. P. I sit for Northampton—I have known Trafalgar Square about 30 years; during that time the public have passed freely over it and used it as a thoroughfare in every direction—I have never seen any notice exhibited in Trafalgar Square to the effect that it was no thoroughfare or private—I have never known the public excluded from passing freely over any part of the Square—I have held about 30 meetings in the Square, from about 1860 to 1884; I have only attended one or two except those held by myself—none of those meetings have been prevented or dispersed by the police—there has been one slight interference, that you can scarcely term an interference, and one serious interference with the holding of the meetings on the part of the police—until 1880 the meetings were on general public questions, after that they were solely with my own right to sit in Parliament; a controversy had arisen as to whether I was entitled to sit without taking the oath—all the 30 meetings I have mentioned have been perfectly orderly—several of the meetings have been attended by as many as filled from the National Gallery to the Grand Hotel and the buildings facing—it has not been found possible at those meetings to make provision for ordinary foot traffic across the Square, I have occasionally arranged for passing people who wanted to pass through the square; I always had a very powerful body of stewards for such meetings—I found it possible to organise and control meetings of that kind without disturbance to the public peace.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 31, Orlando Road, Clapham, and am engaged on the staff of the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>—on 13th November I went to Trafalgar Square for the purpose of taking notes and writing; I think I arrived in the neighbourhood about 1 o'clock and remained there till about half-past 6—I was all round the Square, but I think I was chiefly on the south side of the Square, and near the south-east corner the whole day long—there was a very large crowd; as the afternoon went on the streets became very crowded; it was an ordinary London crowd, good-natured and orderly—I noticed no instance of the spirit of retaliation; it was full of chaff, except one instance, about half-past 3, near or at the south-east corner of the Square, a mounted constable knocked against a man, knocking him down, and the man gathered himself together and seized the reins of the horse; he was buffeted about and he held on the reins very steadily for some little</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188801090100"/>
               <p>time, and then he was turned adrift—he fell right over, prone on his hands and knees—I saw no retaliation on the part of the crowd till that time—I could not say if the man was knocked down accidentally, I saw him fall down—the crowd consisted chiefly of the working class—about 4 o'clock the mounted police from time to time were riding in among the people, and going on the shelters and on the pavement, and breaking up groups of people here and there—there was an incident of that kind more violent than others under the windows of the Grand Hotel, and either then or shortly after there was some procession and a band came down from the neighbourhood of St. Martin's Lane—that was almost on the strike of 4—there was a rush of people, as many as could get past on the east side of Trafalgar Square towards the National Gallery, and over the front of the Square, so that the front between the south side of the square and the east side were almost completely denuded of people except on the opposite side of the street under the Grand Hotel, where they were being dispersed by the Police—I noticed nothing further on the south side of the Square except the mounted police charged the people on the pavement by the Grand Hotel—a moment or so after that I saw a few people streaming from the direction of the post-office in a transverse or diagonal direction to the east side of the square opposite Morley's Hotel, at almost an angle of 45 across the road towards the Square where the police were standing four and eight deep—there were very few people at first—I suppose from first to last there were not more than 50 people; a number of them were women—I was rather round the corner—they seemed to me to be going towards the Square—what took place as far as I observed was that a number of policemen who had been moving up and down the pavement, and were then drawn up on the Square, advanced a few paces to meet them, a scuffle ensued, which attracted more people, and the mounted police went to the assistance, I presume, of those on foot, and the people were dispersed, the whole affair only lasting a few seconds—the scuffle must have been less than a minute from beginning to end—I saw the police nearest the south-east corner advance to meet this knot of people—my range of vision did not carry me very far—I observed a collision between the police and the people, and I observed the people dispersed—the ranks of the police regained their ordinary formation, drawn up in line, in half a minute—after that some of my colleagues told me there had been arrests, and I tiptoed and saw two men on the inside of the Square whom I believe were the prisoners, although I could not say—after that there were encounters between, the police and the people of the same character as I have already described, the mounted police riding among the people, occasionally assisted by bodies of foot police, dispersing the people from the corner at Northumberland Avenue towards the Strand, and on the north and west sides also—I saw the military come from the Horse Guards, I did not know for what purpose; I thought they were changing guard—I could not believe it was for anything else—I was very much surprised to find them riding towards the east side of the Square—I thought they would have gone off west towards their barracks.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Burns.</hi> I was frequently assigned to the duty of attending the meetings held in the Square before November 13th—the meetings prior to that were meetings of the unemployed as I understand it—they were attended by meetings of all classes and conditions of men and women—the majority of people looked like men out of work, and some as if they had been out of work a good long time, and out of food too—it did not impress me that there was the average sprinkling of thieves, and so forth—I thought they were mostly poor people, unemployed men who did jobbing work; not regular mechanics, but unskilled labourers—I think the percentage of unemployed would be nearer 70 than 80 at the general meetings—there were speakers at the meetings who harangued the people on the necessity of finding work and employment, and suggested the manner in which work could be found—they sent deputations to the Local Government Board and the Lord Mayor—the men as a rule were generally attentive; there was a fringe of boys and youths who were noisy at times and indulged in a good deal of horseplay, but the men, as far as I saw, tried to stop it, and the speakers asked the assistance of the police to drive away the lads who clamber over the lions and run round the base of the pedestal—so far as I observed I found no difficulty in moving from the outside to the inside of the crowd—I moved among them, and conversed with them occasionally—there was no attempt to pick ray pocket; if there had been they would have found a gold watch and a sovereign or so when I had money on me—in my opinion the conduct of the crowd did not justify police interference and the subsequent prohibition—in my opinion if the police had shown forbearance there would have been none of this conflict—I have seen you in the Square, and heard you speak—I have heard you order lads off the lions and off the plinth of the monument, and ask them to keep order—I have never heard you suggest in any manner that you wished any one to loot shops, create riots, or generally act furiously with the view of making a riot—there have been no disorders in the Square at any meetings I have been at convened by you—there was a meeting convened by the Sugar Bounties people, not by you; there was a disorder at that—I have seen you talking to the police—I don't remember Superintendent Dunlop saying to you "For God's sake, Burns, keep this crowd in order, I cannot"—I have heard it so stated—there was no disturbance then—I should not describe you as a loose, idle, disorderly person—I should rather describe you as industriously inclined.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SOLICITOR-GENERAL</hi>. I heard no such appeal made to Dunlop—when I have been in London, which has been a good deal within the last seven or eight years, there have been very few meetings in Trafalgar Square at which I have not been present—I could not say how many have been convened by the Social Democratic Federation; it might be half a dozen; it might be more certainly—half a dozen probably</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188801090102"/>
               <p>—I remember some of the meetings of February, 1886—I recollect and I was present on the occasion on which there was a procession through the West End and a great deal of mischief done, shops broken into in Piccadilly and the like—I did not attend the first meetings in Trafalgar Square, October last year, but all the meetings afterwards I attended—I was not present at the meeting early in November, or at the end of October, when the crowd left the Square and went up to Hyde Park—I was not present on Sunday, 23rd October, when the crowd went to Westminster Abbey, and on another Sunday when they went there—I was not in London at the time—there were processions through the streets after the unemployed meetings I was present at—I accompanied nearly all the processions—there was a body of police in attendance at the processions—I should not call it a strong force; the force strengthened as the processions went on, and the streets were well guarded through which they passed, not all of them, but as a rule the more busy thoroughfares were well guarded—doubtless greater precautions had to be taken from day to day—on 13th November when the actual conflict took place between the defendants and their followers and the police I was a few yards, it might have been five or ten, from the south-east corner towards the west, nearly opposite the Grand Hotel on the pavement in front of the police—I was at the east side of the Nelson column—I was facing the Grand Hotel if I put my back to the Square—I did not identify Graham or Burns; I knew them very well, and was looking for them, but did not see them, but I saw blows interchanged between the police and the people—I saw the police cuffing the crowd—I saw blows inter<lb/>changed; I did not then recognise the defendants, nor had I seen them advance—my attention had not been called to cheering in the Strand, but only to the two things, the scene under the Grand Hotel windows and the band by the National Gallery, until I saw the people streaming across diagonally—there were not so many loafers in the crowd as on week days—the Sunday crowd was a very respectable crowd taken all through, a very much better crowd than it had been on week days—I am speaking of the whole day; I had been moving freely all round the Square, occasionally going a little way down the Strand and Northumberland Avenue and Parliament Street—I noticed the police were always breaking up masses of people—after 4 o'clock there was more excitement and noise; I think there was after the military first came on the scene—I noticed more excitement among the crowd who moved round after the military—the crowd cheered the soldiers very much.</p>

I am honorary secretary of the Metropolitan Radical Federation, which consists chiefly of the Radical Clubs in the metropolis that federate—the object of the Federation is to carry out the Radical programme, and to hold public meetings and demonstrations whenever they deem it advisable—we have a duly-elected executive council of 25, which consists of delegates duly appointed from different clubs—there was a meeting of the council on Wednesday, 2nd November—I have the minutes of the meeting—we discussed about the meeting in Trafalgar Square for about quarter of an hour, and this resolution was passed unanimously: "That a demonstration be held in Trafalgar Square on Sunday, November 13, at four p.m., to demand the release of Mr. William O'Brien, M.

I wrote that on the evening of the 8th, but as it could not be issued till next day I dated it 9th November; that is what I always do—I was at Trafalgar Square from 3. 30 till past five—I saw the aggressive nature of the police from the start—I did not see the particular conflict between the police and Graham at the south-east corner, but at half-past three I saw mounted police charging the crowd in all directions, and I saw a man taken away and locked up at 20 minutes to four opposite the Grand Hotel—at four o'clock, after seeing the batoning, I went to the cordon of police and asked to be allowed to pass through—I said I did not come there to be batoned; I came to take charge of the meeting that was fixed to be held; I asked to be allowed to be let through—I was referred to the sergeant; the sergeant referred me to a mounted inspector, who sent me to Scotland Yard, where I saw Chief Inspector Cutbush—I told Cutbush the nature of our peaceful demonstration, the same as on other occasions, and would he allow some of us to hold one, and allow some of us to go inside the Square, but I was practically ordered out of the station.</p>

On January 5th, 1887, we determined to uphold the right of public meeting—we have always held meetings in Hyde Park, and should do so—our association had not expressed by resolution or otherwise the same decision with regard to the right of meeting in Hyde Park; I can tell you why we did so in this case—I was told verbally of this proclamation on the night of the 8th, I had not seen it, I was told by one of my members it was out—the card drafted on the 8th was printed next morning, and was in the post by 12 o'clock next day, the 9th—I did not think the proclamation applied to us—we intended to hold our meeting in defiance of what the police might do—if the processions had not been stopped 60, 000 or 70, 000 persons would have assembled; that is our usual number that attended the meeting the next Sunday—we met in Hyde Park perfectly peaceably and orderly—at the meeting next Sunday in Hyde Park there was no interference by the police; it was peaceable and orderly—Mr. Hyndman is not a member of my association, from his opinions he would not be—I knew nothing of how Burns and Graham met together till I heard it at Bow Street—I fix the times, and they are agreed to by the Council—the processions were timed to start at certain moments, so that they might all arrive at Charing Cross at a certain moment; they began at 12 minutes past 2 from Hammersmith Broadway, 47 minutes past 2 Paddington Green, and so on, and they were all timed to arrive at the same time, so as to begin the meeting punctually—our usual time of meeting is not 3, we have met as late as 5 in Hyde Park and other places in the summer<lb/>time—I saw none of the processions, they never reached the Square—I have been in Court about an hour to-day, I could not get here yesterday—I have only been told by the police that people in the processions had sticks and pieces of iron and other weapons—we gave instructions that they were not to even bring umbrellas if it was raining—I have not got those instructions; they were verbal, and were given on Saturday night by the organisers, Ellis, of Peckham, Sterne, of West Marylebone, Harris, of Hackney, Suter, of Southwark and others—60, 000 to 70, 000 is the usual number of people we have—the orders were given at a quarter-past 10 or half-past 10 on Saturday night to the meeting of organisers to make the final arrangements—the arrangements would be conveyed to the thousands by each of the organisers, who would appoint a steward—I should think there were 20 organisers; that is the central body that meets, and they distribute it to others—the 20 organisers would communicate to their lieutenants, who would communicate to the thousands who were going to join the processions—notices of the meeting would be up in the clubs long before Saturday night—I did not send a post-card to every delegate to make his arrangements till we settled it—I did the times of starting at my house on the Thursday—they would be in the hands of the different clubs on Friday, and would be seen by the members on Saturday afternoon—the directions about no weapons were at a meeting on Saturday night about 10, and it was to be carried to the members between 10 and the time of starting—there were not 50 or 60 different starting-points, because the processions would pass through various places—there is only one starting-point for the south-west district, and two for the south-east, one from Bricklayers' Arms and the other</p>

               <p>from Peckham Rye, and they would start, picking up contingents—I had not heard on Saturday night that there was any probability of weapons being taken, nothing of the kind—it is quite an unusual thing to pass these special resolutions—the executive council, because of the rumours in the newspapers that there would very likely be a terrible scene on that day, passed this resolution that men should come defence-less on this occasion—I arrived on the scene at half-past 3—that was my usual way of organisation—I went to Scotland Yard, and did not see what happened at 4 o'clock—I saw repeated rushes of the people away from the mounted police, who were moving them on all the afternoon—they allowed omnibuses to move round the Square, and people got on the omnibuses and got round the Square on them cheering; it was a most ridiculous thing—I was present at the meeting in February, 1886, when the riots took place—I heard Burns speak—he was speaking at a different part to that at which the riots originated—he was a speaker at the meeting; I was a speaker myself—the riot commenced with the Sugar Bounties people—Burns was speaking by the National Gallery.</p>

I arrived at Charing Cross Metropolitan District Station—Graham, Burns, and myself walked up Buckingham Street—there were no others with us—I met Burns by appointment at the station—about five or six speakers were appointed by the Social Democratic Federation—they were working men, and it would injure them if their names were published—they were published in the papers at the time—I have spoken in Trafalgar Square a good many times before—the speakers were to speak on behalf of the Socia Democratic Federation—that was not the body who called the meeting, but the meeting was under the control of the Metropolitan Radical Federation—our secretary mainly made the arrangements for speakers on that afternoon, Mr. H. W. Lee—we notified to the organisers of the meeting that we should require two speakers for each platform, or more—one occasion on which I spoke in Trafalgar Square was in February, 1886—I then represented the Social Democratic Federation—I mean I was a member of the Social Democratic Federation—we did not hold that meeting, and if Mr. Burns says I did not there represent the Social Democratic Federation, my memory may have failed me, and possibly I did not—my impression was that I did, but when I come to recollect it I think we went there practically without any formal organisation as a body—I was then a member of the Social Democratic Federation—that fact was commonly known—the meeting was not one called by the Social Democratic Federation, but by other persons and for other purposes to which we objected—as they called the meeting we took advantage of it to come and make speeches—it was proposed to make an amendment—we informed them of it, and that led to rioting, therefore we held a meeting at some distance in another part of the Square—Burns had a red flag in his hand—I think I heard him make a speech—I do not remember whether I made reference to what happened in France at the time of the</p>

               <p>revolution and the sacking of shops—possibly something might have been said about that—we stood our trial here, no doubt, and evidence was given—I do not remember Burns calling upon the people who were willing to go west to hold up their hands, but I remember at the end of the meeting in the Square those in favour of going to Hyde Park were directed to hold up their hands, and they did—Burns went along Pall Mall with them—some were in front of him and some were behind—I think he still carried the red flag—I think he did get upon the pedestal in front of the Carlton Club to address them—the windows of the Carlton Club were broken after the members of that Club had thrown missiles at the mob—the other windows in Pall Mall were not broken until after missiles had been thrown at the mob—as to other windows being broken, I presume, having begun, a certain fringe of the mob broke through, and no constables being there to take them into custody, they may have enjoyed a little fun for once—that is what they considered it—I endeavoured to stop them—they went up St. James's Street and broke windows there—it is all in evidence—they went along Piccadilly and the shops were sacked there, and Burns and others endeavoured to check them; meanwhile Burns and I were going on to Hyde Park—we went to the Achilles statue and made speeches there—after those speeches I believe houses in Audley Street were sacked—it was proved in evidence—I have no idea that mischief follows our meetings by people who attend them—I was not in Audley Street with the crowd—I was in Pall Mall and St. James's Street, and Piccadilly—probably mischief was done by men who attended the meeting in Trafalgar Square of Peters and Kelly—Peters and Kelly did not come with us, but a large portion of their mob did, I am sorry to say—since February, 1886, I have spoken in Trafalgar Square four or five times certainly, and no disturbances ever followed any more than on other occasions when we held meetings—this is mere conversation, and I should like to point out, though I am sure Sir Edward Clarke does not wish to get more than the absolute truth, that what we claim is that no meeting under our control, or under the control of the Radical Federation, has ever been attended by disorder—we took the people away from the Square, as was proved here, to avoid worse trouble—I should think that if Peters and Kelly were leading the crowd there would be great danger to the shops—they have a magic spell to bring bad people together, which consists of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a pot of beer—I have no magic spell by which to keep bad people away from our meetings, but from experience our meetings have not been attended by disorder—meetings called by others have—on the Sunday referred to we were going to attend a meeting called by somebody else, but we were not in harmony with them—if you bring two crowds together who don't happen to agree there might be a disturbance—there was no intention to fight anybody—I do not think there was any intention to rob the shops, and I venture to appeal to you that this is entering into a discussion—I have called it a conversation—it is all in evidence what they did, and that we endeavoured to stop them—I had not spoken at any unemployed meeting—I had been at one meeting in Trafalgar Square, on a Sunday, when five of the unemployed addressed the meeting—that was about a week or a fortnight before our meeting—it was not on the Sunday they went to West<lb/>minster</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Our meetings in the Square have never been attended by disorder—Burns and I were indicted in this court in connection with the meeting of February, 1886—what the charge was I never could make out—evidence was gone into at great length and we were acquitted by the Jury.

On that occasion Burns and I did everything in our power to restrain the men from acts of violence; the meeting was not called by us, and we were not in sympathy with its objects—on 13th November two speakers were to attend at each platform—the first topic was in reference to the imprisonment of Mr. William O'Brien, and the second with regard to the right of free speech in Trafalgar Square—I met Burns by appointment—if I remember, I was rather surprised to find Mr. Cunninghame Graham at the station, as I did not appoint to meet him—I had only made his acquaintance two or three days before—I met Burns by appointment at the station—Graham was there, too, and the three walked up Bucking-ham Street together—the five or six people who were with them then straggled off into the crowd.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Ferndale Road, Clapham, and am a journalist and a novelist—on November 13th I was engaged in Trafalgar Square for the National Press Agency—I arrived there about 2 o'clock for the purpose of making a report—I walked round the Square several times—from my observation it seemed to me to be a good<lb/>natured crowd that had met there more to amuse itself than otherwise, and they seemed to treat the whole thing as if the police had taken too much trouble about it, and they were laughing about it; that is only my impression, of course—they did not appear to me to have any riotous intention—I remember being opposite Morley's Hotel about 4 p.m.—there was a cry of "There they are," which I think proceeded from the police who were standing as part of the cordon at the south end corner of the Square—the police rushed across the parapet a few steps, and then the whole thing resolved itself into a <hi rend="italic">melee</hi>—I saw Graham and Burns, but they were certainly not at the head of the crowd—a little knot of about 20 or 30 came across from Morley's corner, but the police did not give them time to reach the cordon, but rushed along the pavement, and I had to do the best I could to get out of it—the police had been hitting right and left, and I got one or two blows myself—I distinctly saw the police advance to meet this knot of people—I did not see them use their truncheons—they were hitting with their fists right and left—I did not see them strike the defendants—accidentally a mounted policeman's horse backed on to me, cut my shoe, and grazed my toe—I was on the pavement between the policemen who were on foot and the policemen who were mounted, who sidled down to protect the unmounted police.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, of 9, Arthur Street, Deptford—prisoner is my son—my daughter was married to Robert Maxwell, who was a working foreman to an engineer—he was 35 years of age—on 20th November he was out of work from the Wednesday previous—he and my daughter lived in my house—they occupied the front bedroom, first floor, and the back parlour, furnished; they had one child—the prisoner occupied the back room, at the back of the front bedroom—my daughter was confined about quarter to two between the Sunday, 20th November, and Monday—Mary Kingston, the monthly nurse, came on that day—on Monday, the 21st, Maxwell came home between four and five in the afternoon; he was in a drinking state—he went up into his wife's bedroom—she called to the nurse for help; the nurse was out at the back, and I went up with the elder child in my arms; he was a boy of about two-and-a-half years—Maxwell took the child out of my arms and threw it on the bed, and struck me in the mouth with his fist, and then threw me out of the room—my hand and wrist were hurt by his blows—I called out to my youngest daughter, and my son then came up to my assistance—Maxwell swore at him, and said he would knock his head off and throw him over the banisters—I and my son then went to the police-station and saw the inspector, and made a communication to him—we then came back—Maxwell got some money, and went out and got more drink—he kept drinking next day and causing words and unpleasantness—he slept a little time in my son's bedroom that night, but not for long—my son gave up his room to him and slept in the kitchen—I heard Maxwell go out about live a.m.—he came back about 10 minutes or quarter to eight, and went into his wife's bedroom, and then into my son's room, which is two or three steps down; we call it the ante-room—shortly after eight I heard a scuffling noise in my son's room as if there was a quarrelling; it did not last very long—I heard a mumbling sort of talking noise; the door was shut—I dressed myself and went into my daughter's room, the front room—Maxwell was there; he was just coming out—I saw he was bleeding at the forehead and about the head—he sat down by the fireplace on the floor; Mrs. Kingston was bathing his head—I think the prisoner then went after the doctor—Dr. Jarvis came, and the deceased was taken to the hospital in a cab, which the prisoner fetched—I went into my son's bedroom that morning—I saw a little blood on the sheets, not much—the deceased was only lying on the bed; he never got into bed—I did not notice any blood on the wall, only a few spots—I saw the doctor take them off—I spoke to the prisoner in the middle of the day about this—I said "It is a very bad job"—he said he would soon get over it; it would cure him of his drunkenness; he had led such a wretched life—there was evidence of a struggle in the room; the carpet was all knocked about—this weapon (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was kept in different parts of the house, sometimes in the washhouse, sometimes in the yard; it depended upon who used it—I used to</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The deceased was a very strong, powerful man, especially when in drink—on the 21st and 22nd he had been drinking nearly the whole day, and when in drink he was a very quarrelsome, irritable man—I got so frightened of him that I and my son went to the station to ask for protection on the day this occurred—he threw the child on the bed where his wife had just been confined, and he wanted to take the money from the purse under her pillow to go and get drink—my son's room is a small, dark room on the first floor—it was just about eight when I heard the scuffle there—my son appeared very much surprised when he was told that the deceased had to go to the hospital; he did not think it was so serious—the scuffle lasted about two or three minutes—the bedclothes were not disarranged—my son is a very affectionate son and a quiet young man.</p>

My husband's name was Robert Maxwell—we lived at 9, Arthur Street, with my brother (the prisoner) and mother—my husband had been out of work a few days—on Monday, 21st November, he came into my bedroom; I was in bed—he was under the influence of drink—I had my purse under my pillow; he asked me for some money—I said "No, I want it at a time like this"—he said if I did not give it him he should take it—my mother came in with the eldest child in her arms—he took it from her arms and put it on the bed rather roughly. and he pushed my mother; I heard the prisoner outside my room, and I heard a quarrel on the landing between him and my husband—I did not hear what it was about—on that same day the prisoner advised me to get a separation from my husband, as he was no good to me—between 7 and 8 on the Wednesday morning the prisoner came into my room and said "Has he cone to work?"—I said "I think so"—he said "Not him, he will be back directly"—he then left; he had nothing with him that I saw—my husband had been in my room all night; he came in about 3 in the morning, vomiting, and was rather ill; he lay on a pillow in front of the fire-place; he left between 5 and 6, taking the pillow with him—he came back about half-past seven—I went to sleep—the next I heard was heavy blows and a short scuffle; I heard no words—the scuffle seemed to come from downstairs somewhere—after that my husband came into my bedroom bleeding very much from the head; the nurse was there—the prisoner came in shortly afterwards—I said "Who did it?"—the prisoner said "I did it, I did it out of revenge"—I said "Oh Erne, how could you, what did you do it wit?"—he said "A piece of wood"—he went for the doctor; he came, and my husband was taken to the hospital—I did not see him afterwards—this piece of wood used to hang in the washhouse as a rule—I have seen it at odd times—I never saw it used, it might have been used when my two brothers were mending their boots—they were living in the house at the time—the prisoner is a butcher by trade; he was out of work.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner of 97, Aveling Street, Deptford—on Wednesday morning, 23rd November, the prisoner came to my house between eight and nine and said "I want you to come and see my brother-in-law, who is bleeding"—I said "Bleeding from what?"—he said "Well, it is like this, sir; a few days ago we had some words and he struck my mother, and I have had my revenge this morning; I hit him over the head with a stick"—I told him I would follow him on directly—he told me the address</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188801090116"/>
               <p>and I got there in about five minutes—I went to the front room up stairs and there saw Maxwell bleeding from the head—he was lying down—I attended to him—I saw he had wounds on the head and had him removed to the hospital—I afterwards said to the prisoner "Who did this?"—he said "I did"—I said I thought it was a very cowardly act—he said "You call it cowardly, don't you think it cowardly to strike my mother?"—I did not see Maxwell again alive—I was present at the post-mortem on 30th November made by Dr. Bleaker, the senior medical officer of the Miller Hospital—there were three wounds on the head, two apparently incised wounds on the forehead, each about an inch in length, and one contused and lacerated wound about three and a half inches long over the posterior part of the left side, that was the severest injury it laid the flesh open to the bone—when the scalp was removed there was a V-shaped fracture of the skull corresponding with that injury, that had injured the brain; inflammation followed, causing death—I think the injuries were such as might be caused by blows from the instrument produced—there were three separate blows; there was a mark on the left wrist and the back of the left hand, and the fingers were much bruised; those were such injuries as this instrument would cause after the post-mortem I went to the house and examined the bedroom; I noticed stains on the wall at the immediate head of the bed and about a foot above it—the bed was close against the wall, in a corner; if a man was lying on the bed with his head in the ordinary way and the blow were given in that position, that would account for the marks of blood on the wall—I did not notice blood anywhere else, the sheets had been removed; some of the stains were almost like splashes of blood, and some were spots—you could pick them off—I did not notice any anywhere else—the splashes I saw would not be caused supposing the man was standing up when struck.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I only examined that part of the room where the bed was—the wounds on the forehead were serious; there was no fractnre corresponding with those—when the prisoner came for me he asked me to come at once—he did not describe the matter as serious as he did afterwards—when I said the man must go to the hospital he manifested more anxiety than he had previously shown—the bedstead was a small iron one—I only noticed blood on the wall—if the man was first struck on the forehead when standing, and then knocked on to the bed and struck again, that would explain the splashes on the wall.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Mr. Henry Turner—we have been married seven years, and have two children—up to April last we lived at Priory Road, West Hampstead; we then moved to 3, North Bank, Regent's Park, Raleigh Lodge—letters used to come addressed "Burleigh Lodge," but we got them—I sometimes went with my sister to All Saints' Church, Margaret Street, where a little over three years ago I noticed the alto singer in the choir; I was struck by his voice—the prisoner is the person—he spoke to me first outside the church as we were leaving; I was alone—he gave no name, but the second time I met in he said his name was Harry Graham—I let him know I admired his voice, and he suggested I should hear him sing in private—he described some rooms in Newman Street, Mr. Harris's, which he said were used for singing purposes—I agreed to meet him there, and I used to do so very regularly between 4 and 5 o'clock on Fridays for a year—there was a piano there, and he sang secular and sacred music to me—he plays without notes—after a time I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay for the rooms, I sent</p>

               <p>it to him voluntarily, and wrote to the address he gave, Glen Villa, Chestnut Road, Plumstead—I have written several letters to him and received several from him at 82, Priory Road, but he only came there once—that was in the afternoon—my husband was not at home—that was after I sent him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he knew from me that my name was Mrs. Turner, and I think he knew my husband's Christian name—he wrote me a letter, which I have destroyed, saying he had signed his name to a bill for a friend, and was unable to meet it, and was responsible for it, and asked me to send him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I afterwards gave that sum into his hands—that was a year after he had spoken to me—he did not tell me the name of his friend, or show me the bill—that was after his visit to my house—I gave him the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. just inside St. James's Hall, Regent Street—the visits to Harris's fell off in number after I moved to Raleigh Lodge—he again wrote me a letter, which I have destroyed, applying for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as he was in debt; he said he had asked his father for it, who declined to help him—I declined to give him the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was not long before Christmas and before I moved to Priory Road; it was shortly after the autumn in which I had given him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went to Harris's rooms three times after that—I knew of his leaving the choir of All Saints' and going to the choir of St. Mary's, Bayswater; that was after he applied for the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and about the time I left Priory Road—I went to St. Mary's, Bayswater, to hear him sing, and as I was coming out he spoke to me—I had not then been to Harris's rooms for some months, and had not heard him sing except at church—he asked me to go to Harris's rooms again, and I thought I had better go, as I had a certain amount of fear—when I went there the room was more filled up, there were six or seven pianos there, and he complained—he suggested we should find some other room, and afterwards said he had found one at an hotel near London Bridge Station—the first time I went there he met me; he was waiting where the omnibuses stop, and conducted me to the Brighton Hotel, Duke Street, London Bridge—I went there three times—I think there was a piano in the room, and he sang to me—on Sunday, 4th December, I saw him outside St. Mary's, Bayswater—he spoke to me and said "I have found out that some one has been following us; he passed through Newman Street when I was singing to you and heard me, and he wants money, and says he will tell every one about you"—he said he had to supply him with a certain sum every week—I asked him if he had given him money—he said "Yes"—I said "Why?"—he said "Because he threatened to say all sorts of things about you"—he then said that he had not the money to supply the man with, and I must—I said I had not got it and did not think I could get it, but I would do my best—he said "The man wants 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. within the week, and it is to your advantage to let him have it, and if I go abroad it will be all right for you"—I said "Why?"—he said "He will not demand anything of you when he knows I am out of the country"—I asked him how much he would want to go away—he said 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but he could not go without paying some debts first, and required money for them—I asked him how much the amount would be—he said "40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. will clear everything"—that was inclusive of the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he was to give the man—I said I would do my best—the service was over at 12. 30—I asked the name of the man—he said he could not get it out of him, he hardly spoke at all, he simply said he wanted money—he showed me a letter which he said he received</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188801090119"/>
               <p>from the man—he also said that the man had certain information about me, and he would use it if I did not give him a certain sum—after that conversation I called at my mother's house, and from there walked home with my husband—I told him nothing going home—we went home by omnibus, which took 20 minutes, and when we got home I told my husband what had happened—that was about 4 o'clock—I then wrote this letter and envelope at my husband's dictation.

That letter was posted on the 8th, and soon after I received this letter; the postmark is the 8th—I must have got it on the 9th—it is the prisoner's writing—I had had many letters from him before.

I fetched that from Kelley's Library, Vigo Street, and gave it to my husband the same evening—I found this other letter at Kelly's at the same time—I had been there on Saturday the 10th, and they said there were no letters—I went again on Monday the 12th, and found these two.

I really cannot stand much more worry; I am so unwell. Can't you do something to stop it. Be sure, dear, to see me on Sunday, &amp;c." <hi rend="italic">Signed</hi> "Harry.") I gave both those letters to my husband—I afterwards received this anonymous letter (<hi rend="italic">G</hi>) at my residence—I do not remember the date: "Mrs. Turner, Burleigh Lodge. Time your fooling was over. Decide at once what you intend to do. I will not wait much longer. W. E. "Ihad not told him my address after I left Priory Road, and I am positive he did not get it from me—I then asked my husband for the letters from Vigo Street—we compared them with this, and came to the conclusion that this was in the same hand—my husband always hunts on Wednesdays in the season, and on Wednesday, December 14th, about 3 o'clock, some one called, and my parlourmaid gave the name of Mr. Eastman—Raleigh Lodge is written up, not Burleigh Lodge—he was shown into a room—I went in and found the prisoner—I guessed who I was going to see—I took him into the breakfast-room, and asked why he had come—he said "You must know"—I said "I feel quite sure you wrote the anonymous letter to me"—he said "I know nothing about it, and I am much hurt that you should think such a thing, and I don't know what to do about it"—I said he need not do anything, for I had told my husband all, and if he required money he would not get a farthing—he said "You know best about that"—I said "If you did not write the anonymous letter, why have you</p>

               <p>given the man money; it is the worst thing you could do for me"—he said the man had threatened his people about it—I did not ask him how he got there—I had never put any address to the letters I wrote to him after I moved to Raleigh Lodge, and I never wrote from Kelly's Library till I wrote the letter which my husband dictated—I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it bears the postmark of December 17th, and I received it by the first post that day—I compared it with the letters bearing Harry Graham's signature, and have no doubt that the writing is the same; the envelope was torn in opening. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi> (<hi rend="italic">H</hi>): "Mrs. Turner. I am greatly amused at your message, which I received from my young friend, &amp;c. What a good, kind, accommodating husband you have, &amp;c.

I shall communicate with your young friend within three days, &amp;c." <hi rend="italic">Not signed.</hi>) I went to the theatre with the prisoner, but only once; my cousin was with us; she remained all the time—the statement that I have committed adultery with the prisoner is absolutely untrue—I received this letter last Tuesday morning: "Monday. Dear Mrs. Turner,—Before I drop from your path I wish to thank you for sparing me the trouble of doing what you have done so ably for me. I trust you will remember the present lesson, and curb your passion for music in the future.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had attended All Saints' Church about two months before I knew the prisoner, and after that I attended regularly—I had never been to St. Mary-the-Angel at that time—the first time I met the prisoner I walked with him from the church door, and after the second Sunday we went to Harris's rooms—we went there very often; we went at 4 o'clock, and stayed an hour and sometimes longer—I may have stayed with him till 5. 30, but never till 6—I used not to walk to Newman Street with him; I may have once walked there from Oxford Street with him, but we did not usually enter together; he was there first and opened the door to me—we sometimes walked together coming out there are very few persons about in Newman Street—we went there together for about two years on and off, but not so often as once a week—there was an interval when I did not see him for some time; that was when I was annoyed at being asked for the money—I went there once when he did not meet me—I don't think I said that I was annoyed at that—he told me the reason he was not there—I did not scold him a little—it was after that I first saw him at St. Mary's—I did not then suggest to him that we should take another room together to hear him sing; he suggested it—I did not write to him, and appoint to meet him in the Burlington Arcade—I have never been there with him—after the interval when I did not see him for some months I saw him at the church, and I saw him after that in the Burlington Arcade—that was in consequence of a letter which I had written to him—it was not arranged when I saw him there that we should take another place—I was to sec him at</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have not looked to see whether every letter forming each word and syllable is the same—I speak generally from my knowledge of the prisoner's letters which I have destroyed, as well as from the letters to Kelly's Library—before telling my husband, I never wrote from Kelly's Library, and then only one letter—it is quite true that after moving to Raleigh Lodge my letters bore no address, nor did I ever tell him my address, but he told me on December 4th that the man had followed me to my address—the conversation about not knowing my address was on the 4th, and on the 14th he turned up at that address—I did not ask him how that was—my address is in the Blue Book and the Court Guide, but whether it was so last year I do not know, because we only removed in April—letters misdirected Burleigh Lodge, 3, North Bank, St. John's Wood, have been delivered at our house—on the occa<lb/>sion</p>

                  </hi>. I have made handwriting my study for over 40 years, and have been examined and cross-examined on innumerable occasions—my business is to point out to the Jury the foundation of my judgment—the first letters shown to me were "E.," "F.," and "G."—Mr. Turner called on me with them—I studied them all, and afterwards letter "H."—the subject of this indictment was put before me beginning with the words "I was greatly amused with your message"—these were the only anonymous letters put before me up to the time of my examination at Woolwich—I afterwards received the letter to the Magistrate—the anonymous letters were before me to compare with the prisoner's admitted writing, two letters sent to Kelly's Library, and the card with "Harry Graham" on it, and the pencil address, and I say that letter "H." was written by the prisoner in disguise—I have examined every one of the letters connected with the case, and am positive they are all written by the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">The witness here pointed out to the Jury the similarity in numerous letters in Exhibit</hi> "<hi rend="italic">H." and the same letters in the prisoner's admitted writing.</hi>) My judgment is in no way affected by the pencil writing of the address and the card of Harry Graham—they are the same writing; there is no disguise about them—I have no doubt about any of them, and I include the letter which the Recorder has received—I have not seen the writing of two persons, only of one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am very positive—I generally am, but I consider I am always right—I was right in Davis and May's case—I did not swear that the will was a forgery—an expert is called upon to say according to his conscience, not to swear—I gave evidence according to my conscience that the will was a forgery, and I believe it still—it was not my fault that Jury and the Judge were of an opposite opinion—I believe the Jury stopped the case after Mr. Seamer got into the box and swore he saw the will signed—what the Jury said went in at one ear and out at the other—I believe the Judge made observations on my recklessness and pre<lb/>sumption,</p>

I am Governor of Holloway Gaol, where prisoners on remand are kept—prisoners' letters are written on blue paper with the name of the prison, and every letter that goes out bears my initials in the corner, "E. S.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have had 14-years' experience of prison discipline—there is not quite such strict discipline before trial as after conviction—fines have been imposed in numerous cases for taking out letters or for bringing in spirits or tobacco, or trafficking with prisoners' friends, or posting letters—the Treasury prosecute the warders whenever they detect them—there are about 50 warders at Holloway—sometimes they are there for a very short time; sometimes they are brought here temporarily only during the Sessions, but they are the same men.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">HARRY TINDALL</hi>. I am a baker, of 42, Molesworth Street, Lewisham—I went to see the prisoner occasionally—my wife lives with him—I saw him at 3. 30 p.m. on the 27th December, at the Greyhound Yard, Eltham, where he works—we went to the Crown Inn courtyard—we came out and he left me to change a horse in the Eltham 'bus that came up then—I went with him to his house about 5. 30, where I saw my wife, and we had tea—about half an hour after I said "Good-bye, "and ascended the steps for the purpose of leaving the house by the side entrance—I had got about three steps into the passage when I received a very severe blow on the top of my head from the prisoner with a chopper, a second one on my ear, and a third across the nose—he was about to deal me a fourth blow when I struggled with him for possession of the chopper, which I got and kept in my right hand—he then seized me with both hands by the throat, and then my wife came out with a lamp in her hand—the prisoner said "Let's pitch him down here"—I managed to get away about as far as the front garden gate but could not get out there—the prisoner overtook me and dragged me back to the front area, and said to my wife "Let's pitch him down here," which he did, partly by a blow</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188801090127"/>
               <p>and partly by a push—it was not very deep; I still had the chopper; I did not hit him with it—I partially lost my senses for a few seconds—I then got out over the garden wall into the road—I saw a crowd of people there and offered the chopper, which some one I could not recognise took—I staggered about the road, and called for assistance for somebody to take me to the surgery—the prisoner then came up and put himself in a fighting attitude—a man took me by the arm and led me away to the side of Park Place, and then Cotton, the postman, came, and the two took me to Dr. Ford's, who attended to my injuries—I afterwards went to the police-station—when the prisoner struck me the third blow he said "You thought you were going to get the upper hand with me, didn't you; you have come to Eltham for something"—this is very much like the chopper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I cannot say whether he struck me with the back or front of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Sergeant Graves was on duty at the station and took the charge—I charged the prisoner—he is living with my wife, and has been, I think, a little better than three years—she left me when I was living in a street off the New Kent Road—I guessed perfectly well where she had gone—I heard rumours of it, and knew it for certain when I went to Eltham on the 27th December—I came to London on the 12th—I knew where the prisoner was working from what I was told—I had been to Chislehurst to see my old master; I did not go to see the prisoner to have a row but a friendly chat; I last saw him at the Lewisham Albion Hotel over four years ago; I meant if I found the rumours correct to come away contented—it is very likely that a number of persons saw the chopper in my hand, and that no one saw it in the prisoner's—the prisoner did not take me to the surgery; he came afterwards; I heard him tell several people that he struck the blows in self defence—I did not deny it—I don't mean that I said it was a lie; I don't see why he had any reason to strike me; it is not true that I struck him first; I told the sergeant it was untrue; we had only been into one public house, the Grown; we went to an eating house about 5.20, and had tea—we had tea again at the prisoner's house about ten minutes after—I did not go to the prisoner's house to fight him, he asked me to go—he left me alone with my wife—there was no jealousy on my part, I did not care a bit about her living with another man, I was rather pleased than otherwise.</p>

I am a surgeon, of Eltham—the prosecutor was brought to my surgery between six and seven o'clock on the 27th December by Cotton, the postman, and Manley—he was bleeding very much from the face and head, and was much exhausted—there was a wound across the nose, dividing the cartilages and exposing the nasal passages, a wound on the right ear, a portion of the rim of the ear being shaved off, a scalp wound of about an inch in length on the right side of the head, just above the wounded ear, and two superficial wounds, one on the top and one on the back of the head—I dressed the wounds, and he was afterwards taken to the Cottage Hospital—he has been an in-patient up to last Monday he has nearly recovered, except the wound on the ear—the wounds could be caused by such a chopper as this—they would not be caused by falling on the ground—it must have been some sharp instrument—they were all of an incised character.</p>

I am a labourer, of 2, Victoria Place, East Greenwich—about 10 o'clock on 2nd December I was in the British Queen public-house, Trafalgar Road, East Greenwich—the prisoner came in after me—I treated him to two half-pints of ale—we left together about half-past 10—I asked him to see me home—he said "I will just see you home, come along"—he took me in the wrong direction about five minutes' walk from the British Queen public-house to where there was a lonely road with no houses built—he asked me to walk up there, that he wanted a private conversation with me—I refused to go, I said that was not my way home—he closed me up very close, and grasped the silver Geneva watch out of my waistcoat pocket, and gave it a rough drag and broke it off the chain, and ran up the fields—I shouted out, I lost him, and the minute I came to West Combe Park Station I gave information to the police, and went with Sergeant Holt to the spot again where the robbery was done—I there found the bow of the watch-my watch was safe up to the very minute the prisoner committed the robbery—I saw the watch in his hand after he gave it a rough pull—I was as sober as I am now, only I had had, I dare say, two half-pints of ale—I have not seen the watch since, it has not been found—I next saw the prisoner about 11 o'clock the same night—I knew where he lodged, and I went to his lodging with the sergeant, and pulled him out of his lodging—it was half-past 11 the same evening.</p>

I practise at Camberley, in Surrey—my house is half a mile or rather more from the Crosby Hill Lodge—I had seen his nephew, on one occasion he came to my surgery to consult me about a skin eruption—on Thursday, September 22nd, I was aroused after I had gone to bed, about 11 or half-past, I should say nearer half-past than 11 o'clock; it was the prisoner who called me up; he said he wanted me to come and see his wife, he was afraid she was dying; he said he thought she was in a fit; he was in a very excited state, he wished me not to delay—I got up and rode on my tricycle—I overtook the prisoner on the road, about half-way there—as we went along together the prisoner said he had been given to understand his wife had heart disease by his former medical attendant, and he was not to be surprised at any time if she died suddenly—knowing his son, I asked him how it was he did not send his son for me, as he said he had no one in the house—I thought it was his son—he said there was something the matter with him also—he said he had a pain in his back, and he was very thirsty; he had previously given him a little water, and he expressed himself as feeling better, so he left him; he thought probably he had got a bilious attack—he also told me he had tried to rouse his next door neighbour, Mrs. Sharp, but he could not make any one hear—then I arrived with him at the lodge; he preceded me in—before I got in I first of all, outside, heard some one crying for help—I could hear loud cries of some one, a man's voice—as soon as I had put my tricycle on one side I went in—I found the prisoner standing over his wife in the room downstairs; she was lying down in front of the fireplace on the floor on the hearth rug, something was on the floor, with her head towards the door nearest to me—on my entering the prisoner said he thought she was dying—I walked round to look at her, and by her appearance I said I thought she was too—the woman was very pale indeed, the pupils were very dilated and fixed, her jaw was rigidly contracted; I could not move it, and she was pulseless—the only signs of life</p>

               <p>I could observe were a few muscular twitchings about the muscles of the face—she was <hi rend="italic">in articulo mortis</hi>, at the point of death—the prisoner then requested me to go upstairs to see his son, as he was very ill, and he could not tell what was the matter with him—the prisoner had not been upstairs before he said that, that I saw—I sent him for some whisky and brandy, and went upstairs to see the boy—the woman was not actually dead before I went up—I went up, and the prisoner went out to get brandy—the boy, Edward Bowles, was calling loudly for help, for water, I think—if I remember he was calling "Water, water"—he was in violent convulsions—he was in bed undressed, with only his check shirt on—the place was surrounded with his black vomit, the walls and bedclothes and floor; it was pouring copiously from his mouth—it was impossible for him to move when he was in a convulsion—his countenance was very dusky, his lips livid, his eyes were staring, and his pupils dilated—the hands were clenched, and the arms drawn across the chest in a state of flexion, and the spine was arched, and the legs and feet were also rigidly contracted; in fact, his whole muscular system was in a state of extreme tension—the prisoner had not time to return while I was noticing this; he had to go some way to get the brandy; he had to go to Major O'Sullivan—he came back before I left, before the boy was dead—the boy was perfectly conscious, his mind was intact—I asked him if he was in any pain—he knew my question, he knew the terrible position he was in—he said he should die if I could not remove the load from his chest—he said he could not get his breath. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He said he was not in pain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No. The convulsions did not last long—after it had passed off I questioned him as to what he had been taking—he told me for supper he had had nothing but a little bread and jam, and he had swallowed one antibilious pill afterwards—I asked him if he had been eating any mushrooms or fungi—he said "No"—when I took hold of his hand he went off in another violent convulsion; the slightest touch was sufficient to bring them on—a man named Evans, whom the prisoner had called up, came before the prisoner came back, with a little whisky in his pocket; he keeps a fly and drove up in a fly—he came in a cab while the prisoner was out for the brandy—he had some whisky in a flask—I gave Edward Bowles a little of the whisky and water—after Evans came I went home to fetch chloroform, I knew I could do nothing for him, leaving Evans and Mrs. Deverel in the house—I left the boy alive, he was getting much worse, the convulsions were getting stronger and longer—the woman was dead when I came down—she must have died very soon after twelve; she died very soon after I was in the house, about five minutes—before I left the house to fetch the chloroform I had seen a pill-box on the mantelpiece in the downstairs sitting-room—I had seen that before Bowles left for the brandy when I first came into the room—I picked it up and examined the inside of it very carefully; it was perfectly clean, I could find nothing in it; it was a one-dram pill box, similar to that (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); it had the name of the chemist, Claypole, on it—I saw particularly it was perfectly clean inside—I looked for that—there was no trace of chalk, nothing—I should think it was half an hour before I returned with the chloroform—I passed through the living room when I came back—I went up to the bedroom, and there found the boy Edward dead on the floor—when I came back the prisoner Evans and Mrs. Deverel were all in the downstairs room—they told me the son was dead—I went up to have a look at him and them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188801090135"/>
               <p>came downstairs and had a talk with the prisoner—I asked him if he could tell me whether they had had anything likely to cause the symptoms—he said he did not take suppers and could not tell what they had had, and did not know what they had had for supper, for he had been reading his gardening magazine and smoking; he heard them talking about taking pills, and he looked up and he saw the jam on the table; he suggested they had better not take so many pills but get some salts, as his mother had recommended him to do; he said he could not tell whether they had been taking any mushrooms or anything for supper—I asked a question that led to that; he could not tell; they had been having some lately, as they grew plentifully on the estate; he had cautioned his son not to get any—I could not be quite certain how the prisoner spoke of the boy—I was always under the impression he was his son, now I recollect he called him his nephew, I think because he explained the reason to me for doing so at some other time I think—he said he cautioned the young man not to get any, as he did not think he could distinguish the poisonous from the non-poisonous unless he was with him to show him—I asked him if he had been using any of Battle's vermin killer; he said "No," at that time—he told me his wife had made a very peculiar remark before she died, and he could not think what induced her to do so; it was to this effect, that "If anything happens to me, Ted, I hope your poor father won't be blamed"—he made that remark to me after he came back with the brandy after his wife was dead—he described the circumstances under which she made this observation—he said she made it thinking his son or Edward was in the room instead of him, and that she made the remark before he came for me, but after she was ill—when she was on the floor—that was all the conversation we had—I looked round to see if I could see anything—I must have asked him for that pill-box again on his return; he said he had got many other pillboxes like them—the pill-box had gone, he must have moved it—after I had inquired about it I noticed it was gone—I inquired about the pillbox when I came back, when they were dead—I inquired of the prisoner for the pill-box that I had seen on the mantelpiece—I made that inquiry because I wanted to know all I could about the pills—it was after the boy had made a statement to me about taking the pill—after I returned with the chloroform I asked the prisoner about the pill-box; I wanted to see it again—I said I wanted to see the pill-box I saw on the mantelpiece—he had mislaid it or something; he did not know where it was—he told me he had got several more like it that he kept his garden seeds in, and he got some from a side drawer—I cannot remember now whether he said he had mislaid it—I think he said he did not know where it was—I then looked for it where it had originally been, on the mantelpiece; it was not there—the prisoner then produced some others from a drawer; he had several of them—most of them were like that, the same size—he said he kept small garden seeds in them—he said these pill-boxes were some of the same sort—as far as I can remember they were all labelled in the same way, "Claypoles Antibilious Pills"—I did not notice that particularly—I noticed the size of the boxes—that was all that took place on that night—next morning, the 23rd, I went to the lodge again with another medical man, Dr. Manders—I took away from the lodge a bottle containing greengage jam with one of Crosse and Blackwell's labels on it, a tin dripping-pan containing scraps of food, a galli<lb/>pot</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188801090136"/>
               <p>containing some treacly-looking substance—those were the only traces of food I found that I could take away, and there was some uncooked meat in the larder—I took charge of those things, and afterwards handed them to the police sergeant—on the same evening I, with Dr. Manders, made a post-mortem examination of the two bodies—as to Hannah Bowles the body was pale, and of course stiffened; the spine was slightly arched—she had her clothes on of course, and we could see nothing more—she was still on the floor then, and with her clothes on—the rigor mortis well marked, stiffening well marked, pupils dilated equally; heart pale, flaccid, empty; valves healthy; right lung healthy, old adhesions; left lung somewhat congested; liver healthy; gall bladder empty; membranes of brain and brain substance healthy; fluid in both ventricles; kidneys healthy; gall stones in the gall duct—we took out the stomach and put it in a jar, and sealed it, and marked it with the name—the Coroner had it afterwards—there was nothing to guide my opinion as to the cause of death upon this post-mortem, except the boy's condition; there was nothing as to the woman—there was nothing with regard to the condition of the heart and other regions to indicate the woman was addicted to drink—the liver, kidneys, and heart were all quite healthy—nor was there anything in the condition of the heart to show she was a woman likely to die suddenly at any time—then I went on to make a post-mortem examination of the body of the boy Edward Bowles—we went upstairs, placed the body which was on the floor on the bed, and removed the shirt—he was placed on the floor the night before; he begged to be moved, they always do when the convulsions come on, and he was moved in my absence—we placed him on the bed; the surface of the bedclothes and walls were all covered with a black vomit—both flexors and extensors of the feet were in a state of extreme tension: the spine was arched; the complexion was dusky; the pupils were dilated; rigor mortis was well marked; lungs healthy; heart healthy, full of blood, uncontracted; liver healthy; small intestine slightly congested; upper part of duodenum had a rod patch on it—I could not tell what that was caused by—oblong patch of reddish-brown colour alone at the pyloric end of the stomach; kidneys healthy—I did the same thing with the stomach of the boy, sealed it up in a jar separately—there was not, so far as we went, anything in the postmortem of the boy to indicate the cause of death—we could not tell what the patches on the duodenum and stomach were; they might have been bile stains—we did not open them—we could only see them from the outside; we could not open them because they were to be sent up for analysis—the prisoner was not present while we were making the postmortem on the body of the boy—we had a difficulty in getting him out of the room, but we did eventually turn him out and bolt the door; he came again several times, but could not get in—before we commenced the post-mortem we had difficulty in getting rid of him, we wanted to begin, it was getting late—he wanted to stop, I suppose—before he left the room I called Dr. Manders's attention to the boy's feet—the prisoner said that contracted sort of muscular condition of the feet was natural to him—some observation was made in the prisoner's presence about the condition of the feet in the morning—the prisoner said he had a peculiar walk—he thought that was natural to him; that was the contorted condition of the tendons, the muscles—we did not agree to it—we said we did not think it could be</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188801090137"/>
               <p>explained in that way—with the other things I have mentioned we also took away some part of the sheet and some other things that contained the vomit, the sheet, the boy's shirt, and just a little off the wall—we made up that into a parcel; it was afterwards given to the police—I have since heard the result of the analysis of the stomach—having heard that strychnine was found in the stomach, in my opinion strychnine poisoning was the cause of the death of Hannah Bowles—I said that before the analysis—nothing in the post-mortem guided one to the cause of death—I formed the opinion she died of strychnine poisoning from the condition of the boy; I first formed the opinion, I mean, that they had died from strychnine poisoning; I could not form that opinion from the woman—when I saw the boy in a state of convulsion I could not conceive anything else that could cause it—that was what led me to ask the prisoner about it—when I asked him about Battle's vermin killer, he said he had got some—I formed the opinion when I saw the boy in these tetanic convulsions, and the boy was perfectly conscious, and then I asked the prisoner whether he had any Battle's vermin killer—he said he had not—he said about a week afterwards that he had been thinking it over, and he had been using it—the post-mortem was made on the 23rd—I saw him about a week afterwards; he was going to church, at all events he had a Bible; it was on the Sunday week—he took a short cut, and came up to me and said he had been thinking over what I said to him about using vermin killer, and he remembered he did use it for poisoning sparrows, but not at Crosby Hill—the pyloric end of the stomach is the end that leads into the small intestine, the bowel—the duodenum is the small bowel—I think that is all he said to me on the Sunday—I have not explained how it was he called the lad his nephew; that was not the same day; I think that was on the road up there that night when I was on the tricycle—he said he did that because the other men should not think he showed any partiality towards him—it was when I said "Why did not your son come up?" he said "He passes as my nephew"—he thought if he went as his son they would think he would favour him—that was his explanation, and that he really was his son—on the next day I made no search for the pill-box that had been missing the night before, or any further inquiries about it at all—the police<lb/>man had it then, I think—the policeman had a pill-box; I don't know whether it was the original one—I never saw as far as I know that particular pill-box that had been on the mantelpiece—during the 10 months they had lived there I had never visited the woman Hannah Bowles at all—I never visited the lodge at all; the boy came down to see me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I don't think the passage in the deposition is a correct statement of what I said: "On the evening of the death to which I have referred, namely, 22nd September, the prisoner showed me an ordinary small pillbox empty which he took from the mantelpiece of the sitting-room, and told me me those were the pills they had been in the habit of taking; the box was labelled 'antibilious pills,' and had the name Claypole On it; there were several other pill-boxes; the prisoner produced them to me; I looked round the rooms upstairs and down for matter of a suspicious nature, but found nothing"—there was only one box on the mantelpiece; I did not see any man there—the others were in a drawer—"On the evening of the death to which I have referred, 22nd</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188801090138"/>
               <p>Sept., the prisoner showed me an ordinary small pill-box, empty, which he took from the mantelpiece of the sitting-room"—he showed me the pill-box; there was nothing in it—the box was labelled 'antibilious pills'—several boxes were labelled in the same way there, which the prisoner produced to me from a drawer—I said nothing in my deposition about opening the box and the absence of chalk—I did not make that statement before—I looked round the rooms both upstairs and down for something of a suspicious character, but found nothing—I remember using those words—the box was empty and therefore useless—I think it worth while now to state there was no chalk in it, because I informed the chemist after I had given my evidence—I do not mean to say the chemist suggested to me signs of chalk should be in the box; I suggested it—I asked him what he had been in the habit of rolling his pills in—some use liquorice powder—he was in the habit of using French chalk—I saw the pill-box for the first time after I had attended the woman and before I went upstairs—I took it up in my hand and carefully examined the inside—the prisoner was with me in the room—I do not mention in my evidence then that I ever asked for it again—I did not give that in evidence then a week or ten days after the event, because at first I had no idea it was a case of poisoning, but by thinking it over—from the state of the boy I had no doubt it was a case of strychnine poisoning, but I did not know whether accidental or suicidal—I did not mention about the pill-box at the time; I did not attach anything to it—there was nothing in it, to discover in it—he showed me the other pillboxes—he took them from a little drawer in a little sort of sideboard, or something he had on the side in the same room—I could not say how many boxes were there, half-a-dozen, something of that sort—I did not look inside all those—I could not say for certain that I looked inside any of them—I did not notice that they were clean also, except for seeds—I believe chemists put up pills in boxes with different sorts of materials; if they are sold in large quantities sometimes they are coated with sugar—small quantities for poor people they roll plain as they are made, and then use French chalk to prevent them sticking together—sometimes they are rolled perfectly plain without any coating whatever to render them tasteless—these little dram boxes will only hold four—I think I made mention to the boy about mushrooms—he said he had not taken any that day—he then said he had had a little bread and jam, and he had taken one antibilious pill—he did not say the prisoner, his father, had given it to him—he did not mention his father's name at all—I did not ask him how long after he had had his supper or the pill he had first become ill—I did not gather what time he had had his supper; only from the prisoner, not from the lad—that was the only conversation I had with him—I asked him whether he had eaten any mushrooms, and then he told me what he had had for supper—then he spoke about the load on his chest—I noticed when I got up there the room was very plainly furnished—there was a bed and a box—the woman died during my absence when I was upstairs with the lad—I have not had experience before of deaths by strychnine—I have never seen a death caused by that poison before in a human subject—the tetanic symptoms are the same with animals; the arching of the spine and the condition of the limbs; therefore any one accustomed to use strychnine for vermin and animals would know at once the sort of sufferings that would ensue—I should think it was one</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188801090139"/>
               <p>of the most painful deaths from poisoning possible, and it would produce the same kind of suffering on animals as on human beings; it is not always the same—the woman did not lead me to think of that—in the post-mortem I discovered her heart was empty, flaccid, and pale; it was not a strong heart—many persons have an idea that they have symptoms that would lead them to think they have a weak heart—so far as I could see there were no signs with regard to the liver that she had need of these antibilious pills—there were no symptoms of liver disease at all—I don't know what was in the stomach; I did not open it—when the prisoner came to me he was in a very excited condition, and begged me to come at once—that was between 11 and half past as far as I recollect—beyond begging me to come and telling me his wife was ill, very little passed—he told me his wife was in a fit when he was at my house; nothing else—he went off and I got up to dress—I spoke to him from a window—he said he was afraid his wife was in a fit—the conversation was from the street to the second-floor window—the working classes round Camberley look on me as their medical man and come to me, and therefore he came to me—the prisoner's son had been to me previously, his name was on my books—it depends how long it takes for strychnine to act on how it is taken, and the subject—if taken in a pill it depends on the pill, whether it is recently made, or has been kept some time—if the pills were old they would take much longer in dissolving than if newly made—if either of these pills contained a third of a grain and were newly made they would be half an hour to an hour before they began to act on the system; they must have time to dissolve—supposing they had been made three years I should not like to say how long they would take to dissolve in the stomach and act; some pass through like bullets if they are kept too long—half a day might not elapse if they had been kept a long time; they would not act at all if not before that a good deal—I could not say whether it would be possible for strychnine in old pills not to act—supposing freshly made, I think it would be half an hour to an hour before they produced effect, as a rule, and if kept longer their action would be longer—it would vary in different subjects; people's digestions vary—the longer made the longer they take, because they are not so soluble—I don't think the prisoner seemed in a very distressed condition about his son's death; he seemed in a muddled state, confused—I thought there was nothing suspicious at that time; I never suspect people unless I have a reason—the next conversation I had with him after that date was Sunday week—I met him on the road; he had a Bible and prayer book with him; I think he said he was going to church—Saturday was the first day of the inquest; it was finished some time in October—it was while the inquest was in progress that I saw him; it had not concluded—then he remarked that he knew he had Battle's vermin killer, but not at Crosby Hill—I asked him if there was any vermin killer then in the lodge—he said he had not any, but he recollected using it before he came to Crosby Hill—I should think a pill containing a third of a grain of strychnine would not have a different taste to an ordinary antibilious pill; antibilious pills have a taste; it depends what they are made of—I did not know these pills—I never took them—I know what the component parts are—a pill containing this amount of strychnine would have the bitter taste which is its most prominent physical characteristic—when one-third of a grain is placed in a small pill it would</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188801090140"/>
               <p>not give a bitter taste to the pill; it would in a liquid state, but not sufficient in a dry state to arouse anyone's suspicion—I don't remember that I said anything to Mrs. Deverel about the pill-box—the sergeant did not have the pill-box; I think the policeman did; the policeman had one, I think—I did not see it given to the police-constable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I mean Holdforth, the Camberley policeman—I am not quite sure if he is the constable who was called before the Coroner—he is not the person of whom you can make inquiries where the pill-box came from—he is the officer who took the pill-box—from what I saw of the tetanic convulsion of the youth I then thought he was in a state of strychnine poisoning—the symptoms to a professional eye of the person affected were those of strychnine poisoning—they were perfectly marked in the case of the boy—I could not conceive any other explanation—he was not in great pain, but in a terrible state—he felt he was going to die, and he did die—he was perspiring profusely, an ordinary indication of great suffering—I said before the Magistrate: "I asked the deceased Edward what he had taken; I asked him first whether he took any mushrooms or fungi; he said 'No, I only had a little bread and jam for supper, and I took afterwards an antibilious pill"—he did not say he had swallowed it—I concluded he had swallowed it; he had taken it—what the boy said was probably, "And I took afterwards an antibilious pill"—I mentioned Battle's vermin killer—Mrs. Deverel was in the room when I asked about the pill-box, and the prisoner said he did not know where it was—she w is not actually there when I examined the pill-box—when I came back and asked for it, and he said he did not know where it was, Mrs. Deverel was there and Evans too.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, and also a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in England—I live at York Town, Frimley, in Surrey, and practise there—I never attended the deceased woman or the youth; I never saw them in my life—I attended on Friday morning; the 23rd, with Dr. Twort, and also in the evening at the post-mortem—I have carefully listened to the statements made by Dr. Twart as to the condition of those bodies, and I have also heard him give from his notes an account of what was found on the post-mortem—I think it is rather a mistake to say we were not permitted to open the stomach—we came to the conclusion that we had better not do so, because the cause of death was to be found in the postmortem, and we felt sure the cause of death would be found in the stomachs, and agreeing together we thought it injudicious to interfere with them, as they would go to the analysts—there was certainly no appearance in the heart or valves of the heart of the woman to indicate anything like heart disease—I may say Dr. Twort told me when he came to me on the morning after the death that he thought it was a case of strychnine poisoning—there was nothing to indicate disease of the heart; it was a pale flabby heart, but there was nothing to indicate disease of the heart—there was certainly no indication in the brain, liver, kidneys, or any organ of her being a person of intemperate habits—at 11 o'clock on the morning of the 23rd I went to the lodge at Crosby Hill, and there saw the prisoner—there was a con<lb/>versation</p>

               <p>with me alone when Dr. Twort was not with me—I got to the lodge, and found the prisoner there standing at the gate—I was waiting for Dr. Twort—I entered into conversation with the prisoner—we were talking about the affair—he told me about it—I did not know for some time that he was Bowles, and then it must have been I suppose five to seven minutes when he suddenly seemed to say "My poor boy"—he seemed to break down—I said "Oh, then you are the gardener?"—he said Yes, he was—then I knew he was related—we talked about mushrooms—I asked him if he had been eating any—he said they had had mushrooms—he told me the boy had been cautioned by him as he did not know a mushroom from a fungus—that was the conversation outside between me and him; then he went on to talk about his wife—he said she was a queer and nasty tempered woman, something to that effect, and that she always took his money, for which she rendered no account; that Dr. Muller gave him a cheque, which he backed, was his expression, and gave to her; that she would bear no interference with her house or the expenditure of the money; but I don't quite know what gave rise to his saying that—it was this occasion of my speaking to him—something was said on this occasion, at the same conversation, as to what his wife had said when she was ill—Dr. Twort had already told me about it before at my house; that was how I knew it—I asked the prisoner if his wife had said anything about whether, if anything happened to her, he should not be blamed—I did not put it in those words, I led up to it—I asked him if his wife had said anything to him about that, and then he made some statement to me; he said "If anything happens to me, Ted, don't let your poor father be blamed; "I think that was it, I am sure that was it—he said he (Bowles) was present, kneeling by her, and that he was bathing her temples; she thought it was the boy, that is what he gave me to understand; that is how he explained it—the putting in the jars of the two stomachs and sealing and marking them, and collecting a little of the vomit and making the collection for the Coroner that has been spoken to by Dr. Twort, was not very definitely stated; the stomach of the woman was tied and labelled before we went upstairs to the boy; the boy's stomach was taken out, tied, and labelled, and put in the same jar—we put that in the cupboard and locked it up, and took the key of the cupboard away—next day these were handed over to the Coroner, who sealed them up with a seal I have with me now, and they were given then into the charge of the police sergeant—they were in separate jars—they were locked in the cupboard, removed from the cupboard to the Coroner, and then the two stomachs were put in separate jars—Bowles fetched string to tie them up with—the jars were separately labelled, one having the woman's and the other the youth's stomach, the labels were not touched—I searched the room and found in the youth's room no utensils, nothing at all, no earthenware vessel of any description, no wash-basin, nothing, there was only a small box in the corner—on the first day of the inquest, before the burial, I went to Dr. Muller's house—there was an inquest before the funeral, and then the adjourned inquest—the first time of the inquest being held I went to Dr. Muller's house—I searched for poison in justice to Dr. Muller—Bowles had said that Dr. Muller kept poisons in his house to which his wife had access—the prisoner told me that when I was talking to him, not at the gate, but the same morning, after Dr.</p>

               <p>Twort had joined me and we had gone into the house—it was the same morning in the grounds—I went in justice to Dr. Muller to see what poisons there were—there were no poisons there unless you took a large quantity of them, ammonia, hydrochloric acid, alum, carbolic acid, Condy's fluid, things chiefly for making manures—Dr. Muller is Lot a doctor of medicine, but a doctor of science—some of those things that I have classified as poisonous can be used for disinfecting purposes, carbolic acid, Condy's fluid—I went to see what was there because I knew Dr. Muller was an analytical chemist, and I thought it possible but not likely that he would let any one have access to them, but there was nothing there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I don't know anything about the action of the woman's heart, because I never saw the woman alive—a perfectly healthy heart might be pale and flabby if the individual was pale and flabby—such a heart would give rise to no symptoms of heart disease in life—it might not give rise to some kind of pain, palpitation, or anything apparent—pain in that region would be probably due to indigestion with such a heart as that—there might be a pain in that region, I could not say—if she had a pain she might get the idea of weakness of the heart; I don't know that she had a pain—I had a conversation with him before I discovered he was Bowles—I had been speaking some little time, and then he broke down about his poor boy—I cannot say he was in trouble about him, he seemed to break down; he had been talking to me for five or seven minutes beforehand, and then said 'Oh, my poor boy, what shall I do," and he laid his fingers over his face, and turned away as if he had suddenly recollected his boy—Dr. Twort told me strychnine poisoning was undoubted—I looked particularly at the boy because it was such a marked case of strychnine poisoning; the woman's was not so marked; she was lying on the floor with all her clothes on, the boy was stark naked, with the exception of his shirt—the prisoner told me about the cheque, because he said she was a nasty temper, and Dr. Muller paid him by cheque, which he endorsed and then handed over to his wife; I don't know why he told us that—that was after he spoke of his boy—unconsciousness does not arise at all from strychnine poisoning alone—the prisoner had said there were poisons in Dr. Muller's house, he had not described them at all, simply said he knew there were poisons to which his wife might have access; he said Dr. Muller used them for manures; you may call them poisonous, but you would have to take a considerable dose; there were not really any poisons there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Having seen the heart at the post-mortem, I should not think much of a medical man who would say the woman was a person likely to fall down dead in a moment—no good medical man would say so—one person being so sick and the other not might be according to the quantity eaten by each person, or the effect on different people—strychnine does not always produce the same effect; take a young man of 18, of strong muscular fibre, and a pale, flabby woman, the woman would die sooner—the woman did not vomit, she died first, but she had the arching of the spine, and they had a very peculiarly marked rigor—a dose of strychnine does not necessarily produce sickness, it depends very largely on the state of the person—we heard that the woman had a weak heart, so we examined that heart particularly, perhaps more carefully than the other.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist, carrying on business at York Town and Camberley in Surrey—the shop at Camberley is about half a mile from Crosby Hill—the shop at York Town is farther away—I superintend the shop at Camberley, and I also have an assistant there—I am in the habit of manufacturing and selling antibilious pills—I sell them in boxes similar to this one produced, with my name upon them—the usual quantity we make would be about half a pound of the mass, and that will make about 64 dozen pills—they are never made in quantities of two, and three, and four—each pill weighs five grains—I produce the formula from which they, are made—the ingredients are calomel, Castile soap, powdered tragacanth, powdered capsicum, powdered gamboge, scammonix, colocynth, aloes—the ealomel is a preparation of mercury, and is the active ingredient in the pill—that is the only poisonous ingredient—the quantity of calomel in a pill is about five-eighths of a grain—the boxes contain either 2, 4, 6, 12, or 24 pills—this is what I call a one-dram box, that would contain either two or four—the pills when made are rolled in French chalk, a fine white powder, and then they are put into the boxes—this is a box containing two, but they have been in the box since the case was at Farnham, and I think the powder is a little dry, a little absorbed—they are not coated, they are only rolled in powder—I don't think this pill-box has been used; I brought it with me this morning in case somebody might want to see it—I put these pills into boxes after the case was tried at Farnham—if a man came to my shop to buy two pills I would deliver this or something like this to him—I don't know whether any French chalk can be seen in this box now, it could when the pills were put in—the pills are rolled in French chalk and then put into the boxes—this one has not been used at all, I should think—no chalk is put into the boxes except what is on the pill when it is put in; except what the pill has been rolled in—I cannot tell exactly when was the last time before the 22nd September that any quantity of these pills were made; I make no memorandum of the times we make the pills, but I should think it would be six weeks or two months before—they are made at the York Town shop, and supplied to the Camberley shop for retail—some pills were made soon after the 22nd, perhaps 10 days after; I cannot say exactly—I know a fresh quantity was made about 10 days after the 22nd; I can't say exactly—nearly all the previous quantity had then been sold—I have strychnine at York Town—at the York Town shop the strychnine was kept in a distinct place, quite separate from any calomel—it is in a different part of the shop; it may be three or four yards from it—it is kept in a small cupboard, with other poisons—it is not kept with</p>

                  </hi>, M. D. I am lecturer on Medical Jurisprudence at Guy's Hospital, and I am official analyst to the Home Office—on 27th September last I received from the constable, James Heighes, first, a jar labelled "Mrs. Bowles," containing her stomach; secondly, a jar labelled "Edward Bowles," containing his stomach; thirdly, a gallipot labelled "Found in fire flue; "fourthly, a pot labelled "greengage jam; "fifthly, a parcel labelled "Tin found in oven "and sheet; and sixthly, a parcel labelled "Part of shirt of Edward Bowles," and I have examined and analysed all those articles—on analysing the stomach of Mrs. Bowles I found it had the appearances of a healthy stomach, containing 3¼ ounces of thickish material, in which the only recognisable article of food was slices of French or runner beans—the stomach and its contents contained fluid that yielded one poison, strychnine; the quantity was about a quarter of a grain, and there was no other poison or calomel or any other pre<lb/>paration</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188801090145"/>
               <p>of mercury—I have heard Mr. Claypole's description of his antibilious pills, and the formula from which they are made—if a person had taken one of those antibilious pills at any time that evening I should have expected to find traces of the calomel or mercury—strychnine is a poison which is absorbed into the tissues quickly—from the quantity which I found in the stomach I formed the opinion she must have taken a large dose, that is to say a fatal dose; a quarter of a grain is quite the quantity you would find after one or two grains had been taken during life—ordinarily a fatal dose is about a grain, but half a grain will destroy life in an adult—half a grain has destroyed life in an adult, but one grain may be taken as a usual fatal dose—I then examined No. 2 jar, the stomach of Edward Bowles—it contained a human stomach, inside which was a quantity of dark fluid or semi-fluid matter containing a considerable quantity of tough mucus and some blood—there were also articles of food recognisable, French and runner beans, potato, a plum stone; it also contained strychnine, about one-third of a grain, but no other poison or preparation of mercury—I assumed that Edward Bowles must have taken a large dose of strychnine to have left that third of a grain in the stomach, for he had vomited, I heard in evidence, and of course in vomiting he would be likely to reject some of the contents of the stomach, including poison—he had certainly taken more than a grain, I should think—on the stomach of Edward Bowles I noticed besides a patch of mouldiness there was a mark close to the pyloric end of the stomach; that was the mark of a bile stain, no doubt—after death the gall bladder had stained it by being merely in contact with the bladder; in popular language it was a bile stain—No. 3, the gallipot, contained merely a small quantity of burnt sugar, no poison; No. 4 was simply greengage jam with no poison; No. 5, a parcel containing the dripping pan containing the remains of cooked food—the food was fried matter, liver, scales of a fish, potato skins, French or runner beans, no poison—in that same parcel there was a sheet and a pillow case, and upon that were remains of dark vomit, mixed with blood, like the contents of the stomach of Edward Bowles—I extracted those and also a portion of the shirt in No. 6—I combined them all together—I also found vomit on the shirt in No. 6—I treated five and six together, and found they contained remains of the runner beans, the sheet, pillow case, and shirt—I extracted strychnine from those; the quantity was about one twelfth of a grain—there was no other poison—there was no trace of mercury—I have heard the evidence of Dr. Twort and Dr. Mander—looking at what I found on analysis in my opinion strychnine was the cause of death—the fact of one person vomiting and the other not makes no difference in my judgment—strychnine is the active principle of nux vomica, the vomiting-nut, so called because it produces vomiting—people who take strychnine in a pure condition don't as a rule vomit; they die very speedily, but in a very decided number of cases it irritates the stomach and produces vomiting—it is not the characteristic symptom, but one not infrequently met with—the same quantity of strychnine might produce vomiting in one person and not in another—taking the cases where vomiting occurs one cannot associate the vomiting at all with the quantity—I am speaking of a case where a large and dangerous or fatal quantity is given, of course—a dose such as I have mentioned of a grain may begin to act within three minutes; a common time is 15, 20, or 30 minutes, but occasionally when taken in pills it has</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188801090146"/>
               <p>been delayed for a longer time, up to three hours—the effect may be exhibited almost immediately, within three minutes; as a rule, within 15 or 20 minutes—if taken in pills that are hard and old they may be delayed for rather an indefinite period, three hours I have known, but that is decidedly an unusual time—if taken in pills not hard and old the average time within which it would begin to act is half an hour—with reference to this being taken in pills, it is a poison that has an extraordinarily bitter taste; one grain in a gallon of water is intensely bitter—in my judgment it could not be taken except in the form of a pill without being noticed; it could not be taken in articles of food—it is not a poison that loses its properties at all by being kept; it will remain unchanged for any length of time, 20 years to my knowledge, certainly—I have as an experiment made up these two pills the same size as Mr. Claypole's antibilious pills, 5-grain size, each of them contains 4 grains of strychnine—if anything these are a trifle larger than Mr. Claypole's, but nothing material—Mr. Claypole's are darker because there is not so much of the coating powder; mine are coated with liquorice to prevent them sticking—these are evidently old—there is no difficulty in making up strychnine into the form of pills if you know how—any one who has made a pill before would easily make one—it could be done with a little gum and glycerine or treacle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> These pills with four grains of strychnine were made in the dispensary in the ordinary way; rubbed up in a mortar and on the slab, the ingredients mixed, and then if making several you make them on a kind of grooved slab, on which you put a kind of roller, and roll them—the grooves divide them as you rub them; make them of a certain size—the size of the pill depends on the size of the groove—I think it is liquorice I coated the pills with—I put on some inert powder of that kind—I have seen those produced to Mr. Claypole—I think mine are a trifle larger—I had not seen his before—I mean by saying his are old, the dusting powder is absorbed by the pill; is fallen off; they are not made within the last few days—I forget how many were made; I think more than those two—there is no difficulty in making up single pills, or two pills—supposing strychnine was in those pills with calomel, the more powerful poison would not destroy the power of the weaker one—a grain would be a fatal dose—I discovered a quarter of a grain in Mrs. Bowles's, and one-third in young Bowles's stomach—I imagine a large portion of the fatal dose had been absorbed—supposing there were the amount of calomel in either of those pills described by Mr. Claypole, its absence would not be accounted for by the strength of the strychnine; if calomel and strychnine are in the same pill, calomel would be more likely to remain in the stomach than strychnine, it being more readily absorbed—if calomel had been in a pill I should certainly have found it in the stomach, or some preparation of mercury—the dark fluid in the boy's stomach was due to the blood being altered by the internal gastric juice of the stomach—it is not unusual in convulsions to bite the tongue and swallow blood—there was about three-quarters of a tumblerful of this blood—I do not think entirely that the longer strychnine had been preserved in a pill the longer it would take to work a fatal effect—it would depend partly on the substance of which the pill was made; some substances set hard sooner than others; some don't set hard at all—the materials in my pills besides strychnine are glycerine, tragacanth,</p>

               <p>gum tragacanth, glycerine and water—the materials in Mr. Claypole's pills are calomel, soap, tragacanth, and some extract of colocynth—the largest amount of material there is aloes; that is rather bitter;—strych nine is very bitter—the presence of one grain in one gallon of water. would make the water extremely bitter—I don't suppose anybody swallowing Mr. Claypole's pill, or a strychnine pill, would perceive much difference—pills of this sort are usually bitter, and strychnine is bitter—I don't think any ordinary individual would distinguish a strychnine, pill from an ordinary pill—the longest time I know for strychnine to begin to work is three hours—I think there have been cases recorded in America (of which I know very little) longer, but the longest case in England is three hours, where a bread pill was prepared for killing a dog, and the pill became hard.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at High Street, Camberley—I knew the deceased Hannah Bowles and the prisoner and the boy Edward Bowles slightly—I did not know very much of him—I have visited at the lodge—Mrs. Bowles seemed to be a very respectable person—as far as I saw her she was never in any way addicted to drinking—I never saw her—she was of a cheerful disposition always when I have seen her—I never saw anything unpleasant between her and the prisoner—about midnight on Thursday, 22nd September, I was called up by Evans, a cabman—I went with Evans to Crosby Hill Lodge—the prisoner was not with Evans. he had gone on in front—I should think my house was within a mile of the lodge—when I went into the lodge I went straight into the living room—the doctor was upstairs then—Mrs. Bowles was dead when I got in; before I got there—no one was in the room when I went in—Evans and I went in at the same time—Mrs. Bowles's body was on the floor—the prisoner had gone out; the doctor had sent him for something when I arrived—when I first went into the room I noticed on the mantelpiece</p>

               <p>a pill-box—I could tell the size of it—it was the size of that small one—I did not look at it at all—the doctor soon after came downstairs, and left the house—I called out the lad's name, and the doctor came down and asked me who it was—after that the doctor left the house—the prisoner had come back, before the doctor left, with some whisky and brandy; I did not see it; he passed upstairs with it—I did not have any conversation with the prisoner when he came in—I remained downstairs till the prisoner came down—he said he could stand it no longer; it was too much for him, the sight of seeing his son dying—he did not ask me to do anything; not then—he did not say anything about the deceased woman Mrs. Bowles then—he did not remain in the room; he went back upstairs—he came down again after the death of the son—he and Evans remained with the son till he died—I was in the room downstairs all the time—I left the room before the doctor came back—I went upstairs into the woman's bedroom, and took a sheet off her bed to cover over the body—while I did that the prisoner was upstairs—then the doctor returned, and they said the son was dead—Evans said "He is dead," and then the doctor went upstairs and looked at him, and he came down, and he asked Bowles where the pill-box was that stood on the mantelpiece—he said "I don't know, sir"—he went to a drawer, and took out some, and said "Here are some; these have no pills, and I keep them to keep my small seeds in"—when he said "I don't know, sir, "Ilooked across at the mantelpiece; I was sitting opposite to it—the pill-box was not there that I had seen before; it was removed—I had not touched it—I heard nothing further about the pill-box—after the doctor had gone and Evans came back to put his horses up the prisoner sat down in a chair and said to me then he felt very tired and sleepy—then he said he had no money of his own, would I feel in his wife's pocket to see if she had any money, and I said I would do so when it was daylight—then shortly after that Evans returned—I remained in the house that night until the morning, till Bracknell came, and after it was daylight the prisoner again asked me to feel in the pocket, which I did—I took a purse out. and handed it to the prisoner—I also handed him two letters and a piece of paper, like a bill—on that morning I went up to breakfast at Crosby house with Bracknell and the prisoner—the prisoner left us while we were at breakfast, and went back to the lodge—more than once he went out of the house—the prisoner burnt the two letters I had given him, saying they were of no consequence—I went back to the lodge that morning, when the doctors came between 11 and 12 o'clock; I could not tell exactly—Bowles unlocked the door—he was outside; he was near the lodge when they drove up in their carriage—we went in—I only tidied up the table that day; the things that were on table in the centre of the room—I did nothing more—I saw nothing more that morning of the pill-box which I had observed on the mantelpiece the night before—I did not go over the lodge in clearing up the place—I never saw any spirits in the house, only what the prisoner and Evans brought in that night—beyond what they brought in I saw no spirits—on my previous visits to the lodge I had not seen any spirits there at all, nothing more than a cup of tea—shortly before this Mrs. Bowles had made arrangements, to my knowledge, about the winter—she had remarked that she had been making some warm clothing.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> On 8th September I saw Mrs. Bowles; some time before that she said to me "If I don't feel well at any time I shall send for you"—that might be back in the summer, in June I think it was—I had said nothing to her about whether she was feeling unwell, but in the summer she said she was not feeling very well; I should think it would be June, she did not describe her symptoms in any way; she said she was not feeling very well, nothing more—she never spoke to me about her heart—I was on friendly terms with her; I knew her—I never remember she said anything praticularly to me about the money Bowles earned, in fact she never stated any sum—she did not tell me she had his cheques or his wages, or the money for housekeeping, never a word—before this sad event I had only been upstairs to the upper rooms once before, that was in March, when Mrs. Bowles showed me through the lodge; the boy, Edward Bowles, was not then living with his father—I don't think there was any furniture in the boy's room at that time—there might have been a few odds and ends, but no furniture—it was from their bedroom I went to fetch the sheet to put over the dead body—while I was in that room the prisoner was in the room where his boy was dying, he spoke to me; I told him what I was about to do; he said "Do exactly as you please; do what you like"—Evans was in the room at that time besides the prisoner and the dying boy—I first noticed the pill-box on the mantelpiece when I first went into the lodge—I did not leave the room till I went upstairs to fetch the sheet to put over the dead woman, when the prisoner came down and said he could not stand any longer the sight of his dying boy, Evans was upstairs—I had come down into the living room; it did not take me long—I never left the living room that night, till the morning—the prisoner stood between the doctor and me when he went to show the doctor where the other pill-boxes were—he opened a drawer and took out a box—when the doctor asked him where the pill-boxes were he said "I don't know, but here are some; they are all the same; they are small antibilious pill-boxes that I keep to keep my small seeds in"—I saw several of them; I think there were more of the larger than of the smaller size—this is the size I saw on the mantelpiece—I was at the big house when the policeman looked at some boxes—I was not called before the Magistrate—a gentle<lb/>man from the Treasury called at my house and asked me to give evidence; that was on a Saturday, last month; a fortnight ago I think—I told Dr. Manders about this pill-box—I told him I was very ill and could not come up last month—that was the first time I had ever told anybody about its disappearance—I spoke about it in my own family, which includes my husband and sons—I could not tell you when I mentioned it to them, I talked about it after I was ill, it made more impression on me—I was not feeling well at the time of the inquest; before this last month I was very ill with an ulcerated throat—about a month ago I mentioned it to Dr. Manders when he came, and he gave me a certificate that I was not able to come—this death caused some sensation in the village—I knew very little; I keep myself in my own house—I heard of the arrest; an arrest generally makes an impression in a small country village—I don't know why neither I nor my husband mentioned it to the police at the adjouned inquest, I did not think much</p>

I am a cab proprietor at Canberley—I have occasionally been employed at Crosby Hill with a horse and cart—I knew the deceased woman and the prisoner—she was a very industrious woman, upright, sober, and to my knowledge as good a wife as a man could have—from what I have seen of them they appeared to live together on fairly good terms—on this night of the 22nd I was called up by the prisoner—he said "My wife has a fit or a fainting fit; do you know Charlie Buby's mother?"—she has been married a second time; she is called Mrs. Deverel now; the prisoner called her Charlie Buby's mother—I said "Yes"—he said "If you would not mind calling her up and driving her up to my place I will pay you for it"—I did so, I called Mrs. Deverel and drove her up—when I arrived at the lodge I entered the living room before Mrs. Deverel—when I went in Dr. Twort had just come downstairs—I did not notice anything on the mantelpiece when I first went in the room; after the deaths I noticed a pill-box on the mantelpiece, after the boy had died I mean—it was an ordinary pill-box, the smallest size; the smallest size, I should think, of those two produced—I did not touch it at all, Dr. Twort did; he took the pill-box off the mantelpiece and opened it—I saw no more of it after that time—I cannot say what the doctor did with it; I fancy he put it back in the same place as it contained nothing—I was not present afterwards when it was inquired for, when Dr. Twort asked for it—I went up into the boy's bedroom after that with Dr. Twort—the boy was not dead—I had been upstairs before I saw the pill-box—the doctor came upstairs with me after he had looked at the pill-box—I did not remain in the house all night—I stayed in the house till after the boy was dead; then I went home with my horse and trap, and came back and stayed at the lodge until the morning, between 6 and 7—during the night I had a conversation with the prisoner about the death of Mrs. Bowles—the prisoner said it was about the worst trouble he had had; he had had a great deal of trouble, but this was the worst trouble he had ever had—I cannot remember any more—he said "My poor son," that was just as the son was dying, "My poor son; I should not have been surprised at my wife dying because she was troubled with the heart disease; but my poor son, it is a great shock to me"—that was while his son was dying, in his son's room—the prisoner came up as the son was dying, and lay down beside him and kissed him—I was there from the time I went up—I never knew he was his son—he said "I should not have been surprised at my wife dying, as she was troubled with heart disease, as the, doctor told me at any moment she might die"—he kissed the dying boy.</p>

I am a coachman at Camberley—I live within 120 yards of Crosby Hill Lodge—I have known the prisoner and the deceased Hannah Bowles since last spring, and the boy Edward Bowles I only knew a short time—I used to go into the grounds sometimes with Mr. Bowles and see him there—Mrs. Bowles was a very nice kind of person—I never saw any signs of drinking about her—I have never been there at meals—on Friday morning, 23rd September, I heard of her death—I went to the lodge—I was going in search of Bowles at the big house, Crosby Hill, when I met him; that was near about 7 o'clock in the morning—he was coming to the lodge—I spoke to him—I asked him what happened, and asked how Mrs. Bowles was, as I had already heard she was ill, as the servants told me in the morning—he said they were both dead, and he took me into the house and showed me the wife and not the son—when he said they were dead I said "Why did not you come and fetch me?"—he said he asked his wife if he should fetch me, and she said "No, I shall be better directly"—on the following day, the 24th, he took me to the mushroom beds, where the mushrooms were supposed to come from—I was up at the house, and we were looking round the grounds, and he pointed out the bed and said "I suppose this</p>

               <p>is where they got the mushrooms from," showing me the ground that had been disturbed—he had told me he thought they had died through eating mushrooms—I asked him how they came to meet with their death, and he said he supposed they caught their death through eating mushrooms—that was on the Saturday—he said nothing else on that day, not of any consequence—he said nothing else on any occasion with regard to what might have caused their death; he passed a remark once before that he thought his wife would at any time drop down, as she suffered from heart disease; he said that some weeks previous, in her lifetime—he said nothing after the deaths about anything these persons had taken, no more than they had had jam and mushrooms; he supposed they had had mushrooms, he was sure they had had jam—he said nothing else about what they had had—he told me privately the boy Ted was his son—I heard nothing about pills at any time—I had no conversation to my knowledge about the deceased persons that I have not told you; I may have done, but it is not quite clear to my memory—I asked him that day if I could lend him any assistance, and he said yes, I could, and I said what, and he said "You might send your wife over to keep Mrs. Deverel company"—I was on very friendly terms with him—I had a conversation with him upon the question of insurance—I said it was as well if he had not insured their lives; he said he never had anything to do with those kind of people, and it was just then the police came in the avenue—that was the day after the burial; Sergeant Heighes then appeared in the drive—I said it was just as well he had not insured them; the reason for the remark was the expense of the funeral; they told me Dr. Muller was going to meet the expenses—I had no more conversation with him after the death about these circumstances at all, the only matter I asked him was different questions about gardening, nothing else in particular.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Brown, a painter, and have lived in Caledonian Road, London, for 17 years—the deceased woman, Hannah Bowles, was my only sister—she had first married Thomas Pygle, and after his death she was married to the prisoner, as I thought—they had lived together as man and wife since 1882, I believe—when I first knew him they were living, in 1882, at Lognor Wood, in Staffordshire—from there they went to Henton, in Gloucestershire, and then they were at another place until they came to Crosby Hill—the child was three years old last Christmas; December, 1884, it was born—they left Henton and sent their luggage to my place, where I am now, and they were lodging at Gloucester Place, and then they got a situation at Major Burnaby's, at Halstead, in Kent, where two babies were born, two girls; one died, and the other is now living with me—I had it about two months after it was born; its name is Hannah Bowles, the same as its mother—then they went to Colonel Steel, Wanstead Fiats, I think, and from there, I believe, they went to a situation in Blackheath, I don't know the gentleman's name, and to Surbiton, and ultimately they came to Crosby Hill—during the time they have been at Crosby Hill I have seen my sister twice; once she came to me, I believe, last March, and I went to see her last Whitsuntide, taking her little baby with me—when I saw her at Whitsuntide she was in good health, as well as I ever saw her for some time, and she appeared in very good spirits; she was a sober and a most abstemious woman—I never heard until after her death any suggestion of her being in the habit of drinking, and she never did—I had not heard anything before her death of her state of health—she had been told her heart was affected, but I never believed it—she had been told it by her husband, the prisoner, not by any one else—I had no reason to call him anything but her husband; unfortunately he was not—she enjoyed good health; she worked hard all her life, so she was bound to have good health—I did not see the boy Edward at the lodge when I saw her at Whitsuntide—the first time I saw him was Jubilee Day—my sister wrote up, would my youngest boy take him round to see the Jubilee, so my boy went round with him and my husband in the evening—we entertained him all night, and my husband took him home in the evening—that was the first time I saw him and the last, until I saw him lying dead at Crosby Hill—on the Monday before my sister died in the same week I had a letter from her which I gave up to the inspector; it was produced before the Magistrate—I saw the prisoner after the death on Wednesday, 5th October, when he came to see me in London—I did not ask him any questions—he was talking about his child, and he said he would buy his son out of the army—there was no conversation with regard to my sister's death—he said he was looking up the bills, as poor Hannah was so careless in laying them about—he should not like to have</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The deposition of Thomas Wager was here read as follows:</hi>—I am a farmer, and reside at Glutton Grange, near Buxton, in the county of Derby. I knew the prisoner, Henry Bowles, in 1882, when he applied to me to come into my service as gamekeeper and general servant; I engaged him, and he came to me in March of that year. He remained in my service till 17th June in the same year; he left me to go to Buxton to see his wife; he did not return when I considered he should have done so. I paid him his wages and he left my service. He told me his wife wished to go away from Buxton; I did not know his wife I never saw her; he always spoke affectionately of her, and while the prisoner was in my service he gave entire satisfaction; the prisoner lived under the same roof with me, and did anything I set him to do, as well as looking after game. It has always been my practice to supply my keepers with strychnine for killing vermin. I am not able to say if I supplied the prisoner with any strychnine. I produce a bill for amongst other things strychnine supplied to me in March, 1882. I did not always buy the strychnine myself; I sometimes obtained it through my doctor. I probably supplied Bowles with strychnine, but, as I said, I am not able to swear that I did. I cannot say the prisoner ever asked me for strychnine. I am not able to swear the prisoner used strychnine while in my service. Poison was used for killing rats, at least the rats disappeared.

He also gave her a small box of pills, which my wife showed to me, but I begged of her to throw them in the fire, and I warned her against using any poison in our place, as I had been to a good deal of expense of buying eggs of choice fowls called the Derbyshire Redcaps, and also I had a valuable mastiff dog that I took out of a night, the property of Sir John Harper Crewe, when I suspected poachers about, and which I would not have had anything happen to it for a large sum, as the dog was not my own. In the winter time, I think it was February, one evening Mr. Charlesworth asked my wife to tell me to go down in the morning to the farm, as he wanted me to shoot a cat which was a nuisance to them by getting into the dairy. I went down about 10.30 in the forenoon, and Mr. Charlesworth told me he was not very well; he was upstairs. I told her I would call next morning, and I returned home, and about two hours afterwards heard he was lying dead, and which quite upset me. I went in and told my wife; she made this remark, that she was sure he had poisoned himself, as he was always full of drink, and his wife led him a terrible life, and Mrs. Charlesworth showing my wife her legs which were bruised by him. He was buried three or four days afterwards, and there had been no doctor, no inquiry</p>

               <p>whatever. He was put out of the way as quietly as you would bury a dog; that is what I witnessed of the affair.

E., and where my wife undertook to do the laundry work, and during that time frequently used poisons, and on one occasion when I went to post some letters in Leytonstone, which may be half a mile, my wife asked me to get a bottle of cough mixture and some bottles of vermin killer, as the mice would not eat what she had put down for the mice. I did so; but I do not remember whether it was one or two; my name was entered in a book. My wife not being able to get through with the work, we left there in August of the same year. In November of the same year we were living in the service of Mr. John Cross, agent to Lord Wantage, of Lockinge Park, in Berkshire, near Wantage. One Saturday night my oldest son, Harry, who had been in trouble and had cost me a good deal of money and trouble, came to our house after dark, not knowing where else to go, as I was the only friend he had. My wife put herself in such a rage, and declared if he did not go from there she would poison him. Fearing my wife, in her temper, might do something to my poor boy, I pleaded with him, and advised him to go and enlist for a soldier, and I promised if he would do so, and keep from the drink and retrieve his character, that I would buy him off in three or four years' time, and he took my advice and did so, and left on Monday morning. I went part of the way to Didcot Station, and gave him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in his pocket to pay his fare to Reading, where he enlisted in the Royal Berkshire Regiment, and are now lying at Templemore, in Ireland, since February, 1886, when we left Mr. Cross. I have never heard mention any poison, and she has been on better terms with me. She have always had all my wages to lay out ever since she first lived with me, and also always paid the men. I never interfered in the least about house affairs, nor were there any place locked but she had the keys; nor had I the slightest knowledge of any poisons being in the house.</p>

                  </hi> "Henry Bowles and wife and furniture removed from Lognor Wood, where I had filled the situation as gamekeeper to Sir John Harper Crewe, in April, 1882; lived at Buxton till about the first Monday in June of that year. Mr. Wager engaged me at that time to go to his house, which is about five miles from Buxton, to do his garden and to watch some hill ground where there were rabbits, and remained five weeks in his service, for which he paid me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. After receiving only 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I went and got my coat, and walked to Lognor, which was market day, and where Mr. Wager was gone.</p>
               <p>"I, Henry Bowles, declining to do any more for him at such pay. During the time I was in Mr. Wager's employ I had never seen any poison of any description, nor was ever asked to use any. Remained at Buxton till 11th July, 1882, when I, Henry Bowles, and my wife, went to Berkley, in Gloucestershire, and took charge of house and gardens</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188801090162"/>
               <p>belonging to John Swayne Pearce, Esq., of 13, Craven Hill, Bayswater London, and where I lived till 14th August, 1884.</p>
               <p>"Moses Wheeldon, of Lognor, farmer and watcher for Mr. Wager, of Glutton, during the time I was living at Lognor Wood had frequently brought me beaks of magpies and crows, for which I was paid for by Mr. William Turner, the head keeper for Sir John Harper Crewe, as part of my wages, and I gave Moses Wheeldon a couple of rabbits in return on one occasion. I asked Moses Wheeldon how he got hold of the crows, as I knowed they were difficult to trap, and he told me Mr. Wager supplied him with strychnine to poison them with. I never received any poison from Wheeldon, or any other man. He had at different times come to my house, and in my absence, but don't know if he gave my wife any.</p>
               <p>"Moses Wheeldon's farm was on my beat on one side of the River Dove, and Mr. Wager's ground on the other side opposite, and Wheeldon looked after both sides, which he had done years before I went there, for which I used to give him rabbits by order of Mr. Turner, the head keeper, and all the vermin he could poison he would bring to me, and I gave him rabbits in return, as I was paid for vermin as part of my wages.</p>
               <p>"About March 13th or 14th, and a day or two before I left Lognor Wood, I saw Mr. Bradley, bank manager of Buxton, who asked me if I would accept the post as river watcher on the River Dove, as he and the farmers were going to form an association for the preservation of the trout and other fish in Dove, as I had broken up a notorious gang of poachers, having at one time three of the same poachers in Stafford Gaol at one time, and eight days after the ringleader came out I took him between 5 and 6 o'clock on Sunday morning, and stealing both rabbits and traps, he got two months, and that dispersed them, and that is why Mr. Wager also was anxious to engage me, but I never asked him for employment as he stated at the inquest. I never spoke to Mr. Wager in my life till the Saturday night in the week the Derby is run for at Epsom, when I was asked into the Cheshire Cheese Inn, Buxton, when Mr. Smedley, who drives a '<hi rend="italic">bus</hi> from Lognor to Buxton, past Mr. Wager's, told me that Wager was at the Eagle Hotel and particularly wanted to see me. I went, and he asked me if I would come, as the poachers were taking all his rabbits. I promised I would be there on Monday morning following. I went to Wager's, and remained there, doing anything, for a month, thinking in the meanwhile they would settle about the river, but it came to nothing. On Tuesday, Lognor market day, I asked Wager to pay me. He gave me a sovereign, and went to market. I afterwards put the pony in the trap for Mr. Wager to go, and then I got my coat and went to market too, as I had had no engagement with Wager. I did not intend to stop with him, and we never had a word more.</p>
               <p>"During the time I, Henry Bowles, and my wife lived at Buxton my wife went to the Shakespeare Hotel cooking, and where she drank heavily and coming home at night at 11 o'clock and later the worse for drink, and I threatened her that if she continued getting in that state I would sell the furniture and separate from her, when she would swear she would poison me first. That made me accept Mr. Wager's offer to go and do his garden and watch his ground, hearing that Moses Wheeldon had left him, and also I thought if I could only earn half a loaf it would occupy my time and also my mind while at Mr. Wager's. My wife came there in such a mad state of mind and accused me of corresponding with some</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188801090163"/>
               <p>other woman, and declared she would poison me and go and murder this said woman, who it was I never knew. It so upset me that I left off work and walked a little way back with her, and pleaded with her not to say such rash things, and pledge my word I would not part from her if she would let the drink alone. A short time after that I got the situation in Gloucestershire. After being there a short time she lead me a dreadful time of it, what with her temper and the drink. I declared I would leave her, for which she threatened to poison me on several occasions for bringing her to such a dirty hole, and there she poisoned a favourite old dog of my master's, which I thought at the time was done at the hotel by Sharpness Station, which is just below the grounds, and where the dog frequently went, and I reported the same to my master in London, but after that my wife was taken ill, and the doctor treated her for heart disease. We left, and while in London we were speaking of the place we had left, and then she told me that she had laid some bread and butter in the larder sprinkled with poison to kill the mice and forgot to pick it up in the morning. The dog went in and eat it, and in a few minutes after the dog was what I thought first in a fit, but died at once, and I buried it, and reported the same to J. Swayne Pearce, Esq., my master at the time."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner made the following statement before the Magistrate:</hi> "On 22nd September I lived with my wife and son at the lodge at Crosby Hill. Dr. Muller came from London that day, and was with me about the grounds planning out work for the future, and he left there about a quarter past 4. He left by a pad gate at the lower end of the grounds, a most unusual thing, he had never done so before. I let him out. I went back about my work to the greenhouse till I saw that it was leaving-off time for the men. I went to the kitchen garden to see what had been done, and pulled a handful of radishes for tea. I went down to the lodge where I lived, and bid the witness Bracknell 'Good night. 'My wife took the radishes, and washed them for tea. When I got in my wife asked me where Dr. Muller was, as she said she had not seen him pass out of the lodge entrance. She then asked me if Dr. Muller had paid me any money which was owing to her from Mrs. Muller for washing three dozen blankets in the spring. I said 'No'. She then used an epithet and a wicked word, and swore by oath that she would never do another hour's work there again. I told her I had no wish for her to work, it was all her own voluntary act, and I assured her that Mrs. Muller would pay her when she came down. I also told her that she ought not to be pressed for a little money, for that she had 33<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week to keep house, with no rent, coals, or vegetables to buy. With that she flew in a passion, and declared my boy did not pay enough (he was paying so much a week), and he should leave; and I told the boy to ask Bracknell to get lodgings at camberley next day. She flaw in such a rage, and swore she would not stop there. I told her she could pay her way as well as any one if she left the brandy alone. She swore at my boy then for telling me he fetched it. This was during tea-time, and I got up and walked out. My son followed me. I was always in the habit of working till dark, and my son went to set some traps for rabbits, and he came to me by the greenhouses. I locked up all the buildings, and returned to the lodge. I pulled off my boots, and got my writing-desk, and was busy examining some lists that Dr. Muller</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188801090164"/>
               <p>had given me that day. My boy sat down by the table, and was looking at some of my papers for some time. My wife did not speak to me. She was of most violent temper, and have remained like that sometimes for two days. My boy, to amuse her, got the cards out, as she would tell his fortune sometimes; but she threw the cards down on that occasion and would not make herself agreeable. About half past 9 she asked my son if he wanted any supper; they were both in the habit of eating suppers, but did not ask me, as I never eat suppers. I have not eaten suppers for 10 years, as a rule. After supper my wife got a box of pills from somewhere—I don't know where she had them—and told my son that he ought to take a pill, as he had pimples breaking out on his face. My boy laughed, and asked for more jam, as they did not taste very well. After that my boy went to bed. My wife remained downstairs, but they have been in the habit of going to bed both at one and the same time. I sat there busy at my papers and smoking my pipe. I remember once filling my pipe and looking at her. It was an unusual thing for her to sit down, after supper she would always go to bed. She looked very pale, and I thought it was her temper. As near as I can tell, it was about half an hour from the time they had taken the pills she fell from the chair on to my legs. I thought it was a fainting fit. I got some water and sprinkled her face and moistened her lips, and in a few minutes she spoke to me, and asked me to bathe her temples with vinegar, for her head was in great pain. While bathing her head my son called and said 'Father, bring me a little water. 'I took up to him a jug of tea and milk, such as I was drinking myself. I said 'What makes you thirsty?' and I told him his poor mother had just fainted downstairs. I got hold of his head and raised him from the pillow, and I held the jug while he drank from it. I asked him if he had any pain. He told me he had pain betwixt the shoulders, and had a tightness at the chest. I asked him if he thought it was the pills he had taken. He said he thought it was. I persuaded him not to take more pills, but to get some salts from Camberley when he went again. He laid back on the pillow, and said he thought he should soon be better. I went down to my wife, when I asked her if I should lift her into my armchair, she said 'No, but get me a pillow from upstairs to lay my head on. 'She kept on asking me to bathe her temples, which she said were in great pain, and finding she did not recover I asked her if there was any brandy in the pantry, where there should have been some by rights. I could not find any. I took a small jug and ran as hard as I could to our neighbour, Mrs. Sharp, but I could not make anyone hear. I then returned and asked my wife if I should go for a doctor; she said 'No, I shall be all right presently. 'I kept on bathing her temples, and finding she got no better I ran to Camberley as hard as I could for the doctor, and also called up a woman, Mrs. Deverel, who she had always expressed a wish should come to her if anything happened to her; I also called Mr. Evans, cab proprietor, to fetch this woman, and bring her up in a cab, as I was compelled to get home as soon as I could after calling the doctor, as my wife and son were alone. Going up the road the doctor overtook me on his tricycle, and we went to the house and found my wife lying in the same position that I left her, and appearing to be nearly dead. I spoke to her, but could get no answer. My son was shouting upstairs for water. I took some water up and gave him to drink. He was completely</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188801090165"/>
               <p>smothered with a black vomit or dark vomit; bedclothes and walls were equally smothered, and it looked very much like ketchup or porter. I asked him if he had been eating mushrooms, and he said no, he had been eating jam, and I remained with him, as he was so strong, fighting and tearing about, poor fellow, and Mrs. Deverel remained with my wife. I frequently gave him water with a little drop of whisky in it, which the doctor sent me to Mr. Sullivan's for, and which I brought because I could not get brandy. Dr. Twort and Mr. Evans were in the room at the time. Dr. Twort shortly left to fetch something for him, but he struggled and died before the doctor came back. My wife never vomited anything, nor scarcely moved until she fell down. The doctor went away, and myself, Evans, and the woman remained in the house. It was she (Mrs. Deverel) that cleared the room up, and I remained at the house until the doctor came in the next day. They took the keys of the lodge, and after that I remained up at the big house up at Crosby Hill, where the inquest was held on Saturday."</p>

I am stationed at Croydon—on 14th December, at a quarter to 8 p.m., I was off duty in plain clothes at Broad Green, Croydon—I went into the Rising Sun public-house, and was drinking a glass of ale—the prisoner was there then—no one else was in the bar besides we two—the prisoner came to me and said "You have not found the property that was stolen from the church yet"—I said "No, I have not; I should like to know the person who stole it"—the prisoner said "I believe I can tell you where the property is, and also tell you the party who stole it"—I had seen the prisoner once before—after some further talk I said "I should like you to show me that property, and also the persons who stole it"—he took me to the Queen's Arms Hotel, about a quarter of an hour's walk, after some further talk—he pointed out there two men over the bar—he said "You see those two men over the bar"—I said "Yes"—he said "Those are the two men that stole the property"—they were standing opposite to me in another compartment, drinking some ale—I told him that I didn't like to interfere with the two men until I had seen the property—after that he took me to 22, Grace Road, a few yards off—he unlocked the door with the key which he had—he said he had charge of the house; it was an empty house; unfurnished—we went in—I went into two rooms on the ground floor, and he took me upstairs—then he took me downstairs, and in the coal-cellar under the stairs—there were two sack bags full of something there—I took them into the room and examined some of the property, and found they corresponded with the property stolen from St. Saviour's Church—this is the property (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I pulled some of the things out—he said "I saw two men bringing two sacks full of something on the night the church was broken into; they took them in the window at the rear of the house where I then was"—I told him to remain there a few minutes—I went and called to my brother constable on the beat, and told him to go to the station for my inspector, Mr. Harris—while waiting there the prisoner said "Yes, I knew the property was there three or four days before"—I said "Why had you not taken me and shown me the property at once, when we were in the house"—he made no reply—then my inspector came.</p>

               <p>them?"—he said he could, he had known them all their lifetime—I said "Why don't you tell me all you know about the case?"—he then said "About three o'clock on the Friday morning "(that would be the morning of the 9th) "Iand my wife were sitting up in the kitchen, we had not gone to bed; I was writing at the time, when I heard these two men coming around; they came round the corner to No. 22; I said to my wife' There is something up;' my old woman said 'Go to bed, and I will go and see what is the matter;' I went to the kitchen window, and saw the two men come round to the back of the house carrying a sack each, and put them in the window; I waited awhile, I heard them strike a match, I heard them strike three or four catches; I remained, thinking they were going to stop there for the night; I remained quiet, and afterwards went to bed; I got up in the morning, went round to No. 22, unlocked the door, and in the room I found the two bags full of the things taken from the church"—I said "Could you swear to the men?"—he said "Certainly I could"—I said "Why did not you inform the police at the time?"—he said "No, me and my old woman have been setting watch ever since; if I told any one it would have been split, and the birds would have flown"—I told him he had better go home—he lives at 20, Grace Road, two doors from the unoccupied house, of which he was the care-taker—I directed a constable to go with him to make some inquiries—I saw the wife and made inquiries—she gave me this, some writing in a book, some poetry, and different things—she gave me an almanack—there was some writing found in the church—the writing which the prisoner's wife gave me is similar to that found in the church vestry—I went back to 22, Grace Road, where I saw the prisoner—I said "Be very careful; I want you to tell me a little more about this"—I cautioned him and said "About what time was it that you saw the men bring the sacks into the house?"—he said "It was about three o'clock"—I said "Did you tell any one when you found the sacks containing the property the following morning, or show it to any one?"—he said no, only to his wife—I said "Did you show them to her; did you bring her in?"—he said "Yes, she did"—I told him he had better be careful, as I was suspicious of him; I did not believe his story, and that very likely I should have to take him into custody—then he told me his wife was the only person that had seen the things—when Mrs. Wells came in I showed her the things, and she told me in the prisoner's presence she had never seen them before—I asked her if the prisoner had told her anything about finding them there—she said "No"—I said "Then if your husband has told me he has brought you in here and showed you these things he is telling a lie"—she said "I never saw them before; he has never brought me in here"—he said he had—I told him I should take him into custody, and charge him with breaking into the church and stealing the things—he at first said it was wrong; he made sport of it—he said it was wrong and laughed—he said "I am willing to go with you; let me have my boots"—afterwards he said "I may as well make a clean breast of it; I did take the things, and you are right this time"—he told his wife to give me the clock—I went to the house with the wife, and in a wet linen basket, between the wet linen she showed me this clock—I took the prisoner to the station—the clock was one of the things stolen from the church—on the way to the station he said "You have made a good job this time; you are quite</p>
