               <p>Q. Did you cry out murder in the house?</p>
               <p>Barber. Yes; and he kicked me into the street, and I was told he said, I should pay handsomly for it, and I lay sprawling in the street, but no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174501160003"/> body knew me there, nor nobody came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Was you ever in the house before?</p>

               <p>Barber. Because nobody knew me: I went home afterwards, and then I did go there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say you would not have prosecuted this Man, if he would have come down to you?</p>
               <p>Barber. I never said so. If there are twenty false Witnesses against me, I can't help it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go after you were out of the House?</p>

When I asked her for it, she said, d - n you, what business have I to pay the reckoning? and said she would not pay me. I said, madam, you use me very ill, you used me so before, but you shall not use me so now for I will be paid for the wines; she said she had no money, then she pulled of her pillareen, and said, d - n you take that, I'll a robbery against you, and have your life for it. Another time a gentleman came with her into the house and paid a shilling for a pint of wine, she took the shilling up and went about her business, and I lost that.</p>

            . I lie in Mr. Gore's greenhouse. I heard a noise in the night; I got up, and saw the prisoner going out of the window through a pane of glass. I took hold of her by the heels, and pulled her in again, and found these branches under her. The pane was taken quite out. It was 20 inches by 14, which is big enough for almost any person to go through - The greenhouse may be about 40 yards from the dwelling house. The prisoner had a knife about her, with which I believe she cut these things. The gardener said it had the gum of the trees upon it. <rs id="t17450116-3-verdict16" type="verdictDescription">

Then a man came either behind me or on one side of me, and laid hold of my collar; as soon as I found that, I struck at him, then another man came up and they pulled me down backward upon a step, held me by the throat, and asked me what business I had to call the woman bitch. Then the prisoner unbuttoned my breeches, and turned every pocket the wrong side out, and took a guinea out of my right fob. But there was one six-pence left, which happened to stick in the corner of one of my pockets. As she was unbuttoning my breeches, I took hold of her by the coat with my right hand.</p>

When I got up, I took her by the hand and she called for assistance. Then one of the men came and struck at me. I struck at him, and brought him down - I had hold of the prisoner all the time.

I was constable of the night, about one o'clock in the morning the Prosecutor brought the Prisoner into St. Martin's watch-house, and told me as he has said now, that she had robbed him by the assistance of two men of a guinea; that he had never let her go from him, and was sure she must have it about her. I searched her, took 2 s. and some half pence out of her pocket; I said to Ind search her behind and before (I ask pardon, my Lord) he has got a pretty good hand at searching; he searched her, and took the guinea out of her mouth; I was the more ready to have her searched, because the man was very positive and very sober. I took her aside, and desired her to give an account of her two accomplices, by which the might probably save her own life; instead of giving any direct answer to that, I think, to the best of my knowledge, she said, whether I had any assistance or not, I will make no confession: then she pulled me back, whispered me in the ear, (I thought she had changed her mind, and would have discovered her accomplices) and said, Mr. Constable, I know it is in your power to leave the watch-house door open, and let me go out, if you will, you shall have a - whenever you please.</p>

I was going home into Covent Garden, and just by the Bagnio at Charing Cross I heard an outcry, I thought there had been some quarrel; I saw Humphreys with the Prisoner in his right hand; he told me he was robbed by the Prisoner and two men, and desired me to go with him to the watch-house; when I came there, Mr. Dunn thought I was a proper person, and desired me to search her. I pulled off her stockings, searched all her clothes, and found 2 s. 4 d. and a bag of tobacco; then I searched her arm pits, and every where that I could, but could not find the guinea; then I said, D - n you open your mouth; she opened it, and turned out her tongue double; I put my finger into her mouth, and brought the guinea out: she said something afterwards in a vulgar manner, but I could not tell what it was.</p>

            . The night twelfth night was kept on, as I was going along about seven o'clock, I felt something rustle in my pocket, I put my hand into my pocket to feel for my handkerchief, and it was gone. I collared the Prisoner, and said, where is my handkerchief? he said, there it is, and threw it out of his hand. There were several people came up, and threatened to take him away from me, but some butchers coming they ran away. I took him to a publick house, searched him, and found seven handkerchiefs in his pocket; he had a very good one about his neck that night, the next morning it was gone. I asked him what he had done with his handkerchief? he said, he had sold it for bread in the prison. I asked, whether he had any money; he said, no; I gave him a shilling, he gave me a sort of a gruff for it, he did not thank me. The handkerchief cost me 4 s. 6 d. but I laid it at 10 d. on account of his youth. <rs id="t17450116-13-verdict67" type="verdictDescription">

Mrs. Abbott asked her if she did not take such a petticoat, she said she did not know any thing of it, and run away. I stopped her, and she said we could not detain her without a constable.</p>

            , that if I did not go home immediately I should have my house stripped; for the prisoner was in company with my wife, and was assisting her in carrying off large bundles of goods. Upon that I went home and missed a gold striking watch, a Pinchbeck metal watch, &amp;c. I lost more money than is mentioned in the indictment, but there was no more found.</p>

               <p>Margerum. Upon my wife, I staid in the house with a friend, and heard about two hours after that they were gone to the B Boar in White Chapel. I went in search of them, but could not find them. The next night about 6 or 7 o'clock as I was sitting in my own house, the prisoner came in; as soon as I saw him enter the door, I got up and took hold of him, and by the assistance of some friends, secured him. We took from him a hanger which was concealed under his coat : I got a constable and carried him before Sir

Sir Thomas asked him how he came by the pocket book, he said, it was given to him by my wife. I heard she was below, and Sir Thomas ordered her to be brought up stairs and searched.

               <p>Margerum. To be sure she used to wear them sometimes, and I used to wear them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you give your wife these things as ornaments to her person?</p>
               <p>Margerum. I bought the gold watch with a design to wear it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What! you wear a gold watch, and your wife a metal one?</p>
               <p>Margerum. Yes - I never made her a present of these things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not she keep all the keys?</p>
               <p>Margerum. She kept the keys of the room, and the bureau, and I kept the key of the chest where these things were.</p>

               <p>Jury. Was the chest broke open?</p>
               <p>Margerum. The staple was drawn. I did not design to mention it if I could have helped it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not she wear the rings and watch and snuff-box that Sunday on which you charge the robbery to be committed?</p>
               <p>Margerum. The thing was done in the morning. It might be so, I can't tell, for I was out all the day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Does not the house go in the name of Fifield, for fear of your being indicted for keeping a bawdy house?</p>
               <p>Margerum. The house does go in the name of Fifield, because I have two houses.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Have not you a house behind St. Clement's, that goes by the name of Margerum?</p>

            . I was a servant to Mr. Margerum, but had left his service about a fortnight before this happened. I was there on twelfth day about 5 or 6 at night: Mrs Margerum was above, I met the prisoner upon the second stair as he was going up the second pair of stairs; he asked for Mrs. Margerum and went into the room where she was, and where Mr. Margerum and she lay, and shut the door. In about a quarter of an hour they came down. Mrs. Margerum had a bundle in her hand, and they both went out together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she or he carry the bundle out?</p>
               <p>Seymour. He helped her out with it. There was a linen gown and several other things in a large apron. The prisoner gave me a shove, and I was afraid he was going to cut me.</p>
               <p>Q. Why was you afraid he should cut you?</p>
               <p>Seymour. Because he often carried hangers with him. He had one in his coat then.</p>

            . On Sunday was sev'night hearing a noise in the room up two pair of stairs, I went up, and Mrs. Margerum and the prisoner were there. He went down stairs and she followed him with a bundle in her apron. She was going to take away some more things; and the last witness interposed and went to hinder her from going out. The prisoner pushed her away and began to d - n his eyes, and swear in a violent manner. I was afraid to interpose, because he always wore a hanger under his arm. Then the prisoner laid hold of the bundle she had, and carried it cross the Strand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was her apron tied on?</p>
               <p>Jones. I can't tell whether it was tied on or no.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he carry the bundle?</p>
               <p>Jones. He put his hand under the bundle and carried it out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take the bundle from her and carry it out?</p>
               <p>Jones. He was so eager that he laid hold of the bundle - he did not take it from her, he took hold of it and carried it out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the woman quit the bundle or no?</p>
               <p>Jones. I can't say whether she loosed it or no.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner or the woman carry the bundle out of the house?</p>
               <p>Jones. They both helped; he laid hold of it, and said, Come along; and they both went out together.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he carry his hanger?</p>
               <p>Jones. Under his arm (I can't say which arm) with a belt over his breast under his coat. As we were carrying him along in the coach, he threatened to push me through with a penknife. I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174501160010"/> this pocket book and hook taken out of his pocket, I know it to be Mr. Margerum's. I have seen him have it - there was a gold repeating watch, &amp;c. found upon Mrs. Margerum.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say how he came by the pocket book and hook ?</p>
               <p>Jones. He owned they were Mr. Margerum's, and that he had them from his wife.</p>
               <p>Jury. Are you a servant to Margerum?</p>
               <p>Jones. I am a porter to an apothecary. I rent a lodging of him.</p>

               <p>Jones. It was tied about her middle when she came down stair. But when she went out it was untied; I did not see her untie it, but she put some more things into it.</p>
               <p>Q. After she came down stairs did she untie the bundle and put things into it?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What things did she put into it?</p>
               <p>Jones. A gown and some other linen.</p>
               <p>Q. The gown was in the bundle before, was there any other put in?</p>
               <p>Jones. There was another put in below stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tie the apron on afterwards ?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, it was untied when she went out of the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I stand by the fire side when she came down stairs ?</p>

Mrs. Margerum told me one day she was going to see a play; what play, says I? a play that is nothing but love. Now I will tell you what Mr. Margerum said: on Monday morning I was in bed, he came and knocked me out of bed: (the Prisoner and I had some words because he did not come home:) says he, I am going to my wife and the Prisoner; says I, what do you design to do with them, hang them both? Said he, I have had Sims before a Justice, and he has got irons on; and said I, what have you done with your wife; well, said he, I begged her off: this is true, and what I will say before God and all the Judges.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the Prisoner's behaviour while he lived with you?</p>
               <p>Moore. He behaved modest and well, and never did any thing amiss.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other way of living?</p>
               <p>Moore. No; but I have a husband who has a gift of two voices, a gift which God Almighty has given him; and he goes to gentlemens houses and other places to divert gentlemen and ladies.</p>

            . I am servant to that Lady [Mrs. Moore] I have known the Prisoner two years and two Months, I never knew him behave any otherwise than civilly. He is a breeches maker; he worked for my master's brother - two years and two months - he worked all the while with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What dress did he go in, did he use to wear a laced hat?</p>
               <p>Terry. Not till within these two months.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to wear a laced hat?</p>
               <p>Terry. He is a soldier.</p>
               <p>Moore. I forgot that; he is a soldier, my Lord, and it behoves a soldier to wear a hanger - he has been a soldier about six weeks; his Sergeant's name is Temples; he belongs to Colonel Stuart's regiment.</p>

               <p>Q. Does she keep any women in her house?</p>
               <p>Moore. I do not keep any women in my house; I do not love women, I can hardly bear a maid servant to wait upon me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you go to visit Mrs. Margerum?</p>
               <p>Moore. She came once to my house, and called for half a pint of wine, but by what I can find since, she came to court the Prisoner.</p>

I have seen her abroad with other men, besides the man that goes for her husband.</p>

               <p>Mr. Rondeau. I knew Mrs. Moore twenty years ago, she used to go by the name of Chamberlain. She walked in Spring Gardens at Vaux Hall, and picked up men there.</p>
               <p>Moore. Pray did you pick me up, or did I pick you up?</p>
               <p>Rondeau. She asked almost every one to give her a glass of wine.</p>
               <p>Moore. You know VauxHall is a very pleasant place; I know you very well, for I remember you picked me up there once.</p>
               <p>Rondeau. Every man that goes by her door now, she asks them, whether they will walk in. I have business that way sometimes, she has asked me many a time.</p>

               <p>Then the rings and seals were produced, but there was only one of the five gold rings set with diamonds, and one of the four gold rings set with a saphire and diamonds found.

               <p>Q. Was your shop broke open at any time?</p>
               <p>Taylor. My shop was shut up the 21st of July at night, and the next morning being Sunday, about seven o'clock my apprentice came to me while I was in bed, and said he must speak to me; he told me my shop was broke open; I was very much surprized, but after I had composed myself a little, I went there, and found that the staple was wrenched out, and the padlock unlocked, and then I missed these goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the Prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I know him very well; I have seen him at Bristol a great many times, and I can say, that on the Friday morning before my shop was broke open, the Prisoner came up to my glasses, and locked at them - I think, (but I cannot be positive ) I saw him in the Long Room that Saturday - I saw him again the Wednesday after in the Long Room; that was the last time.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mrs. Taylor, these rings and the watch in particular were in her shop the 21st of July at night; I locked it up myself, our maid called me the next morning between six and seven, and told me the shop was broke open. I went and found one of the doors about a quarter open, and some rings and other goods loose upon the counter, and upon making an examination, I missed these things - to the best of my remembrance, the night that this happened when I was shutting up the shop I saw the prisoner at the roley poley table.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mercy. I live at Bristol, the Prisoner lodged with me about six months. I live about a musquet shot, or about three times the length of this room from the Hot-wells. - I do not remember the day of the month Mrs. Taylor's shop was broke open; I know it was on a Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Prisoner indebted to you?</p>
               <p>Mercy. He always was, and always very scantys of money - The Prisoner staid till the Thursday morning following, and then he said he was going to London, he came back again the Tuesday following at night: he would have paid me the 15 l. he owed me as soon as he came home, but he was in such a trembling that he did not pay me that night, but he paid me the next day. - Mr. Percival paid him 12 l. the Wednesday or Thursday before he went from Bristol, of which he paid<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174501160013"/> me 8l. when he had paid me the 15 l. he took away his clothes, and took a lodging one night or two at a little alehouse, and then left Bristol - He might easily get out of my house at any time without any body's knowing it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council to Mrs. Taylor. Did not the Prisoner say that he was sorry you was robbed?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Taylor. I believe somebody was shewing him that my shop was broke open, and I believe he said in broken English, he was sorry for my loss.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rawlins. The 28th of July the Prisoner, (who went by the name of Lambert) and Mr. Clement a shoemaker, came to me with a gold watch and two rings (it was a gold dial plate then, but it is an enamelled one now) and pledged them to me for seventeen guineas, and they remained with me two months, and then were redeemed. I think they were brought the 28th of July: he appeared very genteel.</p>

            . The Prisoner was recommended to me by Mr. Vanciliers, a merchant in the city. The first time I bought any thing of the Prisoner was about five months ago, I believe it was about a month before Michaelmas, they were some small roses unset: he came to me very genteel; he was in the same dress he is now, and I had no mistrust of him. I took this watch out of pawn about three weeks after I bought them; it was in pawn for seventeen guineas, and he desired I would make the most of it, because he was short of money.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money has he had of you in all?</p>
               <p>Bouillard. As near as I can call to mind about 45 l. I paid him 5 l. 10 s. for the unset roses; for four rings and a seal 4 l. 4 s. another time 13 l. and a fourth time 22 l. 5 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Q. How much were they worth?</p>
               <p>Bouillard. As much as one can make of them - I think I gave the full price for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you set down the times when you bought them, and the money you paid?</p>
               <p>Bouillard. As I paid ready money for them, I did not set them down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how he came by these things?</p>
               <p>Bouillard. He said he had bought goods at Bath and at Bristol, and that he had sent goods abroad several times - he said he bought these at Bristol of a man who had a box before him.</p>

When the Prisoner was first taken up, Mr. Bouillard, the Constable, and I, went to his lodgings, I told him I heard he had got some goods that were given out to be stole; I said he must give an account how he came by the goods he sold to Mr. Bouillard. I acquainted him with the robbery committed at Bristol; he said he bought them at Bristol about eight or ten days after the robbery was committed. I told him it was very imprudent to buy such things so soon after a robbery: then he said his memory was very bad, it might be three weeks or a month after. I told him I must know the truth, and how he came by them; and as I was a soreigner, and did not understand the laws of this country, I was willing to go to a person who understood the laws, and went before Sir

            . In the conversation I had with him, he said he bought these things of a shopkeeper in Bristol: I said, I am very glad of it, for then you will easily clear yourself of this affair. Said I, do you know where the man lives? then he was a little confounded, and said, he bought them of a Jew, who carried a shop before him. I asked him, whether the Jew spoke French; he said, he did not, but he made him understand that he would give him so many guineas, and that he laid out his money to get something by them. I asked him in what place he bought them; he said, he bought them at his own lodging, and since that he has told me he bought them in the street. When he came before Sir Thomas, he said he bought them of a man at Bristol, who had a little shop before him. When the watch was produced, I knew it perfectly well, because I had sold it to Mrs Taylor: he said he bought the watch three weeks after the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bouillard said he believed Mr. Demareen had given a faithful account of what passed relating to this affair.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner made his defence in the French tongue, which was interpreted to the Court and the Jury:</p>
               <p>That he went out of the Long Room that night at half an hour after ten, in company with Mr. Mercy and some other persons who he does not know, went home with Mr. Mercy to his own lodging, supped with him, Miss Bartlet, and another, and went to bed about eleven o'clock as he used to do; the next morning about seven o'clock Mr. Mercy knocked at his door for breakfast, and directly after that he went to drink the Waters at the Hot-wells, then went to hear a sermon in the town, and dined with Mr. Percivall: he does not know how they can accuse him when he knows he was in his own room. That on the 25th or 26th of that month, he received some money of Mr. Percivall, and that with what he received before was about 41 l. And as he was coming home - the Wednesday night after the robbery, he met a man,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174501160014"/> who pulled him by the arm, as if he wanted to speak with him, and shewed him his merchandize in his box which he had before him; that the man took him into a passage, he looked at them, and bid him as much as he thought they were worth; laid out about eighteen guineas, and gave him something to drink: that there was a dispute between him and Mr. Mercy, who had asked him for money, and used him ill, so he took a resolution to go to London.</p>
               <p>That he was several days in Bristol after the robbery was committed, and if he had been guilty, he would not have staid there so long. When he came to London, he went to Mr. Clement's the shoemaker to get him to help him to some money on these things; he did not care to let people know he wanted money so much as to pawn these things, and that was the reason he did not put them in his own name, for he thought to take them out again very soon. When he had raised some money, he went down to Bristol again to satisfy Mr. Mercy; and that he shewed these things publickly to Mr. Cumberford and several other people, which he would not have done if he had stole them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cumberford. The Prisoner lodged in my house about six or seven weeks, ten or eleven months ago; and about eight days after he came to my house, he had a bill of 63 l. some shillings sent him, I got it accepted, and it was paid by a 50 l. bank note, and the rest in cash. About four months ago he shewed me three or four small rings - I am a jeweller.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the occasion of his shewing you those rings, was it to borrow money on them, or to sell them?</p>
               <p>Cumberford. He shewed them me to ask the value of them - as to his character, I never heard any thing amiss of him. He always kept very good company, and paid me very well.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peccarereau. I have known Mr. Castaing about six or seven years. During the time I have known him, I always took him to be a very honest man. I knew him at Bourdeaux, he always was reputed to be an honest man. He would not keep company with those who were not so. I have had dealings with him, and he has paid me very honestly. He has some friends who are very rich. I know they have supplied him, and will supply him again - the prisoner shewed me some rings at Mr. Cumberford's.</p>
               <p>Issac Cuttercau, (a merchant at Bourdeaux ) I know his uncle has remitted him several sums of money. Whether he has done it within these six or eight months I don't know - he shewed me some rings at Mr. Cumberford's about 5 months ago.</p>

               <p>Mr. Griffan. I have known the prisoner about fifteen years, almost from a child, he was always reckoned an honest man, and every one was pleased with his behaviour. His uncle sent to me to endeavour to get some place for him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Luneau. I went to pay a visit to the attorney general of Jersey. Mr. Castaing was there; and at the attorney's recommendation, I took him into my house and he behaved very well.</p>

I left my purse once with 30 or 40 guineas in it upon a table in the room where he was, and I did not lose any thing out of it. He has been three or four hours together in my apartment. I found he was very much of a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lynch. The first acquaintance I had with him was at Bath last winter was 12 months. I was frequently in his company, and he always behaved well.</p>
               <p>Q. What opinion have you of his honestly?</p>
               <p>Lynch. A very good one; because I have heard of his family, and they are people of very great reputation at Bourdeaux. I very little expected such an action from him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Blake. I saw Mr. Castaing last season at Tunbridge Wells, and in very good company. He always behaved like a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lockman. I have known Mr. Castaing about three months. I came acquainted with him at Slaughter's Coffee house, he behaved much like a gentleman; he was respected by every body there. And if he had not been reckoned a gentleman they would not have kept him company. I should not have thought he would have been guilty of such a thing as this.</p>

I went into the next room where my husband was in bed. There is a wainscot partition between the 2 rooms, about 5 feet high, and the rest is glass, and a curtain to part of it. I looked through the glass, and saw them sitting facing one another with their knees jammed in together. I said to my husband, I believed they were sodomites. Then I looked through a thin curtain and saw them kissing one another. A little after I looked in again, and saw Manning's hand in Davis's breeches. I looked in again, and then Davis had his hand in Manning's breeches. After that Manning put his tongue into Davis's mouth: they seeing a candle in my room, got up and came to the window to look if they could see the shade of any body; then they set down again, and Davis shewed what he had to Manning; they kissed one another for some time, and then Davis opened his breeches: I had not patience any longer, and called

               <p>Q. Was Manning's back or his face to Davis?</p>

               <p>Holland. I don't know. When they found I had discovered them, Davis run into the yard with his breeches down, thinking he was going into the street, and some gentlemen stopped them both.</p>
               <p>Manning. Did you see my breeches down, or any such thing; or did I run into the yard ?</p>

            . I happened to be at Mr. Holland's and saw the prisoners in a back parlour that looks into the yard. Mrs. Holland called me into the little room, which she lies in, where Mr. Holland was then in bed, and desired me to stay. There is a partition wainscot 4 or 5 foot high, the rest is glass. She took hold of the corner of one of the curtains and desired me to look. According to her desire I did look, and saw the prisoners knees close to one another, and their faces as close together as ever mine and my wife's were - they were sitting face to face. Mr. Manning got out of his chair and looked to the glass to see if any body was looking. I went into the back yard with a design to look through the window, and presently Mrs. Holland cried out, nasty rogues, vile fellows. I met Davis at the entry door going into the yard with the lower part of his breeches unbuttoned, and his shirt out. He said, for God's sake let me go, or I am ruined to all intents and purposes. He said, it was the first crime that ever he committed of that kind before - Manning denied it to all intents and purposes, was in a great rage, and asked me whether I would accuse him of being guilty of any such thing - they were sober to my thoughts.</p>

            . I lodge at Mr. Holland's. On the 31st of December, a little after 9, I was going to bed; Mrs. Holland met me at the foot of the stairs, and said, Wright, come here. I went into the little room, the candle was out. Said she, I have heard talk of sodomites, I believe there are some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174501160016"/> here. Says I, I don't like the thoughts of them. I looked through the glass and saw them close together: says she, look now, they are bussing. At last Davis got up, he had got his shirt hanging out of his breeches: he went between Manning's legs, and here he went - Mrs. Holland had not patience any longer, but threw up the sash, and said, you d - d dogs, what are you doing of?</p>
               <p>Q. Were they face to face when you saw this?</p>
               <p>Wright. Yes; Davis was between Manning's knees; and when Mrs. Holland said, what are you doing of, they quitted one another.</p>
               <p>Q. What position was Manning in?</p>
               <p>Wright. He was sitting in his chair - Davis got up and went to Manning's chair, and got between his legs.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you think it was to assist him in this sodomitical act, or to prevent him.</p>
               <p>Wright. I believe to assist him.</p>
               <p>Q. You say Davis's face was towards Manning?</p>
               <p>Wright. They came face to face: I advised Davis to put his breeches up, but he could not in two or three times trying, he was so much frightened: he said Manning had been the ruin of him - Davis said Manning had drawn him away several times, and Manning said that Davis pulled his - out to him.</p>
               <p>Jonathan Green. The last day of the old year I saw the Prisoners at Mr. Holland's, which was the first time I ever saw them in my life; on a sudden there was a great noise; presently came in Mrs. Holland; says she, Mr. Green, here are a couple of sodomites; I said, God forbid; I got from my chair, came into the passage, and there was Davis with his shirt out of his breeches: he sled into the backside to get off, for the fore door was fastened, but the hostler brought him in again: his shirt was out still; then he came and begged of me to intercede with the landlady to let him go: said I, Friend, if you had brought a girl into the house, I would have interceded for you both to go; but as it is, let the law take its place, for I will have nothing to do with you. He entreated to be let go, and said, he was undone; I said, it was a pity the thing had fell out so, that it was a wicked thing, and I would not screen him in it - As to Manning, he looked like an old rat in an iron cage, he did not make any attempt to go away.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you take him to be like an old rat?</p>

               <p>Remmington. If they fall in my way I take them sometimes. I saw the Prisoner take this handkerchief out of Mr. Hamilton's pocket, and go to put it into his own.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mcdonald is the person who took the handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket, and now he wants to push it upon me. They are the greatest rogues and thief-takers in the world; they do it for the sake of the reward.</p>

               <p>A Juryman of London. I knew Remmington an errand boy when he first came to town, and he took naughty ways, and would not stay with his master: he is a naughty man.</p>

I had been at Mr. Crawford's in the Park at Southwark, and bought them there, and as I was going home, I fell down over some rubbish in Wild Street, and was very dirty. I went into a publick house, one Mrs. Murphy's, the corner of Colson's Court in Drury Lane, got some water, and washed myself, and the Prisoner [who was her maid] washed my apron, and I gave Mrs. Murphy three half peace to give her maid. Mrs. Murphy, another, the Prisoner, and I, had two pints of hot with a little gin. Between nine and ten o'clock I went away, and Mrs. Murphy insisted upon the Prisoner's going home with me?</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason of your going into Mrs. Murphy's?</p>
               <p>Quin. Nothing; but only I had met with a man by Fleet Ditch who had frightened me, and I was under an apprehension that he would follow me home, and rob me, because he told me I had got tea, and that he might come in and search my house.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose was Mrs. Murphy's maid to go home with you?</p>
               <p>Quin. Because Mrs. Murphy would have her. She would have gone quite home with me, but I would not let her, because I did not like her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the bundle tumble from you, or did she take it from you?</p>
               <p>Quin. She took it from me. I struggled with her to keep it, and my nose was bloody in the struggling.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go out?</p>
               <p>Quin. I went out about 11, and staid in the Borough till between 5 and 6.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you drink all that time?</p>
               <p>Quin. Only one pint of beer in the Borough. I drank no where else. When I came home I told my daughter I had been robbed. She went to Mrs. Murphys and asked if her maid was come home; she said, no. My daughter told her she had robbed me. Mrs. Murphy said, then she should be ruined, and her house indicted. The next day Mrs. Donelly delivered my daughter the gowns, the pillowbear, and the boy's shirt, which the prisoner had left with her.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say to you as you went along?</p>
               <p>Quin. She said, d - n the woman, why does not she go home - I can't tell why she d - d me, or why she wanted to go home with me, unless it was to take the things from me when I got in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she offer to do you any harm when you was down?</p>
               <p>Quin. I can't say she did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am very innocent of the matter; she was so much in liquor that she could not stand.</p>
               <p>Quin. It was no such thing. I was as sober as I am now.</p>

She had a bundle, and I saw a shirt with ruffles hanging out. She said she was married, and those were her husband's things. Said I, Where is your husband ? she said, he was just by. I asked the man if he was her husband, he said, he never saw her in his life before. I met one of her companions, who said, Fanny, you will certainly be hanged if you don't tell the watchman the truth. She was very drunk indeed.

On the 4th of December they sent him to receive a fifty pound bank note; but he did not return with the money. Upon that they thought proper to advertise him the next day, with 5 guineas reward. The same day Mr. Dunn, the landlord of the Cross Key's Inn in St. John's street, sent to acquaint them that he believed the thief was at his house. They went and took Bromley and Newman together (who went to lodge there the night before) Bromley had spent 13 s. and returned them all the rest of the money. Bromley was examined with relation to the snuff boxes, owned the taking them, and said that Newman and his wife told him if he could bring any thing to them they would help him off with it. The boxes were found the same day upon Newman in Dunn's house, and he owned he had them of Bromley. Bromley <rs id="t17450116-22-verdict130" type="verdictDescription">

            . I was told that somebody had taken these things off one of the beds. I understood that a boy had been lurking about the door some time. I went to him and told him I suspected he had taken such things; he said, he knew nothing of them. And upon searching an empty house just by, a pair of blankets were found. Then he owned he got into a leaden gutter, went into the room and took them out of the window.</p>

            . The prisoner came to me with a pair of sheets, said he was going on board a ship, and desired to leave them. He laid them down and said he would be there again in half an hour. I thought when he left them they had been trowsers, or some things for the sea, as he was in a sea dress. Mrs. Bell came in and asked for such things; my wife made a laugh at it, and said, there were no such things there. I said, a boy they call Mutton, had left a bundle, I shewed them to Mrs. Bell, and she said they were hers. <rs id="t17450116-33-verdict174" type="verdictDescription">
