                  </hi>. I carry on business in partnership with Henry Bray and George Thomas Hines, brickmakers, near Peterborough—we have offices at Nottingham—I manage the works at Nottingham—I have nothing to do with Peterborough—in August last Barrett applied by letter to be a commission agent for the sale of our bricks; we replied through our manager agreeing to pay him a commission of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per thousand—on 4th September he wrote us a letter accepting those terms—on 16th October we received this letter from him. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he had received an order from Buckle, of 72, Mark Lane and Tottenham, for 100,000 bricks, giving a reference.</hi>) It is our practice to require references or a guarantee before supplying bricks—on 6th November we received this letter from Barrett. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that the freeholder had declined to allow Buckle to sign the agreement on account of his delay, and that he had arranged with Linnett to proceed with the work and give the necessary guarantee.</hi>) In reply to that, on 7th November, we wrote saying if the guarantee was satis<lb/>factory we would pay the carriage—on the 11th we received this letter from Barrett enclosing this guarantee for Linnett from Chalcraft as the freeholder—on the 13th we wrote accepting the guarantee, and stating that instructions would be given to supply the bricks—we did supply bricks; 75,000 bricks, amounting to upwards of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I made some in<lb/>quiries respecting Chalcraft, and after 9th December discontinued the supply of bricks—at the time I consigned these bricks I believed the statement contained in the letters of 6th and 11th November, and the guarantee—if I had been told that Linnett was a journeyman printer out</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188503230002"/>
               <p>of work it would not have been a transaction in the ordinary course of business, nor if I had known that Chalcraft was not the freeholder—I never received any repudiation of the order from Linnett, or any protest against invoices being sent to him—I had no notice from Barrett or Chal<lb/>craft that the bricks were being used by Barrett—throughout the trans<lb/>action I regarded Barrett as our commission agent; as such he would not be responsible for the price of the bricks—I depended upon the consignee, the reference, or the guarantee—we have never supplied an agent with bricks for himself—on 14th January I wrote to Barrett requesting him to call on our solicitor—if bricks were supplied to an agent who gave proper references, he would still be entitled to his commission, but such a thing has never occurred—I never received payment for any of these bricks.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WHITE</hi>. I have never been offered payment for them—there are three partners in my firm—at present we have only one agent, at the time in question we had two—I superintend the work of the office—I do not sell bricks—I do not get customers; we leave that to the agents, but we are not satisfied if they simply make inquiries about the customer—we were satisfied in the first instance in this case—I wrote to Barrett to say that as he was perfectly satisfied as to the <hi rend="italic">bona fides</hi> of both parties I was satisfied—the bricks were forwarded on 14th November—I made inquiries on 1st December—we should supply anybody with bricks if they paid beforehand—if I had been paid for these I should not have been here, because I should not have known of the fraud—assuming I had known of the fraud, and been paid for the bricks, I should certainly have been here; there would still have been the misappropriation—Barrett's customers did not always turn out all right—Barrett forwarded the guarantee—it was in his writing—the last consignment of bricks sent to Linnett was 9th December, I think; then we stopped in consequence of inquiries made in reference to Chalcraft—I first instructed my solicitor to ask Chalcraft for payment about 14th January—I believe between that time and 9th December I was corresponding with Barrett—I wrote to Linnett for payment—I do not know whether any offers were made by Chalcraft to my solicitor to pay for the bricks—when I found out these fraudulent pretences I applied for a warrant, and had Chalcraft arrested—I have never had any communication whatever with Chalcraft—before I had this written guarantee Barrett had told me that he was satisfied with the <hi rend="italic">bona fides</hi> of the parties, and that he had a verbal guarantee from them, and I requested that to be put in writing and in legal form.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BURNIE</hi>. I was to be the judge whether Barrett's customers' references were good or not—to commission was to be 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per 1,000—we supplied goods to Petley on Barrett's introduction—we had a stop order in that case, not a guarantee—we supplied bricks to Blackford also at Chingford—I can't remember how many—they were sent to Blackford to pay the carriage, he did not pay it, and the Midland Company sold them to defray the expenses—I had some correspondence with Barrett about it—I have been told that all these bricks have been used on this land—the freeholder is Miss Mayho, and I know now that she has been living with Chalcraft as his wife—I did not know it when I preferred this charge—when I determined to take criminal proceedings against Chalcraft I was advised by my solicitor to include Barrett.</p>

I live at 27, Spencer Road, Holloway—up to June last I was a printer's warehouseman, in the same employment for twenty-six years—I left in consequence of the company being wound up—from June to December I was out of employment—I have never been a builder, and never had anything to do with building, and never signed a building agreement—I have known Chalcraft ten or eleven years—be<lb/>tween June and December I was frequently in his company—he knew the nature of my employment; he knew of my having left it in June—I first met Barrett, I think, about November in the Holloway Road—I was with Chalcraft at the time; nothing passed between me and Barrett then—at a later date I went with the prisoner to Messrs. Goldring and Mit<lb/>chell's, solicitors—I waited outside; they went in—they said they were going to sign a building agreement—Barrett said so—when they came out Barrett said "I must go and see about the bricks now; I am going to see Mr. So-and-So in Chancery Lane; I have ordered the bricks in your name"—I said "I object to that"—Chalcraft was present—we were all three together, and I should think he heard what passed—I saw the prisoners several times after that—I did not know Barrett's address, and I wrote a letter to Chalcraft—I received some invoices some time before Christmas—I sealed them in an envelope, and was going to send them back to Bray and Co.—I met Barrett on the way to the post—he said "Have you got any orders from Bray and Co.?"—I said "Yes"—he took them from my hand—we went into the Tollington public-house and met Chalcraft there—he took the papers from Barrett's hand, and said "They are nothing to do with Linnett; they have got my guarantee"—I received further letters—Barrett called for them as a rule, and I gave them to him—I told him repeatedly not to have the letters or orders ad<lb/>dressed to me—he put me off with excuses from time to time—after I had received the first letter Barrett asked me to give him a note to the station-master at Tottenham to have these bricks consigned to a carman, which I refused to give him—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not in my handwriting, or the signature to it; it purports to be my name—my name is C. Linnett, that is E. Linnett—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not my writing—I did not give any authority to write it—I saw Chalcraft in January or February—I met him at Tottenham Station, and asked him if he was coming down—he said "I have got the bricks, and am using them and intend to pay for them"—they were on a plot of building ground—I don't know the address.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WHITE</hi>. The date of my first instructions from my client would probably be the 14th, and they sent the correspondence that had passed between them and Barrett—Chalcraft called and pro<lb/>duced the building agreement about the 19th—I saw it in his hand; it never came into my possession, and I never read it—I saw the outside of it—I did not see who it was between—he told me it was between Miss Mayho and Barrett—I understood Barrett to be the builder—it was after that date that I wrote to Goldring and Mitchell—Chalcraft did not deny his liability at all—he offered nothing, but promised to pay at a future date—he made no other promise.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the last witness—I went to the Middlesex Registry on 24th February and made a search there—I produce a certificate of a memorial of a conveyance from Hinds to Chalcraft of certain land on a plan there—that is the land that was pointed out to me by the carter as the place he had taken the bricks to—that is dated 29th Decem<lb/>ber, 1882—I also produce a certificate of memorial of a conveyance from Chalcraft to Miss Mayho—I also found a memorial of a mortgage dated 5th December, 1884, by Miss Mayho to Davis, and also a mortgage bearing the same date as the first conveyance from Chalcraft to Hinds—those are all the memorials I found with reference to this property—I remember Chalcraft calling at Mr. Warner's office about January 19—I was there all the time he was there—he made no offer of terms—he admitted his liability to the debt.</p>

I went to the Registry to search for any records of any dealings with this property—I read them sufficiently to see as to the parties and the land in question—I saw that the mortgage with Miss Mayho and Davis was a mortgage of the same property from Miss Mayho the then freeholder to Mr. Davis; that was" all I wanted to know—I did not find out the object of the mortgage—I did not think it important—I have not brought the certificate for the mortgage—I do not know that Barrett's name appears in the mortgage about a dozen times.</p>

                  </hi>. I am at present residing at 11, Bruns<lb/>wick Road, Tottenham—I formerly resided at Banbury—I carried on business there with my sister as dressmakers and milliners—I had half the profits of the business—I have been for some time, and up to the date of Mr. Chalcraft's surrendering himself, acting as his house-keeper at Tottenham—I purchased the land in question at Sutherland Road, Tottenham, from Mr. Chalcraft—it was at that time subject to a mortgage of 215<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to a Mr. Hinds—I gave Chalcraft 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the land—the mortgage had not all been paid off—I acted under his advice with respect to the land—he had authority from me to act as he thought best in letting the land and getting houses built on it—I practically left everything in his hands—he proposed a building agreement at one time with Mr. Buckle, but that fell through because Chalcraft did not quite approve of Buckle, and he afterwards arranged terms of a building agreement with Barrett with my sanction, and he afterwards arranged terms of a mortgage with Mr. Davis—when Barrett failed to proceed with the building works, Chalcraft on my behalf took possession of the land again—he had general authority to do what he thought best in the matter.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I signed the building agreement myself; Chalcraft had no power to sign building agreements for me—he would do anything I asked him to do—I asked him if he would build on this land or get somebody to do so, as I had 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. interest to pay on the 215<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. mort<lb/>gage on the land which did not bring me in one halfpenny—I had to work to pay the interest—I gave the millinery business up in October last year—when the conveyance of this land was made to me, to the best of my recollection, I was living at Banbury—Chalcraft never lived at Banbury—I was in my business at Banbury since 1882—I have no in<lb/>terest in that business now—it was a new business when I went in, and I made enough profit in that time to buy the land and pay the interest on the mortgage—I don't remember whether Chalcraft paid 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the land—I don't remember whether he paid 275<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it and mortgaged it for 215<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—at the time I paid Mm the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Goldring and Mitchell, solicitors, 13, Southampton Street, Bloomsbury—I am conversant with the circumstances of the building agreement in relation to this land—before the building agreement between Miss Mayho and Barrett there were negotiations passing for an agreement with Buckle in respect of the same land, I prepared a draft agreement for that purpose, but they were broken off afterwards—I do not think Chalcraft was satisfied—our firm had this letter from Ohalcraft about it: "I object to Buckle signing the agreement, and will see you as to other arrangements I have in view.—Yours, J. Chalcraft, on behalf of Miss Mayho." I have heard the evidence of the last witness—I prepared the deeds which he produced, except the mortgage to Davis, that I only perused—I received the in<lb/>structions to draft the deed from Chalcraft, and those instructions were afterwards confirmed by Miss Mayho—Chalcraft always acted in every way as the authorised agent of Miss Mayho as far as I was concerned—I know Barrett's handwriting—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in his handwriting; it is an approval of the draft building agreement to which he was a party, the other party is Miss Mayho, Barrett being substituted for Buckle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When Chalcraft wrote to me he signed as Miss Mayho's agent—I don't know whether that was his general rule—I don't remember receiving any other letter—I don't remember him signing any agreement on behalf of Miss Mayho—he came and gave instructions, and Miss Mayho afterwards called and signed the document—Chalcraft gave 275<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the land when he bought it of Hinds, and he mortgaged it next day for 215<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., so that the actual money that passed from Chalcraft to Hinds would be 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this agreement was certainly signed on the date it is dated; that is the general rule—I know Miss Mayho did not see Barrett at our office—I believe Barrett signed it first; I cannot say positively—I was witness to both signatures—I should not like to say posi<lb/>tively, but very probably, looking at this document now, that Miss Mayho signed it first—we always let the first party sign above—I don't think that both signed at the same time—Barrett signed at the office—it was taken away unstamped—he said he would stamp it, but he never appears to have done so.</p>

Clifton said "I do not know any man, I am a single woman—I took her to Snow Hill Station and left her there—I had followed Clifton to 11, Upper Charlton Street, but I did not find her there—I followed Burls on 24th February from the Thames Police-court to St. George's Court, St. George's-in-the-East,</p>

               <p>and I went there two nights after, and saw Clifton come out of the same house and go to 11, Chapman Street, and then to 2, Rose Cottages, where McDonald lived—they had both refused their addresses—Burles said, "I have got no address," but afterwards he said, "If you go to Avery's you will find my house"—he afterwards said, "I lodge any where"—Clifton said, "I mostly live at common lodging-houses"—I said, "Where did you sleep last night?"—she said, "Somewhere by Spitalfields, I don't know the place"—the landlady opened the door at 11, Chapman Street, but I had the key which the female searcher gave me; it opened the door of the work-room, which was locked, and I found this ladle under the bed, this plaster-of-Paris mould for shillings under the pillow, and this small piece which has been broken out of it in the fender, a small bag of plaster-of-Paris, a broken mould for making shillings and sixpences near the middle of the bed outside the mattress, and this rent-book of William McDonald, Rose Cottages, St. George's Court—next day I made further search and found some pieces of lead in the ashes, this small piece of lead on the floor, which looks like trimming cut off with a knife, this copper wire was under the coal-box, and these two files on the shelf—the female searcher also gave me three pieces of copper wire, some brushes, and a large pocket-knife with plaster-of-Paris on it; it is exactly the same pattern as that found on Burls—here are two small files, a tobacco-box, a pair of pincers, a piece of whitening, several pieces of lamp-black, some brick-dust done up in small packages, and several quart bottles from a publican's in Poplar—I examined Burls's pockets and made this copy (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is made so that the purse could either remain in the pocket or be put outside—I also found this skirt with marks of plaster-of-Paris on it—Clifton gave me a good shilling—here is an apron with marks where coins have been cleaned on it, a bottle of acid, and a piece of board with marks where coins have been cleaned on it—the constable gave me two pawn-tickets, one of which was in the name of McDonald, who was sentenced to seven years here last Session—he was being tried when these two prisoners were outside here, and he called out the name of Walter Burls as one of the witnesses to his character—he was tried twice, on March 3rd and 4th, and he called Burls on the 4th, but Burls was then in custody—I have seen the prisoners together four or five times since December, in Poplar, and they brought some refreshment to the police-court for McDonald—on February 24th I was in plain clothes, and watched them to Rose Cottages—they went in together, and in a quarter of an hour Burls came out—two or three evenings afterwards I saw Clifton come out of that house at 8.30 and go to 11, Chapman Street.</p>

I am the prisoner's wife, we have been married about seven or eight years; I have one child aged four and a half years—in February last we were living at 9, Brunswick Terrace, Camberwell, and my sister, Agnes Reed, was living with us—on Tuesday, 10th February, I went out with my sister, and while with her we met a person named Dixon—I did not know him before, but I believe my sister did; she introduced me to him, and we walked about with him and had a glass of wine with him, and arrangements were made about writing to my sister in the name of Reed, but he wrote "Mrs. Taylor"—I took the apartments at Camberwell in the name of Mrs. Taylor—my husband knew that—we parted with this man on this Tuesday and returned home about one o'clock in the morning—on Thursday night my husband told me he had received a letter and asked me the meaning of it—I saw he had got a letter from Mr. Dixon addressed to Mrs. Taylor—I said "I know nothing about it"—he was very angry with me and asked me if the letter was for me, and I said "No, it must be for Agnes"—on the following day, Friday, we were quarrelling all the morning, and my husband struck me twice; he was going about the room like mad, and he said he would kill me—he said he would get drunk and then he would kill me or murder me—this was about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, he was sober then—after<lb/>wards I and my sister went out without my husband's knowledge, because I was frightened to be in the house, I took my child with us—we went to Vigo Street; we were there about half-past 5 o'clock—as I was coming down Vigo Street I had my baby on my right arm and my sister leaning on my left arm, and I felt something go in my back; I turned round and saw my husband there—he said "I have caught you now"—I put my hand to my back and found it was bleeding—the people called out and a constable came, and he was given in custody—I did not see whether he had got anything in his hand until he had done this, I then saw he had got a table knife—I found afterwards I was wounded in the shoulder blade; the stab went through the whole of my clothes, four articles of dress—I was taken to the police-station and seen there by Mr. Ross, a surgeon, and afterwards attended by Mr. Wright—the table knife was one of my landlady's.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 9, Brunswick Road, Camberwell, with my sister and the prisoner—she lived there as Mrs. Taylor; I don't know whether the prisoner passed as Mr Taylor—she took the rooms in the name of Mrs. Taylor because he owed some money or something, but I don't know that he passed as Mr. Taylor—he knew she passed as Mrs. Taylor—they were badly off—I went out with my sister on Tuesday, the 10th, and I met a man named Dixon—I knew him before, and introduced him to my sister, and then it was arranged that he was to write, but I don't know whether he was to write to Mrs. Taylor—my sister gave her name and I gave mine—the letter was sent for me, then afterwards we were out till about 1 o'clock in the morning—on the following day I did not hear any quarrelling between my sister and the prisoner—on the Friday he was very angry about this letter, and threatened to kill her—he showed me the letter when he said he was going to write to Mr. Dixon for an explanation—I told him it was intended for me, and not her, but he would not believe me—this is the letter: "Temple, 11th February. Dear Mrs. Taylor, I find I shall not be able to keep my appointment with you to-morrow night. I fear also I shall not have an evening disengaged till next Wednesday. I will write again as to seeing your sister and you.** I hope that handsome big sister of yours is no longer cross with me, and that you both got safely home last night. With love to you both, Henry Dixon."—I know the prisoner's writing—this letter is part his writing and part mine—"9, Grosvenor Road, Cam<lb/>berwell," is mine, and the following is the prisoner's: "Sir, I received your letter in my wife's absence, I suppose to keep the appointment with you, to her shame. I have not the slightest knowledge of you, but let me tell you if I find you speaking to my wife, or corresponding with her, I will watch her for the future and will pistol you on the spot. My wife probably told you I was abroad, or some such lie."—That is not signed—on Friday afternoon, about half-past 4, I and my sister and her little girl went out together while the prisoner was out of the house, and about half-past 5 we were in Vigo Street—we had not met or seen Dixon then—as I was walking along with my sister and child, going to get some money from a gentleman I knew, some one came at the back—I did not see him do it, but he turned round and said to her "I have caught you now"—my sister said "Oh, heavens, there is blood on my neck"—I said "That is nothing"—I did not know she was stabbed—somebody called out at the back "She is bleeding, he has a knife up his sleeve"—I did not see it, but I saw it pulled out from his sleeve—a constable then came up and took him in custody, and I saw the constable</p>

I live with my husband at 111, Philip Street, Hoxton—he works for Dr. Stunt, and the prisoner, was cook in that service—I knew her as a servant there—on the evening of 22nd December she came to my house with her child—I knew that she had been confined—she lived with me—she attended to the child; she had not much milk—I fed it every morning with Ridge's food—after that I can't answer for; she took care of it—she continued to live with me till the 10th—on the 9th she said she was going to take the child to a friend's in London Fields to be minded, and she was to pay 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week, and she had paid one week in advance—I lent her the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the Saturday night, the 10th, when she took it away at half-past 8 o'clock—it was then dressed in the clothes produced—I identify them—it was a bitter cold night, and wet—the baby was very thin and poor; it could not take the breast three days before it left my house—she had not sufficient for it—she returned at half-past 9 o'clock without the child, and remained with me three days—she did not tell me her friend's name or any further address than London Fields—I asked her the name, and she always turned the conversation—on the 13th she went into a situation—she never ill-used the child in my presence, she only said she wished she had not had it.</p>

I am a writing-desk maker, and live at 22, Antwerp Street, Hackney—on Saturday night, 10th January, about ten minutes to 10, I came from my house and heard the cry of a child in a dark part of the street—I went to the place and saw a bundle lying on the foot-path by a dead wall—I fetched a constable and then saw that the bundle contained child wrapped in a shawl—the constable took charge of it—it was a windy night, boisterous and wet.</p>

I am a M.R.C.S. and Licentiate of the College of Physicians, Edinburgh, and am Medical Officer of Hackney Infirmary—I saw this child when it was brought there on the Saturday night—I don't think I ever sasw a child more emaciated, and it was very cold indeed—the side of the head and face was covered with a thick mud—it seemed to be almost dying, very feeble—I ordered it to be sent to a ward and it was attended to under my care until it died the next night—I afterwards made a post-mortem examination—it weighed 4lb. 3 1/2 oz.; the average weight of child a month old would be from 8 to 10lb.—I examined the internal organs—in my judgement death was due to starva<lb/>tion, of course hastened by the exposure that night—it was a wet, cold night—in my opinion even if it had not been exposed it would not have been likely to recover—there was no disease sufficient to account for death—the valves of the heart were a little affected from debility, but there was nothing to prevent their performing their functions—if pro<lb/>perly fed with great care it might have lived, but it would require very great care indeed—there was nothing organic to cause death, if not starved or exposed.</p>

I went to service on the following Tuesday, and remained there a week only, when I left and went to Barnsbury, and I have not seen my child since."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at my shop, 56, Westbourne Grove, Paddington—on 26th February I went to bed at 11.15, and between 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning I heard a shuffling noise on the washing-stand in my bedroom—I said "Is it you, Rose?" and not getting an answer I put my hand over the bed, and saw the door of the washing-stand, which is a kind of table as well, was open, and the cash-box which had been in it was gone—I got out of bed, and went to my bedroom door, which was open; it is always kept shut—I heard footsteps running down<lb/>stairs stairs very fast to the back door which leads out into the Monmouth Road—my daughter had bolted that door; I had heard it shut—when I got down it was shut, not bolted—I went upstairs, and called my daughter and the housekeeper, and the latter I told to go for the, police—in the cash-box was a cheque for 184<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a gold watch and chain, a ring, a cork<lb/>screw, and 10 shares in the Neuve Monde, and other things—I have since seen this corkscrew and stud; I am quite sure they are mine—the stud was in the box before I lost it—Parish has been in my employ for about three years; I don't know Wells.</p>

On Saturday, 14th March, about a quarter to 12 o'clock, I was on duty at Great Portland Street near the Albany Tavern—I saw Lake and Sullivan struggling with the prosecutor; Woodruffe was standing close by; the moment they saw me the prisoners ran away—I went up to the prosecutor; he was bleeding very much from the mouth, his clothes were very much disarranged and seemed all un<lb/>buttoned—I spoke to him, and he found he had lost his watch and chain—I followed the prisoners and stopped Lake—Sullivan came up to try and rescue him, and another constable came and took Sullivan—the prosecutor identified them as the men who had assaulted him—on the way to the station Lake tripped me and threw me down, my hand was injured and has been ever since—I took him eventually to the station.</p>

I am a dairyman, and live at Peckham—from March 1882 to 1884 I carried on my business at 123 and 124, Dalston Lane—Newson Hodson was my assistant; he was about 16 years old, and up to September, 1883, I believe he lived at the prisoner's house, 2, Laurel Street, Hackney—he came to live with me about September, 1883, and on 19th March, 1884, he was ill, and I took him to the prisoner's house, and left him there—he was removed to the hospital ship, and I heard of his death on April 2nd—he left one or two old clothes at my house, but no box—I believe his box was at the prisoner's house—he used to go and stop there very often, but he only slept there once or twice.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Savings Bank Department, General Post Office—in November last the deceased's father came and inquired whether his son had a savings-bank account, and we traced it as having been opened at Dalston Lane—the only address we had was 2, Laurel Street, Dalston—in November and December I called and saw the prisoner several times; I told him I was from the Savings Bank De<lb/>partment, showed him the notice of withdrawal <hi rend="italic">A,</hi> the order <hi rend="italic">B,</hi> and the savings-bank book <hi rend="italic">C,</hi> and told him that the lad died on April 1, and the money had been drawn out—he said that he knew nothing about it, the lad only left an empty box—he told me the circumstances of his illness, and said that he knew he kept a savings-bank account, but did not know where the book was kept—I asked him for some information respecting the warrant which had been sent to his house—he said he knew nothing about it—I asked him who could have had the opportunity of taking the letters—he said Harry Archer, who lived at his place at</p>

               <p>the time the deceased lived there, and who knew that he had a savings-bank account, as Hodson had put away between 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for Archer—he said that he received notice from the ship of Hodson's death, and he would give me every assistance, and he and his wife had attended the funeral—I went to Harry Archer's lodging, and he filled up at my request this notice of withdrawal—I dictated to him the words "Newson Hodson, 2, Laurel Street, Dalston," and he wrote them—I afterwards saw George Payne, a dairyman's assistant, who filled up this form <hi rend="italic">E</hi> at my request—those forms do not agree at all with the writing on <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and <hi rend="italic">B</hi>—I saw the prisoner again in December, and asked him to fill up this form <hi rend="italic">F</hi>—I dictated from the first docnment, and he wrote the words as they are now, "9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and interest, to close account, Newson Hodson, 2, Laurel Street, Dalston"—I then compared it with the notice A and the receipt <hi rend="italic">B</hi>—I have no doubt whatever that the two are in the same writing, and the word "interest" is spelt <hi rend="italic">"intrest</hi>" in each—they strongly resemble the writing in the savings-bank book, but they were not written by the same person, because we know that he was dead.</p>
               <p>

(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner here put in a letter in French from the witness to herself stating:</hi> "If you consent to sing at my concerts I will place as many bills as you like in the theatre.")

Delbart, because that is a thing a man is not proud of, to live with a lady and not be married—I wrote on 6th November, "Dear Prima Donna, you must let the lunatics have a rest and occupy yourself about our week at Brighton"—I did not like the lunatics to be mixed up with my concerts—I had discovered that I had made a mistake in putting your bills in my theatre; I was told by</p>

Gounod—I remember your asking me what I looked so miserable for, and I spoke to you about my former misfortunes, and said I was afraid that in the Levy case they would cross-examine me about my <hi rend="italic">faillit</hi>—I did not say that I had paid all my creditors; I said that I was in course of paying them—I could not pay everybody in one lump—you offered to help me, but I did not accept it—I was not put into the witness-box—I did not persuade the Recorder on the last trial that I had been cross-examined in the Levy case; if the Recorder said so this is the first time I have heard of it—I don't know whether I mentioned the word "bankrupt" to Madame Menier or yourself; I may have said <hi rend="italic">"faillit</hi>"—there is a difference in French—I wrote this letter to you (<hi rend="italic">Signed "Your devoted General Riviere</hi>") asking if you knew of any moneyed partner who would join me; I did not refer to yourself—all the letters I have from you are here, but I have not kept all; I never knew they would be wanted—if you have a copy I will agree to it—I was at Madrid then, and it is quite a mystery to me that I kept so many—I objected to more than 30 in the choir on account of the expense—I do not know that you had 300—I said that I did not wish to have a large choir, I always objected to the expense—I never was put to any expense for the choir except the 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and I paid you for three weeks I think—the concerts were for five weeks—I think the money you got from me was three weeks at 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—I will not swear it was three weeks, but I feel almost sure it was three—they sang for three weeks and I dismissed them; the last two weeks I declined to pay because they were not there—I dismissed them for incompetency—the concerts lasted five weeks.

               <p>to have 500—if there had been 200 to 250 there would have been no room for the orchestra—I have conducted concerts in this country for 25 years—I do not give lessons nor train choirs—Miss Fisher, my sister-in-law, was a dressmaker—I think three weeks would be sufficient to train a choir—you offered to sing for nothing in 1878—I call offering to sing for advertising your bills, singing for nothing—you sang for no payment, what I gave I gave willingly—the case mentioned in your letter of 22nd April was to contain your photograph and 100 tickets—I had time to reflect that if I gave 100 tickets to each chorister Covent Garden would not be large enough to hold them—I had been thinking of 60 choristers, not 250; I never dreamt of 200 choristers—Gatti's letter, which I mentioned in mine of 29th April, 1879, has been destroyed, I do not keep letters—Merrimee asked more than 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, I do not know if it was 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I wished to stop encores, I do not remember whether you put it into my head, I did not mean to ask your advice—I objected to Miles's prices for the cases—I thought you were not likely to fill the boxes—all your propositions were so gigantic that I could not follow you; it would be your concert, not mine—a contract might be a verbal agreement—I do not remember if you came with Madame Menier on 26th May to Villa St. David, Gipsy Hill, to spend the day with me—I did not dictate this agreement to you then; we were together, and you may have taken notes; it was the topic of our conversation. (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner then read what purported to be a draft prospectus of the Covent Garden concerts, with an announcement that M. Riviere had engaged a large and efficient choir, that M. Riviere intended to give fortnightly concerts, and that tuition would be regular, with Mrs. Weldon as conductor.</hi>) The end of that was in this Riviere and Hawkes circular. (<hi rend="italic">This also stated that 200 tickets for the concerts would be presented to each chorister.</hi>) That was written by you, we did it together—it does not state the numbers of the choir—I never agreed that you should have the book of words—I changed my mind about Madame Menier having the stall—I promised you a share of the profits if there were any—the circular gave your address, to save you the trouble of all the people going to your house—I do not remember telling you that Madame Delbart committed suicide on hearing I was married; she committed suicide eight years after she heard that—she knew I had a wife in France in 1847, Madame Zinc—I did not tell you I had never been married except to my present wife—very likely I told you I had been married in France, there was no mystery about it, every one knew it—I did not tell you at my previous trial that I had been sentenced to <hi rend="italic">travaux forces</hi> for embezzlement; it was not true—I do not know if I used the word "fraudulent," I said I had been bankrupt; I was not fraudulent—I do not remember telling you about my past life on that visit, but I did at the Old Bailey—I was condemned for my bank<lb/>ruptcy by <hi rend="italic">contumace</hi> to ten years' <hi rend="italic">travaux forces,</hi> in my absence in 1858.

(<hi rend="italic">The witness also gave particulars as to his payments to his other creditors.</hi>) This "act of decease" shows that my father-in-law died in the Rue de Cremelin; there is nothing to show that it was at the bicette—Madame Bosquet was my mother-in-law—this paper shows that she died in May, 1866, at the "Little Sisters of the Poor"—I do not dispute where she died—Mr. Fisher, my second father-in-law, was a watchmaker; he was stated in the marriage certificate to be a gentleman—I do not remember telling you and Madame Menier anything of all this—I told you about my bankruptcy in this building at</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner here put in a printed post-card concerning the Crystal Palace concerts, which contained the announcement "Efficient chorus, under the direction of Mrs. Georgina Weldon.</hi>") I was agreeably surprised with the choir—I wrote that post-card after I heard them, that was public; I was not going to tell the public that the choir was no good—the post-card was printed before I heard them and sent out afterwards—you said you would supply the music for the Crystal Palace; that you had so many hundreds of this, that, and the other, I don't remember if it was for the Crystal Palace or Covent Garden, I should only have chosen things that I had music for—I did not say you were to buy the music, but supply it—you were to have a share of the profits in case of success at Covent Garden—this was the pre<lb/>liminary notice of the Crystal Palace concerts on 11th August in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>—I have done nothing to offend you purposely in any way, it was trying to keep you in your place—when I wrote on 6th August I did not know you had leaders, those you had were not efficient; you never let me hear them separately, I asked you to—I was going to pay 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week for the choir and advertisements and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for you; and you were to find the music you had, I did not want you to buy any—I proposed that you should engage leaders when I proposed the 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—I proposed giving Steadman 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for a single concert, I don't know whether you were pleased or not at that—I was not satisfied with your choir, there were 200 of yours and 100 of Steadmans—I don't know that you showed me answers from about 900 choristers—I did not want to pay for the ladies' dresses, when I was paying 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—I don't think you refused one voice for your choir, you thought everything was good enough—I think nine out of ten could not sing, I heard them at the Crystal Palace and Covent Garden; I formed that opinion shortly after they sang at Covent Garden—I could only make a programme by repeating the same pieces—I have attended plenty of rehearsals—a good many pieces of music were copied for you, I spent about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in copying and printing—you could conduct at rehearsals, but at concerts we could not have two <hi rend="italic">bu✗tons</hi>—I decided on 100 of Steadman's choir; I am confident I received your advice in writing to do so, I have not got the letter here—I never authorised you to spend more than 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in advertisements, I don't know if you told me it was less than 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should have given you the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if you had told me you had spent it, but if we had come to the agreement for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that would have covered everything—it was not impossible for you to get that large choir without spending more money; amateurs came flocking—I knew some of your amateurs must be bad—I don't believe you had a great many of the Alexandra choir—I didn't inquire about it; I judged myself that they were bad—you have not tried to pick out the best—you did not always think it necessary for me to come to rehearsals—Steadman's choir is a good well-known one—you took Steadman's choir by my advice; the chorus would have been defective otherwise—we did without Steadman's choir at the second concert—I wrote that you were "badly surrounded"—I meant Madame Menier—I thought I was your best friend—I said "I detest flatterers," and I wrote "All that can do good to our commo</p>

Gounod's opinion was better than mine, and I decided that your choir was too serious for the Crystal Palace concerts—the people found the programme heavy and never heard your piece, but I decided that it was not a proper piece for the concerts, and I should do the same to-day—I think you said that if you did not sing a certain song you would not sing any—you wrote and asked me for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not give it to you; I was hard<lb/>up through the loss at those concerts—I said "You take the money and pay as you please"—that was up to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was agreed that you should spend 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for advertisements.

               <p>—you would have that tremendous number of choristers, and that is where the blunder was—you did not reduce their number, nor did I give in an inch except on 3rd October, when to have peace I made a com<lb/>promise—I afterwards agreed to give them 100 or 120 tickets—I never knew that you bought music because I did not supply it in time—you wanted to be everything and everybody—you wanted to be the star and blamed them for wanting to engage Emma Thoresby—I did not promise you that you should be the star—I did not believe you when you said that your choristers had sung the "Hymn of Praise" and the Stabat dozens of times—you did not refuse any boxes; you had them as agreed, and could do as you liked with them, and give some boxes and some dress circles—I don't see that they would excite jealousy—Miss Fisher is my sister-in-law—I know Mr. Morris by sight—on 11th September I wrote to you as we could not agree, and I thought two gentlemen would settle the matter, one on each side—the ticket question was certainly a very great difficulty to me; I could not overfill the theatre—I agreed with a gentleman representing the choir, and gave as many tickets as I could—you asked for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week to be paid weekly, one benefit night for yourself, which I agreed to; the leaders were to be paid by you—I never promised that the book of words should be sold in the place—I have got my letter to Mr. Cooper—I can see that this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a settlement of the ticket difficulty—Mr. Morris did not tell me that all my wishes were very reasonable; he was on my side in two minutes—he approved of everything I said—this is a circular of September 19th, 1879, which I desired my clerk to distribute at the door of your house to the choir as they left—I did not know their addresses, and could not send it by post—I asked them in that circular to come and speak to me the next evening at 28, Leicester Square—I wanted to explain matters—I did not know that that evening you were advertised to go down and sing at Brighton—I could not go to your house to explain it to your choir, in the state of mind we both were when solicitors were beginning to write—I wanted to make your choir understand how willing I was to make everything satisfactory; they had not accepted my terms when I wrote the circular—I cannot remember what was in the circular, but I had good reasons for sending it—a letter which has not been read settled the difficulty between Mr. Cooper and myself, but I did not know that the choir accepted my terms—this is the circular, full of unscrupulous lies—I have not kept the letters I received from members of the choir; I received a good many—there was an arrangement that I should give 200 tickets to 120 of the choir; I objected to give 200 tickets each to 300 of the choir, and I wrote that they were writing to me that they wanted their 200 tickets, I wanted to meet them and explain to them my position—it was agreed that I should have 50 or 60 choristers every evening—I cannot produce your letter advising me to engage 100 choristers through an agent—you sanctioned my engaging 100 from Steadman; I engaged him—I don't know if I was asked to produce that letter at the former trial or at the action of Riviere and Cooper; I have not produced it—I have not discovered that you only advertised once in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph;</hi> it never came out that you had spent as much as 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in advertising.

Mr. Fisher coming to me with this paper and asking me to agree to it and sign it—you consented to sign something which was arranged—you came down with Mr. Cooper to Messrs.

Zinc an arrangement was come to between us that I should take the business from him and pay him an annuity—I did so, becoming the proprietor of the business—I had no capital—this was about 1849 or 1850, and Mr. Brocard became my partner, putting 50,000 francs into the business. I bringing the goodwill and the goods, which had been valued at 50,000 francs—we soon commenced to quarrel—about this time I found that, for the second time, my wife had been unfaithful to me; those two circumstances and my losing; money at concerts induced me to leave Paris for Brussels—as against the goodwill of the business I drew out before I left 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that is the alleged fraudulent bankruptcy—I left Brocard in posse<lb/>sion of the whole of the business, out of which he has since made a large fortune—he is there still—I began to pay my creditors in 1861 or 1862—as soon as I could—I have continued to pay those creditors up to the present time as far as I have been able—I have letters in my posses<lb/>sion from my creditors thanking me for the honourable manner in which I acted—M. Zinc received, with the other creditors, 13 1/2 per cent, dividend—I continued to pay him the annuity I promised him down to the dissolution of my partnership with Brocard—M. Zinc was never put in prison for my debts—I have no proof that he died in a madhouse from my frauds—I was in Belgium about three or four months—I then determined to come to London, where I arrived in December, 1857, with 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my pocket—I remember the trial of Edward Lawrence Levy at this Court on 2nd and 3rd May, 1879—I saw Mrs. Weldon at that trial in May, 1879—I was prosecuting Levy—he was practically Micklethwaite—he was sentenced to eighteen months—I saw Mrs. Weldon here, and told her I had a case on—she asked if she could assist me—I told her that Levy was going to drag up all my past in Paris, alluding to my misfortunes that I have mentioned—I then told her of my bankruptcy in Paris and my condemnation for not having surrendered to it—I lived with a woman named Madame Delbart from 1857 to 1869—we then parted—on her leaving I gave her 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Rentes and everything in the house; also a policy for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the Hand-in-Hand Insurance Company in case I should die first—I continued to pay the annual premiums on that policy up to the time of her death—I also sent her 100 francs regularly every quarter up to the time of her death—in 1869 it was mutually agreed between us that on account of our tempers being unable to agree, we should part—the money I used to send her I sent to her direct, but she acknowledged it through "M. O'Neil"—it was eight years after her leaving me that I heard of her committing suicide—it is not true that when she heard I had taken up with one of the French <hi rend="italic">Can-can</hi> dancers at the Philharmonic she committed suicide—my present wife was never a <hi rend="italic">Can-can</hi> dancer at the Philharmonic; she was never on the stage in any capacity—it is not true that Delbart committed suicide on finding that I had taken up with a <hi rend="italic">figurante</hi> at the Alhambra—I was married to Miss Fisher in 1870—at that time I had a friend named Adamthwaite, who had also married a Miss Fisher, a sister of my present wife—I being a foreigner, Adamthwaite arranged and gave the necessary information for filling up the documents for my marriage certificate; he gave evidence on my behalf on Mrs. Weldon's trial in 1880—he has since died—since I left Paris I have been there many times, two or three</p>

I am stationed at Lea Bridge—about 8.30 on Friday night, the 20th, I went to Alfred Bashan's, 53, Devonshire Street, Bethnal Green, and in a room at the top of the house I saw the two prisoners—I said to Forster "I am a police-officer, and am going to take you into custody on suspicion of breaking into a house at Waltham-stow"—he pulled off his coat and vest and threw them down on the floor—the poker was in the fire red hot—he pulled it out and held it up in a threatening attitude, and said "God blind me, if you touch me I will smash your head in pieces"—I went towards him; he aimed a blow at me with the poker; I jumped on one side and it missed me—he then turned the poker round to hit me with the big end, but burnt his hand and dropped it—I closed with him—he had only his shirt on—we struggled—his shirt was torn to pieces—I got hold of him round the waist; he unbuttoned his trousers' so that I should not hold him by any<lb/>thing—he tried his utmost to get away—I cross-butted him, and threw him, his feet struck and knocked over a table on which were a lamp I had taken up and one which had been in the room before, and the paraffin from them set the room on fire—he still struggled, violently—I got him to the staircase; Bashan was outside, and together we pulled him down-stairs by his boots—when we got below asked him to be quiet—he re<lb/>sisted and tried to get away—I got him in a corner and knocked him about the head and body with my fist till he said he would go and he quiet—I asked Bashan to fetch a constable from the street, and stood by till the constable came and then went up with the constable to search the room—when the lamps were knocked over King and a little girl were in the room—they ran downslairs then, and he called out to her "Annie, bring the b—gun up and shoot the b—"—I believe she left the house—I did not see her again—on searching the room with the other constable, in a basin on the shelf I found this small gold brooch which Mr. Gill identified—this purse and pawnticket relating to a pair of trousers pledged—I found on the mantelpiece in a small box—they have been identified—under the bed I found this carpenter's</p>

                  </hi>. I am a foreman in the employ of the London Tramways Company, and have charge of the Deptford Yard—the prisoner was a horse-keeper under me—February 26th was his night to see all the horses in; that duty is taken in turns by the men—he had to remain at the yard till 1 a.m.; he left, I believe, at 10 o'clock, and did not return next day—he came on Saturday morning, the 9th, and asked me for his <hi rend="italic">line;</hi> that is a note showing the amount due to him—I made it out, giving</p>

               <p>him a day and three-quarters instead of the two days which he would have been entitled to had he finished his day's work—I closed it and gave it to him to take to the paymaster, and he left me on good terms—about 11 o'clock I was in the yard attending to a sick horse, and the prisoner came up and said, "What do you mean by this?"—I said that I meant to pay him for what work he had done, and stooped down to examine the horse—the prisoner said, "Ten hours is a day"—I said, "It may be a day where you come from, but not where I come from"—I stooped down again and felt a severe blow on my side towards my back—I got up and saw him with a knife in his hand; I cannot say if it was open, but he was jumping about brandishing the knife in his hand—he threw his hat on the ground and said that he was an Irishman and would show he was one—I found blood running down my leg—I have never had a quarrel with the prisoner; he appeared to have been drinking—I had very thick clothes on—I was in the hospital a week—these long hours only occur once in 18 days, and next day the man has a half-day—there are a good many hours off, and they get regular meal hours every day.</p>

I am the wife of Robert Roland Warner—I recollect his advertising a musical box for sale—I recollect a man calling with regard to it—before that my husband had received this letter from Mr. Cox, which he showed to me. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "36, Belgrave Square. The Hon. Mrs. Cunningham has seen your advertisement, and has instructed Estell, of Bond Street, to see it, and if satisfactory to buy it") A man came to my house on 23rd January—Mrs. Cork fetched me down to see him—he handed me this note. (<hi rend="italic">Purporting to come from Estell, of Bond Street, to see the musical box, and if worth the money to purchase it.</hi>) I showed him the musical box—he said it was not exactly what he wanted, he thought it was square, with bells, but he said he would take it if I gave him an agreement to return the money if it was not approved of—an agreement was written, and he took the musical box away, and he left the cheque with me, which I gave to my husband—he said he came from Estell, of Bond Street, to buy the box for a lady in Belgrave Square—he agreed to return the box next day if it did not suit—he did not call again—I saw him at the police-station on the 6th February, the day before I was examined—he was with several others, and I picked him out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cab proprietor, of 17 1/2, Cross Street, Black<lb/>friars Road—on Wednesday, 11th February, about 3 o'clock, I went out with my Forder cab and a dark brown horse which I shall have to give 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for, I have given a bill for it—I had had it about a week—about 4 o'clock I was at my farrier's, Mr. Cox's, in Lambeth Walk—I left my cab there and went about 50 yards to the George, where I saw Layzell; I had known him before, but not the Pages—he said "Here comes one of the best of them, what are you going to have?"—I said "A drop of rum"—I had some; the two Pages were with him, I had never seen them before to my knowledge—they asked me if I would buy a good cab—I said "I will buy a good cabber, I have got one outside, I have got to pay 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., ain't much use in a Forder cab"—a better class of horses is driven in Forders—they said would I have a ride behind their cob—I said "Yes, I have a friend going to take me home to dinner with him, we will have a go as far as his house"—they drove me with my friend to his house—we had rabbit and pork for dinner, and then they drove me back to the George; we had some hot rum when we got there, about 5 o'clock—they kept on filling me up, I don't know whether they mixed anything with the rum—I don't remember anything after going back to the George—next morning my <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> woke me and called me downstairs to look at the horse—I came down and saw the <hi rend="italic">cricket</hi> in the stable; it was not my horse—I went to bed again—my <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> showed the horse to a veterinary surgeon, Mr. Phillips, Water Lane, Brixton—it was worth about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that is what I should get for it—on the Saturday after the three prisoners came to my place; I was in bed—they spoke to my <hi rend="italic">missus</hi>—she said I had got a very useless horse and was going to have it killed—he said "Don't-have it killed, I will give more than knacker's price for it; I cannot be buyer and seller, we will give 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I will take 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of it"—so he wanted two horses for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known Layzell 16 or 17 years—he is a cab proprietor, I don't think he had any cabs at this time—he recognised me; he was no friend of mine, I had had no <hi rend="italic">truck</hi> with him in my life—I don't suggest that he made me drunk, I suppose I must have got drunk—I have been drunk four times in 21 years, I think—I was fined on 27th December, 1884, and 26th January, 1885, for being drunk—I am sure it was not 1 o'clock when I arrived at the George, it was about 3—the horse was no use in a hansom cab; it was not a kicker, I had it about a week—I did not say when I came into the house that I had a horse which cost me 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and that it was not worth 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to me, nothing of the kind; I said it was no use to a Forder cab—it had cost me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I will swear the horse's tail was not fastened to the harness so that it should not kick—I don't know if that is a common practice—I did not say "Whose horse is that outside?"—William Page did not say "That is mine, it is for sale"—Henry Page drove me in their horse and cart to my friend's to dinner, I don't know why—they said "Get up and have a ride," it was not to see if I liked it—they said "Jump up and have a ride and see if it will suit"—I did not ride there to try the horse—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188503230083"/>
               <p>did not drive their horse to see if it would suit me—I have had no rum this morning—I gave a bill for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my horse; it has got to be paid—I bought it of Mr. Case—he was going to take it back again, he always takes my horses back if I want him to—I never said the horse was not worth 20<hi rend="italic">l.;</hi> it was not worth that in a Forder cab—I did not say to William Page "I will have a <hi rend="italic">chop</hi> with you, I have a good cabber"—the last thing I recollect is coming back from dinner and getting to the George, and after that my memory failed me—I remember having a ride again in Page's vehicle; we came round after dinner to the George by Mr. Bill's, Russell Street—we had tea at Hudson's with the pork and rabbit—I was sober after that till I got back to the George—Page re<lb/>mained outside with his horse and cart while I had dinner, and when I got back Layzell said "Jump up and have a ride again."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I was convicted in December and January of being drunk, and the time before that was 14 years ago—my cab was brought round from Cox's to the George, and I was going away with it two or three times over, but Layzell caught hold of me and pulled me down, and asked me to have a drop more.</p>

I live at Alfred Cottages, the Parade, Lambeth Walk—I work with my father, a farrier—on 11th February, at 3.15 p.m., I was in our shop by myself—Watson drove up with his cab, which he left in my charge and went to the George—about 5.5 I took the cab and horse round to the George—Watson came out; I said "You had better go home"—he said "I will"—he went to get on the cab, and had one foot on the step, Layzell said "Where are you going?" he said "Home"—Layzell said "Come and have a drop more before you go," and caught hold of his arm and took him inside the George again—he stayed there two or three minutes, and then Russell and Henry Page came out by themselves and started unharnessing the horse in the cab and taking him out; I said "What are you going to do?"—he said "Oh, they have been and done a <hi rend="italic">chop</hi>"—Russell and Henry Page took the horse out of the cab and put it into the cart, and put the horse out of the cart into the cab—after that Layzell came to the door and said "Is it all right?" and they said "Yes"—he then went back into the house—Russell and William Page stopped out; I stayed till they went away—Watson was led out of the public-house by William Page and Layzell, one on each side of him, he could hardly stand; when he went to get into the cab he fell over on the footboard—they put him inside, and William Page got inside his cab with him, and Layzell got on the seat and drove away—the other Page and Russell got in the cart and followed on—the changing horses was all done while Watson was in the public-house.</p>

I am a daughter of the last witness—I saw the prisoner arrive with two women on December 3rd—he had a white muffler on—I saw him five times while he was there, and spoke to him each time—I failed to recognise him before, but I am certain of him now—they had a small box with them, which is here, and a large bundle—that was all their luggage—Young told me that that was all she had—on the 15th January a broker's man took the box into my mother's room, and on the 19th January a constable broke it open—the prisoner had whisker3 and a bushy moustache when at our house, which have been cut off.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>). I was at the station when the prisoner was brought in—I heard the charge made against him of being drunk while in charge of a horse and cab, and running over a child—I read over the charge to him—he said "I don't think I am drunk"—I was satisfied that he was drunk, or I should not have taken the charge—his speech was very thick, and he was unsteady in his walk; he walked across the road; he smelt very strongly of drink—I saw he was lame—I kept him at the station for about an hour, then he was bailed and went away with his friends—a respectable man came to bail him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> If his friends promised to take care of him I should let him go even if he was not quite sober—I saw him when he was bailed out, he was better then, he had partly recovered, but he smelt very strongly of drink.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at St. Thomas's Hospital—on 3rd March I saw a little child about seven years old; it was admitted two days before, it had a wound on the left hand, with injury to the bones of the thumb—I did not anticipate any danger except to the hand—it remained in the hospital until the 5th, when it died from tetanus, which might arise from the cab going over it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hackney carriage driver, of 40, High Street, Lower Norwood—I was sitting on the box of the cab by the side of the prisoner on this afternoon, 1 rode from Streatham with him, about two and a half miles; he was driving, he was going about seven miles an hour—when you drive the horse at that pace he shuffles along, he can't trot at that pace, he makes a kind of shuffle of it, he like canters along—the cab was going at the rate of four miles an hour at the time of the accident, he was pulling up, trotting in to give the horse some water—it was a pure accident, we were pulling up—the child was standing with her back towards us about a yard and a half from the water trough quite still in front of us, looking towards Mitcham—the prisoner halloaed out,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188503230091"/>
               <p>but the child, instead of going away from the cab, ran into it and the cross bar of the shaft, and the hind wheel knocked her down and went over her hand—I jumped off the cab directly—if the child had stood still instead of moving towards the cab she would not have been knocked down—the prisoner was not drunk, he had had a glass of ale at Streatham; he was capable of taking care of himself and a horse and cab—he pulled up instantly after the accident, the horse's head had not passed the end of the trough towards Mitcham—I had had two glasses of ale that day—I went across to the doctor's along with the child—I know this road well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was a man inside the cab who always goes along with the prisoner to help him with his luggage, because he is not able to lift it—he had not got luggage this day, but he had other business; to see a party that owed him some money, he was not looking out for a fare—I weut along with him; I had been with him about an hour.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Grey House Square, Streatham Common—I was inside this cab—I go about with the prisoner to help him—before the cab got into the draw-up towards the Mitre I should think it was going at about six or seven, miles an hour—I did not see the accident, but all at once I found the cab slacken—that was when the accident happened—the pace slackened as the cab turned in towards the Mitre, and all at once I found it stop—it was going at about four miles an hour after it turned in towards the draw-up—the prisoner was not drunk, and he was not to say quite sober—he had had two or three glasses of beer, but he was a long way from being drunk—I was eating a bit of bread and a saveloy inside the cab—I have known this horse about six years—it was rather an old horse when we had him—I used to look after him six years ago—I know he used to go very quietly then, and he has not got faster since—it could not gallop if if tried—if you hit him very hard he would only canter.</p>
