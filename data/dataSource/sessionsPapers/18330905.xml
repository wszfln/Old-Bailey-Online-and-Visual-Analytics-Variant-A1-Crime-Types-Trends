             - we afterwards went to the Red Lion, Fleet-lane; that was between seven and eight o'clock in the evening - I saw the prisoner there with others; he forced his conversation on us, and prevailed on us to play at skittles; we had only gone there to have a pint of porter being thirsty - about a quarter to nine o'clock we were going away; Jackson, and a companion of the prisoner's, went to the bar to have something to drink for what they had lost - I had my hat and coat on, and was coming out of the ground - I had got part of the way out of the ground, going towards the bar to Jackson, and the prisoner came before me and struck me in the stomach with one hand, and with the other hand pulled out my watch, and broke a strong steel guard which was round my neck - he took the watch and ran through the bar and I after him as fast as I could - Jackson stood at the bar, and I said,"James, that man has ran away with my watch" - Jackson ran and pursued him, and took him - next morning at Guildhall, a man produced my watch - the blow the prisoner gave me pained me all the way home; I should have fallen down, but his pulling the watch, and the resistance of the chain, pulled me up again - it was a severe blow; he left part of the chain round my neck, the rest of it was found on the watch, and was produced the next day with it - this is my watch and chain, (looking at them).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose you were very much annoyed at being robbed at the skittle-ground? A. Yes; I never went to a skittle-ground before nor since - I went with the policeman to the house to-day to look for a man - I was not put out of the ground; I was told I should not play there, but I was not going to play- I went with my sister, and two, or three, or four policemen, to day - I do not know what I went for I am sure - I went on account of my sister going with the other men - she did not go to the skittle-ground, the others went there to have something to drink - I did not know it was the house in which I had been robbed, till I got there, because I had never been there before that night - I was not exactly sober when I was robbed; I had one glass of gin and a drop of beer; perhaps I drank part of a pot of beer; I did not measure it - I did not pay for above a pint of beer or so; Jackson had some money of me - I paid 4d. or 5d., not more, for what I had - I call myself an apprentice to a surgeon - I had not been in any other public-house that day - I drank nothing at my father's; I was not drunk in the skittle-ground; I was a little worse for what I had, but I did my work when I got home - I was a little sick in the skittle-ground; that was on account of eating some fruit; I had the fruit before I had the beer; I had it at my father's, in King's-place, Regent's-park.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you empty the contents of your stomach in the skittle-ground, and get the pot-boy to clear it up? A. Well, he was paid for it; Jackson, I believe, gave him two or three halfpence - it was not my intoxication caused me to be sick, it was eating the apples - I did not charge anybody with stealing my coat that night; I had pulled it off to play; I did not say it was stolen - Jackson might say it was stolen; he went to the landlady and got it; he said somebody had been playing a lark with it, or something - I paid for part of what was drank with my own hand; Jackson said he wanted some halfpence, and took 4d. out of my coat while it was off, to pay for what he had at the bar with the prisoner's companion - I did not speak to the landlady; I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050004"/>state to her that I had lost my watch outside the street-door - I did not charge anybody with stealing my coat - my brother-in-law, when he found somebody had been playing a lark, said he thought my coat was taken out of a lark; he went to the landlady, and the coat was produced - he did not say the coat was stolen at all in my presence - I eat a few apples at my father's, nothing else, to make me sick; I had them about an hour before I got to the skittle-ground; I only played one game at skittles - nobody is here that saw me attacked, that I know of; there were about twelve persons in the ground.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was it before or after the blow that you were sick? A. A long while before; I never went to any skittle-ground before, and not being used to drinking, made it take effect on me - I did not play with the prisoner at all; he sat next to me in the ground all the while - I did not show him my watch; I did not see him before I went to the public-house - I am seventeen years old.</p>
               <p>JAMES JACKSON. I live at No. 33, George-street, Blackfriars-road; I am the prosecutor's brother-in-law. I was with him on the day in question, at the Red Lion, he was quite sober when he went there - I had no fruit; he had some apples in my presence; he bought them in the street, and eat them going along the street, not at his father's - he had one glass of gin at the Red Lion, and part of a pot of beer - five drank out of the pot of beer- he is not in the habit of taking spirits; I consider his sickness was on account of the fruit - he appeared rather affected by liquor, but knew what he was doing perfectly well - I went to the bar to have something to drink with the prisoner's companion; we had fallen into their company in the skittle-ground - during the time I went to the bar to have something to drink, the prisoner came running as hard as he could run, out of the house; he came through the bar as fast as he could run;

             was behind him, and cried out,"Stop him, stop him, he has taken my watch" - I ran after him as hard as I could run, and the prisoner ran as hard as he could till he got opposite Mr. Waithman's Obelisk; he ran right across Farringdon-street, and there I detained him till the constable of the night came up, and being certain that he was the man, as I had never lost sight of him, the constable of the night took him to the watch-house - he was searched, but no property found on him; being positive of him, I had him searched again; he was locked up, and we had to appear next morning at Guildhall, and there the watch was produced by a man named

             - the prosecutor complained of his stomach all the way home, and appeared suffering from pain.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were you in the habit of frequenting these places? A. Never; we were thirsty, and went in to drink something, not intending to play at skittles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Would not gin, beer, and apples, give him a pain in his stomach? A. He never had the pain in his stomach before - he was sick that night, but he did not have the pain in his stomach till after the watch was stolen - the five that drank out of the pot were all strangers, except the prosecutor; they all paid their share- I paid threepence that night; the prosecutor paid about fivepence; he was not in the habit of going to skittle-grounds - his master did not know he was going that night- I have not gone to the skittle-ground since; I did not go into the ground to-day, I went close to it - I was not refused to play there to-day; I did not stop a minute - I went there to have some beer it was the same place as the robbery took place - we were on our road going home from here; and it was the nearest place, when it was proposed to have some porter - neither I nor my brother made any demand to play at skittles there to-day- some of our company played, but I did not hear them refused - I got there just as they had finished playing; I did not stop to hear what the landlady said - I stated, that I did not stay a minute, but I went back afterwards; they were playing then - they were not prevented from playing - the man that found the watch was playing with somebody, I do not know who - none of my company were playing, except Frier; the prosecutor remained in the ground - I left him there when I went away; I was absent about five minutes, and remained there about five minutes, when I came back, the prosecutor was there all that time - I saw my brother that night sick; he was laying on the benches; he was not so drunk as not to know what he was doing; he did lay down on the bench - it was not through drunkenness; he laid down merely to rest himself, I suppose - it was not because he was sick - he did lay down and was sick.</p>
               <p>Q. You have sworn he laid down to rest - now you say he laid down and was sick? A. He was sick during the time he laid down; the pot-boy was obliged to come and clean up the filth he had vomited - I did not see the benches soiled and dirty by his vomiting; it was on the ground - I saw nothing else soiled; he vomited all on the ground - none of his garments were dirty - the pot-boy was called to clean up the filth; he was paid for it - my brother did not complain that his coat had been stolen, it was me - I could not see his coat any where, I searched all round the ground; I asked the landlady to come and see if she could find it - I did not complain that it was stolen - I did not say my brother had been robbed of his coat; I had drank very little indeed; I was as sober as I am now - I drank no liquor whatever, only porter; there was one pot among five of us - I paid threepence; one man had not got money, and I gave him a penny, which made the threepence I paid.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you go while, your brother, and the rest were in the skittle-ground to-day? A. I came up here to meet my sister; I did not see my brother kicking the pins about in the skittle-ground - I do not know William Bastard, to my knowledge; I did not state to any body, that some persons had stolen my brother's coat - I saw nothing happen to my brother myself; I and the prisoner only ran along Farringdon-street at the same time - six or seven persons did not rush out of the house, they all remained behind; my brother did not give the alarm till he came to me - no one ran from the house but the prisoner; the others did not leave the place.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. It was at the bar you first heard your brother had lost his watch? A. Yes; the skittle-ground is some distance from the bar - I could see the persons<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050005"/>in the skittle-ground as I stood at the bar, if I had looked - the ground is straight forward, from the bar.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH FRIER. I live at No. 55, Brandon-street, Locks-fields, Walworth. On the morning of the 15th of August, I picked up this watch in Farringdon-street, about a quarter before five o'clock - there is a heap of granite just by the Obelisk, and I saw something laying on the ground; I got up, and looked, and it was a watch out of the case, which laid about a yard from it - the case and the inside of the watch were both bruised, and there was part of the guard, and seal, and chain, on it - any body could have thrown it there running by Mr. Waithman's Obelisk - it was about the middle of Farringdon-street; I heard of the robbery, and told the officer; he advised me to go to Guildhall, and I went and gave it up.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were you at the skittle-ground that night? A. No.</p>

             EGLETON. I am an officer. I produce the watch, seal, and guard; I received them at Guildhall, in presence of Frier - he gave it up at Guildhall; I heard in the morning a man had found a watch - I sent our patrols to find him out, which they did, and he brought the watch to Guildhall.</p>

            . I am going on for fifteen years of age - I have been a pot-boy thirteen months; I was pot-boy at the skittle-ground when the prosecutor says he was robbed of his watch - Mrs. Marks keeps the house; I saw the prosecutor on the night in question - he was very tipsy, laying on the seat, and he sicked all over the ground - I asked him what he would pay me for cleaning the place up; he said he would pay nothing - he was sober enough to speak; he was sitting down on the stool - I afterwards cleaned the place; I got nothing for cleaning it; there were about a dozen men there, playing at skittles - I saw the prosecutor's brother there; he complained that his brother had been robbed of his coat; he went and fetched mistress, for he said he would see the long and short about the coat, for he had lost it in the ground - I remember the prosecutor coming to the bar about his watch - he ran outside the door; he said he had lost his watch outside the door - I am sure he said it was lost outside the door; he said he lost it on the left hand side of the door, and that is the side going into the street.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to say he used the word"left side," what did he say? A. He ran out of the yard, and said he had lost the watch outside the door, he did not say he had lost it in the skittle-ground - he said he had lost it outside the door - the skittle-ground is not outside the door - there is a door from the house to the skittle-ground; the skittle-ground is outside that door; he said outside the door in the street in Fleet-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say in the street? A. He said, "outside the door;" he did not say on which side of the door he lost it; he told mistress he had lost it outside the door - I saw him run out into the street; three more besides him ran out of the house into the street, at the same time as he did - I was out of the yard myself, and saw them run down the street; three besides me ran out, I made the fourth - they were strangers to me; I never saw the prisoner in the house above two or three times; he is no acquaintance or friend of mine - I saw the prosecutor at mistress's house to-day; he came about twelve o'clock; four persons were with him; he was going to play at skittles, and mistress would not let him - I saw him play; mistress came and took the ball away from him.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Have you been questioned on this matter before to-day? A. No, not by any body; this is the first time I have given any account of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you not been questioned by the prisoner's attorney? A. Yes; to day; and by my mistress.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did the attorney say more to you than to tell the truth? A. No; I told him what I have stated - he wrote it down.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did he ask if you had heard the prosecutor say he had lost his watch outside? A. Yes; I do not recollect what passed between us.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear the prosecutor cry "Stop him, he has taken my watch?" A. Yes; I saw three run out.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did not you see the prisoner rush out of the house through the bar? A. Yes, he ran out first.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did two men run along with him? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How did they run along with him? A. They ran along Farringdon-street with him - I saw Jackson running after the prisoner; the prisoner was running hard; I did not see him caught; I saw the man who drank with Jackson at the bar; he did not run out at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the third man that ran out? A. There was another went out, I do not know who he was - he ran up towards Ludgate-hill; he ran into Farringdon-street down to the corner of the lane - I think the third man kept up with the others - he got to the top of the street by Waithman's monument - I could see as far as that; it was about half-past eight o'clock - I ran to the Fleet, which is about six yards from the monument - I did not see the prisoner stopped - I never knew it till he was in the watch-house; the companion who was with him is a young man who goes with him, and deals at Powell's hardware shop - he was not the third man that ran out.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you know the third man? A. No; I had not seen him before, and should not know him again; he was a stranger - he had played two or three games at skittles; he was short and stout, I think- I do not know how he was dressed.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Where were you when the prisoner ran out?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050006"/>A. Inside the door in the passage - he ran past me; I saw nothing in his hand - he ran very fast; Murrell called out immediately that he had lost his watch, and ran out.</p>
               <p>MRS. MARKS. I am landlady of the Red Lion. I remember the night the gentleman lost his watch - I saw both the gentlemen there that night - the prosecutor was so drunk that he could not stand; I saw him laying on the bench in the skittle-ground - I did not see him sick; I saw marks that somebody had been sick - he came to the bar and said he had lost his watch outside the door; he was standing outside the door; leaning against the door.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to say he said he was standing outside? A. He said he was leaning against the back of the door, on the threshold of the door, and the man gave him a knock on his stomach, and took his watch out; and he hallooed out to his brother, to run after him, for he had stolen his watch - he said the man snatched his watch, and ran off.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he show you the way he was standing? A. Yes (leaning herself back.)</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure he said he was standing at the door? A. Yes, I am quite sure - I have not witnesses to prove it, but there were two - he showed me the way he was standing, and he said I was standing here, and pointed to the door, and he was at that time standing at the street-door, but this was an hour after it took place; he said, "I was standing here," and he was at that time leaning against the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he standing at the time he spoke to you? A. On the threshold of my bar-door in Fleet-lane; that is the street-door - he said he was standing at the door - I am sure he told me that he had been robbed at the street-door - this was an hour, or an hour and a half after the alleged robbery took place; he had at that time in a degree recovered his sobriety - he came to my house to-day; I saw him; he came with some policemen; and they had the ball, and they wanted to play at skittles; I said they were not to play; the boy said he was not playing; I went out, and he was playing; I took the ball from him, and told him I would throw it at his head, for I had had enough of him - I was not in court when the other witness was examined.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where were you standing when the alarm was first given of the robbery? A. In the cellar below; I came up directly - I saw no one but the friend of the man who had lost his watch apparently; they were all gone when I came up - the prosecutor was standing in the lane so tipsy he could not run himself - he was standing in Fleet-lane - I have kept the house fourteen months - I had never seen the prisoner at my house - I don't know him now - when the prosecutor's brother-in-law complained that the coat was missing, he was laying on it on the bench (the man himself was) they came to me and said if it was not found we should hear more of it, and when I came in he was laying on it on the bench in the skittle-ground; I told them if they could not agree, they had better give up the ball.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, when Murrell lost his watch, give us the exact words he used? A. He said, "I was standing against the door, the man came and gave me a punch on the stomach and snatched my watch, and I directly called to my brother, who was drinking, to run after him, for he had stolen my watch;" he said nothing more - he did not describe the person who had taken his watch.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the prisoner in the habit of frequenting your house to play at skittles? A. No, I don't know him- I never saw him before to my knowledge; I did not see him on the night in question playing in the skittle-ground - the pursuit was directly on the alarm - I never saw the prosecutor before, and never saw him since till to-day.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you threaten to throw the ball at his head to-day - why drive a customer away? A. Because Jackson came with a friend and said, if I did not make good the value of the watch, he would get my license stopped on licensing day - I did not know the man, nor encourage him to steal it - there was nobody left in the skittle-ground when I came up from the cellar - by the prosecutor's brother coming about the watch, I have had an opportunity of knowing him - I don't know the prisoner - a great many hawkers come to my house, as they come to Field-lane to purchase goods.</p>

            . Q. Was the prisoner in the habit of frequenting your mistress' house, have you seen him before playing at skittles two or three times? A. Not playing at skittles; he comes into the house of a morning and has half a pint of beer; I have seen him repeatedly there; I have not seen him there frequently before this occurrence of the watch - I have seen him several times.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many times? A. About twice - he has been there about an hour and a half at a time - he did not go to the bar to get what he wanted at those times he was playing at skittles - I take them what they want into the skittle-ground - the door leads into the yard, and the yard to the skittle-ground; you walk through the house, through the bar, into the yard to the skittle-ground- the coat was found on the seat where the prosecutor was laying, under him; his brother-in-law complained of his brother losing his coat - I was in court part of the time that Mrs. Marks was examined - I did not see Jackson at the bar drinking - the young girl was serving in the bar when the cry of "Stop him" was given - my mistress was down in the cellar - I was not in the bar; I could see the young girl at the bar from the passage.</p>

On the 14th of August, I saw the prisoners in company with another person, in Lower Regent-street, a little before nine o'clock, in the Quadrant - I followed them into Coventry-street, and laid hold of Pickard; the other two walked away; they were all three together - when I laid hold of Pickard, I asked him what he had got there; he said, "a suit of clothes;" seeing some silk handkerchiefs, I took him to the station-house, and untied the bundle and found a piece of seven handkerchiefs, and a child's dress, tied in a black apron - I have had them ever since; I called Stone to lay hold of the other two, but one ran away.</p>

             re-examined. This is my piece of handkerchiefs; it is marked i.a. all the way through; I marked it myself - I might have thirty or forty pieces in the window that day; I cannot say the exact number, our stock is too large - I merely take an account of what money I take, not of every piece of goods sold - we never sell goods without putting them in paper, and this was found without any paper on it - we do not take off the marks when we sell; we had not sold a piece of handkerchief that day, because we enter in a book what is sold; we take an account of what money we take - we do not enter every article we sell; we should put down, "goods £5." if it was a lot; but if it was merely one thing, we put down what it is, but such a thing as this we should have recollected - if that piece of handkerchief had been sold with other articles to one customer, I should have entered them as goods; but we should have recollected it, if I had sold one whole piece - when a large parcel is sold, I generally require the young men to mention what they consisted of, and we had not sold one piece that day - when we sell a parcel the bill is made out, the money brought to me, and I always read over what is sold, and take the money, and give change, and such a thing as that did not occur that day - I do not recollect any piece of handkerchiefs being sold, but if it was sold with other goods, it would not have been entered in the book.</p>
               <p>Pickard's Defence. At the top of Coventry-street, by the stages, a man asked me to carry the parcel to Turnstile, and he would give me 6d.; the policeman took me, and dragged me along; I told him the man who gave it me had gone, and he would not look after him, and then the man ran directly.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. HEBDEN. Q. Would it not require an instrument to cut the window? A. It seemed to be starred, as if forced with a blunt instrument in three or four places, and the glass was either cut or broken in the direction of those stars - the corner of the square was taken out.</p>

            . I was passing the house at the time the first pistol was fired, and in an instant afterwards I saw a young woman in great distress, crying out that her sister was shot, and she appeared greatly agitated - I immediately opened the gate, and took her to the opposite house, ran back, and assisted in getting the prosecutrix off the ground; she was laying on her back; I took her to the same house as her sister was at, and medical assistance was sent for; I stood by while her wounds were dressed, and I saw this ball taken out of her neck.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the prisoner afterwards? A. Yes; as soon as the prosecutrix's wounds were dressed, I returned to the house, and saw him surrounded by persons who had just taken him - his face was discoloured from the explosion of the pistol from gunpowder, and it was bleeding very much, he had shot himself, evidently.</p>

On the evening of the 28th of June, Sarah Parry was brought to the hospital; the index finger of her left hand was shot off, and there was a wound on the left side of her neck; it was such a wound as a pistol shot would produce - the ball had been extracted before I saw her - I was obliged to take off the remainder of the finger; it was very much shattered indeed - the wound in the neck was a small wound in the centre, rather behind, it had penetrated about three inches; she was in danger for some time - the prisoner was brought to the hospital about an hour afterwards; he appeared to have been wounded with a pistol on the left cheek, just by the angle of the eye, and on the upper lip; the shot had passed from one to the other, there was a communication between the wounds.</p>

            . I was at the Gun with Jennings, on the night in question; we had some liquor there - she was rather the worse for liquor, and so was I; I saw the prisoner in the house - he is the man; he put his arm on her neck, and played with the lock of her beads; I asked her to give me the beads, and I would take care of them until she got home; because I thought I was more sober than she was - I went out before her, and was on a few yards before her; I turned round, and saw her down on the ground - nobody was near her then, because the prisoner had then ran away; I saw the prisoner, because I hallooed out "Stop thief" after him.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was him? A. He was against her when they came out of the public-house - he was close to her; and when I saw her on the ground, I saw him running away; it was about twelve o'clock - I hallooed out "Stop thief" after him, and ran after him; he turned round Austin-street, and I lost sight of him - I went to the station-house the same night, and saw him, and was certain it was the same man; I have not a doubt about him.</p>

            . On the 9th of May, 1832, I apprehended Wright in the Old Jewry for stealing a coat; he was convicted in this Court at the following Sessions - I have the certificate of his conviction, (read) the prisoner is the person who was tried and convicted.</p>
               <p>Wright's Defence (written). On the 15th of last July, I came to town from Woolwich, where I was residing with my mother, in consequence of being out of employ; about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, I was proceeding down Essex-street, Whitechapel; I saw two young men pass me in great haste; within about fifty yards of thent, I saw a person making an uncouth noise, and was running after the young men; when he came towards me some one came behind him and knocked him down; when he got up, I saw a watch and appendages lying in the kennel; I stepped off the pavement, with the intention of picking it up, to give it to the prosecutor, when two men (to all appearance labourers) procured it and gave it him; when he had it, he proceeded towards Whitechapel, in the direction after the young men who ran away. I did not know at the time exactly what had happened, and followed him to ascertain; when he stopped a mob collected round him, I joined them and inquired of him what had happened, when he replied, the two young men he was following had robbed him of a watch; I then told him I did not think he had lost a watch, as two men had picked one up, and gave it him; he then stated he had two watches in the same pocket and had lost one; I conversed with him, persuading him what to do, nearly twenty minutes; during the time two policemen came up, and inquired into it; he never at the time accused me of being a party concerned: he then went with them to the station-house, and gave information of the robbery; about two hours after three policemen, with the prosecutor, came down the street where I was residing with my sister; I was standing at the door, they all looked at me; the policeman put some question to him, to which he shook his head, and passed on; afterwards I had my tea, and cleaned myself, with the intention of returning to Woolwich. I was sitting in the front parlour, when the policeman Conolly called, and said he wanted me; I asked him what he wanted; he replied, on suspicion of highway robbery; I stated I was entirely innocent of the charge; he asked me several questions going to the station-house; I told him, I knew nothing of the transaction, and for him not to bother me with questions; I added, it was a pity that the innocent should suffer for the guilty. There was a person whom I did not know taken at the same time with me; when locked up in the station-house the aforesaid person said to me, "Young man you are entirely innocent of the charge, and should we go before a magistrate, I will tell him so;" he called the policeman, and made a communication, which I did not hear; the policeman replied, "He'll be here by and by," but to whom he alluded I did not know; about eight o'clock in the evening the prisoner Reynolds was brought in; we were then placed together for the prosecutor to recognize us; he then swore to the prisoner Reynolds as the person who robbed him, and me as the person who shoved against him, we were then locked up in the station-house cell, with some other prisoners, when a person (which afterwards proved to be the witness, Kent) came with two policemen and said he could identify the persons who committed the robbery; at eleven o'clock at night we were taken out for him to view us, when he positively stated that we were not the persons who committed the robbery; next morning we were examined before Mr. Broughton, at Worship-street, when the prosecutor swore to the statement he made above; the policeman Conolly begged for our being remanded, as he stated he could prove our being the parties; we where then remanded till the 20th of July, when the witness Kent (being on oath) swore positively I was not one of the party, of which there is proof in the depositions. We were again remanded till the 27th, when the magistrate was going to commit us, but being reminded of the depositions of the witness Kent, he again remanded us till the 30th, when he took the witness Kent's depositions down again, in which he flatly contradicted his former statement, swearing to me as the person who took the watch, and Reynolds as the person who shoved against the prosecutor: when they told him to beware of what he stated, as he had stated quite different on a previous examination, we were then remanded till the 3rd of August, when we were fully committed to Newgate. Mr. Broughton, the magistrate, remarked, he should be most happy to discharge us, as he believed us to be innocent, but under the peculiar circumstances he deemed it his duty to send it before a Jury. I beg most solemnly to assure you, I am entirely innocent of the charge laid against me, and beg to call your attention to the fact of the prosecutor seeing me several times, and not recognizing me as a party concerned; the witness Kent twice positively stating I was not one of the party. Were I guilty it is not probable I should have remained about the spot where the robbery was committed, but would naturally have endeavoured to conceal myself, or have left the quarter where I was residing. I now humbly leave my case to your serious consideration, trusting the importance of the case will induce you to ponder well 'ere you return your verdict. Solemnly asserting my innocence, I appeal to the well-known justice and humanity of a British Jury.</p>

             re-examined. I was not there when Kent was first brought to the station-house.</p>
               <p>Reynolds' Defence (written). On the 15th of July, the day that the robbery was committed, I was at work until five o'clock in the afternoon; about seven o'clock the same evening I went to see a friend of mine, and after I had been there about half an hour, a policeman knocked at the door of the room that I was in, and said that I was his prisoner; I was surprised and asked him upon what charge? he, the policeman said, for stealing a watch; I denied the charge, but he took me to the station-house. When I arrived at the station-house, I saw two other men which I learned were there for the same robbery that I was charged with. The next morning, the 16th instant, I was taken to Worship-street office, the prosecutor came and said that I was the man that robbed him, I was then remanded. On Saturday, the 20th instant, I was again placed at the office, and was again remanded until the 27th instant; I was taken to the office, and a man came and swore that neither me nor my fellow-prisoner were the men who had robbed him, meaning the prosecutor. He, the witness, said that he should know the men, if he was to see them: we were again remanded until the following Tuesday, the 30th instant, I again was placed at the bar, and the witness swore that my fellow-prisoner Wright was the man that robbed him; at the same time the prosecutor swore that I was the man.</p>

               <p>Reynolds. That gentleman was not present before three examinations passed - he came down to the cell, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050013"/>said that for 3l. 10s. he would put the prosecution on one side, and Conelly said he was quite angry with him for talking to the prisoners - he came to us several times; he said he was a man of the world, and had a son and daughter transported himself, and knew the business perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Wright. I only had the use of one hand, and was not able to attack anybody.</p>

In consequence of information which I received on Sunday morning, the 21st of April, I went down stairs, about five o'clock, and found my private door wide open, and my shopdoor was forced open - the goods in the shop were scattered in all directions; many silk rollers were lying about; the silks had been taken off them - I missed from twenty to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050014"/>thirty pieces of silk - I missed two wrappers of shawls, worth 60l. or 70l., and a whole box of lace, worth about 100l. or 140l.; the whole loss we estimate at 400l. and upwards - my desk in my shop was broken open; I lost nine papers of halfpence from that desk, containing 5s. worth each, and each paper was marked with a figure of 5s. - the iron chest in the shop was safe; there had been an attempt made on it certainly, but it had not succeeded - I found a chisel very near the iron chest, it did not belong to me, and a bunch of keys, which had been taken out of my desk; they were in the desk the night before - I have a cupboard in my breakfast parlour, and from that was taken twelve or fourteen silver spoons - I missed some cigars, and a variety of other things - I observed something very indecent had been transacted in the house - there was an imitation of a lighted cigar taken - I went into the kitchen, and found part of the pannel of the door cut out; the aperture enabled a person to put his hand through and undraw the bolt; the door was open - the pannel was cut out of the cellar-door, which was open, and a small window at the back of the house had the glass taken out, and the cross-bar and two squares of glass were taken out; a person could get through there into the house - I tried it myself - my house was safe when I went to bed - Willis's father keeps some stables at the back of my house; he goes by the name of Hutton there; these stables are about four or five hundred yards from the back of my house - I saw the chisel applied to the door by Attfield, it corresponded with the marks exactly - when Johnson was taken we found two chisels in his room, they were applied, and fitted exactly the impressions where the places were broken open; one chisel had a small piece broken out of the corner, and the space was wanted in almost every mark - Brock afterwards showed me a piece of silk, and Prendergrass produced a piece to me - I went into Newgate soon after Willis was taken into custody - it is about two months ago - I found the female prisoner in Newgate, and Willis too - the female prisoner had a light puce silk dress on; I considered the silk the dress was made of mine; I had one a similar colour, and a short length of it, and from the appearance of it I considered it mine.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 21st of April, I was called up about five o'clock, and went through the premises - I observed the place broken open, and the property removed - I afterwards went to the stables of Hutton (Willis's father) and could see there the traces of a cart or narrow wheeled chaise from Hutton's stables into the street, and pursuing the track of the wheels I found a piece of lace, which I believe to be Mr. Goodman's; there is a mark in pencil of the length of the lace; it is one of our shop marks, but not made by myself - I have seen Willis before at Uxbridge in company with his father, and believed him to be the son of that man.</p>

            . I am a groom. I was in the employ of Mr. Batty of Uxbridge - in April last, I slept in Mr. Hutton's stables - I know Willis; Hutton passed as his father - I was sleeping in the saddle-room on the night of the 20th of April; Mr. Hutton gave me leave to sleep there - I knew Johnson before; I never saw Johnson in Uxbridge before, but Willis had lived there with his father - while I was in the saddle-room I saw Willis, he awoke me by tapping at the saddle-room window, he asked me where the keys of the gates were, I said they hung up on a nail near the door; Willis then came in and said,"Johnson has come down, and we have brought a horse and cart;" I said, "Have you?" he said, "Yes;" and they brought the horse and cart into the yard, turned the horse out, and brought the horse into the stable; there was only one horse in the cart; I don't exactly know what sort of a cart it was; it was a light cart; there had been no other cart up the yard that morning, not to my knowledge - Johnson and he both came in the stables; Willis instantly got a light, he got it in about a moment; I don't know how he got it, he got it from something he brought with him; there was no tinder-box there - Johnson lit his pipe, and Willis told me in Johnson's hearing, that they were going to crack a bl-y crib - I don't know what that meant, but fancy it meant to break into a house - Willis fed the horse with oats - they went away in about twenty minutes - I cannot say at what hour I was awoke, I had not a watch, but imagine it was near four o'clock when they went away; they came at near one o'clock I suppose - they came back, I did not see whether they brought anything with them - when they went away about four o'clock, they took the horse out of the stables, put it in the cart, and went away - I was in bed, but I could hear them do that; and about half-past five o'clock I heard of Mr. Goodman's house being robbed - the constable came down into the yard about five o'clock; I got up, and dressed myself - I saw nothing found - I did not see the prisoners when they came back; but I heard them stirring about, as if in a great hurry - the horse, according to what I could see as I lay in bed, was a chesnut horse, about 14 hands, 2 inches, as near as I can guess.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You were lying in bed, and the horse in the yard? A. No, the horse was in the stables; there was no stall in the stables, he was standing by a rail - I thought it was a dark chesnut; almost a brown - I did not understand what they meant<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050015"/>when they said they were going to break a b-y crib - I rather judged it was to break into somebody's house - I have had nothing to do in that way myself - I remember living in Northumberland - I was never charged with robbing any body there - I did not live at a public-house - I was never charged with robbing my master, nor any body else - I was never taken into custody till I was taken on this, and then I could not find bail - I was fetched from Cambridge by Mr. Goodman and an officer - I was taken into custody then, and brought on this charge; I told this story after that; I had not told a word about it before I was taken into custody; I never told it, except to one man, named Maddox - he is not a particular friend of mine; he was a friend, and he was not; he lived with Mr. Hutton at that time - he lets out flys, and horses, and gigs - I know where Mr. Goodman lived - I heard of the robbery about half-past five o'clock - I went to Cambridge soon after Epsom races, about two months after the robbery; I staid at Uxbridge until Epsom races, that was about three weeks - I knew where the prosecutor lived, but did not give an alarm; I might have got 20l. if I had gone near him, but I had no hand in it, and did not wish to make a disturbance; there was 20l. reward offered; it is not offered still that I know off; I have not the least notion of getting any part of it now - I was out of place when I left Uxbridge; I went to Epsom, and got a place with an old master who I had lived nine years with, and staid with him till Mr. Goodman fetched me away; I went with my old master to Cambridge; his name is Edwards, he is a gentleman jockey - I did not bring seventy sovereigns from Epsom; my pockets were very clear when I returned from Epsom; I did not show any body seventy sovereigns, and say I had made a good thing of it there, nor did I show any money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Is there not a reward still offered for the robbery? A. I don't know; I know there was a reward before I left Uxbridge, and I suppose it will remain - I don't expect to get any portion of it; I never said I had made a good job or good thing at Uxbridge; I remember being at the Ben Johnson, in Shoe-lane - I never said there that I had made a good thing at Uxbridge, and had been to Epsom races; I made nothing at Uxbridge but what I earned by hard work; I worked for Mr. Batty, that was the only thing I made money by there; I was never charged with robbery at Newcastle; I lived with Lord Kelburn in Scotland - I was never charged with committing robbery there; I know a man named George - I did not go with him to Scotland, I went with him to Yorkshire; I was never charged with robbing his mother - I don't know whether he was; I never knew George charged with robbery while I was with him; there are several George's - none of them were charged with robbery while I was with them; I saw the tracks of the wheels, there were two tracks; I looked at them in the morning, as a good many people were looking at them; the cart was in the yard, and I was in the stable in bed; I could not see the cart from my bed - I saw it once - I stood by the stable door then; I was in bed before they came with the cart; I got up to shut the gates, and saw them going out, they had not got quite out; there were only two tracks on the ground; the cart only had two wheels - I saw the prisoners plainer than I saw the horse.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. It has been said you said nothing about this, what was your reason? A. Because I was rather under obligations to Hutton; not being in regular service, he gave me leave to sleep in the saddle room, I did not wish to make any disturbance, as I had no hand in the robbery, I thought they would find it out soon enough - I mean that I saw only the marks of two cart wheels.</p>

Willis and the female prisoner lodged in my house as man and wife; they lodged with me six or seven weeks; on Sunday, the 21st of April, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, I heard a horse and cart drive up to my door; I took my little boy and went to my door, and saw Willis and Johnson in the cart; Willis got out and went up stairs, and left Johnson in the cart; I saw Willis come down, and Johnson handed him a large parcel, wrapped in brown wrapper; Willis took it up stairs, came down and took a second parcel; he took them from out of the underneath part of the cart below the seat; I walked away into my back parlour, and heard one of the prisoners go up stairs twice; I returned again to the door, and Johnson said to Willis, "I think that is all;" he said "No, there is a small parcel," which he gave to Willis who went up stairs; it appeared to me to be five shilling papers of coppers tied up; I walked away from the door; they both went up to the room, and in five or ten minutes Willis came down, and drove away with the horse and cart; the horse appeared to be driven very hard, and it was very hot; Willis returned in ten or twelve minutes and knocked at my back parlour door, and paid his rent with five shillings worth of copper; his rent was 3s. 6d.; I asked him to take the change; he said, his wife should come down and take it; there was a figure of five on the brown paper; I untied the parcel of halfpence, and put the eighteen pence out; the female prisoner came down and fetched it; Johnson dined with them that day, and stopped all day until towards evening; I am not a judge of horses, but it appeared a chesnut horse, with a white face and white foot.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you know that he came to your house from Tooting, where they lived before? A. No; I don't know where they lived, but they told me they came from Uxbridge; the halfpence were tied in a handkerchief, but it appeared papers of copper; I looked at the paper they paid me, that had a figure of five on it - I looked particularly at it; that was all that was on it I am sure; it is very common to make halfpence up in five shilling parcels; they saw me standing at the door, and must have known that I saw what they were doing; they continued to lodge in my house for four or five weeks after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Have you ever said you would do all you could to convict the prisoners? A. Not to the best of my knowledge; it is possible I might have forgotten saying such a thing; I did not say I should like to hang the whole lot - on my oath, I did not; I never said anything at all like it - I will take my oath to the best of my knowledge, that I never said I would do all I could to convict the prisoners; I can only swear to the best of my knowledge; if I ever said so respecting any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050016"/>one of them, I have forgotten it - I don't recollect it; I believe I never did - I never had any quarrel with them.</p>

            . I am the wife of Joseph Jessup; Willis and the female prisoner lodged at our house; I remember Willis and Johnson coming to the house on the morning of the 21st of April, in a little chaise cart; it had a lightish horse; I saw them take two or three large parcels out of the cart, wrapped in brown wrappers - I saw nothing else taken out; they owed us one week's rent - I had not asked for it; it was only due on the Saturday; Willis brought the five shilling paper of halfpence to the back parlour door, wrapped in a brown paper, and it was marked with a figure of five, with a long mark after it; I burnt the paper; in about two or three hours the female prisoner brought me several little bits of lace down and gave to me - I gave them up to the officer; I am a dress maker; on the Wednesday, she brought me down two pieces of silk, a piece of puce-coloured silk measuring eight and a half yards, and a piece of lavender-coloured silk about forty yards; I made her a gown of the pucecoloured silk, and made a dress and bonnet of the lavender-coloured silk, and returned her the remainder; I think twenty-two or twenty-three yards were returned to her, because she cut two or three little pieces off herself to make a bag of; she gave me a yards and a half of the lavender-coloured silk afterwards; I made up nothing else for her; she never paid me money; I considered the pieces of lace sufficient to pay me for making the puce-coloured gown, and she gave me a yard and a-half of silk for making the lavender-coloured, and a little bit more; I saw in her possession a very handsome shawl, and four very handsome handkerchiefs; the shawl had a handsome green middle, with a reddish border - the handkerchiefs were French colour; I don't know what you call them; some of them were figured - I gave her a shilling for a scarf and made her a bonnet for it besides; all the things I had from her were delivered to the officer; I sold the yard and a half of silk to Mrs. Allen - I cut off a little bit to make it a yard and a half - On Saturday evening Willis and James went out together; nobody was with them; the woman returned about nine o'clock, as near as I can guess; she came and sat in my back parlour, and told me she had been as far as Charing-cross with her husband, and that he was gone to Uxbridge to fetch their things home; when they took my apartments, they said they came from Uxbridge - they said they had been lodging at Uxbridge; they brought nothing with them but what they had on their backs; Johnson was in the house all day on Sunday, and dined with them - I did not see any of the goods at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You always considered the woman Willis's wife? A. I did; I never knew otherwise; these transactions were all done while they were living together; I don't know the value of the scarf; here it is, it is a gauze one; soon after they came to lodge with me, I remember their getting some goods from a tally shop; I did not recommend them to the shop particularly; Mrs. Willis knew very well where the shop was; I went with her to the tally shop, and she procured some goods there; a tally shop is where you pay so much a week for goods; I did not advise them to go away and leave the tally man without paying for the goods; I had not a word with them about going away - I had no idea they were going away; I don't know what amount of goods they had from the tally shop - I don't know what the bill was; they had the goods from the tally shop about a week before they left.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. That was after the 21st of April? A. Yes; they had been but three weeks with me on the 21st of April.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Had they any goods from the tally shop before that Sunday? A. Not to my knowledge; I had not been with them to the tally shop before that.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Law, pawnbroker, No. 1, Commercial-road. On the 27th of April, Willis pawned eighty-four yards of silk at our shop for £4 10s., in the name of John Willis, No. 3, Charles-street; I took it in; I had seen him once or twice before, and am quite certain he is the person; on the Wednesday following, Woodman came to the shop and brought the same duplicate as I had given to Willis; and he(Woodman) took forty-two yards of the silk, the remaining forty-two ramained in my custody; I have it here - I am certain this is part of the eighty-four yards Willis pawned at the shop.</p>

            . I am a jeweller, and live in French-alley, Goswell-street. I bought a duplicate of Willis; I gave him 1l. for it - it was for eighty-four yards of silk, pawned at Law's, at the corner of the Commercial-road - I went there, and took half the silk off, and left half there; I sold the half, and pawned the half which I left for 2l. 10s.; that produced appears to be the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How long have you known Willis? A. About sixteen months - I have seen him at sales, and have been with him at sales, and have seen him buy silks and things at sales - I always considered him a man who dealt in such things; I have seen Jessop several times - I went to Lambeth-street to give evidence, but was not called; and when I came outside the door, he stood there with his wife, and I presume his lodger - when I came out, he was abusing the reporters for not inserting the robbery in the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Jessop say he would do anything? A. When I came out, he said he should like to transport the whole lot, and he should not be particular what he said in order to do it - he said that in my hearing; my wife said, "Is that what you say? - you cannot transport me" - he said, "No; I know I cannot transport you."</p>

            . I am a police officer of Worship-street. On the 25th of June, I apprehended Johnson at No. 23, Harp-alley, Farringdon-street; I took him to the station-house, in Black Horse-court, and told him he was charged on suspicion of being concerned with others in breaking and entering the house of Mr. Goodman, at Uxbridge, and stealing a quantity of silk, plate, and other articles - he said he was never at Uxbridge in his life, and knew nothing about it; I asked if he knew a man named Willis, at No. 3, Charles-street, Commercial-road; he said he knew him perfectly well, and had been there a good many times - I found a phosphorus bottle in his pocket, which I produce; after finding that in his pocket, I went back to the house in Harp-alley with Mr. Goodman; and in a back room, on the second floor, in a table drawer, I found two chisels, and a bunch of keys; two of them are latch keys - when before the magistrate, at the office, the chisels were produced, he said they were his chisels; I took those chisels out of the same drawer as I found the keys in - on Thursday, the 27th of June, I went to Mr. Goodman's at Uxbridge, and examined the premises - I examined the inside of the cellar door, I observed a mark where the staple was drawn, and a mark about three inches under that; I applied this large chisel to the marks on the cellar door; it exactly fitted the indentations - one corner of the chisel had been broken, and that corner was wanting in the impression, and there was a notch in the chisel which corresponded - I have not a doubt that chisel was used for that purpose - I observed the kitchen door had part of a pannel taken out, and there were two impressions there, which I applied the chisel to, and they corresponded - there was the deficiency in the corner of the chisel, in one of those impressions - on the shop door leading from the passage, there were two impressions, apparently of the same chisels, they fitted it; I observed impressions on the cupboard; I applied the smaller chisel to one of the impressions, and it corresponded in every respect, and the larger chisel corresponded with some of the impressions on the cupboard door as exact as possible, and on a cupboard, on the left hand side were impressions, and both chisels fitted them - a large desk, in the shop was broken open, on which I found ten impressions of the large chisel, several of them very clear, and one impression of the smaller chisel - Newman gave me a puce coloured gown, which I produce - on the 24th of June, I received a zephyr scarf from Mr. Jessop - I received a yard and a half of lavender coloured silk from Mrs. Allen.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM GOODMAN re-examined. I can identify many of these things, but can only positively swear to two of them - I lost such things as these; I have a scarf exactly corresponding with this in my pocket, and the silk has a mark on it; I bought it at Morrison's; this scarf I cannot swear to - this puce coloured gown, which the female prisoner had on, I can swear to, by an ink mark on it, which is the mark of my young man, who is present - I have pattern prints here, corresponding with all the silk and all the lace; I identify them positively, but have not a mark on them - I lost such things, and have corresponding things remaining behind, and I have marks on the other two.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. When you sell silk, you do not rub off the private mark? A. I cannot, it is in ink.</p>
               <p>VALENTINE BULLER re-examined. My mark is on this puce coloured gown, and this puce coloured silk was marked by me also - I can see the figures "84" - the other things resemble goods we lost - I believe them to be my master's property - this imitation cigar I cannot say any thing about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Let me look at the mark "84" - was this marked at your house, or the manufactory? A. At our house - the manufacturer charged it as 82 yards - I marked and measured it, and made it "84" - the manufacturer don't mark the length; I mark all the goods that is not a fashionable colour particularly; it is saleable - we only had this one piece of that colour; the gown is a different colour; we had eight yards and one-eighth of that, and that is the mark on it - it was a remnant; we had not sold it - we had had that some years, being a short length; it is about three years since we had the whole length - I had seen it a week or ten days before the robbery; one or two other persons served in the shop, besides my master - but the silk goods fall particularly under my department.</p>
               <p>MR. GOODMAN. I had such a cigar as this, and lost it.</p>

             (policeman G 174). On the night of the 1st of September, I was in Whitecross-street about eight o'clock, crossing Chiswell-street, I saw nine or twelve persons standing opposite; Martin the officer was with me - on my coming there they ran away, and I saw the prisoner on his knees, and the prosecutor lying on his back on the ground, and the prisoner by the side of him on his knees - the mob which dispersed had separated from the spot leaving the prisoner in view; they had previously been round him - I saw the prisoner draw his right hand from Allen's left hand trousers pocket, and the pocket came out with his hand, turning it inside out - he ran off; I ran after him and lost him in the crowd - I took the prosecutor to the station-house - when we first raised him up he was quite senseless, but before I got him to the station-house he got better and could walk alone - I knew the prisoner well before, and can swear to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What can you swear to me by, did you ever know me in trouble? A. By seeing you so often- have not I frequently ordered you off, and threatened to take you before the magistrate? I have seen you at different times with a gang of thieves.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. At the time the prisoner drew his hand from the prosecutor's pocket, was any other person about him? A. There was two, one of whom I could swear to if I met him - a portion of the crowd parted, leaving the prisoner with his hand in the prosecutor's pocket, and two others by the side of him, and they all three ran away - I swear the prisoner drew his hand from the prosecutor's pocket.</p>
               <p>JOHN ALLEN re-examined. When I stood at the bar of the Cat public-house, about fifty yards from the spot, I felt money in my pocket; I felt the silver in my pocket.</p>

             (policeman G 202). I was with Brooming. On the crowd dispersing, I saw the prisoner on the ground on his knees, and his hands very close to the prosecutor's pocket, which was turned inside out - I went in pursuit of the prisoner, and saw him about half an hour after at the corner of Banner-street; he appeared to be peeping round the corner as if on the lookout - I laid hold of him - he asked what I wanted of him- I said he knew very well - he said he had been in the fields all day; that was the first time he had been in Whitecross-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming down Banner-street with some pudding in my hand, and turned down Whitecross-street, and saw Martin and another officer with him; the other said, "Is this him" - he said "Yes" - I said,"What do you want with me" - he said, "Come to the station-house, and I will tell you" - but as to his catching hold of me it is false; it was not above a quarter past eight o'clock.</p>

            . The officer who was with me laid hold of him, because I thought if I had gone after him he would have ran away - I was rather behind the other man - he took hold of him and handed him to me - it was about half-past eight o'clock; he was eating pudding.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went with him to the station-house, and they said I had robbed Allen; I said I had never been there all day - I had been to Tottenham on the Sunday, and I had just come down Banner-street - I know nothing of the robbery.</p>
               <p>JOHN MARTIN. I swear he is the man who was kneeling by the prosecutor's side; I have not a doubt of it, I see him so many times every night, and have occasion to move him and a gang who follow with him - I cannot be mistaken in him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. If I had been concerned, I should not have come down right into their hands - it is false that he saw me at the bottom of the street; ke knows he did not see me in Whitecross-street all day, for I was not there all day until the time he took me to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>JURY to JOHN ALLEN. Q. Where was your money? A. The silver was in my waistcoat pocket, and the coppers in my right hand trousers pocket; I lost every thing but 2s.</p>

The prisoner lodged in the same house with me, but in a different room; he is a married man; it is Mr. John West's house; West also lives in the house - about eight o'clock on Tuesday evening, the 6th of August, there was a disturbance in the house; the prisoner was making a disturbance in his own room - I went up stairs and went into West's room and spoke to him, and then went towards the prisoner's room, and told him it was Mr. West's desire that he should be quiet or leave the house; he was then standing in his own room doorway - I was in the passage and he in the doorway - after telling him that, he said, "What do you say?" and stepped back into his room; I followed him in about a yard into his own room, and repeated the same words as I did in the passage - he had a knife in his hand; at first he seemed to be eating - when I went into the room, he changed the position of the knife; he had it at first in this manner (holding it as usual) - he then changed the position so (turning the blade downwards), and plunged it into my left breast; I had not touched him, nor said anything more than I have stated - on feeling myself wounded, I went down stairs, and asked the landlady to send for a surgeon, and we sent for Mr. Farrell; I bled a good deal; the wound was rather more than an inch deep; I had never had any quarrel with him at any time - before he gave me the stab, he said something about that he would put me out, that was at the time he was striking; he had not desired me to leave the room before that, nor said anything to me except at the time he was striking - he said he would put me out - I had my coat and waistcoat on; it cut through the coat, but it was outside the waistcoat; it went through the coat and shirt at the armhole of the waistcoat; it was a knife similar to this (a dinner knife) - my coat was taken off; the officer has had it since - my face was towards him the whole time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you anything to Mr. West? A. No, I do not know that West and the prisoner had had any disagreement that morning; they might have had; I was not a joint lodger with the prisoner; I thought it was my duty and an act of kindness towards the old man, the landlord, to remonstrate with the prisoner to be quiet - he was using abusive language towards the landlord; he was in his own room, the landlord was not in his room - the prisoner seemed angry, and as if he had drank a little; he had given me no offence - I was inside his room, when he said he would put me out; I never had the least quarrel with him at any time; he was not sitting down at the table - I did not notice whether any food was on the table; his mouth was in motion as if he was eating; the knife he had was one which he might use to cut his food - I had known him about three months; he had no ill feeling towards me - I told him the landlord desired him to be quiet; he said in the passage,"What did you say?" I stepped in after him, and repeated the same words - I think the landlord was afraid to go in and speak to him; I do not know that it was because the prisoner was so much excited, that he was afraid to go in; West is not here, he is very unwell; he wished me to advise the prisoner to be quiet - the prisoner has one child; his wife was in the room at the time, and the child.</p>

             asked me to fight (I had never seen him before) - I would not fight, and when I went to go out of the street, the other man knocked me down - I do not know the man who knocked me down, I only know Doyle - I do not know whether the one who knocked me down was in company with the other - after they knocked me down, they took three half-crowns, three shillings, and a sixpence out of my left hand coat pocket - I cannot say who took it; I had 1s. 6d. in my right hand pocket, they did not take that - Nelling saw it all; I have been in London five months - both the men ran away after taking my money; and a little while afterwards I went after a policeman, and he took Doyle the same night; they struck me in the face and ear when they knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not there a regular fight between you and one of the men? A. No; I was not abusing the King - I did not d-n the King of England; I did not say that the King was married to a German lady, and that the Germans had a right to do what they liked in England; that was not the way the battle began - I will swear I said nothing about the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050021"/>King nor the Queen either - I had been with the girl in a public-house, in Plough-court, before the row began - I had not been drinking, only dancing; the room was full of people - there were plenty of people in the street when the fight was going on.</p>

             (through an interpreter). I was at the public-house with the prosecutor on a Saturday in August - I do not know the day of the month; I left the public-house with him, and as soon as we came into Essex-street, Mahony asked him to fight - there were four of them together; the prosecutor did not say any thing to them before they asked him to fight - one of them knocked him down; he got up and told me somebody had taken his money; I did not see it taken; I had seen him shortly before with 11s. and 1s. 6d. - as soon as they knocked him down they ran away - I did not see them do any thing; I went down Whitechapel to look for a policeman; I can tell the person of any of the men except the one who knocked him down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you understand English? A. I speak it a little; Bender understands a few words; he told the English in the German language that he would not fight - I have known him two years; I knew him over in my own country - he was paying for drink at the public-house when I saw the money; there was a good many there who he asked to drink, I had some, and Bender took a little - there was a few words before he was knocked down, but not about the King and Queen - when the prisoner knocked him down he said, "A German b-r, why don't you go over to your own country?" Bender heard that; it was said in English; Bender made no answer to it.</p>

I was on duty on this Saturday in Essex-street, Whitechapel; I don't recollect the day of the month - I was not present when this took place; I met one of our policemen with a young man, in consequence of what they said, I went into the Rose and Crown, Essex-street; I saw Doyle there, but the man who went with me did not know him; I came out to go to the place where the prosecutor was knocked down, and Doyle followed us to the place; I received information from a person who was standing by, and I asked Bender if that was one of them, he turned round and said it was; Doyle heard that, and said he knew nothing of it - I took him into custody, searched him, found nothing on him at all - I apprehended Mahony on the Monday following; I found nothing on him but 3d. and a duplicate; I knew both the prisoners very well, I had seen them on the Saturday before the robbery two or three times, they were at the Rose and Crown in Essex-street together, about eleven o'clock that evening, but I can't say whether they were in company.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. I was in Catherine Wheel-court, Essex-street, at eleven o'clock - my wife was there; there were three of us there - I saw the prosecutor there with two females dressed in the foreign fashion - I saw Mahony there - I did not hear Bender say any thing about King William - I saw Mahony and Bender talking together, but did not understand what they said - I was passing out of the court into Essex-street, and did not notice - I did not know what language they talked - I saw the prosecutor go into Essex-street, Mahony followed and put himself in an attitude of sparring, and while I stood there the other prisoner came up, and knocked the prosecutor down - I am positive it was not Mahony that knocked him down - I heard the other prisoner say, he could knock him down if anybody else could not - I believe that was in reply to something that passed in the court - the prosecutor was not down a second before he ran into Whitechapel.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You say the prosecutor was not down a moment? A. No, not before he recovered himself and ran into Whitechapel, and I pursued him leaving the prisoner Mahony with his wife - I was near him when he was knocked down - neither of the prisoners were near him when he was down, they were across the street; Mahony was talking to his wife - there was a lamp, but not exactly close to it - I swear nobody touched him when he was down; I was close enough to be certain neither of them were near him after he was down.</p>

            . I am son of Peter Grant, and live in my father's house in the parish of Acton. On the morning of the 12th of August, about one o'clock, I was awoke by somebody opening my bed room door; I laid perfectly quiet for a short time, to see what he would do, and in a few seconds a person came in contact with my bed curtains; I immediately started up and cried out "Who is there?" upon which the person ran down stairs; I immediately jumped out of bed to follow him, when to my surprise, I heard him pull open the hall door and go out, and hearing that, I then ran to the window overlooking the front court, and saw a person scale the iron gate in front of the house, and disappear on the other side; the police having answered my first call, by this time ran up; I went down stairs and found the prisoner lying perfectly stunned, in the road at the foot of the gate; the gate is about nine feet high, but it is lower on the road side; he must have fallen about fifteen feet; he was taken in custody; I went round the premises with a servant, and found one of the kitchen windows open, and the dresser drawer immediately below the window had been opened, and the contents strewed about, but nothing taken away; a purse containing 3s. 6d. was left untouched, belonging to one of the servants; there was a pocket book on the dresser I believe, but I did not see it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do you hold the house jointly with your father? A. No; I am on leave of absence from my regiment, and visiting at my father's.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Grant's service; I cannot positively say I fastened the house the night before, but to the best of my knowledge, every thing was fastened; the kitchen window which was found open, was shut when I went to bed, to the best of my knowledge; but I really cannot say; there is no catch to the window, so that it might easily be pushed up; I went into the kitchen before I went to bed; I usually go there the last thing, and fasten the back door - that was about half-past ten o'clock; I went into the kitchen to see that all was fast, and to the best of my knowledge, the window was shut; I went round the house after the alarm, and found the window open wide enough for a person to get in; there are iron bars, but it is wide enough for a young person to get through; I found no other way in which he could have got in - the back door, and all was fast.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many servants are there? A. Three maid-servants and myself; it is usual to open the window at night to cool the kitchen, and it has frequently been left open all night; I could not swear positively that it was closed that night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know anything of a pocket book? A. It is a memorandum book which the cook uses; I saw it laying on the dresser - I don't know where it was the night before; it is very possible I might not have noticed whether the window was open; I went into the back kitchen to see whether all was safe, and I saw that all was safe - I have no doubt at all but the window was shut, but I cannot swear whether it was shut or not - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050023"/>might be deceived; I went to see that all was safe, and I have no doubt I did see all safe.</p>

            . I am a policeman. On the 10th of August, I heard the cry of police; I was about thirty yards distant, and as I ran, I heard something fall, but could not see what it was, it was so dark; when I came to the prosecutor's gate, I found the prisoner laying there quite senseless; I took him into custody.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am perfectly innocent of getting into the house; I went down to Acton to see a few friends - I had been there with Lady Byron, and I am acquainted with several people in the town; I stopped there with them playing at skittles till after twelve o'clock at night, (Mr. Grant inquired of my character and found I was tipsy,) they asked me if I was capable of going home by myself, as they had no bed for me to sleep in; they left me, and I know nothing more, till I found myself in the station-house; they asked me if I knew what had happened; I said, "No;" they asked how I came in Mr. Grant's house, I said, "I have not been there;" the policeman said somebody had been there, at all events; Mr. Grant has inquired of my character, and knows I was with the people that day; the policeman said he could not tell whether I was drunk or not - that I might be laying there drunk for what he knew; nobody came up in time to see me fall, if it was me.</p>

By seeing him walk up and down by the Docks - I mentioned this when Pedley was tried; I stated it to Lee, the officer, near twelve months ago; I was taken up for it, and was in custody ten weeks, and came from gaol to give evidence against Pedley - Ellis put the property into the cart himself - I was up in the cart all the time - I was not present when Ellis was examined, some time ago - I heard nothing of it - I was taken up nearly twelve months ago - I might know Ellis before by passing backwards and forwards about the Dock - I am positive of his person.</p>

             re-examined. On the same day as the packages were delivered I sent a small case to be sent by a van, from Blossoms-inn, and the invoice of these goods was inclosed in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never absconded since I was apprehended before, and acquitted - this man says, Wall was in the robbery - he knows himself he has seen that man several times, and he knows him to be innocent; he took him for another man - I have worked at the West India Docks ever since April - Robinson has been transported for seven years himself; he received 15s. from Pedley; Pedley told me so himself.</p>
               <p>JOHN ROBINSON. I received the money from the prisoner himself - I was transported twenty-one years ago.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How long have you known the prisoner before the transaction? A. I might have known him about twelve months - I know him perfectly well - I used to see him walking backwards and forwards about the Docks - I knew him by name and person.</p>

            . I live at No. 29, Crown-street. I was at our door, and heard the cry of "Stop thief;" I saw Mc Coliff run, pursued by the prosecutor - he was stopped by the private watchman, and the police officer took him - when he had brought him about one hundred yards, I saw him pass the watch to Clary in Crown-street; Clary was behind Mc Coliff - he took it and ran off - I know Clary by sight, and I am sure he is the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you first mention this? A. At the station-house, Bow-street; I was afraid to call out at the time I saw him take it, as there were so many thieves about me, and only one policeman - I do not know whether most of the persons were thieves, but there were a great many - I know Clary by sight - I never quarrelled with him; he was taken on the 13th of July - I did not hear anything said about him before I got to the station-house, but when I got there, I told the policeman that Mc Coliff had passed the watch to a young man, and I described him and his dress - he was taken from the description.</p>

            . I live at Sheerness; my husband is a labourer; I was present at the prisoner's marriage at Queenborough, on the 25th of November, 1830, with Mrs. Sarah Dunn, a widow; I witnessed it, and am quite sure the prisoner is the man; he was something in the Ordnance; Mrs. Dunn is here now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know what became of Mrs. Dunn, after the marriage? A. No; I never saw her at Sheerness; I never knew the prisoner nor her till they came to be married; my father was then clerk of the parish, and the prisoner asked me to be bridesmaid; I was frequently called on to officiate in that way at that time, and if people asked me civilly, I had no objection; but I will not do it any more.</p>

No; I will take my oath I did not use any threat or promise; I did not say I would charge a policeman with him - I will swear I did not strike him at all, nor touch him.</p>

            . I am a clothes salesman, and live in Marylebone-lane; the prisoner came to my shop about three months ago, and purchased a pair of breeches, a waistcoat, a pair of gaiters, and a hat; I think they came to between twenty and thirty shillings; I showed him a coat at the same time, for which I asked him twenty-five shillings; he said he would not give that, but he would come in the afternoon and have it, if I would take £1 for it, and he came and had it for that; he came again some time afterwards, and bought a fustian jacket, two waistcoats, and a silver watch; he paid for them 2l. 10s.; he gave me a £5. note - I asked him who he had it of, he said I had no occasion to be afraid, that he lived with Colonel Dyson round the corner; he said he had just received his wages and he was going into the country; I sent to enquire, and he did live there; these are the clothes, some of them have my mark on them.</p>

            . I live in Tower-street, Seven Dials. On the 16th of July, I went in the evening to see Simmons's exhibition of wax-work - I am in the habit of taking snuff - I had my snuff-box when I went there - I staid about three-quarters of an hour, and as I came out of the last room I missed my snuff-box - there were a great many people there, but I did not observe any one in particular - when I came out and had got five or six doors down <placeName id="t18330905-50-crimeloc299">Holborn</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Had you the box when you went into this place? A. Yes, I am sure I had; I missed it before I came out - I did not notice the prisoner there - when I came out I saw the prisoner and another person with him, but the prisoner had the box - it was between nine and ten o'clock, but I saw him looking at my box by the light of a shop - I saw a box in his hand which afterwards proved to be mine - I saw it was a black box; I should have known it if I had seen the picture - I was never married; I have gone by the name of Ann White.</p>

            . I was with the prosecutirx - I did not see the box in her possession at the exhibition, but I afterwards saw the prisoner on the opposite side with a box in his hand - I crossed and took him by the collar; the person who was with him ran away - the prisoner dropped the box when I charged him with having it, and I gave him in charge of a policeman; the person belonging to the house went into the area and handed up the box - the prosecutrix saw it, and said in the prisoner's presence, it was her's - it was given to the policeman, who is now in Whitecross-street for debt - it had an oil painting on it; I should think it cheap at 6d.</p>

            . The prisoner had not bought this silk, nor any part of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did she buy of no one but you? A. No - she bought some black silk, but I cannot tell whether it was off this piece; she paid about 4s.; I don't know the exact amount; this silk was on the counter; I left the prisoner for a short time; there are fourteen or fifteen shopmen; it is called Navarino house; there were no persons near her, she was sitting at the counter - Mr. Smart was near the door; about twenty yards from the prisoner; I don't know any thing to prevent either of the Mr. Venables being here to night.</p>
               <p>COURT, to JOHN SMART. Q. What name is over the door? A. W. Venables, and Co. - Mr. Walford was a partner, but he has ceased to be so; I am acting under Mr. William Venables; he is the sole proprietor, and was so on the 6th of August.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. As William Venables and Co. is over the door, how do you know that he is the sole partner; is it not from what you have heard, you state this? A. Yes - the word Co. is over the door, it has not been erased - I saw Mr. Richard Venables to day, but he could not attend here without leaving his business.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear of his being subpoened on the part of the prisoner? A. No - Mr. Richard certainly acts as master, and has the privilege of dismissing hands.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have any of the shopmen that privilege? A. No.</p>

            . I am a salesman in Thames-street. I sold Mr. Pierce twelve kits of pickled salmon on the Monday, and he came for them on the Friday; this is the top of one of them; I know it by the mark - I may have seen the prisoner but don't remember it - I had not sold him any salmon that day, for I had none to sell.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I have bought a great many tubs of him. Witness. I cannot say that I recollect it - I am sure I did not sell him this on that day.</p>

             (police-constable S 49.) I was on duty in Hampstead-road, I saw the prosecutor and prisoner coming towards me; he said to me "I will give her in charge to you, she has picked my pocket of two half-crowns, and has thrown them into the ditch" - I turned on my light, and found one of them, but I could not find the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050038"/>other - I took the prisoner to the station-house, and then returned, and after some time I found the other half-crown - she told me that he had given her a shilling to get some gin, and that she had the eightpence halfpenny change in her pocket, which she had.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) I met the prosecutor late on the evening mentioned, when I was coming from my work; he asked me where I was going in such haste, I told him home; he asked me to stop and have something to drink, I did not refuse as I knew the man well; he then gave me one shilling to fetch out anything I liked best, I brought out one quartern of gin, and I offered the change to the prosecutor, which he refused taking, and he told me to put it in my pocket; after that he said he would take a walk with me, and then he proposed sitting down to rest: we had not been together more than half an hour, when the prosecutor wanted to take more liberties than welcome, and we had a great scuffle; then he saw the policeman coming, and he asked me to come back, and he said if I did not he would give me in charge; I ran towards the policeman, and he followed me, and told the policeman I had taken five shillings from him; and when we were going towards the station-house, he told the policeman where the money was, and on looking down on the bank where we had been sitting he found one half-crown. I declare solemnly I am innocent of what the prosecutor states, but I did not give it a thought at that fatal moment what the prosecutor's intention was towards me; I forgot the promise he made me one evening a few weeks before this occurrence, he promised me as soon as he had an opportunity he would make me remember him as long as I lived.</p>

On the morning of the 31st of August, I had on my shop counter, a great coat, a frock coat, and a shooting jacket; I had occasion to go into my parlour, which is separated from the shop by a passage; my daughter alarmed me, and I ran into the shop, and turned into Heath-cock-court, by her direction, and saw the two prisoners as close as they could stand together, having my property between them; the skirts of my coats hung down from them; I called, "stop thief," and they threw them down; I told them to stop, and Randall struck me, and I laid hold of him; Wilks ran away; Randall struggled to get away; Mellish the policeman came to my assistance, and I gave him in charge; my daughter picked up the property and took it into the shop; I delivered the great coat to Rice; I have not got the other things; I was to return them that week as they belonged to a customer; the great coat, and frock coat were worth 5l., and more. The shooting jacket was worth 1l., and more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DAWSON. Q. Are you positive you saw the property in possession of the two prisoners? A. I am; it was between them; I saw the skirts of the great coat hanging down so that it touched both; I cannot say which of them threw it down; they were so close together; I saw it hang down between them; they stood as close together as could be; I never saw Wilks before; I am positive he is the man; I saw Wilks run away when I caught hold of Randall; I went to Bow-street with Randall, and while he was under examination, the magistrate sent for my daughter; and as I returned to Bow-street with my daughter I saw Wilks in Bow-street; he was not in custody then; the first time I saw Wilks after he left the court was in Bow-street; it was a few minutes more than an hour after I saw him in the court; I knew him by his face; they did not separate till Randall struck me; I ran between them in the court, and looked them in the face; when I saw Wilks in the street, I told two officers that he was Randall's companion, and then two men turned him back, and I said, "He is the man;" I did not know then that he was in custody.</p>

There is a passage between the back parlour and the shop; I was standing there on the 31st of August, and I saw Wilks come in and take the clothes off the counter; two of them had passed the door before that; that was him and Randall; Randall did not come into the shop; he was passing the door when Wilks took the clothes; after taking the clothes they joined company, and went up Heath-cock-court together, Wilks was carrying the property; Randall would have an opportunity of seeing what Wilks was doing in the shop, when he took the clothes; they joined company between the door and the court, three or four yards from the shop; I gave an alarm and my father came out.</p>

Yes; I never said Randall took it; Wilks had the property after leaving the shop; I saw him pass the door before, and observed him, because they looked into the shop; they stopped and looked in; I am positive Wilks is the man who entered the shop; I said so, at the office; I swear to Wilks.</p>

I am a surgeon, and live in King-street, Covent-garden; these two girls came to me that evening; the prosecutrix's wound on her neck was about an inch and a-half in length, but the depth was very little, nothing of any consequence; it was of sufficient depth to be necessary to sew the wound up; it was across the jugular vein; if it had been deeper it would certainly have been dangerous - if it had been a quarter of an inch deeper it might have been fatal; I repeatedly asked the girl how she came by the wound, and she as often repeated that it was by falling on a scraper; and while I was sewing it up again, I asked her, and she said it was done by a spade; I said it certainly could not have been so, it must have been done by some sharp instrument, as the wound was cut; she then denied it being done with any sharp instrument - she never told me how it was done.</p>

On Friday morning, the 16th of August, in consequence of information, I went to my warehouse, and observed the lock was partly off the door, the iron bar was off, and the padlock broken off - I missed a lot of figured lustring ribbons, and some figured satins; my desk was broken open, and I missed from it a cashbox, containing a bill of exchange, a 10l. note, a 5l. note, some sovereigns, and some silver - in consequence of information I went to Spooner's, in Chiswell-street; I saw some ribbons, and went in consequence of information to Lower White-cross-street; I saw some lustring and satin ribbons, about one-third of the quantity I lost.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long had the ribbons been in your possession? A. They were purchased about the 23rd of May, and some on the 1st of June, and I believe some since; there are various patterns - we have sold some of the patterns, and very likely we have sold some of each pattern: I cannot swear we have not - they were spindled on a small paper, not blocked, when taken from my warehouse; but when I found them at Lander's they were blocked, and some of the ends changed - I never saw Lander before; I had information first from the dresser, and went to Spooner's, who gave me information where he got them, and then I went to Lander's - I know nothing of the prisoner, except what was stated by Lander.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the quantity you found at Lander's and the other place greater than the quantity you had sold or less? A. We had sold a much larger quantity; there are so many patterns mixed together; I usually average the price of different manufacturers' goods and put all together at one price - I never sold a quantity of so many different patterns to one individual - at different times I dare say we had sold more of the same patterns.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You had the ribbons from Dodd? A. Yes; he is not the original manufacturer of them; there are three or four manufacturers - the lot was in my warehouse when I left the premises; they were a little out of condition - I could pick out this lot of goods from others made by the same manufacturer, because they were out of condition; they were lying on the counter; other people might have goods lying on the counter, and out of condition - as a lot I could pick them out, so as to be certain they were mine and nobody else's - it is possible others might be injured in the same way.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you find as much as you had lost? A. About half; I had lost sixty-eight pieces; I found the same mixture of goods as I lost, with the same marks of damage, and some of each sort, and in the same state and condition, except that some had been put on blocks, and some spindled, but the ends altered - I believe them to be part of the property; I lost the same mixture and assortment.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Do you sell ribbons dressed or undressed? A. Satins must be dressed, but lustrings we do not dress; Mr. Spooner sent them to the dresser; I intended to have the satins dressed after they were sold; these were undressed when stolen.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you lose them? A. On the 15th of August, and found them on the Thursday following, the 23rd, some of them had been dressed in the intermediate time.</p>
               <p>GEORGE THOMAS EDWARDS. On Thursday evening, the 15th of July, I was in the warehouse, and left it about half-past seven o'clock; it was secured by a lock and a bar across the door, and fastened by a padlock; I found it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050043"/>broken the following day - these very goods were on the premises that evening; I know them to be the same; I can identify them positively; we have had them too long on the counter not to know them; I believe if there were a thousand pieces of the same patterns I could pick them out; they have been constantly under my eye, and they are the make of several different manufacturers, and we, after taking stock, mixed the several manufacturers' goods together, and these are the same assortment of goods as we had made.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you a partner? A. No, he has no partner; it is Thomas Dodd's warehouse; the goods were his, and in his warehouse - Bullock is only the agent; he is not answerable for them; they are consigned to him for sale without his being responsible - I know Mr. Dodd has no partner; they are all Dodd's goods.</p>

A. 17s.; I had seen him several times before; he is a linen-draper and dealt in ribbons - I have seen some goods as good as those at 19s. 6d. a piece, at wholesale houses in the city; I gave 17s. - I will not swear these are not worth 29s.; I should not like to give that for them - I should think Lander was a judge of these articles.</p>

            . I live at 149, Upper Whitecross-street. The prisoner came to my house in the afternoon of the 20th of August, and said he wished to speak to me - my young man called me down to him; and he said he had some goods, would I step home and look at them - I had bought of him before in that manner - I went down in the evening; he keeps a clothes-shop, in Golden-lane; he took some papers off his shelves, and produced some ribbons; I said, "It is too late in the season for them;" he said, we could not get jobs unless the season was gone by; he named the price at 18s. a piece - I said, "Where did you get them?" he said,"I bought them of a very respectable man" - I offered him 16s. a piece, and he said I should have them - I bought thirty-four pieces - I paid him 27l. 4s. in gold and silver; they were not worth more - in the proper season some would not be worth more, and others would; some patterns would not sell at all - some of them were worth considerably more - they were not worth 18s. - I conceive I gave a fair price.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What are you? A. A haberdasher; I have lived in Upper Whitecross-street three years and a half. I have dealt with the prisoner for the last six months, occasionally, three or four times, for different sort of things, in our way - I have bought ribbon and haberdashery; I bought some trimmings of him, about a month ago; and some ribbons, about six weeks ago; that was not so large a parcel as these - I have bought goods three or four times, or six- I did not take an invoice of the goods I bought - I marked it down myself on a piece of paper which came from the ribbons - I have not got that paper - that is the way I deal, I take no invoice when I pay money - I have dealt with many people buying goods, and not had an invoice - I knew him to be a very respectable man - I was in trouble about this, on the following Thursday, which was two days after - I told our young men in the shop who I bought them of when I brought them home; there was a gentleman in the house when I was called down to the prisoner - I have two shopmen, one is here; there was nothing in the goods to make me think them improperly come by - it is very general to buy different patterns at so much a piece, altogether - nobody but Mrs. Benjamin was present when I bought them - I did not know what I was going to look at, when I went to his house - I went home for the money and then came back with it - I brought the goods from his house myself in a paper parcel.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is it customary to buy goods and not take an acknowledgment or discharge from the party? A. I believe it is quite general; if I go to a house and see a lot of goods; I bring them away - it is generally the case with job lots.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Lander. I recollect the prisoner coming to my master's shop on Tuesday - he asked if Mr. Lander was at home, I said,"Yes," and went for him; when he came down stairs he said he had something to sell him - Lander said, he would come down in the evening, he went and returned with a quantity of ribbons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear all that passed? A. No; I heard the prisoner say, he had something to sell him, in the shop - my master went out, and when he came home next he had the ribbons with him - I saw him return and he had the ribbons - I was at home all the afternoon; he was gone about half an hour; he lives about half a mile from the prisoner's house - it would take him half an hour to go there, to examine the goods, and bring them to the house - I cannot say whether you can go twice in half an hour - I don't know whether he was half an hour or three quarters - I should think it would take him the time he was gone - I was in the shop- there is a private door; my master goes in at that door very seldom - I was in the shop all the time - I don't know whether I was or not - I might have been out part of the time; except going out for a necessary purpose I was in the shop - I might have gone out into the yard, and if I did, I was not out three minutes - I never saw master return till he came back with the ribbons.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you searched the premises was he at home? A. He was; he certainly told me I might search his house all over - I found nothing of a suspicious nature - I found no silk goods at all there.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Might not you find these patterns at Leaf's, or Morrison's? A. I think not; not mixed up as these are - it is usual to keep goods separate, not to mix four or five manufacturers' goods, of different prices, together, as these are - I put them together and averaged them in stock, at 23s. a piece - some have been dressed since they were stolen - the trade never send them out till they are dressed.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am quite innocent, and wish that letter read, which I sent to the prosecutrix (letter read).</p>
               <p>"Madam - I feel great regret that you should have been so much deceived in the identity, of the persons who were concerned in robbing of you; I assure you most solemnly, I had no connection, neither did I know any of them. I beg you to consider ere it is too late, the great responsibility that devolves on you - time may bring to light those who were concerned in it, which will prove me to be entirely innocent; consider what then will be your feelings, when you reflect, you have been the means of depriving an innocent person of his liberty for ever - I have a beloved father who is sinking fast into the grave, could you wish to deprive him of his sole stay and support? as I am confident the loss of me would soon finish his days, besides it would plunge a family who have hitherto been without stain or blemish in their character, into the deepest distress and anguish of mind - sisters who are looking up to me for that protection which females always require - indeed you cannot picture to yourself the misery and distress you may cause. I beg and entreat you to consider if you may not be mistaken, many resemble one another, and it is difficult then to identify a person on only seeing him once, especially in the state of mind you were labouring under at that moment - I solemnly assert my innocence before the Almighty God, and as you value your peace of mind in this world, and the salvation of your soul in the next, to pause seriously, on the consequence of falsely swearing away the dearest blessing of man - his liberty, especially situated as I am at the present moment - leaving it to your consideration. -

I took the two prisoners, and these thirteen pieces of wood; Cadwell said his wife bought part of them, and they had come at two separate times - that Palmer had brought some in the morning, and some in the evening - he said his wife gave 1s. for that in the morning, and he gave 1s. 3d. for the other; he said he was not aware but he had given a fair price for it - I thought well of him; he has been two or three months in the business.</p>

On the 13th of July, in consequence of having missed some goods, I marked four half-crowns and gave them to a young man, to give to his wife to come and purchase goods; together with ten shillings, which were not marked - we all left the house except the prisoner, just before nine o'clock, and I returned just before ten - I went into the counting-house, and returned to the prisoner, who was in the shop; he said, "I have just taken some ready money" - I had just looked into the box where we put the money, and saw two of the half-crowns which I had marked - I asked the prisoner how much he had taken; he said, "14s. 9d." - I went and looked at the book, and he had entered 14s. 9d. - the young man then came in to whom I had given the four half-crowns, and from what he said, I sent for the officer - I called the prisoner into the counting-house to Mr. Partridge, my partner, and told him I suspected him, and wished to search him - the officer found on him two of the marked half-crowns, and two black silk handkerchiefs, which belonged to me and Mr. Partridge; they are worth 7s. - the prisoner was to have 30l. a year, and his board and lodging.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. How do you know these handkerchiefs? A. By the mark on them - this mark is put on at the warehouse; I cannot say who put it on - the same mark might be on other handkerchiefs - the prisoner was the only person in the shop besides myself and my partner - we had another young man, but he was not accustomed to the business, and did not serve in the shop; our other shopman had left before the prisoner came - if these handkerchiefs had been sold the ticket would have been taken off and they would have been entered in the book - I had seen these handkerchiefs there the day before; we had no other of that price - I looked this morning to see if we had any other tickets the same as these, and we have not - if persons in our employ ask for goods, we let them have them - there was a quarter's wages due to the prisoner on the 27th of August; it was 7l. 10s.; he had had 3l. in money, and 30s. or 40s. worth of goods.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). With respect to the two handkerchiefs found on me, I can account for the possession of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050050"/>them as my own property. Some time ago I purchased a lot of(about eighteen) silk handkerchiefs, and gave them to a friend(the witness Mrs. Longdon, who, with her husband, lives at the house of my uncle) to make up for me. On Sunday, July 7th, I called upon, her for some of the handkerchiefs, when she told me they were not done, but that I should have a couple of them in the course of the week. Being out on business the Friday following, I called for them, but finding they were not ready, I took the two silk handkerchiefs with me in the same state in which I bought them: I put them into my coat pocket, where they were found the next morning on my being searched.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you say you was a servant out of place? A. Yes, I had been out of place for three weeks; I had never seen you before - I do not know what induced you to put your hand round my waist - I never gave you any authority to do so - the last place I lived in was at No. 16, Great Quebec-street, New-road - I did not say that you had kept company with me. I never was at the Feathers at Pimlico with you, I do not know the place - I never slept with you in Oxford-street; I never asked you to borrow a shilling of your comrades, and pay my lodging and sleep with me - I went to the office after you was locked up, to get an officer to go to my lodgings, because there was a soldier in my bed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What do you mean by that? A.

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you never attend Portman-street barracks within the last six months? A. No; I do not know two shops for drink, one on the right, and the other on the left hand side there - I was not at one of them three nights before this happened, drinking beer with you.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Now attend - are you quite sure, and do you swear, that to the best of your belief, you never saw that man before? A. Never in my life; I never was with him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I make any resistance? Witness. A. Yes; when I was on the ground you flung your leg up and tried to throw me over your head; you drew your bayonet three or four inches.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I only put my hand to it to save it from falling out. Witness. I hope it was so, but you appeared to me to be drawing it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Had you not had something to drink that night? A. Yes; I did not drink with the prisoner - I had drank before - I was capable of knowing what I was about, but I forgot this bag; I don't recollect the prisoner asking me the colour of this coat, he appeared to be cautious of giving it up, and said he was not certain whether I was the person; he went with me to his sister's.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050052"/>employed him to have twenty-five yards of work ready by Saturday morning? A. Not to my recollection; I might have done so - there was eleven yards, or eleven yards and a half done of it on the Thursday when he was taken - it certainly was necessary that he should have quills wound to do this work with, but he should not have taken them to wind at home - there is a person at my house who does that - he could not have had to wait more than one minute in the morning to have his quills wound - when we give out silk to work we weigh it, and we weigh the work when done, to see if it corresponds in weight, but I could not have ascertained that, when the twenty-five yards were brought in; not till the whole cane was done.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When the twenty-five yards of silk was done, would not the weight of that make up the weight you gave? A. No, because part of the cane would be still in the loom; we could not ascertain the weight till all was finished.</p>

            . I live in Fort-street. I work for the prosecutor - on the morning in question I went down stairs, and saw the foreman weigh out eight bobbins, and put them into a basket up stairs, where he always keeps them - there were three more there - the prisoner took them up, and he went out soon after - I then went into the room, and saw but seven bobbins in the basket; the prisoner returned, and went to work - when he went home at night there were still but seven bobbins there, and the next morning I saw the foreman weighing some white shute.</p>

             (police-constable H 27.) I took the prisoner, and found these four bobbins of silk between his shirt and his skin, under his arm.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you take him? A. In Spicer-street, Spitalfields - I believe his master sent him out on an errand; I asked him if he knew the prosecutor, he said yes; his master then came up, and asked if he had any of his property, he said he had not; I felt his pockets, there was nothing there - I then found these bobbins, he cried, and begged for mercy.</p>
               <p>MR. WALKER. I did not send him out before the regular course of work was concluded, I told him to go when he had done his work - he did not tell me he intended to work till dark - I only sent him to one place - he paid 2s. 6d. a week for his loom standing in my house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On that Thursday he asked me if I would complete him twenty-five yards of work to go into the country, and to go down and take the silk to finish it, I said I had enough, he said I had better take some more, and he gave it to me - at seven o'clock he asked me to go to two places, and one was for some work to go home at the same time with mine; and as I would not disappoint him of the order, I put the four bobbins into my bosom to wind the quills at home.</p>

            . I am uncle of the prisoner, I keep a shop on Peter's-hill, Doctor's-commons. The prisoner has been an honest, hard working lad - I am a silk weaver; it is usual for masters to weigh silk when they give it out, and when it comes back, if it don't correspond, they stop the wages for it.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WALKER re-examined. Q. Was it your practice with this man to weigh the silk when it was given out, and when it was brought in manufactured? A. Yes, we keep a regular debtor and creditor account in the book - I should at the end of the work have discovered that this was deficient - this work was silk and cotton.</p>

            . I am foreman to the prosecutor. On the 4th of September, I went into the work-shop - when I had been there two or three minutes, seven or eight men rose up, and said, there was a thief in the shop stealing cuttings, they said, "Seize him, seize him," and two or three men laid hold of the prisoner, and said, he had been stealing cuttings, and melting them - I said if he had been stealing anything he must give it up to me - he said, he had none about him - I walked up, and said, "I shall search you, if you don't give it up to me" - he at last with reluctance put his hand into his left-hand pocket, and took out a small piece of gold, and gave it me - I took it to Mr. King.</p>

            . I work in the shop - I was watching the prisoner - in the course of that evening a call came from the counting-house, to take the cuttings down - the prisoner said he supposed he must take his cuttings down and he took down one box, but left another box of cuttings at his place - I looked at it - when he came up again, he took those cuttings and melted them at the lamp - and I saw him put the lump into one of his pockets.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many were in the place? A. Perhaps half-a-dozen - some of them might have their backs to the lamp - some of them might be looking at the prisoner at the time - the lamp is in a conspicuous part of the room - I had no quarrel with the prisoner - I have sometimes joked with him, but had no disagreement - we sometimes call one another names out of fun.</p>

The prisoner lodged at my house three or four months in 1829, and again for about the last twelve-months in 1829, and again for about the last twelve-months - he had incurred a debt of 49l. 10s. with me for lodging, and paid me by a bill of exchange which would become due on the 17th of August last - I paid it away - on the 8th of August, he sent for me up-stairs; I went up and he said, "Here, Mr. Edmead, is your account" - there was another quarter's account about coming due, and that was the account he referred to - he produced the quarter's account, including the bill; I have it here; this is the paper I received from him, here is "bill 48l." mentioned, but it should be 49l. 10s.; the account was 17l. 12s., making the whole 67l. 2s. - on his producing the account, he placed a cheque on the account, this is the cheque, and he said, "Here is this, I have some pressing letters to go into the country, and I shall be absent about three weeks; I think I shall be obliged to go off about seven o'clock in the evening; I am going into the city, to the Bank, should I have time to return before I go off into the country, I will return and take up the bill, and call upon you and settle your account and take this again" - I had paid the bill away, and he knew where it was - he said, "I have reserved this for a certain purpose, I did not want to make use of it immediately" - this passed about twelve o'clock in the day; the cheque was laying on the account all this time - I took the cheque up with the account, and said I would take care of it; I then left him - I went up again about an hour after; he still remained at home; I went up and told him he had made a mistake in the amount of the bill; he said, "Never mind, Mr. Edmead, that is of little consequence, I have a fifty for it" - he went out about two o'clock, and in a short time a boy came for his portmanteau; I went up-stairs myself to fetch it down, and found all that there was in the room nearly, was put into the portmanteau, except a pair of shoes and boots; they were packed in the portmanteau - I brought it down stairs, and gave it to the boy; he took it down towards Euston-square, the same way as the prisoner went - in consequence of what I observed up-stairs, I was induced to present the cheque; and I went that day to Drummond's banking-house, presented the cheque, and payment was refused - he went by the name of Captain

             at my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Are you quite sure you have told us all that occurred between you and him, when he delivered you the cheque? A. Not quite; he asked me where Moggridge lived, at the time he gave me the cheque, I told him, and he took down his address - I am quite sure when he gave me the cheque he did not say, "This is not for payment." - the cheque is for 80l.; the amount he owed me altogether was 67l. when the bill became due and the quarter's account; the bill had not become due then - if it had been due there would be a balance owing to the prisoner, if the cheque was paid; the bill was 49l. 10s. and the account was 17l. 12s. which would be 67l. owing to me - there would be a balance of 12l. 18s.; he did not ask me for the difference; he did not tell me he gave it me as a security, nor anything of the kind - he told me he intended to call for it again; he did not say he would call for the cheque again if the bill was not paid; this was on the 8th of August - I am quite sure he did not say, "Remember, I wish to have that back again."</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say, he intended to have the cheque back again, or words to that effect? A. Yes; I replied, "Very well, I will take care of it."</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Was that when he said he would get back about seven o'clock, from the City, if he could? A. Yes; he did not return at all that day - Moggridge is the person in whose hands the bill was; it was the prisoner's acceptance, drawn and accepted by himself; he

            . I am a policeman; I was called on the 8th of August, and took the prisoner into custody, at the corner of Hampstead-road, in the New-road, at the King's Head public-house - a solicitor who was with me said, "I give this man into custody for forging a cheque of 80l." - the prisoner heard it, but said nothing; I took him to the station-house, searched him, and found a quantity of memorandums, sixty-three pawnbrokers' duplicates, ard a cheque-book of Drummonds, and 3 cheques of it filled up - this is one of the cheques which I found. (looking at it.)</p>
               <p>RIGHT HONOURABLE LORD DUNDAS. I keep an account at Drummond's house, and have always done so - I believe I once saw the prisoner in the street, he presented a paper to me; I don't recollect the contents, but from the contents of the paper I presumed he might be a Mr. David Dundas, who had corresponded with me; I have had letters from him, but have no other knowledge of him - no part of this cheque is my hand-writing; I think I should know anywhere that it is not my hand - I don't draw on these cheques, I have a private cheque-book of my own, unless I receive money in the banking house I don't sign these cheques - the signature is made in the way I sign my name, it is an imitation, but I should discover it in a moment (looking at another cheque) this other cheque is still less like mine, it is not the way I sign cheques, it is the way I sign franks - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050057"/>have had several letters from the prisoner, and corresponded with him; I probably franked my answers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is your Lordship prepared to say that this is an imitation of your hand-writing? A. I cannot answer that more than another person; I imagine it being signed "Dundas" is intended to imitate my signature - I should say the last cheque would not deceive anybody, that is for 40l.; the other might deceive, but not a very accurate observer - it ought not to deceive a person used to my signature, because I invariably draw a line and join the D's.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Is it a different signature to that with which you draw a cheque? A. Yes, the tail of the D comes through it and joins the u, which I do in franks (cheque read).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury - Painfully distressing as my present position is, arraigned a prisoner at this bar - a spectacle to the world, charged with the intention to commit a frand on the Messrs. Drummonds. Gentlemen, my conscience prompts me to reprobate that which I feel to be a vile attack on a character which I have in varied climes maintained without blemish, for a period of more than thirty years in the service of my king and country, having throughout the whole course of my professional duties, uniformly received the high commendations of all under whom I had the honour to serve. I do not name my services, Gentlemen, with any view of moving your pity; nor would I, had I the power, attempt to excite your sympathies to shield me from any pains or penalties, an error in judgment may bring upon me- they are altogether of a secondary consideration, inasmuch as an incurable wound was inflicted the moment of my arrest; nor will your verdict of acquittal heal that wound, or give me back my peace of mind, or allow me again to taste the sweets of social intercourse, or evermore to feel the sacred influence of friendship - under such depression, the sufferer sighs for his final release, to meet the righteous sentence of the Judge Eternal.</p>

               <p>In looking, however, at the evidence given by Edmead, I wish you, Gentlemen, to favour me with your undivided attention to a few points, which, from their tendency, it appears to be imperative in me to notice. Bear in mind, then, that the transaction in question took place after mid-day on the 8th of August, and that I was arrested soon after four o'clock the same afternoon. This man has sworn, Gentlemen, that he assented to hold the cheque as a collateral security, until I took up a certain named bill, coming due on the 15th of the same month. Such was our specific agreement. He has admitted on his oath, that he promised to keep this cheque in safe custody, and to restore it to me at the time already named. He again tells you, Gentlemen, that the impression or understanding of his mind was that the bill should be taken up on that day, a week before it was due, and his account to be liquidated that night. Admitting, then, for a moment the truth of the latter statement, which I deny in the most unqualified manner. Examine, however, this man's conduct; do you see him acting agreeably to his own shewing? Certainly not. You must fancy him flying on the wings of the wind to the banking-house at Charing-cross! Mark his laudable purpose: was it to satisfy himself of the validity of the document? The clerk of Messrs. Drummond's answers no! that he required payment for that which he has sworn he promised to keep in safe custody for a fixed and positive period. I can easily imagine with what chuckling exultation he would bound away, with the honest hope of realizing by his breach of faith the sum of £80, for a debt of £17 odd. All this was done, and my caption made, in little more than two hours; hence it is manifest that his determination was that I should not have the power to do as he has stated he expected me to do! This witness, however, has had honesty sufficient to state on his oath, that I refused to accept any money consideration for this document; and admits that I enjoined him, over and over again, not to let the cheque go out of his possession: his answer was, "I will not." He has further sworn, that when I gave him the cheque, no person or party was named, or even alluded to, so as to give him any idea or reason to think that the document emanated from any person but myself, for it bears no other than my own name. I think I may then fearlessly ask you, Gentlemen, where is the evidence in all this to show even a shadow of "criminal intention" on my part towards the Messrs. Drummonds? Rather would not justice have been more fully satisfied, had this man Edmead, whose conduct herein was based on treachery and falsehood, been put to the bar in preference to the witness box? I shall, therefore, leave my destiny to the decision of your impartial judgment. My conduct in this particular instance may not have been in exact accordance with the requirement of the laws, but I submit that there is not a tittle of evidence to justify the charge of"guilty intention" on my part towards any of the individuals named in this indictment. I appeal then, Gentlemen, to your own feelings, assured that you will conscientiously view all the bearings of the case; and by your verdict show to the world, that you cannot sanction such abandonment of principle, or make me the victim of such nefarious conduct.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you known him before? A I never saw him before; no property was found on him.</p>

            , at Tottenham, about four o'clock on Sunday, the 25th of August - we were in the field next to Miss Howard's house - I saw the two prisoners together, going towards the church; that would lead in a direction to Miss Howard's house; they parted - Salter came back and waited on the wooden bridge, between the fields, about two hundred yards from Miss Howard's house - I could see her house from the bridge; I saw Smith shortly after coming across the fields, from Miss Howard's palings, as fast as he could walk; he went to the wooden bridge and joined Salter - I heard Mrs. Dale cry out; Smith was then coming across the same fields as she was; Salter was nearer than me to Mrs. Dale, and I heard her cry out; Smith was nearer than me to Mrs. Dale; she was running after him; he must have heard her cry out - Salter was at that time on the wooden bridge - Smith joined him; they waited on the bridge two or three minutes, then Salter ran up towards Mr. Wright's moat, from Mrs. Dale and Smith - and Smith walked up towards the main path - I ran to him directly Mrs. Dale hallooed, and he walked the faster; and I said,"You are wanted," he then stopped, came back, and said, "It is not me that is wanted, it is somebody else," he came back after that.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Mrs. Dale in view of Smith when he turned back? A. Yes; but she could not see him turn back, as it was down in a hollow; this was after he had joined Salter and left him - then he came back towards Mrs. Dale, and me, and the beadle - the beadle was in view of Smith; and the beadle called, "Stop thief," as well, he was dressed as the beadle; he turned round at my speaking to him, and came towards the beadle, and was then taken into custody - I had been to church, and came out again, before the service was over - my father sent me to church; he has been in the habit of sending me to church and punishing me for not going; I had been that day at three o'clock, and came out at four o'clock, it was not over; my father has found fault with me for not going to church, when he sent me, but I always do go - I had not known either of the prisoners before; the wooden bridge is about two hundred yards from the prosecutrix's house - Salter had a black coat on - I will swear that, I cannot be mistaken - I was at the office before the magistrate when Salter was brought there; he was let out on bail, promising to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050059"/>come there on the following Wednesday, and he came and was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When you saw Salter at the magistrates, did you know him again? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>CHARLES SAITCH. I am fourteen years old; I was in company with England on Sunday, the 25th of August; I saw the two prisoners near Miss Howard's house that afternoon; I know them both - I am sure they are the persons; I first saw them up towards the church, going in a direction towards Miss Howard's house; I saw them return and go back towards Mr. Wright's moat; when I first saw them in the field, they kept together a very few minutes, then parted - Salter went down towards Wright's moat, and stopped at the wooden bridge; Smith went towards the church, and when we saw Smith again, he was against Miss Howard's palings - we had lost sight of him; I heard Mrs. Dale cry out; Smith then walked quite fast across the fields; Mrs. Dale followed him crying "Stop thief," and"Murder;" he took no notice of it, but kept going on; he went to Salter at the wooden bridge - he remained with him a few minutes, and when us boys were after him, Salter ran towards the moat; Smith was running up towards the path, he turned back and said were we calling after him; we said, "Yes;" he turned back and asked Forster if he wanted him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not he walk towards the beadle? A. Yes; I saw Smith all the time he was on the wooden bridge - he was talking - he did nothing but talk; he gave nothing to the person who was standing on the bridge; I was at Salter's house shortly after this, and he was produced to me; I said that he was not the man I saw on the bridge; there was an officer with me at the time - that was on the Tuesday after the robbery; he was not dressed then the same as when I saw him - he is not now dressed as he was on the day of the robbery; none of the officers or the prosecutrix have been speaking to me since.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why did you then say he was not the same man? A. On Sunday he had a black coat on, and on Tuesday a brown one.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He has a brown coat on now; why swear to him now? A. He had whiskers under his chin on the Sunday, and he had none on the Tuesday - he has no whiskers under his chin now; I said the person had bandy legs, and the magistrate took up his apron to look at his legs, and after that let him out on bail.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Before the magistrate did you say he was not the man, or what? A. I did not go in before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did Salter live? A. I saw him at his brother's house in Union-street, Shoreditch.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time did you see Salter? A.

            . I am a constable of Tottenham. On Sunday afternoon, the 25th of August, I heard a screaming, and went to the spot, and found Mrs. Dale, and joined with her in the pursuit - she was hallooing "Stop thief" as loud as she could - I observed the prisoner Smith coming from Miss Howard's house before Mrs. Dale cried out - he was about a hundred and fifty yards from Miss Howard's then - he went a few paces from me, and returned quite fast in a bustle towards the house - a few minutes after I heard the cry of "Murder, thieves;" I ran to the spot and saw Mrs. Dale running and hallooing - I passed her; came to a hedge about a hundred and fifty or two hundred yards from the prosecutrix's house - some people on the other side of the hedge called to Smith; he came back and asked if I wanted him; I said yes, and took him - I could not see him at the time Mrs. Dale was hallooing out - I found on him a key and a piece of candle in a piece of paper - a tobacco-box and a short pipe; I took him to the cage, and went in search of the other - I took him before the magistrate the next morning; he gave his name

A silver watch, a pair of garnet hoop ear-rings, a pair of cornelian drops, a gold pin, and two silver ones, two necklaces, a gold ring, two chimney ornaments of our Saviour on the Cross, and the Virgin and Child - they were not much larger than my finger.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence.

             public-house, Shoreditch. I have known Salter above six years; I saw him on Sunday, the 25th of August - he left my house about ten minutes before eleven o'clock, it being service time - I always close my house; I did so on that day - he returned to my house about half-past two o'clock, or a little more, and went out - it might be a quarter before three o'clock, when I closed my house for the afternoon service, and I saw him about half-past eight o'clock at night; he had on the same coat that day as he has on now - I am confident of it, because Mrs. Cash laughed at him about throwing off his black coat on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. He was in the habit of wearing a black coat before, was he? A. He was; I have seen him in a brown coat before - I had known him well, but only by sight; he said he lived at No. 1, Mount-street - I have seen Sargood at my house; I have seen them together, but not frequently - Salter was there more times than Sargood - I never knew Sargood go by the name of Smith - Sargood was in my house that morning about half-past eight o'clock - I cannot answer whether Salter was there then - Salter came about half-past nine o'clock; Sargood was not there then - I know this was the 25th of August, because I heard he was in trouble on the Tuesday following - he gets his living by industry; he has been in the military line - he worked for his brother at the horse-hair business - he belonged to the musicians in the Tower Hamlets; he has not left that long - Sargood and he did not to my knowledge live together; they were friends, they drank together at different times - I did not see Sargood at all except just after breakfast-time that Sunday - my house is about five miles from Tottenham - the latest time I saw Salter in the afternoon was a quarter to three o'clock.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you go to Edmonton? A. Yes, and bailed Sargood - I have kept the public-house eight years.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were any of your family at home that day? A. I have only a wife and servants; my wife was at home - she is not here, nor the servants.</p>
               <p>- CONGDEN. I kept the Victory public-house - I left it on the 24th of July, but I was in the house on the 25th of August - I have seen Salter several times; I saw him on the 25th of August, in the parlour of the Victory, Friar's-mount, Bethnal-green, by Shoreditch church; I saw him from half-past eleven to twelve o'clock, and I left him at twelve o'clock - to the best of my knowledge he had on the same coat he has on now.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Will you swear it was not a black coat? A. It was certainly not black, that I will swear - the Tottenham coaches go from the Basing-house, about a quarter of a mile from the church - I don't know whether it would take a man long to get to Tottenham from there - I have not known him long; I had seen him six or eight times in the house - I don't know Sargood; I have seen him at my house, but not with Salter.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you go to the public-house? A. I am there every day - I know it was on that day, because I had a collector who used to collect for me; he ran away with part of the property, and I was obliged to go down on Sunday to receive my money, and I saw this man there - I was there at half-past eleven, and he was there when I went in; I left about twelve o'clock - the house shuts up during Divine service, but my collector<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050061"/>pays me my rents there, having several houses in the neighbourhood, and several tenants of mine had come there to pay my rents; one of them is here, a man named Smith, who paid me rent at the time - Smith lives in Mount-court, Friar's-mount, No. 4, some call it Mount-place - neither of the prisoner are my tenants - I don't hold the house Salter lives in.</p>

            . I am the mother of Scoulen. On the morning of the 22nd of March, when I came down I found every thing taken off the board in the workshop, and the window wide open - I was awoke about six o'clock in the morning, by hearing my neighbours talking - I went down immediately, and found the workshop as I have described - two suits had been removed from where they had been left; I observed foot marks in the next garden, they appeared to be footsteps of only one person - my daughter picked some things up; she gave me a piece of flint and steel, and two or three matches, one had been lighted and the others not - I gave them to the policeman.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I have the steel here, and produce it - I have not the other things - I compared some shoes with footmarks in the next garden - the shoes were on the feet of a man who worked for the prosecutor, they were compared and did not match - no others were compared with them - Scoulen did not bring me a pair of shoes to compare, which were not on a man's feet; I apprehended the prisoner's wife, but not him; I went with Scoulen to Martin's; I took the bundle from the woman in the street - I saw the tinder-box at Martin's without flint or steel in it; the magistrate at Lambeth-street desired Scoulen to make use of the cloth in the bundle, as he wanted it; I gave it to Scoulen the bundle I took from the woman; Williams was with me when I took it from her; I gave the things in the bundle to Scoulen, after going before the magistrate.</p>

            . I live at No. 8, Rose-lane. The prisoner lodged with me five or six days - he came about the 15th of March, a woman lodged with him as his wife, and a child; it was a furnished room, there was a tinder-box, flint, and steel in the room, among the furniture; the steel was very much like this, but one steel might be like another; there is no mark on it; I recollect the policeman coming to me on the 22nd of March with Williams; I showed them where the prisoner lodged; there was a tinder-box there then, but the flint and steel were not there; I had not been in their room while they were there; they left my house on the 22nd of March - they slept there on the night of the 21st of March both of them; I did not see the prisoner on the 21st of March, after dinner time, about noon; I never saw him any more till I saw him in custody; I saw a light in his room at two o'clock in the morning; I did not see him in the room; I saw the woman next morning - I saw the woman when I went to bed at ten o'clock at night - she was then at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050062"/>work; I did not hear her go out; the prisoner was not in the house when I went to bed; they had no key of the outer door; it bolts inside, but has no lock; I did not bolt the door that night; I heard the woman bolt it after I went into my room to go to bed - I did not hear anybody go out in the night nor come in - I should have heard if I had been awake; I saw a light in their room about two o'clock in the morning; it shone into my room and I got out of bed; I heard no voices in their room.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There was a steel and flint in the room - when did you last see the steel? A. I never saw it till after he was taken to Lambeth-street; I had not seen it in my room after I gave it to them; I saw it when they came to lodge with me on the 15th, in the evening - I gave it to them.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH SCOULEN re-examined. The policeman gave me the bundle, it was cloth - I used it by the magistrate's leave - I had bought three yards of the cloth, and cut a coat of it; and when it was before the magistrate, the chalk marks which I had left on the cloth to cut it by, were on it- I saw them - I can swear it was in my shop on the night of the 21st; I have not the least doubt of it - the cloth was in a handkerchief, which belongs to my brother - I have not brought that here - I have got a shirt front, which was found in the prisoner's lodging, which is mine, but I cannot tell whether it was taken that night or not - here it is - I know it by the tape, which I sewed on it myself - I found it myself at the prisoner's lodging at Martin's - I thought it was Cockrene that measured the shoes, but I may be mistaken, as there were two or three there at the time - my mother was present - it was a new pair of shoes, which had never been worn.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you any mark on the cloth? A. Yes, a chalk line right across it; I had crossed it several times, it was three or four times across - the cross lines were made to cut the coat by, but the other line was made that I should not cut any further; to cut my coat according to my cloth.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am quite innocent - I left my supposed wife about half-past eight o'clock in the morning in pursuit of work, I went in the country, and heard she was taken for felony when I came to London.</p>

We correspond with Masterman's bank - shortly before the 26th of June the prisoner came to the bank to get a cheque for 4l. 9s., which she said she was about to send to Lymington, she paid me 4l. 9s. for it - I did not see her again till she was in custody - the cheque was signed "for Bugden and Co., John Ward" (looking at the signature to the cheque in question) - this is a good resemblance of the signature to that cheque - our clerk afterwards received the cheque back from her, and gave her the money for it; I was in the bank at the time, but did not take notice of her - this cheque is not signed by me, it is not my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you mean to swear that positively? A. Yes, the signature very much resembles my usual mode of writing, it very much resembles the signature to the cheque I gave her.</p>
               <p>Q. Have the kindness to write "Messrs. Masterman and Co. pay to Mr. Gregory or bearer 60l., and 60l. 5s." in figures? (the witness did so.) Witness. I have written that the way I usually write - it is like the signature to the cheque in my opinion - I think it is rather smaller than that - I don't think that that "Gregory or bearer" is quite dissimilar; I think there is a character about it very like mine - I wrote the cheque in my ordinary hand - I think the two are alike - I knew the prisoner before: she frequently came to the bank; I frequently saw her myself - I should say she is fifty years old; I should not think she is nearer seventy; I am a very bad judge of ladies' ages.</p>

             and Co., bankers - there are other partners - on the 26th of June the prisoner came to the banking-house, she presented this cheque for payment about three o'clock in the afternoon - Bugden and Co. of Woolwich have an account at our house - on taking the cheque from her hand, I observed something in the body of it which looked suspicious, and the appearance of it altogether - I took it to the counting-house, and afterwards to the country-office, where it was compared - I asked her if the cheque was payable to her, and she said yes, that was her name; it was payable to Mr. Gregory - I then went into the country-office, and returned to the counter; she remained there - I then asked for her address, and in what way she got possession of the cheque; she stated that she lived at No. 3, Stewart's-buildings, Battersea; and that this cheque formed part of a letter which was sent to her by the post, it has that appearance - I wrote the address she gave me on the cheque in her presence - I know the signature of Mr. Ward. I am in the habit of paying drafts which he draws - I consider this a very good imitation of his handwriting so that on mak<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050063"/>ing inquiry I was authorised to pay the cheque, and asked the prisoner how she would receive it - she said two twenties and four fives, or to that effect - I paid her two 20l. Bank notes, four 5l. notes, and 5s. in silver - she was in the banking house, for ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour - she answered to my questions quite readily; I paid her and she left.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She said, she would take two twenties and four fives did she? A. Yes, that was the way I paid her; I have not the least doubt she asked for the notes I gave her - I am not sure whether she answered "two twenties and four fives," or whether I asked her if she would have it in that way; I have not a doubt but she asked for two twenties and four fives; I will be positive she did ask for those particular notes, in the way I paid her - I cannot say whether she said she would have it so, or whether I asked her; I am aware that the prisoner's defence is weakness of intellect.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you in the habit of suggesting what money cheques shall be paid in? A. Frequently parties say how they will have it, and if they do not say what they will have, we suggest it to them.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did she mention the description of notes, or did you suggest it? A. I have no doubt she did ask for the notes I paid her, for at the time I was paying it she inquired of me if it was in time to send money by the Portsmouth mail, and I considered she wanted small notes to inclose in a letter - I will swear she used the words two twenties and four fives; I am sure of it; I have not a doubt in my mind, that she asked for the particular notes I paid her, that she said, "Give me two twenties and four fives"; I have not a doubt of it - I have no doubt it was paid in the way she asked for it, but whether she said two twenties, or two 20l. notes I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, if she asked for any notes at all, did not she say "two 20l. notes and four 5l. notes," if she used any phrase at all about the notes? A. I cannot tell her exact words.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q."Twenties" and "fives" is a phrase used in banking-houses, to denote notes of that amount? A. Yes; she inquired if she was in time to send money by the mail; this was while I was paying her the notes - she asked when the Portsmouth mail went off - it was about three o'clock.</p>

I remember seeing the prisoner in our shop, on Wednesday, the 26th of June, at near three o'clock in the afternoon; she asked the price of a gingham dress; she did not bargain for anything; she then asked for a pen and ink - she made no purchase in our shop - at her desire, Davies, a person in our employ was sent to Messrs.

            . I am an officer. On the 26th of June I took the prisoner into custody; she was pointed out to me, and as soon as she saw me making towards her she attempted to run away; I caught her at the end of Fenchurch-street, and took her there - I inquired the charge from the last witness; he said it was for a forgery on Hankeys; I took her to the Mansion-house, and searched her - before I searched her I saw her thrust her hand into her pocket, in a hurried way, and immediately took hold of her right arm - I found her fist clenched and opened it with great difficulty, and there found two 20l. and four 5l. notes; I marked the notes and delivered them to Mr. Cope, the marshall; I marked them on the 27th, before they were out of my custody - I will not swear they were not out of my hands before I marked them, but they were not out of my sight - I believe they were not out of my hands; I believe Mr. Bush the solicitor, looked at them in my hands - I considered myself responsible for them, and that I ought not to lose sight of them; I believe Mr. Bush saw them in my hands - I have no recollection of delivering them into any person's hands; I do not believe I did; I was at the Mansion-house - I have no recollection of delivering them, (the notes,) there to anybody; but that was the following day, and I had marked them on the day I took them - before I went to the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>MR. DAWSON. Q. Take these notes in your hand and say whether they are the notes? A. They are the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What do you call them? A. Two 20l. notes and four 5l. notes - she put her hand into her pocket openly, so as I could see her; I was in my police dress at the time, and close to her; she must have seen me.</p>

               <p>Q. She did not attempt to swallow them? A. I did not give her that opportunity; I supposed her to be between forty and fifty years old at that time, but she is very much altered since.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SIMPSON re-examined. I only entered the numbers of the notes which I paid, not the dates, the numbers are 5l., 23,222; 23,223; 15,874; 15,578 - and the 20l. 10,695, and 813; the notes produced are those numbers.(The Cheque was here put in and read.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner being repeatedly desired by the Court and by her Counsel to enter upon her defence; made no reply for some time; but at last said, "The four corners of the earth and the strength of the hills is his also." "I said, they were all going down to the Red Sea." During the whole trial she kept distorting her feautures, working her fingers about, and conducting herself in an incoherent manner.</p>

            . I am the daughter of the prisoner. Some time ago my mother was carrying on business at Woolwich - I think she left it in the year 1831 - she had been carrying it on two or three years before - the house was once burnt down; my mother slept at the top of the house; I was not in the house at the time of the fire - my mother's conduct has been very strange indeed, occasionally; I have many times heard her threaten to put an end to herself; sometimes she said, she would hang herself; at other times, she said, she would cut her throat; we were always very much terrified at her threats.</p>
               <p>Q. What grounds did she allege for hanging herself or cutting her throat? A. The least irritation in her family; she has behaved very violently towards us; she used to throw herself upon the ground, when she went off in these fits; and I used to be afraid she would injure herself very much, by so doing; throwing herself about with very great violence; since the fire, I think the business has not been so good; I assist occasionally in the business.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who conducted the business? A. My mother.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you with her when she kept the Northumberland Arms? A. Occasionally; I remember her taking a public-house, in London; she kept that only four months before she threw it up again - I never knew of any expectations we had of a large estate - I have seen her look as she does now, on many occasions, when throwing herself about, only not looking so ill; but she has exhibited that kind of manner many times - I must beg to say, at the Northumberland Arms, I irritated her slightly - I was going up stairs, and she would have thrown me down if I had not caught by the bannisters; I had given her very trifling irritation.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then the way she conducted herself at the Northumberland Arms was by violence? A. Yes; generally after the violence was over, perhaps she would turn to the action and manner she does now; I have seen her use her hands as she does now, before she was in custody, after the violence was over.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you bring her to herself? A. We would keep her quiet a little while; being desirous nobody should see her in that state, I kept her as quiet as possible; I sometimes made her sit down, and sometimes lie down, and then I humoured her; the rest of the family saw her in that state; but I was particular that the world should not see her.</p>
               <p>Q. You suffered her to go on, and conduct the business as usual? A. Yes; she had the whole management of the business; to pay and receive money; she cast up accounts; saw the customers; she drew bills, and accepted bills - I occasionally thought she managed her business in a very strange way.</p>
               <p>Q. What instances can you state of any blunders in her business? A. In the management of her house she was anxious to remove from one place to another; she was never satisfied above a week, or a month, in one house - we removed a number of times on that account - when we left the shop, we moved to a cottage - we lived in the Northumberland Arms four months; and in the other place where she did business, eight years; we lived in several other houses; we moved to Greenhill-cottage, and were there three months; and then in King-street, six months; and in a cottage, at Bow, six months - she did not carry on business at all these places - she had given up the business at the Northumberland Arms - I think it was nearly twelve months; and then she was anxious to go into business, but against our wish, and she took a small concern, merely as we thought, to amuse her mind, it was in Church-street; she kept a grocer's business there; I cannot say whether there were any books kept there.</p>
               <p>Q. Are her affairs at all embarrassed? A. I think she had got into a very strange manner - I had no reason to think she had lost by business, or was in debt.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did your mother lose property at the time of the fire? A. She lost a considerable quantity of property; she was insured - I cannot tell whether she lost property independent of the insurance - yes, she did; it is two years since the fire; I was sixteen years old at the time of the fire - I don't know that she has been unable to pay her bills since.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Were you here yesterday? A. Not in court; I was in the neighbourhood - brought here by my mother's friends; I had told them what I knew about her state of health and mind; I was not examined - I have seen her exhibit the symptoms she does now several times; she has been precisely in this way several times, and has continued so for some hours; it has not always continued for days; I have observed her strange for days, but not violent - I have not seen her in this state for days - I have seen her for hours in the state she is in now; I cannot say whether it has continued a whole day - it has not so violently; I don't think it is many days since she was in this state, indeed the morning she went away, I thought there was a particular strangeness attending her; I was at home that morning; I was under an impression that she was out of her mind for a long time; no medical men were ever called in to see the state of her mind - I did not conceive but what I could attend to her; she went to town alone; I think she walked down the road; she took a parcel with her; she told me she wished to see a gentleman on business in the Kent-road, but at the same time I observed a very great lightness in her manner - she did not tell me she was going to receive a cheque, or that she had received a letter from a friend with a cheque in it; she took the shop that she had at the time this happened, about two months after Christmas; I think she received £1000 from the insurance office after the fire; she lost her stock in trade, books, and every thing - to the best of my knowledge she told me she received £1000 from the insurance office - it was a month after the fire that she received it; it must be more than two years ago; I think it is three years.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time she kept the public-house at Westminster, was your father in a situation at the docks at Woolwich? A. Yes; he never came home in the week, the business was entirely in my mother's management; my father continues to hold the situation at this time - it occupies his time all day; the business at Woolwich was managed by my mother; she saw the tradesmen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050065"/>and purchased the articles - I don't think she gave any credit at that shop; I did not attend to the business, she managed it entirely herself.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was she strange in her conversation and manner, at the same time? A. Yes; she sometimes did extraordinary things when her mind seemed better; on the morning she left home she jumped about very different to what she was accustomed - she moved about the house very quick and light; her husband usually lived with her when he came home, but she slept with me sometimes, for I was afraid of her committing suicide; she first slept with me soon after the fire; I have been afraid of her committing suicide ever since the fire - I never expressed that idea even to my father, but I wished her to sleep with me, as he slept more sound than I did; if she made the least move she would awake me; I often got up and went to her room with some excuse, for fear anything should happen.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you allow her to go to town alone on this day? A. My father was so engaged he could only mind his own business at the docks; I allowed her to go alone for many reasons - we have often said we would not let her go to town alone, but it was driven off from time to time; economy was one reason why we allowed her to go alone: and if I went, I could not transact the business she did, as no gentleman would transact business with a young girl; it was too expensive for me to go with her and I thought she could conduct the business without me; it was of no moment; I thought her competent to transact it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Has the business fallen off? A. It has come down to be not worth the name of business lately; it was a small concern merely to occupy her time; I have a sister, and a brother who is thirteen years old.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's sister. I remember her coming to Worcestershire to see her mother, who was very ill - she came down on purpose to see her in the state of insanity she was in; to the best of my recollection it is upwards of four years ago - she knew my mother was in a state of insanity before she came to see her - a few minutes after she came into the house, she said she must be off again immediately; she said she came to spend the time with her mother; but instead of that she went to a neighbour's house, and spent her time mostly; my mother died in a state of insanity - she was in that state at times we were obliged to tie her down - her grandmother was in a raging state of insanity; she was obliged to be chained, and her aunt was insane several times, and was chained down several times also.</p>

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. How long did she stay when she came to see her mother? A. I believe two days and two nights; her mother was quite incapable of seeing or knowing anybody; she came down alone, travelled by the stage, and took the stage from Pershore home - I cannot say whether she had seen her mother before she said she must go back again; she had not been there many minutes - the neighbour's house is about a quarter of a mile from my mother's; she came backwards and forwards - my mother had five children- the other three are living in good health.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have had no affliction of your mind? A. Not particularly so; my head is very bad at times - I have violent pains in the head at times; I have not got it now; not more than a fortnight since my head was very bad - I have had my hair taken off twice. I remember when the fire happened at my sister's house; the last witness was at my house at the time - it happened the summer before the death of my mother - it is more than four years ago; I live in Worcestershire - I have not been up to town for ten years - I have not seen her since she came to see my mother.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When your mother or grandmother shewed symptoms of insanity, have these symptoms been attended with violence? A. At times, but not always; they have been very quiet at times.</p>
               <p>Q. What strangeness of conduct did they exhibit? A. They could not answer any questions put to them - at times my aunt would assist in business, and be outrageous at times; her business was very trifling; she had a husband living - she very seldom answered rationally; at times, when she was insane, she would appear like other people, but it would be gone in a few minutes; for a few minutes she would be out of it, and then in it immediately - she very seldom would speak when she was in it; I have not been with the prisoner - I never heard of the prisoner being supposed to be insane till she was charged with this.</p>

            . About fifteen months ago I was assistant to the prisoner at the Northumberland Arms - she used to give me directions to dovarious things, and then contradict those directions; I remember her calling me and the female servant up at night - she said there were thieves in the cellar, and she could hear them knock; but we could hear no knocking, though we were in the same room - I remember her on another occasion fancying there were thieves in the chimney, and there was a fire in the grate at the time - she wanted to let the house after she had been in it a week; I always thought she was out of her mind - she went about the house doing what business there was.</p>
               <p>MR. DAWSON. Q. When she said she heard the noise which you did not hear, was her husband living in the house? A. He was not at home, he was at Woolwich - she was in the parlour, and said she heard the noise in the cellar - we stood in the parlour; she called us up about three o'clock in the morning - I was not with her when she first said she heard the noise; she kept us in the parlour, and said she could hear the noise underneath; she then went to bed again - she was in bed and got up, and came down and insisted that she heard the noise- she must have heard it first in her bed-room - on saying we did not hear the noise, she went to bed; I heard her come up after me; she gave very little credit in the house; she had the care of the till - she took care to lock it up, either she or her daughter; it was always locked up every night - I have frequently seen her lock it up - she seemed very careful of it always.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did she persist in it that she heard the noise of thieves knocking? A. She did - we could not hear the slightest knocking all the time she said it was going on.</p>

            . I am assistant to Mr. Hitchcock, a broker, at Woolwich. We let some furniture to the prisoner - I remember last winter calling with Mr. Hitchcock for 3l., which she owed him; she stated, that in a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050066"/>short time she was coming to an estate, and then would discharge that, and return the furniture and buy new furniture - when she came down to us she was dressed quite in an indelicate state, with her bosom quite exposed; she had nothing except a little shawl on the back of her shoulders, and her petticoat and shift on; it was about eleven o'clock in the day; Hitchcock was a grown up man as I am; she did not exhibit the slightest shame at being so exposed; her bosom, down to her waist, was stark naked - I have heard her talk of coming to an estate, at other times.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In what terms did she talk of large property coming to her? A. She said, she had a large sum of money and an estate in the country, coming from some relative - I understood her that it was out of this large estate she was to pay the 3l.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did she pay the 3l.? A. No, never; this was the beginning of last year; it was for the hire of furniture - I called several times for my money, but was not able to get it; I believe I have seen her once since, and asked her for the money; she gave me the same tale, that she was coming to a large estate, and would pay Mr. Hitchcock and buy new furniture.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house did you see her in? A. I was ushered into the parlour, by a servant, and waited for half an hour - I supposed she was not up; she came down to speak to us in that state; she did not present the appearance of a person coming down suddenly, half dressed; she had a flannel petticoat on, and a shawl hastily thrown over her, but had her bosom exposed; she did not come down in a hurried manner - we were not expected to come that day - I cannot say whether she was aware who was to see her when she came down - nobody was in the parlour besides us; it was a private-house, not a public-house; it was in Bow-water-crescent, the servant let us in.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you send the servant up to tell her you were waiting? A. No doubt she told her; I asked for her mistress; she had half an hour to dress, if she chose.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Mr. Hitchcock so deaf that you were obliged to tell him what she said? A. At times he could hear better than at others; I told him what she said.</p>

            . I am a constable. Some time ago, in the early part of last year, I went with some companions to the Northumberland Arms, kept by the prisoner - I went to spend about half an hour there with six or seven more persons; I saw the prisoner there; not one of us spent our money there, for she behaved in that strange way; the most inconsistent way possible - when we called for something she turned her back to us, and we could not get a rational answer; one our party said, "Why bring us here, when we cannot get served;" we asked for liquor again, and were more than half an hour in the house, and then we went to another house, as we could get nothing - four or five strangers left the house also, who were calling for something, and could not get served - I thought nobody in their senses would act so.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Were you a constable of that district? A. No; I had been at the House of Commons, on duty.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe constables expect to be treated with very great respect at public-houses? A. No; there were several persons in the tap-room; one man, with a pipe, wanted a pint of porter, and could not get served; he went out with his pipe - three customers stood at the bar, wishing to be served; when I went in with seven others, we could not get served, and left.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did she turn her back to you instead of turning to you? A. Certainly; I did not see her serve any customers at all; it was about seven o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did she appear to you to be sober? A. I do not think it was the act of a drunken person; I fancied at the time it might be the case, and watched her; she went out of the bar into the tap-room; persons spoke to her there, and she returned to the bar without noticing them; I said, "My good lady have the goodness to attend to us;" having to go back to the House of Commons again, but I could get no answer.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did she reel or stagger as if tipsy? A. Certainly not; I considered her manner to be from wildness of mind - I watched her, thinking her drunk, but my impression was entirely altered before I left the house.</p>

            , ESQ. M.D. I am a physician, and live in Bedford-row - I have been twenty-five years in the profession; I have had considerable experience in cases of insanity, having been connected for the last five or six years with a lunatic establishment - I attended at the prison at the request of the prisoner's relatives, to ascertain the state of her mind - I examined her three times; I had some suspicion of acting at first - I endeavoured to ascertain as accurately as possible, if that suspicion was correct - I have heard the evidence of the witnesses - from what they have stated, and from my own observation, I should say her intellect is by no means such as would be considered sound; I should say she is in a state of feeble intellect - I should consider her an irresponsible being.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you be at all surprised at her committing suicide? A. No, I should not be surprised at it - I have written on the subject of insanity - I distinctly state and maintain there is no possibility of drawing the line precisely between sanity and insanity; that assuming a point of sanity, is assuming a point which cannot exist - it is not possible, in my opinion, to point out where sanity ends, and insanity begins - a person may be perfectly sane for a week, and next week quite the reverse.</p>
               <p>Q. There have been, I believe, instances in this kingdom, in which the mind has gone all at once, and returned, and very high duties have been performed? A. Certainly.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. That being the case, would you not judge of the state of mind, by the degree of contrivance exhibited at the time of a transaction; should you deem a person<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050067"/>insane who appeared aware of what he was about, and contrived and took measures for his own benefit? A. I cannot say that an act itself sane, might not be coupled with insanity.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard of the prisoner obtaining a writing, and presenting one resembling it, and obtaining through that, a sum for her own benefit? A. I have heard of aberration of mind, being manifested before that took place - I can conceive a great deal of contrivance in the process of effecting a design.</p>
               <p>Q. Would such a degree of contrivance be consistent with imbecility or idiotcy; would it be consistent with the absence of reason? A. Among my patients at the Institution, they have gone through the process of reasoning for the object they have in desire, as a sane person would - the act itself, I should not call an act of insanity, but should conclude that an individual being insane, could perform that act; there may be considerable imbecility of mind, and yet the process of reasoning exist - I conceive it possible for an individual to act as the prisoner did with respect to this cheque, without knowing the degree of responsibility under which she herself must stand in reference to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not within your experience, that many persons partially insane, are perfectly capable of knowing they are doing a wrong act? A. That more refers to cases of monomania.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you conceive all this stratagem might be employed without a consciousness of there being anything wrong in it? A. I conceive it possible, having seen several instances where the object has been of less importance, where the same process has gone on - I merely allude to this as matter of opinion and comparison - I should not pronounce that the prisoner was positively unconscious of a deviation from moral rectitude.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you hesitate to say that this act of the prisoner could be any other than the act of a reasonable mind? A. I could conceive it, and from the circumstances of the case, I must unequivocally state, I should feel a reluctance in condemning her - the motive would considerably influence my opinion, but it is impossible to state what the motive really was - persons partially insane at intervals, are perfectly competent and sane at others.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you not judge of the state of mind by the act - supposing a person executed a will in every respect as a person of sound mind, would it not lead you to conceive it was made in a sound state of mind? A. That would be a circumstance, but it would not be conclusive.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You have heard the evidence of her conduct within the last four years, and observed her yourself, and heard that her grandmother and aunt died in a state of insanity, and the aunt raving mad; do you think that at any time within the last two years, it would be safe to trust her, or that you would trust her with the management of property? A. Certainly not; nor should I think any instrument she executed was valid - I think there are no proofs of her insanity at the time in question; I don't think she was in a state to distinguish right from wrong at the time of this affair.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you hear the witnesses examined yesterday after you had given your evidence? A. I did; I heard Mr. Mc Murdo examined - I have already admitted there was a good deal of feigning; when I saw her in Newgate she appeared sensible of the importance of establishing her insanity; I saw her a second time, and still considered she was feigning; I had some conversation with her solicitor and her friends before the third interview - my opinion became modified at the third interview; I am not prepared to say she is decidedly insane - my opinion of her insanity is fully as strong as it was yesterday, and stronger; as I have heard the evidence on both sides; the evidence given of her sanity did not weaken my opinion in the least - when there is any symptom of insanity, we cannot suppose a person accountable - I should not admit the act performed by the prisoner was itself insane, but if the party was insane the day or week before I should say the act though apparently a rational one, might be the act of an insane person; when we take into account the exceeding cunning connected with mental aberration, especially where there is an intention to accomplish an object - supposing her to be insane before, I do not think the transaction the result of insanity, but consistent with insanity.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you known persons labouring under insanity pursue an object with a cunning you would only expect from very clever persons? A. Certainly; in the only instance of suicide which has occurred since I have been physician of the Asylum at Peckham, the cunning evinced for months and weeks to accomplish the purpose would surprise every body.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. But that was an insane object? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Whether the object was to the person's interest or prejudice, have you known instances of their endeavouring to effect their purpose, by means quite as cunning as you would expect from the highest order of intellect? A. Certainly; I should say the object in view had some supposed good in contemplation.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is not the very act of suicide a symptom of insanity? A. With submission, I do not entirely admit that; it evinces an absence of moral principle, but that is delinquency - I should say insanity prevented the individual from being fully sensible of the delinquency; I should not allow a man to be insane that went from the gaming table and blew his brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. Where the object is obviously beneficial to the parties, and they pursue every reasonable means to accomplish it, is it not evidence of sanity rather than insanity? A. It is abstractedly, but it might be quite the reverse.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you judge of a lucid interval except from the conduct of the party? A. It must last for a long time before I could guarantee its long continuance; you cannot always determine an apparently lucid interval correctly, but if it lasts a long time from acts of insanity, I should determine it to be a lucid interval; it would require a very long probation.</p>
               <p>Q. When a person acts with reference to the transaction in question, exactly as anybody else would do, why do you pronounce that person insane? A. Because we have heard the person was insane before in other instances - I do not come here as an advocate, nor do I positively say she was not conscious of the delinquency of the vact.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there anything beyond what you have heard that leads you to suppose her deranged; is there anything constitutional? A. I never could discover her breath to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050068"/>be in a fetid state, which is usually a characterestic feature of insanity.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN called the following witness.</p>

            . I am an apothecary, at Woolwich, a graduate in medicine. I have attended the prisoner's family as a medical attendant - I was never called to attend her on the score of madness - I always considered her perfectly sound in mind; I saw her in June last I think; it was in June or the end of May; I saw her at her own house, and had some conversation with her relative to the receipt of some money she was to receive from a friend of her's, and was to deliver to me - she had not then received the money, but I had understood she had, and had a conversation with her on the subject, and on some other affairs relative to the family, from whom it was to come - she explained the circumstances how she was to receive the money, and explained my mistake, why she had not it ready for me - it was a mistake on my part, and she explained it - from that conversation I should say she was perfectly sound in mind, as I have witnessed on former occasions; I have known her seven or eight years - I have been the medical attendant of the family during the whole of that time - in my opinion, her mind, during the whole of that time, has been perfectly correct and sound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you heard the evidence given to day? A. I have; I cannot say it shakes my opinion; it creates a degree of doubt, but in a very minute degree - such a degree of doubt, that from such circumstances, I should not form any opinion, unless, as I stated before, I was in possession of circumstances connected with each fact enabling me to conclude - I said, yesterday, that it would shake my opinion; but I modified my answer in the same manner, that it would shake my opinion, if unexplained - I said so to the best of my belief; and that her grandmother, mother, and aunt dying in a state of raving insanity - her coming down to two young men with her person exposed, and her imagining thieves were in the chimney, while there was a fire in the grate - and that there was a knocking underneath, when others could not hear, was inconsistent with other facts - I did not say absolutely that it would shake my opinion - I said the mere facts would, without any explanatory facts, which might be offered - I came here to deliver the truth - I said, I was a graduate in medicine, by which I meant doctor of medicine - I considered doctor of medicine would be understood by that - I consider them synonymous - I have been in practice above ten years - I was graduated in Edinburgh - I am not a member of the College of Physicians, in London - I have no connexion with any insane institution - my practice has not been considerable in public institutions for insane persons; I have had under my own hands several cases - I cannot answer at the moment how many I have had within ten years - I have one under treatment at this instant, an individual residing at Woolwich - I will not swear whether I have had five in this year or not - I believe Dr. Uwins has an experience of two hundred a week - I did not visit the prisoner in prison - I consider a disorder of some intellectual faculty, a symptom of insanity - monomania, is insanity, relative to one particular subject, distinguished from a disordered intellect relative to all affairs.</p>

               <p>Q. In a person proved clearly insane at one time, do you think it easy to distinguish when the process of insanity ceased? A. Unless I had some evident proof in language, or wandering of thought, or particular conduct, I should not form an opinion on the subject; it is known that insane persons have pursued an object of self-interest with a degree of cunning which belongs to very few except the most exalted talents; but I should distinguish the conduct she exhibited at the time, compared with previous conduct - the conduct of the prisoner previously, would determine me as to the state of mind at the time - I consider a person sane at the time, whose conduct is sane, and whose view of things is the same as persons in their ordinary senses.</p>
               <p>Q. If they were a little mad before and after, would not that influence you? A. It would depend on the conduct at the time; I know of no means but comparison - I have visited Miles' mad-house, at Hoxton, with a view to place a person there - my reading on insanity has been cursory; I have read Dr. Burrows' work.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You think the conduct of the individual would determine your opinion of the state of mind at the time? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live at Woolwich. I have been acquainted with the prisoner fourteen or fifteen years; I had frequent opportunities of seeing her; I had transactions with her in business, and have lent her money - about nine years ago I lent her 100l. to take a shop; the first application was from her, and then she and her husband; came both together; she told me the purpose she wanted it for - she and her husband were both together when I advanced the money; my acquaintance continued till within three or four weeks of this matter - in all my intercourse with her she has appeared to conduct herself like a rational person; there was nothing in her conduct to induce me to suppose that she was a person who could not distinguish right from wrong.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Should you not be surprised at her coming down stairs to two men with her neck bare? A. Yes; I should think it an act of indecency quite inconsistent with correctness of mind; it would appear as if she was going rather astray - it would appear strange if she had told me there were thieves in the chimney while there was a fire in the grate - I saw her every day; her habits were those of a regular, quiet, decent woman; a woman as fit for business as any woman in the world; she conducted the whole business herself.</p>
               <p>Q. If she turned her back on seven customers and obliged them to leave, should you not think she was going a little astray? A. Yes; it never was the case when she was at Woolwich; I should imagine if she had done that thirteen months ago, she was a very different woman to what she was when I knew her - I am not much acquainted with subjects of insanity.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. These circumstances would strike you as strange, but if afterwards she conducted herself as before, would that impression be removed? A. It might be so.</p>

            . I live at Deptford; I am a grocer. I have known the prisoner about fourteen years; I have had considerable dealings with her in business; she managed the business at Woolwich, her husband never interfered; she failed in 1830 - I knew her before that; I knew her previous to the fire; and by referring to my ledger to-day, I find from 1826, until the time of the fire, I had very considerable transactions with her - I have known her since the fire, up to the present time - before, and since the fire, I have from time to time, been concerned with her in business, but not the whole time - my dealings have generally been with her, or my young man has dealt with her; she conducted herself always as a very rational, and very clever woman in business; she gave her orders, and depended on my honour to serve her; she gave orders in a business-like manner - she paid me in money; she may have paid me bills, but I never drew bills on her - I frequently settled accounts with her; she understood them as far as was necessary in her business - at the time of the fire, having received money from the fire-office, she came and paid her debts, and then commenced again; and at that period, I had a very high opinion of her, and opened a new account; she gave me an order to the amount of 160l., and since that she has failed at the expiration of one year, in November, 1830 - on the 13th of February last, she called to open a new account with me, after having failed twice - I declined taking her order until security was offered - she was with me an hour or two; securities were proposed by herself; she named them - she brought her brother to my house as security, and I did not accept it; that was on another day - during these transactions, she appeared perfectly conscious of what she was doing.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Within what time did she fail twice? A. She failed in 1830, and again about twelve months ago - she failed in 1830 and 1832 - she had been in business a long time before - she never wanted to borrow money of me; it was because I did not approve of the security that I would not open a fresh account with her; if it had been only 5l. I would not have given her credit for it, nor for 1d. not at that time - she has had a reverse of fortune - I trusted her for a year after the fire and she failed again - it was in February last - I would not trust her, as I have lost 170l. by her - I considered she had treated me ill - I trusted her after 1830, to the amount of 7l.; 5l. of which has not been paid; I thought her not trustworthy in February last.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. In February last did you call her attention to the 5l.? A. I did, and she said she would pay it some day; when she failed, her brother proposed to pay 5s. in the pound for her; she attended and explained the state of her affairs to her creditors, but not at all to their satisfaction; she explained it so as to make them understand it would be best to take the 5s.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What should you think of her stripping and showing her naked bosom? A. It would appear very indelicate - it would appear rather strange if she attempted to persuade me there were thieves in a chimney and a fire in the grate; I have spoken to her within the last two months, prior to her committal, and I have spoken to her in this court, and at the last sessions, and up to within a week of her committal; she appeared a perfectly modest woman, and particularly acute and intelligent.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you not be astonished at her turning her back against seven customers and driving them out of the place without taking their money? A.

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you state yesterday that on one occasion she appeared to you to be strange in her manner? A. Yes; she came to open an account with me six months ago, I declined opening the account several times, till at last she brought security - I stated I thought she was not capable of managing her business, and I declined it, because she appeared so exceedingly strange,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050070"/>and exhibited such conduct, begging for goods, and crying, and making such exclamations; her manner was quite incoherent - I asked who was going to assist her in business, she said her daughter - her manner appeared very much changed from that of her usual manner - I was subpoened to attend on the part of the prosecution.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What sort of exclamation did she make use of, was it the importunity of begging you to trust her? A. It might arise from that, she called repeatedly for a fortnight, and seemed very anxious to be served with goods, imploring me to give her credit, and that it should be paid - she did not complain of being refused credit elsewhere - she begged I would send goods in, and she would pay me at the regular time - she seemed very much distressed at my making a difficulty about it, and went about the room for an hour together, wringing her hands and crying - I gave her credit at last - she was very different when she obtained her object, she then appeared milder; she appeared thankful, and expressed herself so - she said she was going to have goods at a cheesemongers - she might have probably said it was important for her to have the goods - I let her have them, because I got security for them - at one time the daughter came, the only words the daughter used were, "We had better go away, Mr. Danby declines to give credit," and the prisoner said she hoped I should change my mind.</p>

            . I am the medical man employed in the gaol. My attention has been called to the prisoner since she has been confined, as to whether she was sane or otherwise - I was examined yesterday, and said I would rather not give a positive opinion, but rather thought she was feigning; since that I have taken particular pains to ascertain her state of mind, and from information I have received in her presence to-day, I should say I consider her to be positively of sane mind - I was told in her presence of observations she has made relative to her trial; she made no observations to me about it, nor in my presence - I told her what I had heard of her since yesterday, and of what she had said; she appeared to understand me, but would not answer - I told her that she had said to one of the nurses, "I know all that has passed in the Court," and I said, "I understand, Mrs. Wratten, although you behaved well to Mrs. Ruthven up to this time, yet in consequence of her evidence to-day, you have behaved ill to her, striking her, and threatening her daughter, by which it appears you fully understood her evidence;" she made no observation, but she did not make the motion of her eye, or the distortion of her face, as she does now; she appeared to know what I was saying, but would not answer me - I have observed her manner at the bar, she can conduct herself different at times in the gaol; and when I was sitting in the box just now, the moment I spoke to her, to try the effect of my observation, she instantly began to assume the position of the eye, which has been observed; she was perfectly right before, and she began moving her mouth as she does now.</p>
               <p>Q. Then from your observations, and from what passed, you are of opinion she is not insane, but of sound mind? A. That is my opinion; I did not like to give so decided an opinion yesterday, as I heard some of her relatives have been mad, and we have understood that madness is hereditary.</p>

I am superintendant in the infirmary in Newgate; my attention has been directed to the prisoner; she has been principally under my care; she never spoke to me until the day before yesterday - she then came into my room, and seemed very cold; I asked her to sit down and warm herself, which she did, and she then said she should like to tell me all about it - I asked what she meant, and told her I wished she would tell me about it; she then turned round and went out of the room; and yesterday when she came out of Court, she came up stairs in a dreadful rage, and kicked over a bucket of water; I said if she behaved so she must have on a straight jacket - she kicked me and became quite outrageous; afterwards she came into my room, and was dreadfully abusive to me; saying it was all my doing, that I was the wretch who had done it; she did not say what; I had been examined yesterday as to my observation of her conduct.</p>
               <p>Q. From the observations you made of her conduct and demeanour, do you believe her insane or of sound mind? A. I shall always think she is of sound mind; I really do - but I think she has been greatly distressed in mind owing to her situation; she said she was quite aware of everything that was going on in court yesterday; and I mentioned it to Mr. McMurdo before her to-day; she made no reply whatever.</p>

            . I am a sub-matron; I have seen the prisoner several times - I considered she was not quite right in her mind, but likewise considered she assumed a great deal more than is really the case; I am of that opinion still; I have spoken to her repeatedly, she has not given me any answer; I have found, when she has thought she was not observed, that she has been calm and collected in appearance; but when she knew she was observed, or I found she knew she was observed, she put on all these grimaces and actions; I saw her after coming out of court yesterday - I heard her making a great noise calling out murder; I went up and saw her confined down on the bed, she had kicked over a bucket of water, and was very refractory; she has been violent at times before, and had the straight waistcoat on; but she was much more violent when she came out of court than I had ever seen her before.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I received a service of china from Mr. Powell - I took the prisoner Cooper into custody at the Hope public-house, in Blackman-street, Clare-market - when he was at the office, he said, he had the china on commission from a person named Pritchard - Pritchard was then in custody- Cooper said he received it to sell, and he was to have a per centage on it - and he had soldit to a Scotch captain named Wilkinson, who was gone to Scotland - he had sold him two services at the Edinbro' Castle, in Swithin's-lane, and that he had met him on the French-walk, Royal Exchange - he described his person, but he did not know where to find him, and he did not say what he gave him for it - I told him I knew he was telling me an untruth, and I asked him if it was not at Mr. Knight's, he said, no, it had been taken there, but did not remain there an hour, and had not been unpacked there.</p>

            . I keep a livery stables in Wellington-street, Blackfriars-road - I have known the prisoner Cooper about four years, he showed me four patterns of cups and saucers about ten weeks ago, he said, he had them for sale - this pattern was not one of them - but he showed me this a day or two before he was taken, and I purchased it of him for 2l. 8s. the complete set - I am not a Scotch captain - I delivered the same china to Mr. Powell.</p>
               <p>Cooper. Q. Was there not an account between us? A. Yes, I was to give 2l. 8s. for the china, and 10s. was to be set off the debt you owed me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know what Cooper was? A. I considered him a general agent - I employed him to get several debts in for me, and so did others.</p>
               <p>Cooper's Defence. I have known Pritchard for thirty years, and had several dealings with him - I met with him at the Hope public-house, and asked him if I could have some patterns of tea services - he said if I called he would give me some at the warehouse - I called and some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050072"/>patterns were given to me - I showed them to some persons and among the rest was Mr. Knight - he asked the price, I said, five guineas - he said, that was too high for him, but if I should have any about three guineas, he should have no objection to treat with me - I returned those patterns, and had some other patterns which I showed to several persons, and among others to Mr. Knight - he selected this pattern, and I asked him 3l. for it, he said, he would give me 2l. 8s. and take 10s off an account which I owed him - the price Pritchard told me for this set was three guineas, and twenty per cent, off for cash, which reduced it to 2l. 8s., so that I got 10s. by the sale - I then went to the warehouse, and told Pritchard to get them packed up and sent for me, according to the direction, which he did, and I signed the book - if I had known they had been stolen I could have got them away without having a book signed- because when the book goes back I know it is looked over, and the cash book examined to see if the money is entered for them, and the goods are entered in the daybook - when I received the money, I went and paid Pritchard 2l. 8s. which he acknowledged before the magistrate that he had received.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How old are you? A. Twenty-eight; I have been a hawker half a year - before that I worked as a journeyman shoemaker in London; I am not fond of wagers - the prisoners were strangers to me; it was in the absence of the man that laid the lock on the table that I opened it - I did not tell him that I had opened it, but Cooke said I was entitled to the fifty guineas for opening it.</p>
               <p>Q. As you had such an objection to laying wagers, how came you to suffer yourself to be persuaded to lay 24l. with strangers, that you could open a lock which you had in fact opened before? A. Because I considered them to be honest people, and I thought I should not lose any thing by it; there was no money on their side offered, only my money was on the table - I did not ask to have any deposit from them; I have been in partnership with my friend Schenkolowski nine months; the two Bank notes and four sovereigns were mine, and the ten sovereigns were his, but it is all one money; when he comes to me, he is bound to give all the money into my hands, and I buy goods with it, but I have to give him an account of what I do with the money - I can ask him at any time to give his money into my hands; I had met him three weeks before at Liverpool, and he came to Uxbridge the same day that I did - when I went into partnership with him, he gave me six sovereigns; I furnished his box - he now pays me half the profit he gains, and I give him the third part of what I gain; the prisoner Burrell had the money in his hand - I did not try to open the lock after it was changed.</p>

            . I was at the Jolly Ostlers, and saw the two witnesses and the two prisoners there, and a third man; they were looking at a lock when I went in; I saw the prosecutor put the money on the table, and it was afterwards delivered into Burrell's hand; I cannot say by whom.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the prosecutor object to lay any wager? A. By appearance, he was as willing to lay as the other; I did not hear him say he would not - Burrell was appointed the stakeholder; I did not see any other money but the prosecutor's - when I went in, the whole of them were sitting looking at the lock; the man who is not in custody then went out, and when he came in again, he said he would bet 50l. that no one could open that look but himself and the man that made it; he appeared a stranger to the prosecutor; I then understood that the prosecutor made a wager with that other man of 12l., that he would open the lock before Cooke could mark 20 on the table with his finger; that was agreed to, and then the man said to the prosecutor, "If you lose your money will you be offended;" the prosecutor said "No" - Cooke then began to count twenty; I heard him count as far as twelve; whether he counted any more, I do not know; I then heard a quarrel, and the money was taken off the table by some one, and put into Burrell's hand; I had not seen the lock changed, though I was close to it - I did not see the prosecutor fight, nor did I see him beaten; I remained in the house, and assisted in securing the shutters inside as they were afraid the windows would be broken, as there was such a mob - it did not appear to me that the prisoners were any parties to the wager, except Burrell being appointed to hold the stakes.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Who took the money off the table? A. I could not say; it was put into Burrell's hand - I saw Cooke without his coat when he came back and was searched; I heard one of them complain that he was beaten; I do not know whether it was the prosecutor or his friend.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you swear before the magistrate that you believed the man had swallowed twelve<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050074"/>sovereigns? A. No; I said I believed the man had swallowed some, but I never said how many - that was Cooke - I confined him in the cage; I did not give him any medicine - I did not know that I had a right to do so; I told the magistrate I had taken him by the throat, and made him make a gurgling noise, but that was not the reason I thought he had swallowed the sovereigns- I thought I saw him put something into his mouth; I think I took the thimbles from Burrell, I will not be certain - we took them into a public-house, and it was so crowded I could hardly tell who we took them from; I do not know that I said I took them from Burrell - I cannot call to mind what I said before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>COURT. The deposition states "I took them from Cooke." Witness. I will swear I took them from Cooke- I went before the magistrate the next day, or next but one - I am sure what I then stated was correct.</p>
               <p>Cooke's Defence (written). I was on my road to Oxford. I called to have a pint of beer at the sign of the Jolly Ostlers. I saw several persons making a wager about opening a small lock. I saw Frideberg with the lock in his hand, and while the person who owned the lock went to the bar for something, I saw Frideberg asked him if he would show him the way to open it. The person who owned it then said, that the maker would forfeit 50l. to any person who could open it. I remarked that Frideberg was entitled to the 50l. when he pinched me on the knee, and said, "Do not say any thing;" he then offered to bet a sovereign that he would open it before twenty was counted. The owner then said, if he disputed his word, he would bet him 50l. that he could not open it while twenty was counted. Frideberg then pulled out ten sovereigns, and asked his partner for all he had, when he took out two sovereigns from his partner for all he had, when he took pounds aside; it being agreed to by both parties that neither should grumble at losing, or if they did to forfeit a pint of gin for the good of the company. The parties then directed me to count the twenty, which I agreed to do with my finger on the table: at the same time Frideberg kept the lock in his hand, not allowing any person to touch it. Burrell was then called from the other side of the room to hold the stakes, the person who owned the lock placed three 5l. notes first, and Frideberg taking twelve sovereigns off the table placed them into his hand upon the notes, making 24l. for the winner. I then counted the twenty out, when the winner insisted upon taking the money from Burrell's hand, saying he had won it fairly, leaving the room soon after. Frideberg then accused me of counting the twenty too quick; his partner then asked me to go with him to look after the man who had got the money. I went with him down the street as far as the Wheels, when he inquired of a butcher who stood there of the name of Freeman, if he had seen a man go that way with a scratch on his nose, and dressed in black; the butcher replied No. The prosecutor was going away several yards from me, and turned back saying, "You are one of the party". I went with him back to the Jolly Ostlers, when Frideberg and his partner both began to ill use me, by tearing my coat from my back, until I was glad to get away from them. I was going round the market-place, when I saw the person who had taken the money from Burrell. I ran after him, and called out stop him; the constable came and took me. I never had a lock in my hand, or money, nor was I aware of doing any thing wrong.</p>
               <p>Burrell's Defence (written). I travel with lace. On the evening mentioned, I took lodgings at the Jolly Ostlers at Uxbridge; I had not been long there, before I heard a conversation between these persons respecting the opening of a small lock; I heard Frideberg offer to bet twelve sovereigns (all the money himself and partner had) that he would open the lock before twenty was counted; the wager of 12l. aside was agreed to. I was called by Frideberg to hold the money, from the opposite side of the room, which I at first objected to, but was still pressed upon by both parties to hold it. The person who owned the lock put three five pound notes into my hand. Frideberg placing twelve sovereigns into my hand upon the notes, told me to give 24l. to the winner. Twenty was then counted out by Cooke, when the winner insisted upon taking the money from my hand, and soon after left. Frideberg then came upon me for the money, saying the twenty was counted too quick. I told him I did not exactly understand the wager, but the winner insisted upon taking the money. I remained in the room some time after, but from the confusion that was made by the prosecutors, I walked over to the opposite house; when I had been there about half an hour, the constables came and took me.</p>

             (police-constable E 161). On the 8th of July, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw a mare in Gray's-inn-road - the prisoner Smith was leading her with a rope halter - I asked him what he was going to do with it; he said, he wanted a pound or a green-yard to put it into; he said, he had had it given him to hold, in St. Paul's church-yard - I asked where he lived, he said, in the Dover-road; I asked him again, soon after he said, in the Waterloo-road; and then, at another time, in the Kent-road - this satisfied me that things were not right - and I took him to the station-house - he was taken before the magistrate and was ordered for reexamination, and during that time the other officer found the owner of the mare - he saw it on the Tuesday following, in the green-yard, where I had put it.</p>

            . I was at the bar of the White Hart, at Battle-bridge. On Monday, the 8th of July, and Brooks came and asked if I would tell him where a horse-dealer lived; I said there was one named Allen, he said, it was not him he wanted, it was one named Ball, I said, he lived up Edward-street.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence (written). My fellow-prisoner, Brooks, is perfectly innocent, and I should not like to see an innocent man suffer for the guilty one. On the 5th of July, I went to Kennington-common to see a cricket-match; I had not long been there when a man came to me that I knew by the nickname of Toney, living at Croydon: he asked me if I would earn a shilling; I said I had no objection. He then said,"Come with me;" he took me to a field at the back of Kennington-common, and showed me four or five horses, and said that one of them was his own. He took me to a public-house and gave me some bread and cheese, and a pint of beer; we sat talking until nine o'clock at night: he then said, "You must go, and that horse that I showed you this afternoon, you must fetch here to me." I accordingly went to the field and took the horse from the rest, and took it to him. He then said "That is right, I want you to take it to Mr. Adams," he gave me the direction, and then left me with the horse. I proceeded leading the horse to the Dover-road; I forgot the direction that he gave me; I asked a man if he could tell me where a person by the name of Adams lived, a horse-dealer; he said he did not know. I then asked him if he would hold the horse while I got information where Mr. Adams lived; he said, yes; I gave him the price of a pint of beer and went into Kent-street; the first person that I saw was my fellow-prisoner, Brooks, sitting at a door along with two women, I afterwards learned one was his wife. I asked him if he could tell me where Mr. Adams, a horse-dealer, lived; he told me that Mr. Adams lived in the Old Kent-road. I then said,"If you will give me the direction right, I will treat you with a glass of gin:" he gave me the direction, and I gave him the gin. I never saw him in my life before that night about half-past ten o'clock. I could not find the man that I was with on the afternoon previous. I took the horse to a field and tried to find the man that sent me, but I could not find him; and on Monday the 8th instant, I was about taking the horse to the green-yard, and was taken prisoner.</p>

               <p>Brook's Defence (written). I was sitting on a chair at the door of my house with my wife and my landlord's daughter; a lad came and asked me if I knew a person by the name of Adams or Allen, a horse-dealer. I told him that I knew a man by the name of Adams, and that he lived in the Old Kent-road; he then said if I would direct him right, he would treat me with a glass of gin. I gave him the right direction; he then said, "Come along with me, and I will give you the gin." I walked with him about an hundred yards from the house that I live in, and up a turning I saw a horse tied to some paling; he, the lad, untied the horse, and we both proceeded the same way back that we went: I saw a policeman that I know by the name of

            , standing at the corner of the turning that the horse was in, I also saw him on my return. He, the policeman, said, "Whose horse is that." I told him it belonged to a Mr. Adams.

            , then said, "It is a good job that you have come for it as you have, as I should have taken it to the green-yard;" we both left him, the lad leading the horse to the first public-house we came to; I drank a glass of gin with him; I then left him. On Monday, the 8th instant, Brewin came to my house and inquired if I was at home, my wife said I was not. I came home in about ten minutes, my wife told me I was wanted by Mr. Brewin, the policeman. I went directly to him in the Dover-road, where he had left word I was to meet him: he said,</p>
               <p>"I only wanted to know what sort of a horse that was, that I saw you and another man with on Friday night last." I gave him the description of the horse as well as I could, and that a lad came to me and asked me for a Mr. Adams, or Allen, and I directed him to Mr. Adams living in the Old Kent-road; he then said, "Do you know the lad?" I told him I never saw him in my life before. He said there was a man close by that had lost a mare, and by the description that he gave of the one that he had lost, it answered to this one. On Tuesday, the 9th instant, a man came to me and told me, that he came from a young man that was a prisoner in Clerkenwell New Prison; and that he, the prisoner, sent him to tell me that he wanted to see me; I said I did not know any person that was in prison - he said that the prisoner's name was Smith, and he himself was a prisoner in the same prison, and had just got liberated; he then said,"You are my prisoner." I asked upon what charge; he said,"On suspicion of stealing a horse." I knew that I was innocent; I went with him to Hatton-garden office. I was removed from the office to Clerkenwell New Prison. The lad that came to me to ask the above questions, I saw in the class that I was placed in; I recognised him to be the same that I saw before. I asked him what he was placed in the prison for; he said, "For stealing a mare;" I immediately said, "Why you are the lad that came to me on Friday night;" he said, that he was, and asked me what I was sent to prisoner for; I told him that it was through him that I was sent to prison. He asked how the officers came to take me into custody; I told him that it was through going with him to have the gin that he gave me for giving him the direction that he asked for. He said, that he was sorry I should suffer for his crime that he had committed; and also said that he would clear me before the magistrates. I told him that, it was his place to do so, as he knew I was innocent. On Saturday, the 13th instant, we were taken to Hatton-garden office, and after the examina<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050076"/>tion my fellow-prisoner, Smith, confessed that he was guilty, and that I was innocent.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My master told me to take them- I called at the Blue Anchor and had a pint of beer, and left the basket at the door - when I came out it was gone- I was obliged to go back again - I told my master I had taken it, but the next morning he sent another parcel, and the man came back, and said, they had not received them, and I was obliged to leave.</p>

I said, "No" - she said, "You are in a house of accommodation" - I walked out, and when I got two or three hundred yards off, to another street, I saw the prisoner talking to a man; I went up to him, and asked him for my purse and money - I had had one sovereign, one half-sovereign, and 14s. in my purse; the prisoner bade the other man, good night, and took hold of my arm; I was talking with him about ten minutes; I begged him kindly to give me my money, and I would not give him in charge - he said, he had not got my money; I said, "You have, and I am determined, and insist upon having it" - he then gave me a violent blow and knocked me down; he then ran off - he was taken on the Wednesday after.</p>

By having examined the stock-book on that day - this parasol and the other things might have been sold, but that the bills would have shown - the prisoner said she bought some of these things at our shop before she came to my service - but the Irish linen cloth, we know, was in our possession on the 29th of April - there have been one or two mistakes made since I have been in business - but I forgot to mention the prisoner had a piece of ribbon in her hand, and was endeavouring to keep it from me - I told the magistrate she had it, but I do not think I said she was concealing it - these stockings might have been sold - I have two apprentices.</p>

            . He never accounted for any of these sums.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What wages did you give the prisoner? A. I meant to have given him 90l. a year for the first six months - he had been three months with us - I had not paid him his wages; I owed him about 15l. which he might have had if he had asked for it - he had 7l. or 8l. worth of goods, and he had 7l. in cash; when I taxed him with having received these sums, he denied having received any.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was it his business to settle with you? A. Just as he came in from receiving money, either with me or some one in my establishment - I believe, on the 29th of July, he received four small sums and they were made paid - I believe he did not pay any after the 4th of July.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What took place on the 18th of July when you made the charge against the prisoner? A. I went to a place and received some information; I then called the prisoner up stairs, and said, "I understand you have been receiving money and not accounting for it," he said,"No, I have not;" I said, "Have you not received 12l. of Mr. Cook," he said, "Not on your account, I borrowed that;" I asked him if he had received anything of Mr. Black, or Mr. Down, he said, "No," I then showed him the voucher, and he said, he had.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not give you a list of the sums which I had received that morning? Witness He did; after I had shown him the voucher; I had told him the more candid he was the more lenient I would be.</p>

I was on duty in St. Martin's-lane - I followed the prisoner from there - he looked into several shops, and when he got through Temple-bar, he took something out of his pocket and rubbed it; he went past Mr. Micklam's shop, then returned, and went in - I went into the shop and asked what he had given - Mr. Micklam said, one shilling, and gave me this one - I saw the prisoner put something into his mouth - I seized him by the throat, and told him if he did not put it out I would choak him - he put out these two shillings.</p>

            , JUN. I am the son of John Collyer, who lives at Newington. On the 20th of August, about eleven o'clock, as I was going to bed I heard footsteps, they appeared to me to be in the garden; I went to the door, and heard them plainly - I put on my things, then went round the premises, and returned about half-past twelve or a quarter to one o'clock, and found my bed-room door open, and some things in a basket, and some on the table - I had gone outside the house, round the premises, which are about four acres of land - I am sure I shut and latched the door after me when I went out, for I tried it - there was no window or any thing open - I found a basket in the room, and two blankets, and two ironing cloths, and a jacket, and other things, on the table - they were worth 7s. or 8s. - the prisoner was in my room - some of the things I had left in the basket at the end of the mangle, and the others on a shelf, and the jacket hung on a nail - the mangle stands under the window in my room - I could not see the prisoner when I first entered the room - I heard the bedstead creak - it was quite dark; I felt and caught hold of him by the throat, and held him at the door, and called my father to come to my assistance - I am quite sure the things in the basket and on the table had been removed from the spot on which I had left them - I gave the prisoner to my father, and took him to the policeman - I am certain the house was closed while I went to look over the premises.</p>

             (police-constable N 204). On Wednesday morning, the 21st of August, I was at Newington-green, and Mr. Collyer brought the prisoner towards the station-house; he was given into my charge - I took him back to Mr. Collyer's house, and went into a room below stairs, and saw a basket and ironing things on the floor, and other things on a table down at the door - I took the prisoner to the station-house.(Property produced and sworn to).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been out of work ten weeks - I was tired, and looking for a place to rest; there was a broken pailing in the place, I got through to a shed, and laid for about an hour; it was very cold - I went to another door, which I found open, and I had not been in there two minutes - as I was coming out this young man shoved that basket down off a box, and knocked me down, and took me by the collar.</p>
               <p>JOHN COLLYER, JUN. re-examined. I am positive the door of the house was closed; the prisoner could not get into the room without opening the window or the door; no window was open I am sure, nor was any door open; I am certain I latched the door, I found it open when I returned - my room is attached to the house, you can go from it into the house without going into the open air.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live at Whetstone. On Tuesday, the 9th of July, a man named Thompson was brought to my house in the afternoon, between three and four o'clock I think; he was insensible<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050083"/>totally - I examined and saw several bruises on him, but no wounds - there was a bruise or two on the head, on the parietal bone, and bruises on the chest; on the right arm and left groin, and a few small punctured wounds on the instep of each foot; these were all the external appearances - I bled him on the right arm, and took three pints from him, then opened an artery in each temple, then applied six leeches, and in an hour after I again took about ten ounces from him; I rubbed an embrocation on the chest; he was then removed from my house to the Green Man - these remedies relieved him, but he did not recover his senses; it relieved his breathing very much - I attended him afterwards at the Green Man until his death - I applied a large blister to his neck, and gave him one scruple of calomel; I found him beyond recovery and did nothing more; he died on the Friday morning - I did not administer anything after Wednesday morning - Mr. Evans also attended him; I understand he is not able to be here.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the bruises on the head? A. There was no violent bruise on the head; there were a few on the parietal bone, and a slight scratch, but no wound whatever - I could not at all judge from the appearances on the head by what instrument they had been made - the external injury on the head could not be of itself the cause of death; the bruises on the chest were heavy, but not sufficient to cause death, they were such as would be made by a man's fist; the bruise on the groin was not of any consequence - he never recovered his senses at all - I was present at the examination after death; I did not operate; I was present, but not for the first half-hour; Mr. Evans operated - on opening the scull the dura mater appeared perfectly healthy, on removing it we discovered a quantity of coagulated blood - on removing the coagulum, we discovered three superficial vessels had burst on the upper part of the brain, one on the right hemisphere, and one on the left hemisphere of the brain, the brain itself appeared perfectly healty; I saw nothing else particular respecting the brain; the scull was not fractured, nor the least denture - I examined the heart, lungs, and liver, all of which were perfectly healthy - we next examined the bowels and groin, and could discover no rupture whatever, nor any material injury - I next examined the scrotum, that was likewise healthy - in the ancles we found some punctures about half an inch deep, they were rather on the instep, we opened one and found it nearly half an inch deep; they could not have caused his death at all - there was one bruise in the eye, the right eye was very much bruised, such an appearance as a black eye commonly has - in my opinion a fall was the occasion of his death; the rupture of the blood-vessels on the brain, and the extravasation of the blood, were the immediate cause of death - that I suppose to be caused by a fall; the bruises had not the appearance of being inflicted with such blows as would cause the rupture, there was not sufficient external marks to produce the effect.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do I understand you to say, because you saw no external bruise to justify it, you think the rupture of a vessel must be caused by a fall? A. Yes; I cannot account for the bursting of the vessels in any other way, in the manner they were burst; if he had been fighting an hour and forty minutes, and had made use of very violent exertions himself in that fight, that would not have caused the bursting of the blood-vessels in the manner these were burst; the vessels were so full and congested, they burst from a shake - the personal excitement such as takes place in a fight, would be very likely to congest and shake the vessels, but I think they would not then have burst in the manner they did.</p>

               <p>Q. What would be the difference of bursting of a vessel, supposing it to be burst by a fall or over excitement? A. I don't think it would make a difference in the appearance - I should have thought it might have burst from over exertion, but one vessel had burst on the other side, on the left hemisphere - I will not swear that a violent personal exertion continued for an hour and forty minutes might not have caused the rupture of the vessels; I think it is not probable, in the manner they were burst, as there was not sufficient to justify that they were burst by any violent exertion; the scull was not fractured.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not that render it more likely that the vessel burst from exertion? A. If only one had burst it might, but I think not four vessels - I think if it had been produced by external excitement, larger vessels would be burst - if it was a fall, no doubt it must have been a violent one - he might have fallen on the grass without there being any mark of violence on the head.</p>
               <p>Q. If the vessels had been ruptured by a fall, must it not have been a violent one? A. A violent shake; it was a fall produced the shake - in the act of falling a shake was produced in the act of coming in contact with the ground - if he had fallen on his shoulder, that would not produce it - I think he fell on his head; I found no mark to be certain of that - I found no mark on his head to indicate how he got that fall - I think I can take upon myself to say these vessels were not ruptured by the exertion of fighting desperately; because these were less full than larger vessels - they were congested, but still the larger vessels would be more congested - I don't think these vessels could have burst; for instance, the one on the left hemisphere of the brain had no coagulum; there was some extravasated blood; my opinion is, nothing but the violent shake could produce it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a member of the college of surgeons? A. No, I am not a member of any college; not graduated in any college - I have no degree; I practise as an apothecary; I don't keep any shop - I only dispense medicines for my own purpose; I do dispense medicines; I am not one of surgeon's hall - I have practised for the last ten years; I was apprenticed to a Mr. Ives an apothecary; I finished my apprenticeship - I have never kept an apothecary's shop at all; I took three pints of blood from him at once; and I afterwards took ten ounces more - I did not measure it; I only took it in a basin; blood varies in weight - we consider the ordinary weight of a pint of blood sixteen ounces; but it varies in almost every person - I should think sixteen ounces is the average.</p>
               <p>Q. Being no surgeon you opened both the temporal arteries? A. Yes, I did; I think he died about thirty-six hours after; nobody attended him but me at first there was afterwards Mr. Evans and Mr. Hammond came;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050084"/>there is no gentleman here who attended with me; Mr. Cox was with Mr. Evans when I visited - I should not think the leeches took more than two or three ounces of blood; I included that in the calculation I made - I believe only five leeches went on, six were applied; they did not take much blood - they did not remain on so long as some do.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you had much experience in post-mortem examinations? A. Yes; not lately - not within two years; I am not sure that I have had one within that time - I had when I was assistant to Mr. Hammond; that is four years ago, at Whetstone - I have had one or two since; the last is about three years back; I have not attended post-mortem examinations of subjects who died by rupture of the vessels of the brain - I have read various works on the subject; I do not know that I can recollect any of them; I cannot recollect any.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever read treatises on the effect of violent passion? A. Yes; I do not know who they were written by - I have read on the effect of violent exertions of the human frame, but I do not know who they were written by - I have not, since I examined the body of the deceased, looked into any treatise to confirm my opinion; I have not treatise at all at home on the subject of the brain - I cannot tell how long ago it is since I looked into any work on the subject of the brain, or the effect of violent exertion of the body; the last time was about three years ago - I was in the habit of reading a great many medical works at that time; they were not my own - I have not been practising without having any book to which I could refer on medicine or surgery - the deceased was brought to my house by the parties who were fighting; I was not at the fight myself - I have read that violent exertion will sometimes effect the rupture of vessels of the brain; I cannot tell the name of the work - I have generally been an assistant till lately, and have read my employer's books; I have a pharmacopiae and anatomical works; death has been often caused by violent passion rupturing the larger blood vessels; I think it is not so likely the weaker vessels would be burst.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think a strong vessel more likely to give way than a weak one? A. I think so, from the great quantity of blood in it; I think the external vessels would not be likely to give way from the effect of passion; I have had a great deal of experience as a medical man, but not on this immediate subject.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you occasionally called in to see cattle? A. No, never; I have not been called on to prescribe for diseases of cattle.</p>
               <p>CHARLES JAMES COX. I am an apprentice to Mr. Hammond, he is a surgeon and apothecary at Whetstone; he is not here - John Evans is his assistant; he is labouring under fever and a sore throat, and unable to attend - I saw the deceased before his death, on the Tuesday, at Mr. Harrison's; he was insensible - I did not examine him then; I examined him with the assistance of Evans and Hammond at the Green Man on the same day; there were a few external marks of injury on the parietal bone, which I thought was violent; it was merely a swelling externally; I could not tell the internal appearance - the skin was not ruptured at all; the swelling was about the size of half-a-crown; I could not see it, I could only feel it, because the hair was on it - the hair was not taken off at that time - on the arm there was a severe blow; that could not cause death - there were a few slight blows on the chest which could not produce death; the blows on the groin and feet could not produce death - the only important one was the one on the head, which I believe must have been made by a fall, or by a blow from some broad and flat weapon; the fist would have left a greater mark - the mark produced by the fist would not be the same as the mark I saw; it would not be so large - that was the only mark on the head that I observed; I saw him after his death, but did not take any part in the treatment - I think he died on the Thursday morning, about one o'clock, early in the morning; I was present at the post mortem examination - I have been at the King's College studying, but was never before present at the examination of a person's head dying from rupture of a blood vessel - on removing the scalp there was the sign of a severe bruise on the parietal bone; on removing the scull, about two ounces of blood issued from three vessels which had burst, and on examing the dura mater, that was healty; the lower ventricle had a small quantity of coagulated blood - the whole of the viscera was in a healthy condition; the brain was healthy; the three vessels I have named were ruptured, and one on the other side; they were immediately underneath the bruise of the head - the rest of the body was healthy; there was no appearance in the rest of the body to indicate the cause of death - my opinion is, he died from the rupture of the blood vessels, occasioned, in my opinion, from the external injury by the bruise - I have been apprenticed to Mr. Hammond two years; Mr. Evans was at the post-mortem examination; he and Mr. Hammond were present - Evans operated.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Was the apprenticeship the commencement of your medical experience? A. Yes - I never attended a post mortem examination, where death was caused by effusion on the brain - I know nothing of Mr. Harrison - he was present at the time I speak of, and had the same mears of observation as I had - he lives in our neighbourhood, and practices in the neighbourhood near Mr. Hammond - I know nothing about him - I see him practising - he has been at Whetstone all the time, I have, and practised that time - but how much longer I cannot tell - I see him go to see patients - I have known him two years practising in the neighbourhood - the man was in a state of total insensibility, and continued so - I am surprised to hear Mr. Harrison say there was no appearance of external injury, it is not true - I can bring evidence to prove, the contrary thatwhat Mr. Harrison has said, with regard to that is false, as regards the head - it was evident to all those who saw it - they must have noticed it.</p>
               <p>Q. You are asked whether the colour of the skin was changed, and you say you could not see that for the hair, would the hair hinder your seeing that? A. It would more or less - I could tell easier by the post-mortem examination than before - I did not see it discoloured.</p>
               <p>Q. Now in your judgment as a medical man, do you mean to say the hair on the man's head would prevent your ascertaining whether it was discoloured? A. I did not remove the hair - I should think you could see it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050085"/>my observation of the wound was plain - I felt the bruise, and therefore, there was one, there was a swelling - I felt the swelling, it was about the size of a half-crown in my judgment - and the shape a bruise generally is - it was round I think - I did not examine the shape closely - I felt it- I looked at it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what is the reason you cannot tell us whether it was discoloured or not? A. Because I looked at it cursorily, so as to see that it was a swelling - I could see there was a swelling without putting the hair aside - I saw there was a swelling and likewise felt it - it was more raised on that side than the other - a round instrument, a staff or stick would have produced an oblong swelling to the best of my belief in my humble opinion: a cricket ball would not produce an oblong - I explain the round instrument - I mean a staff or stave - I cannot tell exactly the size the instrument must have been to produce it - it must have been a few inches broad - four inches perhaps, and perfectly flat - a blow struck by such an instrument would not produce a larger circumference on the part the blow was given - it was on the parietal bone, and would not take four inches of a flat surface - if the man fell against a stone, or anything, that would account for the swelling - it must have been produced by something flat - the nature of the wound leads me to conclude that.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you call it a wound? A. Yes, a swelling - it was not a lacerated wound - I should think it was a wound- I cannot say how many times I saw the man before he died - I was not present when he was bled - I did not prescribe for him at all - in my judgment it was by no means a judicious thing to open two temporal arteries, and take sixty-four ounces of blood. I cannot say it would accelerate death, but I conclude it was injudicious to take so large a quantity of blood - it was requisite to take away a small quantity, but I think so large a quantity would weaken him too much - when the blood was taken away we did not know the state of injury done to the head - his insensibility might be produced by concussion - I thought there was injury to the brain by the snoring noise he made.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the pupil of the eye dilated - do you know what I mean by dilated? A. Yes, if the eye was closing - I do not know what you mean by dilated - the eye was closed.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Which part of the scull did you feel the swelling, put your hand to it. A. It was on the left side - on the very spot I put my hand - I have before examined the brain of a party after death, at the King's College dissecting room - but only once - there is no water in the brain when it is healty, when it is unhealthy there is generally water, and signs of inflammation - redness is a sign of inflammation - I heard him, Mr. Harrison give his evidence, but don't recollect anything about it - I should not think a fall on soft grass likely to produce the appearances I saw - I said I should say most assuredly it would not - a fall on a round stone might produce that appearance, but it would be according to the size of the stone - a round stone of large circumference might, but a small circumference would not do it - according to my judgment it must have been a flat instrument - it must have been a very violent blow according to my judgment - there was no appearance of fracture of the skull - the skull was extremely thick - in some skulls it might produce a fracture, but in this it did not - I should not think a fist able to cause such an accident - I have seen swellings on the head from a blow of a fist - it must have been a very heavy blow to cause four vessels to burst - that depends on the state of congestion of the vessels at the time - if he had been fighting for an hour and forty minutes, that would have produced congestion of the vessels - it would be difficult to give such a blow like the bruise presented, by the back part of the hand - the knuckles are not sufficiently large to produce it - the swelling was about the size of half a crown - Mr. Evans was present at the post mortem examination, but not my master - I am perfectly satisfied that he died of the bursting of the blood vessels of the brain - he never could have recovered - he died in consequence of the injuries he received.</p>
               <p>Q. From the appearances you have seen, and the improper treatment you describe, he had received, can you say he died of suffusion, or from the improper remedies? A. Had the quantity of blood been taken away, which Mr. Harrison says he took, I should say it was decidedly injurious - a man might get well after bleeding three pints, but it would be hazardous to take that quantity - I conclude he must have died from the injury - the remedies did not hasten his death - had it been concussion of the brain, instead of effusion the individual might have recovered - the remedy was a right one - the remedy pursued by Mr. Harrison was correct, had he known the vessels had been ruptured - I have never read on subjects of violent excitement of the brain - I have attended lectures, but not given my time sufficiently to the subject.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps the brain is of all parts what you know least of? A. It is</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was Harrison present during the whole post mortem examination? A. He was not; he came in shortly after it began; to the best of my knowledge he came in while we were sawing through the skull; I cannot state whether I had observed the external state of the skull before he came in or not; I believe we did not look at the skull together to see if there was any bruise, I don't remember to have spoken to him; I believe he did not make any observation as to the external state of the skull- I did not hear him speak.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say it was a flat instrument, might not the flat part of the hand have done it, though not the knnckles? A. No, I should think that could not have made that bruise, it might, but I should think it was not broad enough.</p>

             were fighting; I was there at the beginning; I knew the men before by sight; the first rounds till about the third round, were fought in a fair way, what I call a stand up fight; I have witnessed a good many; from the the third round Thompson appeared to be the strongest and the best man, and the bye-standers who I concluded to be Murphy's (party, because they were Irish,) broke the ring, and with sticks and other weapons, they pushed and drove on from one place to another, and knocked down by-standers there; they did not call out any thing that I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050086"/>could understand particularly, for it was mostly spoken in Irish; I knew one or two persons who I saw very busy there, but have not seen any of those since; I saw both the prisoners there - Mulany was very active in the fight, but I never saw him strike any body; I saw him there about the third or fourth round, pushing people about with a stick in his hand; it was more breaking the ring than keeping it; he was keeping all the people backwards in a cluster, towards the people who were fighting, pushing them towards the people, that was all I saw him do - Ready was Murphy's second - I saw him act very fair towards his man indeed, I never saw him use any ill language, or put his man forwards, he acted fairer than I ever saw a man in my life - he acted very fair towards his adversary, very fair on both sides - after the third round, the people pushed in, they continued fighting for a length of time - they might have fought for an hour or better for what I know, for I was senseless myself part of the time, being knocked down by one of them; not by the prisoners; I saw no blow given to the deceased - I saw the end of it, but not the middle part of it; I recovered at the end, Thomson and Murphy were very much exhausted; they had been fighting I should think an hour - before I was knocked down, Murphy gave in; I heard him, he looked round to the man who was seconding him, and said to his brother, "I will have no more," in a faltering voice - I then spoke to the other one's second, and said, it was right now and that the battle was theirs - and as I said so I was knocked down; previous to that, (when his brother took him up, just before I was knocked down) he stood across, and put his hands up, and said "Give it to him, you can serve three such as him;" after I recovered, when I got up at the last round but one, they were fighting towards the upper part of the ring, which was on rising ground, grass; Murphy's people had got them all up in a close corner together, on the highest part of the ground; they were at that time breaking the ring and making a disturbance; the whole of the Irish people together were making a disturbance, and their sticks were dropped, and a glass bottle was thrown in, whether wilfully or not, I don't know; several sticks were held up, and some of them fell on them, but whether by accident or design I cannot say: neither of the prisoners had anything to do with that to my knowledge; I never saw Ready in particular; a glass bottle was thrown into the ring; I helped to pick up some of the pieces; at the last round the men were both fighting, apparently as well in strength and health as at first; that was at the first of the last round; they were hustled completely round the ring by Murphy's party, as I considered them, because they were Irish; both the men had fought that round for a good length of time, and were exhausted; the man hit the deceased in the forehead, and he fell down, more by being exhausted, than by the blow; I saw Thompson fall, there was a small turf of grass lying a little on the descent, and he fell on it, and it appeared to reek his head a little back; he fell on an uneven place; there was no stone or hard substance there; I examined the place; his two seconds instantly took him out of the ring, and Ready the second of the other man came to him, and his other second; he got him across his knees, and Ready came and put his knee under him to prop the man up; he was not sensible, there was no breath in his body, apparently at all; he was taken to the doctor's shop, but before he was taken away, I tried to get him to breathe, and pressed my hands on his stomach, and he made a rattling in his throat; I stopped his nostrils, and drew about three ounces of blood, I should think out of his mouth, and then he breathed freely; they took him away directly after; I wished him to be bled, he was taken; in a gentleman's chaise; I afterwards saw him at Harrison's; he was the same man as Harrison attended to; I went with him from there to the Green Man, and left him there about a quarter past nine o'clock, in the care of two surgeons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you attend the inquest? A. Yes, and so did Evans; Mulany was there also, and to give evidence I suppose - he was not in custody - I heard no outcry about a robbery at the fight - Mulany never touched the deceased, as I saw - it is impossible to say how many persons were at the fight more than three or four hundred; there were as near one thousand as four hundred.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. In the early part of the fight, all went on well? A. Yes; and towards the middle part I received an injury, and could not observe what was going on; and towards the latter part the thing was done fairly; I mean by the seconds and the men themselves - the conduct of Ready was fair, both to his opponent and principal, from the commenoement to the conclusion: and when it was found the deceased had been seriously injured, he manifested every anxiety to help him, and render him assistance in the ring; and at the doctor's shop he appeared anxious and concerned for him - Ready did not attempt to break the ring; he endeavoured to avoid it - not one of the seconds had any thing to do with it; it was their greatest wish to keep everything peaceable and quiet - every man would regard it as a fair fight.</p>

            . I was present at the beginning of the fight; the first round was conducted fairly; the ring was broken-in at the second by the Irish; they hit Thompson on the back of his head; only one person hit him on the back of his head; it was Mulany - he struck him with a blackthorn stick; I had not known him before; a number of persons rushed in together; I can say positively that he was the man; he only gave one blow - he was striking about with the stick, but I never saw him strike anybody else; he hit him in the back part of the head; I cannot tell in what place; it did not knock him down; it made him stagger a little, he did not fall, he went on fighting still - I do not know how long they fought afterwards; they had a great many rounds; the ring was broken in at every round but the first round - I saw Mulany kick Thompson at the last round, after the round was over - when he was lying on the ground, after he was down, he kicked him in his private parts - Thompson did not stand up at all after that; I saw nobody else kick him; I am sure of that - Mulany is the one; I swear that he is the man who struck Thompson with a stick in the second round, and kicked him in his private parts after the last round - I never saw any body else strike him; I do not know a man named John Lane; I was examined before the Coroner - I swore it was Lane did it because I heard his name was Lane, but this is the man - I saw him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050087"/>in the yard at the inquest; I swore to him directly he came into the yard - I gave my evidence the day before he was before the Coroner, and he came the next day - I saw Ready at the fight seconding Murphy, he behaved very well throughout the fight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I think you say, the ring was broken-in, every round after the first? A. Yes, I am sure of that; I do not know how many rounds were fought during the battle; I did not take notice; I should think about twenty - I am not certain how long the battle lasted; it was better than an hour I should think - Thompson was not ill-used every round; only in two rounds, that was the last round and the second; the blackthorn stick that Mulany had was about a yard long; I knew it was blackthorn by the colour of it; such a stick as you would cut out of a hedge; a round stick with knots on it; I am sure of that - I went to look on with other people - I have not seen above three fights in my time - I am a farrier, and live at home, with my father and mother - I was never engaged in a fight myself.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever find your way into any gaol? A. No; I have been in a watch-house for being saucy - the policeman took me there for being saucy in the street, for insulting people, I suppose, when I was coming home, running up against them - it was at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your running against them happen to be very near their pockets? A. No, I do not get my living that way - I was not taken up on suspicion of attempting to steal; I will swear that; I used no words when I ran against the persons; I was given in charge of a policeman; he was by at the time and saw it, and seized me, and put me into Marylebone watch-house; I staid there till about twelve o'clock, and then was bailed out - I appeared the next day at the office, and the prosecutor was there, but nothing was done to me; I swear nothing was done to me - I swear I never was in any prison in my life - I know the House of Correction; I was never there, nor in any other prison; nor charged with an assault for which I was ever sent to prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you charged with an assault on a woman? A. Yes, at Clerkenwell, where you go before the grand jury - I was at Clerkenwell when I was charged; I was bailed out from Marylebone sessions-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it for the same assault as you were bailed for before? A. No - yes; I was at Clerkenwell for insulting the woman; it was not at Clerkenwell that I committed the insult; the woman took me there, to that part of it where you have your trial - I was found guilty and fined, and paid 5l.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason you swore a few moments before, that you were never taken up, except for being saucy? A. I don't know; I forgot it at the time; I forgot that I was tried, convicted, and fined - I totally forgot it, and thought nothing had happened to me - I swear that I was never tried before nor since - I never was in Clerkenwell; I was tried there; I mean to swear I never was into custody at Clerkenwell - I was not put into the dock during my trial; I was not locked up at Clerkenwell- I was not there till I had my trial - I have not asked money from anybody here for coming to give evidence; that I am sure of; I never told anybody that he ought to find me, and the witnesses with money - I did not say so to Mark Walsh, nor anything of the kind - I live at No. 62, Market-street, Paddington - I did not describe myself as a labouring man living at Marylebone; I did not tell Walsh so - I did not ask Walsh for a shilling, telling him that as he was prosecutor he ought to find us in money; I am quite certain I did not.</p>

I was there at the beginning of the fight; it was very fair indeed at the beginning, but at the latter end, it was unfair; I saw three, four or five rounds fair: and then the man named Murphy who was fighting, retreated into one corner of the ring, the other man followed him, and when he got there, the ring came round on both sides and was broken in - and then the fight was sometime without seconds, and sometimes with - it was very irregular; the spectators broke in; the men always fought to one corner of the ring, and then the people all broke in; I did not know who the people were; I heard them crying out and hallooing - I was in a gig; I went into the ring and said, "Do keep the ring, let them have a fair fight;" a man said, "What business is it of yours;" and the prisoner Mulany struck me on the hat and cut it; I went out of the ring and stopped outside in my gig - I saw the ring broken in every time, and both men were completely debarred from their seconds altogether; I saw nobody strike Thompson nor kick him; they were both separated from their seconds at times - the seconds acted very fair on both sides; Mulany struck me on the hat - I did not see him do anything else; Ready was second - I saw him do nothing but second; Thompson's antagonist, who he was fighting with struck him a foul blow below the waistcoat - I don't say it was in the private parts; I don't know John Lane.</p>

I was at the fight; I knew Thompson before; the first, second, and third rounds were fair fighting; but when they found the deceased was getting the best of the fight, the opposite party immediately broke the ring in, and there was no fair play afterwards; they used their sticks and whips every time after that, beating every body, it was immaterial who; Murphy fought to one corner of the ring; I cannot say I saw anybody strike the deceased except Murphy - sticks were flung about in each direction; I saw no stick strike Thompson, nor did I see him kicked; I saw the last round - I saw Thompson fall; Murphy took his fist and gave him a dab, and that was all, and he fell down on the grass - I could not tell whether he struck his head on anything; I was in a cart; when I found how the fight was going, I got out of my cart and went across the field to a man named Miller; I went to a man who I believe was stake-holder, and said to him "Call out and say you will not give the money up unless it is a fair fight;" I saw both the prisoners there - I did not see them strike any blow; Mulany was active there; he had got a stick beating people out of the ring - he was very busy with his stick; he was trying to clear the ring to make room for them to fight.</p>

Yes; a great many persons must have seen him; he had a kind of a black stick - a round black stick - he was flourishing it about under the pretence of keeping the mob off - Thompson was not fighting at the time, he struck him; the fourth round was over - Thompson was not sitting on his second's knee; he was standing - he was standing in an attitude to fight; Mulany did not come in front of Thompson; he was running round Murphy; he hit him the first blow on the back of his head; I was outside the ring, but saw the stick hit him; he swung the stick with all his force - Thompson took no notice of it; he did not seem to mind it as anybody would have thought; he looked round at the man who struck him; I was too far off to hear him say anything; then he gave him a second blow on the back of his head, in the very same place for what I could see; it was in keeping the mob off that he gave him the second blow, in the same round; he did not seem to take any notice of the second blow - it was a very thick stick; a middling size - he hit as hard as he could both times.</p>

            . I was present at the fight. I saw persons break into the ring about the fourth round - they all surrounded the two men fighting, and the sticks flew over their heads, as much as to say, "Keep aside, and let them fight" - and about the middle of the round, I saw Mulany, as Thompson was falling, lift up his foot and kick Thompson in the p*****s - I did not see him kick more than once; directly Thompson fell down he drew his two legs up together, and I never saw him move till the seconds picked him up - I saw nobody else kick or strike Thompson at any time; there were a great many people about - I do not know that any more saw him, there were several strangers close to me - I cannot say whether there was any more ill usage, for I was lifted right away by the mob, and could not get near the ring afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. You said it was the fourth round? A. No; I said it was about the middle of the fight; I did not say about the middle of the fourth round; he received a blow from the man he was fighting with, after he was kicked - as soon as the man received the kick, Murphy struck at him and the man fell down.</p>

               <p>Q. On your oath did you not just now tell us he was falling when the man kicked him? A. To be sure; Murphy made a hit at him and the man kicked him, and Murphy put out his hand and the man fell; the man was hit first and kicked afterwards - while falling Murphy struck out the other hand; the blow which caused him to fall, was received just here (over the nose); the ring at that time was about the size of this table; he fell backwards, and the man who knocked him down was facing him - as he stood with his legs open, a man stood in the ring, and came and kicked him; he came to the side, he could very easy kick him, by swinging his leg round; he kicked as he stood, for he must kick rather round; he first came in front and struck him while the man he was fighting with was standing before him - I don't know anybody there who saw this; I did not look round; I was afraid to move; I saw some of the witnesses there who have been examined - they were all there at the time this happened - I do not know that they had an opportunity of seeing this kick - I am a day-labourer; I work for anybody I can get to work for - I do not work exactly for anybody now - I have had employ from Mr. Manning, a builder; about a week ago, I worked for him, close by my own home, in Little James-street, Marylebone; he lives in Earl-street; I did not work for him above two or three days - I cannot give the name of anybody else I have worked for; these are not my usual working clothes that I have on; this is the first time I have had this coat on - my mother brought it home from a gentleman's house, - I have had the trousers two or three months - on my oath I have not been furnished with these clothes for the purpose of appearing before the Jury - I received the coat on Saturday; I do not know who the gentleman was my mother brought it from - I did not trouble about that.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray have you ever been here before? A. If I have been here I suffered the law; I stood where the prisoners do and suffered the law for it; I was charged with stealing some prints; I cannot say how long it is ago; I never keep a recollection of these things; it is as near as I can guess two or three years ago; I was sent away about my business; I was never here on any other occasion at all, nor in the other Court - I was never charged with stealing shoes in my life; nobody said I had stolen shoes from my master's shop, nor boots, nor anything - I never had any charge against me but stealing prints, that was all.</p>

Yes; it was a very fine day, the grass was slippery, it had been fed off - I occasionally play at cricket; it is usual to wear spiked shoes when the grass is slippery - here is the shoe Thompson had on, they have sparables half-way driven into the sole, to enable him to stand better on the ground; but Murphy's shoe had a spike in the centre like the heel of a skate; I only noticed one spike - I consider his object in wearing it was to keep his foot secure on the ground - Ready's conduct was manly and fair; after the man fell he manifested every anxiety to assist him to my knowledge - from what I saw, I think if it had not been for the interference of the mob, the fight would have gone off all quiet and pleasantly, there is no doubt of it.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. How many rounds took place before he got out of the cart? A.

            . I am a journeyman whip-maker, and live at No. 9, Oxford-buildings. I have worked in Marylebone-lane twenty-one years; I went with Mulany in the cart to see the fight - I saw the beginning of the fight, and was in the cart, and as far as I can recollect there was Mulany and some others in the cart with me- he continued in the cart after the fight began, I should think half an hour or perhaps more; he then left the cart and went away on the left hand side round the ring- I saw him come back to the cart; he said he had been robbed; I saw him while he was out of the cart, outside the ring, not in it - I cannot say how long that was before he came back to the cart; when he came back he got into the cart again, and stopped till we got to the Green Man on Finchley-common - when he came up to the cart, the crown of his hat was broken; I never saw him strike any body or interfere while he was out of the cart - I cannot say whether he might have struck any body without my seeing it, for my attention was on the fight- I am quite certain he could not have struck either of the men who were fighting without my seeing it; I did not see him strike either of them, or attempt it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When he was out of the cart your eye was not constantly fixed on him? A. No; it was on the people who were fighting - I went out of the cart myself when he did, but it was at the back part of the ring; I remained in the cart when he returned - while he was gone I got out for a necessary purpose, and got in again - I was looking at the people fighting, not watching him - during that time I did not see the ring closed on the men who were fighting - when he got up into the cart and we were coming away, I perceived a confusion in the ring, but not till after he came back - the ring was not properly kept certainly, at the latter part - while he was out of the cart - I first saw it broken in after he came back with his hat broken; he did not come back to the cart twice - I never saw the ring broken in at any other time - I will certainly take on myself to swear it was not broken in at the fourth round, nor at the seventh round; not before the eighth - when Mulany came back, and said he was robbed was the first time the ring was broken in; that was the first time I saw the confusion, and the only time - they did not restore the ring afterwards; there was confusion, and I saw no more fighting - I was a long distance off.</p>

            . I am a dealer in coals. I went to the fight in a cart with Mulany; he remained in the cart about twenty minutes, then got out and joined the mob - in forming the ring there was a confusion in the mob, and two people, whom I drove down got out of the cart,(Haines and Dunn,) and got into the mob to the assistance of Mulany, who was attempted to be robbed - I saw Mulany's hat, the crown of it was broken-in, and I saw the lining - Mulany went back to the cart and got in - we remained till the fight was over; Mulany did not get out again till we went away; we went to the Green Man, on Finchley-common.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Then Mulany was three quarters of an hour on the ground? A.

               <p>COURT. Q. He threatened to strike a man if he did not stand back? A. Yes; he struck his stick on the ground to keep the ring; he was inside the ring, there were people behind and before us; I was about ten minutes with him walking round the ring - I did not see exactly the time he got out of his cart, but he was in it for twenty minutes after the fight began, to my knowledge; in a few minutes after he got out, he walked round the ring with me - it could not be more than ten minutes after that I saw him in the cart; I did not see him go back to his cart, but I saw him in the cart about twenty minutes after; I was not with him when his hat was struck.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DAWSON. Q. Do you know the prisoner? A. I have seen him, he has been frequently at our house; I should have recollected if it had been him; it was not him.</p>

            . I am a newspaper vender, and live at No. 47, Broad-street, St. Giles'. The prisoner was in my service upwards of four years, and left on the 16th of June, without giving any notice (looking at the cheque) - I believe this to be his hand-writing; he has made my bills out every week, for upwards of four years - I saw his writing every day in the week; I did not see him again until the 25th of August, when I saw him in Cork gaol - I went there to identify him - I got to Cork on the 25th of August, he was detained on my charge, and brought here to be tried - one hundred and thirty-two sovereigns were found on his brother, as I understood - I had sent the prisoner to my bankers, with my banking book, on the 16th of June, before he absconded; that enabled him to ascertain what balance I had, which was about 320l.; this is a printed cheque which Praeds issue to all their customers; and I stamp all my cheques with, "Davis, 47, Broad-street," this is stamped so, and I swear it must have been in my possession - I might have had the cheque-book in my pocket, or in my desk, and he could get access to it - when I went to see him at Cork gaol, the gaoler said to him "Your name is Smith," he said, yes; his name while with me was Haydon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Would you tell me is that writing like your hand-writing? A. It is something similar, or the banker would not have paid him - it is not like the prisoner's common hand-writing, he has tried to imitate mine - it is a feigned hand, but it is the prisoner's writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not possible a hand being feigned to resemble yours, may have some slight resemblance to another person's without its being that other person's? A. It is possible, but it is exactly as the prisoner writes, and makes out the bills, a kind of up and down - I have not the least doubt of its being his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw nothing of him till you apprehended him? A. No; he had given me no notice to quit.</p>
               <p>MR. DAWSON. Q. Have you not frequently known people mistake in person's hand-writing? A. I have heard of such a circumstance; but I know his hand so well, being so long in my service; his writing is something similar to mine - I have not a doubt he copied one of my old cheques - I have nobody in my employ besides him that could write it - I do not know how the cheque was got; I could not have lost it - it was torn out of my cheque book - the book was generally in my desk, of which I keep the key, or I sometimes had it in my pocket; I kept the key in my pocket; I hang my coat up when I have not got it on - I have a neice and brother in my service - nobody could get at the cheques but the prisoner - the notes paid for the cheque were changed at the Bank, and had his brother's name on them; his brother could not get at my cheques.</p>

               <p>Q. You say the prisoner knew you had 300l. in the bank, how did he know that? A. By seeing my book which he took to the bankers on the 15th of June, and left it there to be made up - my book was not returned till the Wednesday - my book had not been made up for three weeks; but I had been down at Hastings, and had not drawn any cheques.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. He knew no drafts had been drawn out during the three weeks? A. Yes; nobody but himself would know that - I hung my coat up sometimes in my parlour - I wore an old coat in doors - the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050093"/>knew every motion of mine about the house; he could take the book out of my pocket; he might take my coat down to brush or beat; he did that about twice a week, perhaps on Wednesdays and Saturdays.(The Cheque was here put in and read.)</p>

I am a medical man, and a member of the college of surgeons, and an apothecary - I attended the coroner's inquisition - I had seen the body of the child a day previous - I did not see it before the inquest - I attended the child's mother Mrs. West, and saw the child frequently during her illness - I should say the immediate cause of its death, was from neglect of proper care and attention, and nourishment - I conceive it died from want of proper food, such as is usually given to children of that age - the body exhibited the appearance of extreme emaciation, without any visible sign of disease; and marks of erosion on the skin, and different parts of the body, which I should say was from the clothes being left dirty on it, and not being properly changed - I cannot positively say the child died of starvation - there had been a bowel complaint I understand, and there was that appearance - it had the appearance of having suffered from weakness of stomach - that is a common thing with children, independent of the want of food - I can offer no decided opinion of the cause of its death - it might have been a disease incident to children, from weakness of bowels.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not common, that where the most proper food is administered, a child which has been weaned, and the stomach being out of order, the child becomes weak, and dies? A. It is common - the child had been weaned in consequence of its mother's death.</p>

            . I am an apothecary - I am not a member of the college of surgeons - I first saw the child on the 9th of August - it died in a week or ten days - the immediate cause of its death was diarrhoea, a complaint that is common to all children that don't wean well - the child had been weaned - the most proper food would be that most like the food it had left, such as milk and water.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think the prisoner, (a <rs id="t18330905-126-deflabel714" type="occupation">child</rs>

The knowledge of young people at times is very great, as to the treatment of children, - otherwise I should be sorry to trust a child to so young a nurse; the selection of food may undoubtedly, be attributed to want of experience in persons so young as the prisoner; a child requires great care; I say the child died of diarrhoea - but we must draw our conclusions from what we hear; in this child there was no appearance of disease in the bowels, and where children don't thrive from natural food, there is generally an appearance of disease in the bowels; they certainly sometimes die of mere weakness of the bowels; it is entirely a matter of opinion; my idea is, that if the child had received proper attention, and food, it would not have died; I cannot swear that it would have lived, but in all human probability it would have gone on well with proper treatment; if a child of the prisoner's age were not informed of what was proper to give it, she would naturally give it the food she used herself; it had certainly not been nourished, the body was extremely emaciated, that always follows with the bowel complaint undoubtedly, especially in the epidemic which had recently visited us; the mother died not long after the child's birth; I understand then it had a nurse for a short time; then it was sent into the country, and afterwards came back to the prisoner.</p>

             (policeman A 1). On Saturday night, the 21st of July, I was in Southampton-street, Tottenham-court-road, on duty, and saw the prisoner Connell - I followed him; he went into Bellamy's shop in <placeName id="t18330905-127-crimeloc720">Fleet-lane</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He had not denied having them, though you said it was no use to deny it? A. No; but I should not have thought it could have slipped his memory - he said "Cocks, what cocks?"- he hesitated, and would not give me an answer whether they were there or not - and not giving me an answer, in my opinion, admitted that he had not got them, when he had only bought them ten minutes before - he went along with me - I had hold of him at first, when he came from behind the counter, but not in the street, as he was willing to come - he walked by the side of me; I had hold of Connell - there was sufficient time to conceal the cocks, but not being in my uniform it was impossible to know I was an officer - I was looking in at the window, and I thought he observed me, by his turning and looking towards the window - I do not mean that he put the goods under the counter because he observed me - it is proof sufficient that he saw my person at the window, or a woman would not have come to the door - I have been in the New Police eighteen months, and was in the old establishment - I do not think Bellamy could have escaped from me, as my attention was directed to him; I think I should have caught him if he had run.</p>
               <p>MR. DOANE. Q. Did you hold out any threat or promise to Connell? A. None at all; after he was in custody he said it was the second time he had been there - Bellamy did not hear that.</p>

            . I am foreman of the smith's department, at Mr. Cubitt's, Connell has been in the employ some years, and was so on the 20th of July - I know these cocks, at least one of them, positively; the other is not so particular a one - these are cocks made unusually heavy and rather different from the general course of the trade; and they are made to a given pattern, to fit a screw to fit to an iron pipe - I have no hesitation in swearing to them, from having had them in my possession - we never sold any of them; I believe it is charged 10s. 6d., subject to five per cent discount - the other I should say is worth 1s. 6d. being old, but it is worth 3s. - the value as old metal would be 7d. per lb.; they are not made of cock metal, but with copper and a portion of tin - the 10s. 6d. one is new, and is of more value than to be melted down- it may weigh 21/2lb.; 7d. a lb. would be the value if it was melted down, but it is quite new and perfect - I had not given either of them to Connell, he had no right with either of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The mixture of the metal is what makes it valuable? A. Yes; perhaps there are few men in that business, but know the relative value of that metal, and copper, and other metals; they know by the colour of the metal; no marine store dealer would give as much for old cocks as for clear copper, and bell-metal; we keep a stock of these cocks; I have no private mark on it.</p>

            . I am a metal cock manufacturer; these cocks are my manufacture; they are made of better metal than usual, according to the directions of Cubitts; I have made none of that description for any other house; this one is made to an iron guage; I am certain of their being made for Mr. Cubitt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This being made particularly for Mr. Cubitt would not be likely to fit any other pattern? A. I cannot tell the size of the different gas pipes in London; it is an uncommon pattern as regards the size of the screw, and certainly less likely to be generally useful; a person would be more likely to buy it, for the value of the metal than for its particular use.</p>

On the 28th of August, about eleven o'clock, I observed a boy going out of the shop; I went out and saw the prisoners in the street - I was going after them to know what they wanted, when Levesque threw down these handkerchiefs out of his apron; they were all loose; he then ran off - I caught hold of Newton, who was with him; I gave him to Collins; he did not say anything - we took him and the handkerchiefs back into the shop - they had been at the further end of the counter, quite away from the door, on a brass rail; there are sixty-nine of them.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer. I saw the prisoners run from the door-post of the prosecutor's shop - I did not see them in the shop - I did not see anything in their hands - I saw Mackie running out of the shop; I turned and saw the two prisoners ten or twelve yards behind me - Levesque dropped the handkerchiefs, and I took them up.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you see them come from the shop? A. Yes, from the door; they were both together, and were walking; Newton was caught before he ran, and Levesque directly.</p>
               <p>Newton put in a written defence, stating that he was merely looking in at the prosecutor's window, and that his fellow-prisoner was unknown to him.</p>
               <p>Levesque's Defence. I was walking along and a man called me to earn a few half-pence; he told me to stop<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050096"/>while he got a parcel, and he went and got these for me to carry.</p>

             (police-constable G 105). On the 6th of July I was on duty at the top of Long-alley, Bishopsgate-street; about twenty minutes past two o'clock in the morning, I had received information that some suspicious characters had been seen about the prosecutor's workshop, and I saw the prisoner and Snook coming from the workshop, each having a load on his shoulder, I called out "What have you there," they made no reply, I followed them, and in a short time they began to run down Acorn-street, and finding I was close to them, they threw down this property; part of it was in a sack, which I believe the prisoner carried, but I am not quite sure - he was rather in advance of the other man; here are twelve chair bottoms, and a variety of materials enough for a dozen chairs - I still pursued the two men, who ran as fast as they could, down Bishopsgate-street, and just by New-street, I came up to them, and with the assistance of a watchman, I took them - they were both committed to Worship-street on the 6th of July, but by some mistake, they were both discharged at the Special Session - I then got a warrant and apprehended the prisoner again, I know he is the man.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there anything particular in your haybands? A. I make them about eighteen-inches- I can swear this is one of my hands - I cannot say that no other person could have made such an one.</p>
               <p>BRIERS BULLEN re-examined. Q. How many places did you see the hay scattered in? A. In four or five; it was in a meadow, fenced all round, and no foot path in it; it was not in the road from the rick to the prisoner's house - I should not have gone to the prisoner's; but Welling, the policeman met me, and told me something - there were some foot marks on the dew, but I did not compare them with any shoes.</p>

I live in Albany-street, Regent's-park, but I did live opposite to the house the prisoner had in Britannia-street; I frequently saw him go in and out, but the house was always shut up close - I saw an old woman frequently go in and out, and always shut the door very carefully; I have seen people knock at the door, but I never saw anybody let in; I never saw any furniture taken in; I saw the materials of the oven carried away; the prisoner entered some time in August last year, and Mr. Attwood got possession in May last.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I told Mr. Attwood I wanted the premises as a warehouse, provided he would give me leave to take the oven away; he said, "Very well;" and asked if I would take the lease; I said I would within twelve months; to which he consented, and gave me possession; I had a person living in the house; as the oven was of no use to me, I applied to Mr. Bedell who built it; he said it had been built twenty-two years, he took hold of a brick and some of the bricks fell down; he said he could not allow me anything for it and if he removed it he must be paid for his man and horse and cart; in a few days Goddard told me that Mr. Dymock would buy it as he was going to build a wall, and he would allow me 4l. 10s. for it; I agreed to those terms and it was carried away; but circumstances did not admit of my making the alteration so soon as I intended; but I resided there six months; I was not applied to for rent, till I met the prosecutor in the road, and he asked if I could pay him, I said "Not at present;" he said I had better give him up the key if I could not make the alterations I intended, that he might let the house; I said if he would give me a little time I should be able to fulfil my promise - I never saw any one for five weeks afterwards; when I went home one night and knocked at the door, I found it had been broken open and a notice on it, which I took down and put into my pocket.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DAWSON. Q. Have you the book here? A. Yes, this is it - many persons write in this book; here is no credit entered to these customers by the prisoner, which he should have done - this other book is the cash book, which I keep; if he had brought these sums to me I should have entered them here; if I had omitted to enter them the cash would not have been right- it is the rule of our house to make up the accounts every night - it has happened that some items have been entered the next day; I think they have not been left for three or four days - I pay every body, the workmen and collector bring the money to me - our business is not conducted in a very irregular manner; I do not know that I ever said it was - I might, on some occasion have said so; some of our workmen have staid out all night, and they have been spoken to about it, and Mr. Graham has been told of it - it has happened that one salesman has given his money to another, to enter it for him, but that was for ready-money transactions in the shop - I will not undertake to say the prisoner did not give these sums to another person, but it is not likely - we never give credit to the men - it the prisoner had come home very late at night, and had not paid me till the next morning, I should not have considered him a debtor for it - I should not have known what he had received till he told me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it his business to give the money to you the night he received it? A. Yes, and I enter it in the cash book, and it is not here - I have never had it; he did not pay it on the 20th of July.</p>

             (police-constable E 54). I heard of the robbery, and went to the prosecutor's house - the prisoner saw me and went in at the side-door; the prosecutor gave her in charge, and I took her to the station-house - she was searched, but nothing found on her but some duplicates; this bundle of new clothes were in her possession when I took her - I went back to the prosecutor's, and found this purse on the tiles of a little house in the yard, under the window of the prisoner's lodging - I asked the prisoner about the money; she denied having had it, and either she or her mother said that money could not be sworn to.</p>

My husband is a sweep, and he was in trouble for thirty days - I stand out in the street with fruit, and what money I could put by I did, till my husband came out; I went to Mrs. Haynes, and asked her to take care of my money till Monday night - I called on her for some, and she said I had better take the whole, which I did.</p>

               <p>HANNAH HART. He did not ask the price of these images - he bought some things which came to 1s. 71/2d.; he gave me 2s. and I gave him the change.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Brick-lane, Spitalfields. I have a shirt, pawned on the 29th of July; I cannot say by whom - this is the duplicate we gave.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WOODS. The prisoner had been working for me on the 20th of July - these shirts were taken from a drawer in the room No. 5; they belonged to a gentleman who lodged there; they are marked T G G 8 32, and T G G 4 31.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who do they belong to? A. To Mr. Glover, who is out of town - all his shirts are marked in this way, I had looked at a great many of them; I don't know that I have seen the whole of them; I cannot swear that I had seen these two shirts - Mr. Glover is out of town, I don't know where - these shirts were not locked up, but kept in a drawer in his room - I have a number of servants, and they have access to that room - I certainly did not take an account of the number of shirts Mr. Glover left, but I have no doubt these are his; I don't know the number he had; I don't think he ever gave these away - there were a number of workmen in my house in June, and I believe the prisoner was one.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought these two shirts and a handkerchief of a man in the new Post-office for 10s. 6d.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I have every reason to believe that the whole of the transaction is a gross conspiracy against me, for the express purpose of extorting money from me- first they prevailed on me to purchase the duplicates for seven shillings at the half-way house (the sign of the George) to the West India Docks, in which Docks I am employed. I purchased the duplicates of two Scotchmen hawkers. On my arrival opposite the Mansion-house, when I was going to fetch the tickets, my prosecutor stopped me, and said if I would give him the tickets, and a trifle of money, he would not prosecute me; but I objected, and then he informed me that three men was gone to my lodgings to apprehend me again. I solemnly declare myself innocent of any robbery, or intention of commit<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050103"/>ing any robbery: and the sole cause of visiting the steam vessel was for the express purpose of seeing my relation before she sailed.</p>

               <p>Simmonds. Q. Are are sure it was me that was there, and ran away? A. I am positive it was you; on Monday morning, when the policeman fetched me to see him, he acknowledged to my face that it was him.</p>
               <p>JOHN MOUNCEY. I live at No. 17, Rose-lane, Spitalfields. I was coming down Osborne-street, near Brick-lane, about half-past ten o'clock - I went down Wentworth-street, and saw Simmonds running down the street, with his coat on, and as I went towards my residence, I saw him standing against Mr. Sheen's door, with his coat off - that was about five minutes after.</p>
               <p>Simmonds. Q. Was I not alone? A. I saw nobody with him; I did not see Seymour at all.</p>

             re-examined. I saw them running in Wentworth-street; both ran together across Brick-lane, to Wentworth-street, and on to the alley, which is in Wentworth-street, and leads into Whitechapel - it was possible for a person to see one, and not the other; the one which had the watch got into the alley first.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050104"/>WILLIAM FIELD. I was coming down Wentworth-street, with Mr. Becket, and saw Seymour run down Wentworth-street from Brick-lane, and down Angel-alley, and in a minute or two after, I saw Simmonds run straight down the street - he had his coat on then, and returned just by Angel-alley in a minute or two afterwards with his coat off - he said to five or six others, who were together,"It is a fine yellow-man"; he said so as he came running in front of us; there were five or six of us together coming home; he then went back, and went into Mr. Sheen's, which was the house he had gone into before; he came out again directly afterwards, and Seymour was against the door; as we went by they went off together, down towards Petticoat-lane - I met Grant, the policeman, and told him what had become of them; he went down towards Rose-lane; I stood at the corner of Rose-lane; Simmonds came back from Petticoat-lane - Cotton took him - Seymour came right facing us, and said, it was a fine yellow-man, and then he turned back, I am quite certain of them both; I was close to a gas-light.</p>
               <p>Seymour. I wish to ask Hayward a question; When I was at Worship-street, the magistrate asked him if Simmonds had his coat off or on, when the robbery was committed, and he said he had it off two or three times over.</p>

             (policeman.) I was on duty in Wentworth-street that evening; I saw Hayward in Brick-lane, at half-past ten o'clock; he gave me information; I went down to the end of Rose-lane, when I heard they were gone towards Petticoat-lane - I stopped and saw Simmons come up to the end of Rose-lane, and Cotton took him into custody; I staid a few minutes after, and saw Seymour come up after him - I went to him and said, "I want you Jemmy," and took him; he said, "For what;" I said, "Something about robbing a man of a watch in Brick-lane;" "Oh, oh," said he - on that I took him to the watch-house; I searched him, and found a knife and 4s. on him - I have known both the prisoners for some time, and had seen them both together myself about half-past nine o'clock that evening - I see them together every night, as I am on duty; they live in the same house together.</p>
               <p>Seymour. He swore he saw me and Simmonds together. Witness. Yes, both of you were together the same night, going up Wentworth-street, and at another time in George-street.</p>

            . I was on duty and have known the prisoners some time - I saw them together about three-quarter's of an hour before the robbery - I afterwards went to the corner of Wentworth-street, and stood there about five minutes, and Simmonds came up with his coat off - I said, I must trouble him to go with me again, he said, "It is Sunday night, Cotton, this seems a regular thing," I said, "You know what it is for, you know it is for a watch," he said, "I did not have the watch;" I took him to the station-house - no watch was to be found.</p>
               <p>Simmonds's Defence. I know nothing about it, Cotton has got my money - I used to sell fruit in the street, and the 4s. was the remainder of my market money - both the policemen know me, and never knew me do wrong - they never saw me do harm, if you will ask them about it.</p>
               <p>Seymour's Defence. I was in Bishopsgate-street at the time, at home with my master - I used to travel with him to sell braces and things - he bid me good night - I thought I would go home and go to bed, and a policeman caught hold of me and said he wanted me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you think you were so much stunned, that if a man called out"Halloo, I have caught you," you could not have heard it? A. Yes, I could hear nothing; being stunned did not hurt my sight as well as my hearing; there was a hedge between me and the man, and a ditch, it was a very high hedge and pretty thick; the man was in the garden and I in the field - the trees were in leaf.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How high was the hedge, could you see over it? A. Yes; we were down in a hollow, the hedge went up high - we could see right into the garden; I saw the man's face, I saw him come from the tree two or three steps, his face was above the hedge - I could see him quite plain, I did not see him till after the shot was fired.</p>

            . I am house-surgeon of St. George's Hospital. Upjohn was brought to me on the 8th of July, I examined him, he had about fifteen small wounds on the left-side of the head, in the back part - I did not take any shot out of his head - I fancied I felt shot there but none were discovered - there is no other surgeon here; he had been to another surgeon before - he was discharged on the 24th of July; the wounds were such as would be caused by the shot of a gun.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Would not coarse powder make such wounds? A. If the gun was near enough, but not that kind of wound - I examined the wound to see if I could discover any shot, but found none.</p>

             (policeman). I went with Mrs. Upjohn, the boy's mother, to the prisoner's employer on Wednesday, the 8th of July. I saw the prisoner there, and asked him where the gun was which he shot the boy with; he told me it was in the yard, at the back of the house - I asked him if he would let me have it, he was going back to fetch it, when one of the servants brought it to me; he said, he shot at the boys, but did not mean to shoot them - he also stated that the boys were throwing bricks into the ditch, to get over into the garden to steal the fruit - he said, he took the gun up, but he meant to shoot over their heads; he did not tell me how it happened that he shot them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He told you he did not mean to hit the boys? A. He said he took the gun up and shot at them, but meant to shoot over their heads - I have seen the place many times - there is a hedge, but it lies in a hollow, and the ditch lies in a hollow also - the boys are very low in stature.</p>
               <p>ROBERT JONES re-examined. The man who fired the gun was about ten yards from us. I was at the doctor's with Upjohn, the doctor brought a light and examined him, and said, he was to be taken to the hospital immediately - he did not take anything out of his head, he felt his head, nothing more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there any fruit in the garden? A. Yes, I knew that very well - I had never been there before; I cannot tell whether Upjohn had - I have not been into any garden since; I do not know Mr. Martin- I have been at liberty ever since; I was never taken on any charge of stealing fruit.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). Gentlemen; - I most solemnly assure you, that when I saw the boys bringing the bricks from the kiln for the purpose of making a bridge over the ditch,(and by that means get into the garden to commit their depredations and plunder,) I was standing at the hovel which is in the garden, and as soon as I saw the boys I called out to them. I asked what they were doing there, and told them to be off. I left the hovel and approached towards the ditch; as I walked along, my feet got entangled amongst some potatoe haulms - I stumbled: I had the gun in my hand; it was loaded with only half a charge of powder, and a few sparrow shot. The gun was full cocked; in stumbling, I must have jerked the gun, which went off. I saw the boys run away (three one way and two another); I was quite unconscious of having done any injury, nor could I have supposed it possible from the situation in which I stood; and when it is considered that the hedge which is on the garden side of the ditch is one foot and a half through, and five feet high, closely set with poplar and elder trees, it would appear impossible to be otherwise than of a purely accidental nature, and the charge must have passed through the hedge and hit the prosecutor without my knowledge. I did not hear any person call out, and concluded that the boys had been frightened away. I returned back to the hovel, and remained on duty my usual time.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM UPJOHN re-examined. I felt a probe going into my head, but don't know whetherany thing was taken out.</p>

Yes; he shut the half-hatch - I had got his mother away from him; Benton was coming to relieve, and the prisoner told me if I came in he would rip my b - y guts out; there was a stone on the board, and he sharpened a three-pronged fork - that was between eight and nine o'clock; I told Benton he was raving mad, and I wished him taken to a place of safety; and the moment Benton came up, the prisoner stabbed him in his left side with the fork - he left the fork in his side until Benton pulled it out; I saw it sticking in his side- Benton drew it out, and then seized the prisoner and took him into custody - he was most decidedly mad at the time - he has been subject to fits of insanity for five or six years; when he is quiet he is very well; he acted the same to other people as towards me - whenever he was without restraint, he is very violent - no offence had been given him at all; he said I had sold him for £800 and bought a whole row of houses with the money; I believe he is at this time sane - he is very rational at times, but goes off all of a minute; when he is right in his mind, he behaves very well - he is always fancying there is something after him when in his right senses; he is wavering, fancying he sees birds or something coming after him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I consider it impossible for him to see at the distance he stood off, whether anything was done at all; for fourteen policemen rushed on me directly - Benton struck me with a stick. Witness. I told Benton he could not do it by himself, and about three policemen came with him, but we were all within a yard of the door; nobody struck the prisoner - Benton would have disarmed him, but while his arm was up, he stuck him in the side.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He may say what he likes; he has been trying to put me away; he has tried to poison me; here is a man here who was rendering assistance, when I was taken to Hanwell on the 17th of April 1832, and kept there until August, 1833; Mr. Meycock helped to put the straight waistcoat on me, all he wishes is to have me confined; I would sooner have my life taken away, than be confined at all; I put Benton on his guard before he came up to me - every thing he has spoken is quite fabric.</p>

            . (Policeman B 10.) On the evening of the 13th of July, I was spoken to by Seyffert, at the collecting house, about ten minutes after nine o'clock; I went to the collecting house, the prisoner was standing in the toll-house, with this fork in his hand; and directly I made my appearance before the door, he came forward, and thrust the fork an inch and an half into my left side; I was not at all acquainted with his previous habits; I lost a great deal of blood; he came at me again directly, and I thrust at him, and secured him, and pulled him over the half-door; I took the fork out of my side, and gave him to one of my men to take to the station-house; I went to St. George's Hospital; he thrust the fork into my side, as hard as he could; I had my great coat on, and it came sideways through my great coat, or I should have sustained much more injury; he did it with all his strength; I have no doubt he intended to take my life if he could; I had not spoken to him; he had heard his father desire me to come to his assistance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Q. When you came up to me, did you ask me to come with you? A. No; I never spoke to you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said "No, I have not offened you, nor any of your men," you immediately took up your truncheon, and made a blow at me. Witness. When he was coming forward to stab me with the fork I had my truncheon drawn, and was going to strike his arm down, but somebody caught hold of my arm, and my truncheon fell down; I had not raised my arm to strike, until I observed his motion with the fork, and he had made a blow at me; it was in self-defence I raised my staff; he was making a thrust at me with the fork.</p>

            . I am a surgeon at St. George's Hospital. On Saturday the 13th of July, I was there and examined Benton, I found three small punctured wounds, about an inch and a half deep, between the fifth and sixth ribs; it appeared to be done by a fork like the one produced; it was not a dangerous wound, although such wounds are sometimes dangerous; it depends on the state of the body; I should think if he had not been protected by a great coat, and it had penetrated half an inch deeper, the lungs would have been wounded, which would have made it a much more dangerous case; I think a great coat likely to prevent that; it was between the ribs; I could pass a probe down across the wound; I dressed it and attended him about five days till all danger was over, and then he was attended by the surgeon of the division; I did not think all danger was removed till five days after; I should call it a punctured wound; it was done by stabbing, there was no cutting at all; it was a mere puncture not an incision or cut.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say; I don't wish anybody called on my own behalf; he has tried to take my life several times.</p>

My wife takes in silk to weave for Mr. Mears, of Spitalfields - I left my house at half-past seven o'clock in the evening, my wife was in the house, and this silk was in the loom; I returned at half-past one o'clock in the morning; I was in Union-street, Hackney-road; and my wife came to me there about a quarter to nine o'clock, and we came home together at half-past one o'clock - I opened the door with a key, and the dog was inside, chained to the staple of the door; I had left him so - there was a light up stairs; and when I entered the shop, I saw a roll on the ground, and the silk gone off it - the back window was wide open - I gave information to a police officer - the premises were examined, and in consequence of information from my son I went to a marine store shop in Bethnal-green-road, and left my son there, in care while I got a policeman; and when I was within a short distance of the marine store shop, I saw the prisoner come from the corner of Waterloo-town, which leads from the shop; he went round another turning, and came up again, and then I saw him with the silk in his hand; he came out of a gateway; he had it tied up in a handkerchief, half out and half in; he saw me, and ran away, and chucked the silk down at my son's feet - I am confident he is the man - I picked the silk up, and gave it to the officer - the prisoner ran away; he was taken afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Did you see it picked up? A. I took it up myself - when I left my house, I left my wife in it; I did not fasten it myself - it was five o'clock in the morning when I met the prisoner; it was not very light - I was in a flurry when I got my property, I was thankful to get it - I have seen him once or twice before, coming to whisper my boy away from his work; I am sure he is the man.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you leave anybody in the house? A. No; I had seen the prisoner once or twice; I don't know of his being acquainted with my son; he came once or twice, and called my son out; my son has gone and spoken to him at the door - my son went out that night about half-past six o'clock.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. I came home at a quarter to two o'clock in the morning, and in consequence of what I heard, I went with my father to an old iron shop in Bethnal-green-road; he left me to watch there, and in about two or three minutes I saw the prisoner coming out of the gateway; I knew him; I was two or three yards from him; the instant he saw me he was very much confused, he looked very much flurried - I told him my mother had been robbed, and then he was still more confused; and then I told him I thought he must know about it, or he would not be confused; he made no answer; and a little time after he said, "If I had not wanted money I would not have done it;" I said I would give him all the money I had about me if he would bring it back, and I gave him 1s.; he said he knew I would tell, I said I would not - the policeman was then coming after him, and he ran away faster than I could run, and I lost him, and then I met him again, coming out of the gate with the work in his hand; I and my father pursued him, and he threw the silk down in Bethnal-green-road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had he not the silk the first time? A. No; I said he had better tell me all he knew about it, it would be better for him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you tell him that before he said he would not have taken it if he had not wanted money? A. He said that first of his own accord, and after that I said he had better tell me all about it; he made me no answer at first - he said he was now done; I am quite sure he said he was done, and should not have taken the things if he had not wanted money, before I promised him 1s. to bring it back, and to keep it secret.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Where were you all this evening? A. I had been after my father and mother, but could not find them; I walked about from eight till eleven o'clock - I had a pint of beer at a new beer shop - I went to Hackney-road, but they had left there, and gone somewhere else - I got home about eleven o'clock, but could not get in; and walked about again from one place to another, and got home at half-past two o'clock; I had been home three times before I could get in.</p>
               <p>Q. What led you to suppose the silk would be at the marine store shop? A. I had heard the prisoner dealt with that man two months before - he has been in the room the silk was in - I had no hand in taking the silk - I had heard the prisoner had said he should not go home all night - I had met him that night, and he told me so.</p>

On the 30th of June, I called in at the George and Dragon, in Hackney-road, about ten o'clock in the evening; I had a glass of sherry at the bar - while I was there, Edwards came in and asked if I would treat her with a glass of anything to drink, and on her renewing her application, I said she should have a glass of anything she liked; she had a glass of rum and shrub, and I paid for that and my sherry and came out, but I had not got more than twenty yards, when she came running after me, and asked if I was going home, I said, "Yes;" she then put her hand round my waist; I said, "You are going to rob me;" she said, "No I am not, upon my soul;" I said,"Go away; if you follow me I will give you in charge of the first policeman I meet;" I went on, she still followed me; I told her if she dared to follow me, I would give her in charge; she took no notice, but still followed me, and I struck her; I then met a friend of mine and told him of it - she then went away, and I went with my friend to another wine vaults and had a glass of sherry; while we were there, the two prisoners came in and Williams came up to me and said, "I don't think she meant to rob you;" I said, "She has not, and if she follows me I will give her in charge;" Williams then said,"I have not offended you, give me a glass;" I said I would not, but my friend said, "You had better give her a glass and have nothing more to do with her;" I then gave her a glass - Edwards then went away - I came out, Williams came after me, and asked me to give her a sixpence to get some gin; I gave her one and bade her good night; but as I was going down the street, she came after me again and said, "Give me another sixpence before I go;" she then put her arms round my waist, and I missed my money from my pocket; I then put my hand to my pocket and missed my pocket book - I said, "You have robbed me;" she said, "I have not, I have nothing but this sixpence;" the policeman was coming by, and I gave her in charge; she was taken to the watch-house - she still denied having anything, but when she was going to be searched, she said, she had 6s. or 7s.; I had lost a half-sovereign, which was in a small bit of paper, and four half-crowns and some silver, which I had taken in change of a sovereign; my money was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050110"/>found on her almost to a penny - Edwards was gone away at the time I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Williams. Q. What time might it be when you saw me? Witness. A. I suppose about a quarter before twelve o'clock - I did not go to any public-house with you; I did not give you a sixpence to go and get some gin - you did not say you could not get it for that,</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You swear she said she had no money but sixpence? A. Yes, she did.</p>

             (police-sergeant H 4). I took the prisoner Williams - the prosecutor said he had been robbed of 18s. or 19s. in silver, and a half-sovereign in a bit of paper in his pocket-book; I took the prisoner to the station-house and found the money in her pocket; the pocket-book has not been found, but it was seen near the spot; the prosecutor had been drinking but was sober; Williams denied having any money but the sixpence; it was about a quarter past one o'clock on Sunday morning, the 30th of June.</p>
               <p>Williams Q. Did I not tell you I had 14s. or 15s.? Witness. A. No, you denied having anything but the sixpence; but when you got to the station-house you said you had 7s. or 8s.; I did not hear you and the prosecutor talking about gin - I did not hear him speak of losing a crown piece.</p>
               <p>Williams Defence. I was going home and met a gentleman who I had a child by - he gave me a sovereign; I then met a person about eleven o'clock, who had been very good to me when I had the cholera; I went to her place and treated her, and we had some rum and porter - I left her place about a quarter before one o'clock; I then met the prosecutor, he put his arm round my waist and asked me to go and have something to drink - we went to a public-house door, and he gave me sixpence and said, "Fetch half a pint of gin;" I said, "They will charge more for it at this late hour;" he then said he had no more money and he thought I had robbed him; but if I had robbed him of the silver, I should have had the pocket-book and the half-sovereign about me.</p>

            . I am apprentice to a pawnbroker, at No. 8, Oxenden-street, Somers-town. On the 26th of August, the prisoner came there to pawn a silver spoon; he wanted 3s. on it - I asked him who sent it; he said, his father, who was a bricklayer - I detained the spoon, and told him to send his father; he did not come, and in about two hours' time, I went to see if his address was correct; it was not, and I took the spoon to the station-house; when I got home the prisoner was there, and said his father could not come; I took him into custody.</p>

            . I worked in Rozee's shop with the prisoner, on the 15th of July, from morning till night - he went out in the morning to get some tobacco; he was a long while gone, and when he came back, he said, he had been to his sister's to borrow 1d. to buy the tobacco; he then had his dinner, smoked his pipe, and worked till eight o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I had my work from Mr. Green, of Steward-street, which I took to Mr. Rozee, who engaged to learn me to make velvet; at length I found he was not a trust-worthy person, being in the habit of getting drunk for three or four weeks at a time; I heard that he had lived with a female for some years, until she was committed to Newgate for robbing the person's house who had engaged her to wash and char; he then sent the children to the workhouse, and left her till she was married to a Mr. Simmons: and now Mr. and Mrs. Simmons, Mr. Rozee, and the children all live in one room. On the day named in the indictment, a young man came to pay me some money, which he had borrowed at sundry times; we staid a short time; when we came down stairs I had my dirty linen, and the young man's dirty linen, to take to my sisters to wash; the door of the workshop has no fastening, and as I came down stairs, I said to Mrs. Ghost, "Be so good as to look after the door, as Rozee is out getting drunk again;" I then left the young man, and went home to my sister's to dinner. The street-door is always open, so that any person might go up or down the stairs without being perceived; and Mr. Rozee some time ago lost his work before, while he was out at the public-house.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When did you first learn the bill was a forgery? A. I think on the 12th or 13th of May - I know that a bill of exchange is not negotiable without an indorsement - I put it into Mr. Williams's hands to try to get the money, but I received nothing for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Long after you had ascertained that this was a forgery, did you not take from the prisoner a written agreement to return the public-house, and fixtures, and all the property you had sold him? A. No, I did not; Mr. Handley took it for me; he is a gentleman, who did live at the Hope, and now he lodges at my house - I know Mr. William Pinks, I don't know that he is rich, they told me he was godfather to the prisoner - I don't know when I went to Mr. Pinks to try to get the money, it might be a week afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. When you sent Mr. Handley to get re-possession, did you not engage to hold the prisoner harmless? A. I cannot charge my memory; I did not propose it; I caused it to be proposed, and he entered into a written agreement, but I never said it was because I thought I could get the money of old Pinks; I had received the 30l. of him in cash at first, but I should have been no great gainer if I had had the rent and taxes to pay.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not afterwards fly from that agreement, and say you would not do it? A. It was proposed to Mr. Usher, and I would not accept it, because I understood he had given a cognovit to pay so much a week to somebody.</p>
               <p>Q. If you found out in May that the bill was a forgery, please to give the jury some honest reason why you put it off till September? A. He promised he would pay me if I would not proceed, I said if he would pay me the 40l. I would forgive him the 30l. - I went once to Mr. Pink with Usher, and Usher asked him if he would assist Holloway- I told him it was a forgery, and if he could not settle the bill, he must take the course of the law - I don't know that I told him I would prosecute Holloway, but I think I said if he would pay I would not prosecute.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go to Holloway, after you had ascertained that the bill was a forgery, and after you had agreed to take back all the property, and sacked the 30l. which he had paid - did you not say that you could not make up your mind to do it, because you had lost your wife in the house? A. I might have done so, I would not swear that I did not; I don't recollect it; I have said so to other persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not afterwards propose that he should execute a bill of sale to Usher of all the property, and that Usher, whose name was forged, should befriend him in consequence of it? A. It was proposed in the presence of Usher and me, but I would not accept of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the condition that the man should deliver up all the property in the public house, to be followed by giving up the bill of exchange? and after having bound him by an agreement in writing, and led him to expect that you would deliver up the bill you are now prosecuting him for it? A. Certainly, I should be very happy to get the money.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of July did you go to the prisoner's wife in his absence, and ask her if old Pinks could be induced to make up this bill? A. I don't know that I used the word "Old Pinks," I might have said, Mr. Pinks, but I don't recollect it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you satisfy us, why you, who knew this bill was forged in May, should now appear to prosecute in September? A. From an impression that he would furnish means to take the bill out of my hands - if he had paid it, I would not have prosecuted him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you been listening to the other two trials, and found that they went off, because the receipts could not be traced to the prisoner? A. Yes; I have been speaking to my master since the trial; I said "It was a pity we had not the boy here who went with the prisoner," he said, it did not matter- I believe there was a boy went with the prisoner on the 6th of July, the prisoner delivered this receipt to me, but I cannot say who made the alteration - I don't know whether the other boy is now in our service - I don't know who he was - we have many errand boys who come to our service, and leave it.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not know that he was engaged in executing the commission of a rival house, and were you not expressly informed of it by his brother? A.

             of Birmingham; I did not know that the prisoner was engaged in business for him - I never heard that he was, or was about to be; I heard in the early part of July, that he had been in negotiation with Mr. Moore - Mr. Moore is a manufacturer in the same line of business as I am; I never employed the prisoner by commission - I offered him a commission to take place subsequent to Midsummer last; that was the subject of conversation in the early part of this year; I did not offer him that after the 29th of May - I am quite sure of that - I cannot say positively how much my returns have increased since the prisoner came into my service; he met me at Stony-Stratford in September, 1831, to look over the business of the establishment, but nothing was then mentioned about increase of salary - he mentioned that I had not given him credit for the present I had been in the habit of giving him - I wished him to leave the house of mine which he occupied, and I told him I would give him £30 a-year in lien of it; I cannot tell whether £52 a-year was mentioned, it might be matter of conversation - I never said that I would give it him; his salary was £120 a-year, and £30 additional for leaving the premises in Queen-street, where he had resided free of rent, coals and candles.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever say that you had been studying how to improve his situation, and that the conclusion you had come to was, that instead of his receiving £120 a-year as formerly, that from the 1st of January, 1832, he should be entitled to a commission of one per cent on all monies received? A. There was a proposal for a commission on his part, to which I did not consent - I did say I had been studying how to improve his situation; I had been in the habit of giving him a present, and I might have given him more - I had a very good opinion of him; I did not succeed to the business of his friends at Birmingham, they live in another part of the town - I swear positively and without reserve, that I never agreed to allow the prisoner any commission of any kind on any occasion; on the 30th of March, 1832, I sent him a statement of accounts desiring him to examine and return them, but he never returned them - I don't recollect his writing to me to say that the statement was not in accordance with my agreement, to allow him a commission of one per cent; I have no knowledge of his objecting to that statement.</p>
               <p>Q. When you discharged him on the 29th of May, did he not remonstrate with you on your conduct, and say that you were to allow him a commission, and that you had sent him a statement which he had returned, as not being in accordance with your own agreement? A. No; he appeared a good deal affected, and said his friends should make good the deficiency; he said nothing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050119"/>about commission - I have no recollection on the 9th of June, of receiving any application from him, to be furnished with an account of the money received since he had commenced on commission - I will not swear it was not made, I don't recollect it - I think that a commission of one per-cent on the sale of goods would have fallen short of his salary; the prisoner called upon me about the end of June, to know if I would reinstate him in his situation; he did not mention the accounts; I have no recollection of his saying a word about them; I will swear he did not; it is probable I might tell him I should be in town in three weeks, and he might call upon me again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at that interview inform you that he was about to join a gentleman in partnership, and mention several commissions that had been offered to him? A. I don't recollect it - I don't recollect that he mentioned a commission from Mr.

            ; he mentioned a per-centage from Mr. Moore, but whether at that, or an after interview I cannot tell - I have no recollection of its being at that meeting, but some such a point was a matter of conversation - I don't recollect his saying he should be at Birmingham in ten days, and he would wait upon me there; he came to Birmingham, but I cannot tell at what time, he called upon me at my warehouse; and I said I wished to see his brother before I had any conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not say that you wished to see his brother before you entered into any arrangement with him? A. I have no recollection of it; I cannot speak to the precise words - I wished to see his brother - I said I would call upon his brother; I cannot swear I did not use the word "arrangement;" I called on his brother the same evening, he was going to tea, but I did not drink tea with him; I received a visit from the prisoner and his brother, but I don't know whether it was on the following day; I had some conversation about his receiving a commission on the sale of brass and copper metal, but I did not enter into any arrangement - his brother had an agent in London of the name of Stevens, with whom it was stated the prisoner was about to go into partnership in the commission business, and his brother asked me if I had any objection to give him some commission, if he should succeed in going into partnership - and I said if anything fell in his way to sell to customers whose names were not on my books, I should have no objection to allow him a commission; I can swear this was in June or the beginning of July - it was before I discovered this; he stated that he had been offered a better commission from Mr. Moore than from me; I don't recollect his saying he would not take mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not his brother ask you this plain question;"Mr. Jenkins, am I to understand that if my brother accepts the commission from Mr. Moore, that he will have nothing to fear from you as it respects his account with you?" A. I have no recollection of his making use of such an observation - I might say - "Certainly not; I will be no obstacle to him, I wish him well;" I had no hostile feeling towards him, until I discovered the money had been received and not entered in the book - none of these charges had then been brought to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Now so far from your not knowing that he had been acting for Mr. Moore - did he not on his return to Birmingham, a week afterwards, call and tell you that he had arranged with Mr. Moore and taken his business? A. He never did, nor did his brother either; I came to London on a Saturday night, in the early part of August, and the prisoner came to me on the Monday after - I do not know what he came for; he said, he wanted to speak to me; I told him I was so engaged I could not speak to him then, but I should be at liberty at nine o'clock in the evening - I had made some discovery before he came, and he was soon after taken into custody, but they were matters distinct from this indictment; I had no knowledge of these at the time - I have had no communication with the prisoner since he has been in custody; the book has not been shown to him since.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Just tell me the amount of the present you were in the habit of making him? A. 10l. a year; I remitted to him money on account of his salary once a month; April was the last time; I have had his acknowledgment for them; there had been conversation about allowing him a commission from June in the present year, if he had continued with me, but it was never acted upon - at the time I saw him at Birmingham I had no reason to believe that there was any account between us, but that which left him in debt that 60l.; and when I went before the Lord Mayor I was not aware of the items in this indictment.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BOULTON. I am a needle and pin-maker. I deal with the prosecutor; I knew the prisoner in his employ - I settled this account with him on the 23rd of August, 1832, by bill 13l., bill 9l. 10s., cash 34l. 10s. making a total of 57l. - the bill was 57l. 12s. 4d., here is the prisoner's receipt for it - (read.) "Allowed 12s. 4d. for

            Hands."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long had you dealt with the prosecutor? A. I am not certain, perhaps two years or more - this bill is headed, Jenkins and Son; I am not certain whether all the bills are so; I had returned to the prosecutor, on the 9th of February, 2 cwt. of old metal, which came to 4l. 10s. - I cannot say whether the 4l. 10s. was due to me for that metal when I paid this bill - the prisoner used to go to my clerks, and they settled it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say whether on this occasion, you paid the prisoner bills and money amounting to 57l., or that you paid this bill deducting 4l. 10s. and the 12s. 4d.? A. No, I paid him 57l. in money and bills.</p>
               <p>ROBERT FAIRBURN. I am a wire-drawer, and live in Old-street. I dealt with the firm of Jenkins and Son, in 1832; I knew the prisoner as their clerk; this is my account with their firm, it is 45l. 4s., but it was originally 35l. 4s. - on the 20th of November, 1832, here is the prisoner's receipt for a bill 18l.; cheque 8l. 10s.; and cash 8l. 14s. making together 35l. 4s. and signed, 
               <persName id="t18330905-196-person1840">G. R. </persName>
            Hands - the account was only 35l. 4s. but it was 10l. short, and he called the next morning, and said, he had made a mistake, and reckoned it too little - I then paid him 9l. 10s. more, and here is the 10s. he allowed for discount.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050120"/>MR. JENKINS re-examined. Have you any partner? A. No; I trade under the firm of Jenkins and Son; I did allow my father a settled sum out of the business, but it did not depend on the trade.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What is the usual credit of your trade? A. We profess to give six months, but it often extends to eight or nine months; but a great many of our customers pay earlier; some only one month; no doubt money has been received, both from Mr. Boulton and Mr. Fairburn since these embezzlements, but I did not examine my ledger with reference to these sums till after the prisoner was committed by the Lord Mayor - I had a regular debtor and creditor account with those persons, but the collecting was in the prisoner's hands till he was discharged, so that I had no means of discovering it - our accounts are sent in half-yearly, or in some cases quarterly; if any objection had been made to these accounts, it would not have come to me but through the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who kept the ledger? A. Mr. Alccck; these sums appear in the ledger, but the prisoner had the settlement of all accounts - I received information that there was a deficiency in these accounts, and then I looked over the ledger and found it; I then applied to the parties, to know what had been paid.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in his defence, read a very long address, stating that he had been for some years in the prosecutor's service, and that he had exerted himself to increase his business, which he had from 100l. to 400l. per week; that the prosecutor had offered to allow him one per cent. commission on all monies received from Christmas, 1832, but which he had never done; that having been discharged without any notice he had no time to correct any errors, which might have crept into the account, and that he had not been since allowed to settle, and that he firmly believed there was now a balance in his own favour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wood, Newcastle-street; Mr. Simmons, Birmingham; Mr. Lewis, Bow-street; Mr. Stevens, Thaives-inn; Mr. Jones, Grafton-street; Mr. Linford, Doctors-commons; Mr. Jackson, Butcher-hall-lane; and Mr. Joyce, of Wood-street, gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

I knew Mr. Delianson Clark, in 1829 - I did not know him by the name of George - I have had transactions with him, in the way of business, and took an acceptance from him - I have seen him write several times - I doubt the acceptance to this bill being his hand-writing; it is not signed the same as mine; the signature is not certainly like the one I have - I have letters from him - this signature is not like his certainly, as far as I am able to judge.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you receive any letters from him? A. No - he mostly made out my bills - he wrote not only figures but words - I paid him for it - he assisted as a kind of clerk.</p>

I was in St. Giles's, and saw both the omnibuses before the accident, driving at a moderate pace - I was standing outside of the Angel Inn - the omnibuses were going by - the child appeared to pass Shillibeer's, and the other omnibus came in contact with her - the near horse knocked her down, and the two wheels passed over her body - I could not see any blame that could be attached to the driver, it was so sudden - I instantly took the child up - I was examined before the Coroner - there was room sufficient for Bardell's omnibus to go by - when I saw Bardell's it was about passing the other - it was in the broad part of the street at that time, and there was sufficient room - the Angel joins the church - the omnibusses were beyond me a few yards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050123"/>towards Holborn - they were nearer Holborn - they had passed me near Compton-street - they had not got to Compton-street - it might be one house from Compton-street - I consider Bardell's omnibus was not going seven miles an hour - it could not be going eight - I said before the Coroner that Bardell's, was going faster than the other - not that it was going very fast, but that it was going faster than Shillibeer's.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that your hand writing? A. That is my hand writing - it was read over to me - I said Bardell's was going faster than Shillibeer's - I meant to say it was passing it - I did not see it pass Shillibeer's - but the child had run across, and must have passed Shillibeer's - when I first saw her, she was under the near side horse's head, about being knocked down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I believe you also said before the Coroner, that these two omnibuses were not racing? A. I did; according to what I considered myself - I certainly did not take particular notice in respect to saying Bardell's was going very fast - for I consider, when an omnibus is going between seven and eight miles an hour it is not such a rapid pace - in my judgment they were not racing - I saw the man who drove Bardell's omnibus, try his utmost to pull up before the child was knocked down - if it had been his own child, he could not have avoided the accident.</p>

I was at my window and saw the two omnibuses coming very fast, they appeared to be racing - I saw the child; it passed by the head of Shillibeer's omnibus - it was knocked down by the other one - the other was coming on the off side of Shillibeer's - I did not see it knocked down - I saw the omnibus stop - I saw the child under the hind wheel - it did not stop before that - they were coming I should suppose, at the rate of ten miles an hour - the horses were galloping - the prisoner was the driver of Bardell's omnibus.</p>

I am a house surgeon at the Middlesex hospital - the child was brought there; I found her very much bruised on the left side of the belly; she died about half-past eight o'clock that evening, from a rupture of the spleen, and a quantity of blood extravasated in the abdomen, which would no doubt be caused by being run over.</p>

I purchased the chest of tea stated in the indictment, at the June tea sale; it stands in my list in the third class, and is described by the Company's tea tasters, as middling Congon - I had it at 2s. 2d. and the duty is the same, which made it 4s. 4d. per lb.; it was left in the warehouse as is usual till it is wanted, and I had never made out any order at any time for its being delivered - about the 12th or 13th August, I heard it was gone I then missed it from my warrant.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you know that there is such a thing as smuggled tea? A. I have heard there is - if tea is exported we do not pay the duty; if a person were to take tea to the opposite side of the channel and smuggle it back, he could have it without the duty - I had paid the duty for this; it was a lot of nine I had paid for; this chest was No. 677 by the Edinboro; that number was marked on the chest; I did not pay the duty on this chest myself, but my clerk did; I have no partner - I know Collins, he keeps a store shop and deals in very thing - I think it is likely that he deals in tea as well as other things, though I have no knowledge of it; I never heard that the prisoner was his servant - I have no recollection of hearing that before the Lord Mayor; I will not swear that it was not distinctly stated as the ground of the prisoner's defence that he was the servant of Collins - I preferred a bill against Collins on the evidence of Thompson, a servant of mine, who had been robbing me; the Lord Mayor sent him to the Compter - as soon as I missed the tea, I inquired of Thompson, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050125"/>he made a statement, on which I admitted him as evidence; I preferred a bill against Collins, which was thrown out by the Grand Jury - I had not seen Collins after I was at the Mansion-house; he has not been at my house nor I at his; I have no knowledge of his being a man of property - I never heard any intimation that money was no object; I never heard a sum of 150l. mentioned.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Do you generally have possession of your tea warrants? A. Yes, every night; on the 5th of August, I delivered this warrant to Thompson; he had to clear with the warrant; the other eight chests had all been permitted, and sent to different persons in the country before that day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If I understand you right, he had been entrusted with the warrant from time to time, which would authorize the clearing of nine chests, and to your knowledge he had only cleared eight? A. Yes, he took the warrant to the India-house, to clear those chests we had occasion for - there is no mark made on the warrant as to what was to be cleared, that is done on paper called a request paper; I gave no request paper for this chest, but Thompson could do that himself - I have never seen the warrant again; it becomes waste paper after the last chest is cleared.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you ever ask for it? A. I asked Thompson for it, and made every search for it in every way; they are sometimes left at the India-house - I have not been able to get it.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever see the chest in possession of the prisoner? A. No, I saw it placed on the knot of a porter, to carry it out - I stole the chest of tea - I don't know whether the duty was paid or not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you known Collins? A. I had seen him, and spoken with him - I don't know that the prisoner was his servant - Collins keeps a marine store shop - I had sold a chest of tea to Collins before of my master's - he keeps a shop for the sale of grocery, and all sorts of necessaries for persons going abroad.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You sold to the prisoner as an agent of Collins? A. Yes, and I received the money for this tea of Collins - my cousin took me to the prisoner, and I knew that I was going to deal with a person on behalf of Collins - it went to a person named Taylor in the Borough.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Do you remember how many chests were on the warrant for that day? A. Only one was then remaining, I had cleared the other eight at different times before- I could get at the warrants before Mr. Nicholson came to town - Collins paid me on my taking a letter from the prisoner about two hours after I sold it.</p>

            . I am a labourer. On the 5th of August I was employed by the prisoner to carry a chest of tea to Mrs. Taylor in the Borough - I took it, and she refused to take it in; I brought it out of the house, to look for another person of the name of Taylor, and the prisoner came to me and said, "Take it on to my house;" he went with me, and showed me where his house was, in Great Suffolk-street; I took it there, and carried it up one pair of stairs - I don't recollect the marks on the chest, but it was a chest of congon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Had you known the prisoner before? A. Yes, I knew him in a respectable line of business - I found there was some mistake when I got the chest to Mrs. Taylor's; he went into Mrs. Taylor's house, and had some conversation with her, and then he came out and said, "Take it on to my house" - it was between twelve and one o'clock in the day - I carried it on my knot - and the permit was in my pocket, which I gave to the prisoner when I got to his house - Collins' house is No. 8, East Smithfield - the prisoner's house was nearer to Mrs. Taylor's than Collins'.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prisoner go with you to get the tea? A. He stood outside the gateway while I went into the warehouse in Crutched-friars for it - he said he should go with me.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did any one go up the yard? A. No; I did not see any one that had any control over it; I took it by the permit which I got from the prisoner - I saw no warrant on it - I saw Thompson, but he did not say anything to me about it; I took it to Stone's from Mr. Taylor's, and the next day I took a chest away from Stones.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who paid you for carrying the chest? A. Thompson paid me directly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did he say when he paid you? A. He met me at the gate and said, "Here is the money for carrying this tea," and he gave me a shilling, which was the proper porterage to the Borough.</p>
