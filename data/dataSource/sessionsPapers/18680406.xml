I tried it, it was bad, and I took it up to my father, who went down with me and spoke to the prisoner, who then ran away—my father ran after him—I had served the other man first, he paid me with good money, and left before the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an M.R.C.S., of 94, Lisson Grove—the male prisoner was in my service in October, 1866, under the name of Arthur Dowdall, until about the middle of December—I had a great many opportunities of seeing him write—I believe this letter to be his writing. I know the female prisoner—she was represented to be his wife.</p>

I am a constable, employed at Nicholson's Wharf, Thames Street, and have been for twenty years—the prisoner has been twelve or fourteen years in the service of the firm, and for the last three years in a permanent situation—on the 9th March, about a quarter past seven, I stopped him as he was leaving the wharf—I asked him if he had anything about him belonging to the firm—he said "No"—I then took him into the office, and found under his waistcoat this piece of cloth (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), wrapped round his body—I asked him where he got it from—he said, "I shan't tell you"—I told him I should give him into custody, and he asked me if I would look over it until morning—I said I could not do that—he then said he found it in the <hi rend="italic">dummy</hi>, that is a lighter moored to the premises—I have never seen any cloth in it during the time I have been there—I gave him into custody, and then went to his house, where I found several other pieces—two pieces exactly corresponded with that I found on him—and I also found a piece with the name of the firm branded on it.</p>

               <p>have about twenty men in my service, employed in repairing clocks—in the upper part of the house there is a shop in which five men are employed, of which the prisoner was one—he has been in my service five or six years—he was employed from nine in the morning till half-past seven, and his wages were 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he had no authority to get wages from anyone else—previous to 15th March, my attention was directed to the work coming from the five men—the shop did not pay—I called the prisoner down, and spoke to him with reference to a self-registering compass—I desired him to stay in my lower shop till his work was brought to me—he did not stay, but in the hurry of business he got away—I went out of the shop for three or four hours, and on my return I found him in the workshop—I asked him for the machine—he said, when my manager's back was turned he had got it away to his own house—I said, "Why, do you mean in my time; you take goods out of the house. For whom did you make it?"—I had some difficulty in getting an answer, and then he said, "No, I have not taken it to my house, but I have taken it to Captain Albini's, for whom I have made it"—he is connected with the Italian Embassy—I had not heard from the prisoner at all that he was doing work for Captain Albini—I then sent for the officer, Cheshire—I had told the prisoner that unless he gave me the machine on which he had been at work I should give him in charge for stealing my property—he then left with the officer and returned in about half-an-hour, and brought a box with him—I demanded to see the contents of the box, and I found it contained the self-registering compass on which he had been at work for Captain Albini—this is part of it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the other part was taken away the next morning by another workman—when the box was brought back it was left upstairs—these are some of the internal works—there was also part of an electric clock, and a piece of material on which he was at work for me, some pieces of metal which correspond with metal I have in my establishment, and a pinion collect—I had not given him any authority to remove any of my materials—I asked him to account for having made this for Albini, because it must have taken two or three months to have made—I think he said it was made in his own time—I said, "How could that be, when you left at half-past seven in the evening, and left all the machine behind you"—then I said, "About the materials; where did you get the materials?"—he said, "I got the framework where you get your frameworks, from a man in Clerkenwell," and he showed me a receipt for which he had paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the rough frame—I then said, "How about all the other wheels, and the escapement"—I think he said they were made with his own materials—I at once looked at he material, and found it to correspond with mine, and I told him that it was not so—of course I cannot swear exactly to brass—I then said, "How do you account for taking the electric clock"—he said, "Oh, I bought that of Mr. Baines"—he is the patentee—I said that I knew better, because I knew where the clock had come from—one of the other workmen told me, in the prisoners presence, that the clock was taken from a cus<lb/>tomer in Camden Town, for which I substituted a clock of our own make—I had substituted an ordinary movement for the electric movement—when I said they were my materials, I do not think he made any reply—these three thermometers were brought to me the next morning by the detective—they are such as have been in my stock—there is one with the name of French on it—I succeeded Mr. French about six years ago—and</p>

About ten minutes past nine, on Tuesday night, 17th March, I was on duty in the New North Road—in consequence of information, I went to the lock-house, on the towing path, on the Regent's Canal—I saw the prisoner there and four or five others—I told the prisoner I had been told that he had thrown his son in the Canal—he did not appear at all excited when I told him that, he was sitting down, "If such is the case it amounts to murder, but as there is no witness here present that saw it done, I shall not take you in custody on that charge, but I must detain you, and take you to the Police Station"—he did not make any reply at that time—three or four minutes afterwards, when we got on the way to the station, about sixty or seventy yards from the lock-house, he said, "I sent him out about two hours ago for half-a-pound of sugar; as he did not return I went to look for him, and I found him, and we took a walk together, as we generally do, and when going under the arch he all at once slipped in, and his shoes slipped off; I tried to get him out but could not"—I then left him at the station—I was afterwards present at the charge was read over to him by the sergeant on duty—I have not got the charge sheet here—he made some observation at the time, I don't remember the exact words, but it was a denial of the charge—he said he was innocent of the charge—I went to the canal, and the spot was pointed out to me by Pritchard—I remained there till one in the morning—I did not assist in dragging that night, I did next morning—I know Crescent Place, Whitmore Road, where the prisoner lives—I have measured the distance, and sketched a slight plan of the place (<hi rend="italic">handing it in</hi>)—the prisoner's house is the second from the towing path—the wall of the house next to the towing path is ten feet high, it is 620 yards from the prisoner's house to the place where the boy was drowned—that is, measuring along the towing path—there is no access to the towing path from the prisoner's house—you would have to go to the Queen's Road Bridge—the are only two entrances, and from one to the other ia 1, 670 yards—that would be the nearest way of getting to the towing path—he could not get down by the Kingsland Road bridge, nor anywhere between the two points, except by getting over a wall, not between Queen's Road bridge, till you come to a little entry by New North Hoad bridge, 220 yards on this side, at the lock-house—there</p>

Prescott &amp; Co.'s—my cheque-book was in the drawer of the safe—I examined it some days after and found that two blank cheques had been torn out, these produced are the two—my desk was also forced open—I had a number of paid cheques in the desk, and they were all scattered about the place—this cheque, dated 9th November, 1867, "Pay Mr. T.

                  </hi>. I am a cashier at the London and Westminster Bank—on 16th of March, a little before 4, I was at the bank, in Lothbury—Matthews came in and presented this cheque over the counter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) purporting to be signed by Charles Harvey for 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and dated 14th March, 1868, on one of our forms—we have a customer of that name—I said to Matthews, "What shall I give you for it?" the usual question—he said, "160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "I know the cheque is for 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in what form will you have it, notes or gold?"—he said he was not particular, he did not care as long as he got the money—I pressed him to give an answer as to what he would have—he then said he would take two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, one 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the rest gold—I said, "135<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold?"—he said, "Yes"—I entered the cheque in my pay book, and went away to get the notes—I showed the cheque to some of my fellow cashiers, who examined it and compared the signature—I then spoke to the manager, Mr. Higley—I went outside the counter, and asked the prisoner where he brought the cheque from—he said, "From Burgoyne &amp; Co."—I said, "Who are they?"—he said, "Burgoyne's, in Coleman Street"—I said, "Do you mean Burgoyne, Burbridge, &amp; Co., the wholesale druggists"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Oh, we know them very well"—I again referred to Mr. Higley, and returned to the prisoner and said, "I will go with you to Bargoyne's," and we went down the office together; when we got to the door he turned to me and said, "I do not come from Bargoyne &amp; Co.'s, I come from Maw &amp; Sons, of Aldersgate Street"—I said, "That alters the case; you must return with me, and state</p>

               <p>that to the manager"—we went back to the manager's room, and I left him with Mr. Higley—Mr. Higley desired me to go to Maw &amp; Sons, and see if his statement was correct—they are wholesale druggists—I went there and made inquiries on the subject, and after that returned to the bank—the prisoner had previously said that he had rcceivod it from Mr. scott, who was confidential clerk to Messrs. Maw &amp; Sons, Aldersgate Street—they had no person of that name in their employment—when I told Mr. Higley that, the prisoner said, "I did not say Scott, I said Charles"—I then went and fetched Sergeant Spittle—I believe I saw this paper written by the prisoner in the manager's room—he was requested to write his name and address, in case we should have to communicate with him; and he wrote "R.

About 4 o'clock on Monday, 16th March, I was sent for to the London and Westminster Bank—the manager made a communication to me, handed me the cheque for 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I was introduced to the prisoner Matthews—he was in the manager's room—I said to him, "I am informed that you have brought a cheque to the bank, fur 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which is believed to be a forgery; lama police-officer; consider what you say, for it may be used against you for the purposes of justice"—he replied, "About 3.30 this afternoon, I met a man in Aldersgate Street, near Maw's; he asked me to oblige him by taking the cheque to the bank, and getting it cashed; I replied I did not care about doing it; he said, 'You will very much oblige me if you will;' I then consented to go"—at this time Sergeant Funnell came to the bank, and we took the prisoner, to Aldersgote Street, in a cab, the prisoner saying he should like to ride in a cab, that the man who gave him the cheque might not see him—he pointed out Maw's premises as the place where he met the man, and said, after giving him the cheque the man went up the gateway, and told him, when he returned, to go up the steps (the steps lead from a yard to the principal part of the premises at Maw's) and inquire for him—he stated that he knew the man by the name of Charles—I asked him if that was the Christian name, or surname of the man—he said he only knew him by that name—we then took the prisoner into Messrs.

I received instructions from the Prosecu<lb/>tors to watch their premises, and commenced to watch on the 22nd or 23rd of February, and continued on duty till the 5th of March—on 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th of March I traced the prisoner from the prosecutor's premises, in Cannon Street, by railway, to Roberts' shop, at 13, Bear Street, Leicester Square, on each occasion he went right through the shop into the back parlour—he left the warehouse at six, and got to the shop at twenty minutes past—it is a trimming shop—on the 5th March I followed him in—Roberts was there—I told him I was an officer, and had reason to suppose he had stolen property in his possession—he said, "I have nothing about me"—I said, "I must search you"—I found a pound packet of thread, and asked him where he got it from—he said he bought it at Edmund's, Gutter Lane—(the police constable, Frederick Brett was with me)—I unbuttoned his waistcoat and found underneath his braces some cloth—thinking I might have to go further in my search, I requested Mrs. Roberts to go into the front shop, leaving him in the custody of Frederick Brett in the parlour—I went into the shop and said to Mrs. Roberts, "I am a police officer, this man has been robbing his employers, and bringing the property to you; and it will depend on the property you produce to me, and as to the satisfaction you give for your possession of it, whether I lock you up as a receiver, or treat you as a witness"—she said, "I bought nothing of him; I know him as a dealer"—I then said, "Well, once for all, I shall give you another opportunity, and if I search and find property belonging to his employer, I shall then treat you as a receiver"—she then produced two pieces of cloth, and said, "I bought these of him"—I asked what else—she said, "I do not recollect anything else"—I said, "You have bought silk, twist, velvet, and thread of him "—I then commenced to search the shop, and found seven pieces of cloth, from two to three yards in length, five pieces of velvet, one piece of velveteen, four reels of twist, three pound packets of thread, four pounds of sewing silk, all of which she admitted she had bought of Tyler—I also asked her the prices she gave, and the time she bought them—the two yards of velvet she said she bought on Monday, and gave 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them; two and five-eighths yards of cloth on 3rd March, for 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the sewing silk was at the rate of 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a reel for twist—I then asked if she had any invoices showing that she had bought goods, and she produced her file—I was then about to remove the property, when Tyler was brought in, who said, "What is all this?"—Robers</p>

               <p>said, "This is what I bought of you, Tyler"—he made no reply—I then directed Mrs. Roberts to attend at the Mansion House on the following day, 6th March, at twelve o'clock, and Tyler was taken into custody—on the following day he was brought up at the Mansion House—she appeared in Court, and was ordered into custody before the case had gone far on—she was remanded, and I arranged to meet her at her shop, to make further search—I went accordingly with Mr. Hart, a witness in the employ of Mr. Bousneld—Mr. Hart then identified thirty-three balls of buttons and ten reels of twist, which were taken from the shop—Mrs. Roberts said she had bought these of a man two years ago, who had gone to America—I asked her if she had invoices for these goods—she produced one of Mr. Edmunds' invoices only.</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly in the C Division, Metropolitan Police—I left it in August last—on the morning of 3rd March, between 2 and 2.15, I was going home through Finsbury Square, towards Chiswell Street—I crossed from Sun Street, past Messrs. Whitbread's brewery—I had been with a cousin to Hackney Wick; there was a benefit for the Clerken<lb/>well outrage, for the sufferers by the explosion, to get some money for them—I had left my cousin in the Hackney Road—when I got against Whitbread's brewery, two young men ran past me on the left hand side—I deliberately turned round and watched them—they crossed over, and-went</p>

               <p>up Whitecross Street—when I got to Whitecoross Street corner, the prisoner stood there, and he deliberately fired at mo with a revolver—he might then be about five yards from me—I had walked up to him, meeting him, and he was standing—I was walking on the pavement—he was not in the road, he was at the corner—I heard a hiss by my right ear when he fired, as if it was a bullet—he then deliberately fired a second time, and I put my head back against the shutters, as I was so agitated I did not know what I was doing—I heard a similar hiss on my left side, and the prisoner went across to me—I called out "Murder! police!" and he deliberately turned, and fired at me again—I had got my umbrella in my hand, and was following him—eight or nine yards behind him, my foot caught against a stone, and I fell, and by chance the shot went over me, and I was not hit—I called "Murder! police!"—Maley, a policeman, came up, and said, "What is it?"—I said, "Take that man, he has shot at me, "pointing to the prisoner—he said, "Are you sure he is the man?—I said "Yes, take him"—the prisoner had his hand behind him, with a revolver in it; I saw it distinetly against the lamp-post—Maley went on one side of him, and I on the other—a struggle ensued; he tried to get released from us—I said, "For God Almighty's sake hold him still;" but he got the revolver up, and went bang, bang, discharging the revolver twice, and pointing it towards where I was; and a piece of the cap went into my right eye—ho fired right at me, but I put my head back, and it did not hit me.</p>

               <p>1863—there might have been complaints, but I resigned—I then went down home, as steward to my brother-in-law, near Pinchenfield, in Essex—I was employed as farm bailiff—my brother-in-law did not get rid of a farm bailiff and put me in his place—he maintained me from the time I left the police till March, 1864, when I went and joined the Essex constabulary—I did not like that, and resigned in four or five months—there was no com<lb/>plaint against me there—I then went and took a second attendant's place at St. Luke's Asylum—I lived in the house—I was there eleven months, and resigned because I had bad health—I then went and stayed a little while at my own brother's house—I have two friends in London, my brother and my cousin—I was earning nothing then—I joined the Metropolitan Police on 14th May, 1866, and resigned on 30th August, 1867—I was brought up to farming—I liked the Metropolitan Police very well, but there was a little dispute, I was robbed of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of my box and some suits of clothes, which caused ill feeling, and one of the constables put a wet towel in my place; I did not like it, and resigned—from August, 1867, up to the period of the Clerkenwell explosion, I was specially employed by police officers engaged in the cases—I was living in London—I was paid by them—that was not my only means of livelihood, because I had my own savings—my pay as a constable of the Metropolitan Force was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week, with a deduc<lb/>tion out of that for superannuation allowance and the mess, which was 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I did not have gratuities—I was paid for work done—I can't say what it amounted to a week, for we were so engaged I cannot inform you—I kept no account—the largest sum I received was 1<hi rend="italic">l.</hi>; but I have had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and so on—I had no regular pay—I mean to say that I went to this public-house, Little Pulteney Street, on duty, before the Clerkenwell explosion, that was part of the labour for which I had those sums—the public-house in Little Pulteney Street is the same as that in Great Windmill Street—that is the house that Allen and Timothy Desmond and O'Keefe frequented—I cannot tell you any day when I saw the prisoner in that public-house, because I never took a note of it—I have sworn that I saw him in that public-house before the explosion—I hare seen him in the public-house which they frequented, but I never spoke to him—I cannot tell you what month I first saw him, or the last time I saw him, I did not take notice of it—I have never spoken to him—I have seen him in company with those persons in the public-house, but not when anybody has been present with me—I used to go by myself, and sometimes I had some of the other officers with me—my visits to the public-house in. Pulteney Street and Great Windmill Street extended from August down to December—I have not been there since December—I have been past Desmond's house, 9, Cross Street, Regent Street, since December, but not to watch it—I have not been employed to watch since December—there are a great many officers named Chamberlain who I know, but I do not know one in the Metropolitan Police Force; I know one in the City of London Force—I do not know Chowne—I can read—I read newspapers—I have not heard of money for rewards subscribed for Chowne and Chamberlain: do you mean in the <hi rend="italic">E</hi> division? I have heard that a man did shoot at two constables of the <hi rend="italic">E</hi> division; but I know nothing of them—I never spoke to them—I do not know of subscriptions of money to those men, only what I have heard say—I have been in frequent communication with the police for the last three months; and I mean the Jury to believe that I have never heard a word from anyone of a subscription for those men—I went</p>

               <p>to the Police Court, and was examined the same morning, within a few hours of the transaction—I have sworn to-day that the prisoner was standing still when he fired the first shot—the solicitor asked me the question a few hours after the occurrence, and I said I could not tell whether he was standing still—but that was the second time, when he was brought up on remand, it was within a week of the transaction—I did not say, "I can't say whether he was standing still or walking on" (<hi rend="italic">The Witness's depositions being read stated</hi>, "I cannot say whether he was standing still or walking on")—I should say when examined by the prisoner's attorney at the Police Court, that I could not say whether he was standing still or walking on when he fired—I cannot say now whether that is a mistake, when a person is moving you cannot tell, when he is in a deliberate manner going to deprive a man of his life—he was not walking—Mr. Ricketts asked me the question before the Magistrate, and I told him I could not tell whether he was walking or not; and I say it still, that I cannot tell—there were two shots fired after Maley came up—those were the fourth or fifth shots—I have said to-day that the fourth shot was aimed at me, and but for my putting my head on one side it would have struck me—I did say before the Magistrate I did not know whether the bullet went into the ground when he fired the fourth shot—Mr. Ricketts pressed me so that I dare say I did say so—I see no distinction between what I said before the Magistrate, and what I am saying now—the fourth shot was aimed at me—I say to-day that the fifth shot was fired at Maley—when those, shots were fired we both had hold of the prisoner, and a struggle was taking place—the fifth shot was not fired over my shoulder, it was in this way—I cannot tell you whether it was fired over my right shoulder, I was so excited.</p>

I live at 1, Milton Street, Cripplegate, and am a box<lb/>maker—on the morning of the 3rd March I was coming down Whitecross Street—heard a report and saw a flash in Red Lion Market, that it at the corner of Whitecross Street—I heard one more shot fired besides that—the constable walked past me—I heard four shotsfired altogether—my friend Ewar picked up the pistol.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant O</hi>). On the morning of 3rd March, about 2.15, I was at the corner of Play House Yard, Whitecross Street—I heard the report of fire arms and saw a flash, went to the place and saw the prisoner and the constable struggling together in the road—there was a quantity of smoke and a smell of powder—Maley had hold of the prisoner, and Hill had hold of him behind by the collar—I received this revolver from Ewar—I took the prisoner to the station and searched him—I looked at the revolver, it had five chambers, and had been recently discharged—one of the nipples had an exploded percussion cap on it, which Inspector Bryant took off—Hill charged the prisoner with discharging three chambers at him, and Maley with discharging two at him—Inspector Bryant entered the charge on the sheet, and read it over to the prisoner, who said, "I can do ten years for this"—directly they put him in the cell went and looked at a gate-post belonging to Haywood and Taylor, right opposite where the shot was fired, and found the dent of a bullet there—the prisoner refused his address.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know now where he is working? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he is a shoemaker, working for Mr. Cox, of 198, Whitecross Street, and living on the premises—I walked with them all the way to the station—I have not cut out the piece from the gate-post, it is solid oak; it is not punctured with the bullet, I only saw an indentation—I saw the post every night in the week—I had not seen the indentation the night before; it, seemed to me fresh done—I could not judge when it was done, I should not have noticed it then if this was not done—it has chipped off the paint all round, and there is an indentation in the post, and a lead mark as well—I tried to find the lead but could not—I believe I mentioned the lead mark</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector G</hi>). I was at Old Street station when the prisoner was brought there in custody—I entered the charge, and read it over to him, telling him he was charged with feloniously shooting at John Harvey Hill and Portens Maley, with intent to kill and murder them, at Whitecross Street, St. Luke's—he said, "All right, I can do ten years for that bit"—he was a little in liquor I think, but it was hardly perceivable, he was able to walk and talk—he gave his name Thomas O'Hara—I asked him where he lived, he said that he declined to give his address, as he did not wish his friends to know anything about it—I went the same morning with Allingham, looked at the gate-post, and found a circular indentation, such as a bullet would make.</p>

Next day I had to pawn my shirt to get a breakfast; I believe the policeman has the pawn ticket; and does it stand to reason if I had the watch or the proceeds on the 15th, I should pawn my shirt the very next day to get victuals?

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Nugent, of 151/2, Peerless Row, City Road—on 14th March, about 12.30 at night, I was with him in Bath Street—there were a good many persons there, they pushed against us and knocked my husband down—then the prisoner rushed at me, struck me on the head, knocked me down, and stabbed me on the forehead—the stab was the first blow, it knocked me down—she then knelt on me and stabbed me several times—I screamed, my husband rushed over and dragged her off—she said nothing—I got up and made my way to my own door—a cab was called—I was taken to the station, and a surgeon was sent for—I have been very ill from those wounds—I am quite certain it was the prisoner who stabbed me.</p>

I am the husband of the last witness—I was with her—I have heard her evidence, it is quite true—I had no quarrel till I was hit by one of the parties—no one spoke to me, but someone shoved against me, and a young chap stepped up to me, and said, "If you do not go on I will give you a punch in the eye," using bad language—he pushed me against the wall—I scrambled on my feet again, and that was the time I had the <hi rend="italic">wrangle</hi> with him—that did not lead to a quarrel—I did not see him any more till I gave the prisoner in charge—three or four other men stood with their hands before me, sparring up to me, and I heard my wife scream—she was lying on the pavement, between three or four yards off—I made my way from the mob to her, and I had these lads hanging on my coat, punching my head—I saw the prisoner on top of my wife, and dragged her off—I am sure it was the prisoner—she rushed at me—I cannot say whether she had anything in her hand—I pushed her—I had hold of one or two men, they came round me, and then two constables came up and dispersed the mob—I went to the door and saw my wife outside bleeding—I sent for a cab, and as we went along (I was outside and one of the policemen inside)</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Cartwright, a shoemaker, of 1, South Street, Forest Hill—the deceased, Alfred Cartwright, was my son—he was twenty-seven years of age in June last—he had a wife and three children, and another expected—he had a little shop, which his wife managed—he himself had been for nearly four years potman at the Swiss Cottage—last Thursday night, 2nd April, from 11 o'clock till half-past, I went to the Swiss Cottage, to get half a pint of beer for my supper—I found my son there, and my husband also—I did not get my beer—my husband, my son, and I shortly proceeded to come home together—I accompanied my son to his house; I was going to see his wife—when we got to the house, we found several persons round the shutters, making a disturbance—the prisoner was one of them—I did not know him at all—they were quarrelling, and knocking and battering against the shutters, and my son asked them not to make such a disturbance—he said, "Move on a little further; don't make a disturbance just here"—with that, the prisoner rose his fist, and made three strikes at my son, but he jumped from the blows off into the road, and missed them, avoided the blows—he went across to his father and said, "Father, I can't put up with this; I will go and see if I can find a constable, and have him locked up, at least, have him moved further"—the prisoner could hear that—we went across the road, and looked up the street to see if we could see a policeman, and we could not, and on our return we saw a policeman with the mob, dispersing them as he could—at that time, the prisoner and his party were just a few steps further on, and as my son came towards them, the prisoner said, "There is the fellow that I offered a <hi rend="italic">prop</hi> to"—I don't know what a <hi rend="italic">prop</hi> means, unless it is a blow; I under<lb/>stood it as that—he then rose his fist, and struck him a blow on the side of the right eye—it was a violent blow; the mark is on him now—the police<lb/>man was there then; he saw the blow struck—my son gave him in charge to the policeman, and he took him in charge for the blow, and proceeded to take him to the station—he took hold of his left arm, and they walked on in that way; I, my son, and my husband followed after—my son was walking on the left side of the policeman, and I and my husband walked by his side—as we were walking along in that way, the prisoner looked round in front of the policeman, and said to my son, "Here, I wish to know, do you mean to look me up for that simple crack"—we had then gone from about half to three-quarters of a mile—my son Raid, "Yes, I do mean it; if you don't know better, you must be taught"—he said, "Then you do mean to press the charge"—my son said, "I do"—for a moment or two after those</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186804060089"/>
               <p>words they were quiet, and then he deliberately rose his right hand, and thrust it round into the body of my son, and he fell—he faltered a moment, but he never took another step—he fell into his father's arms; he supported him—he said, "Mother, I am stabbed"—I saw the glitter of the knife as the prisoner struck round in front of the policeman—my son sank to the ground, as his father helped him—I undid his waistcoat and the waistband of his trousers, and his warm blood came over my bands—the policeman directly conveyed the prisoner to the station; I and my husband remained with my son—a stretcher was afterwards brought, and he was taken into the station, and Dr. Wilkinson looked at him; he bound a large bandage round the wound—it was thought right to take him immediately to the hospital—a cab was procured, and I and the policeman went with him—but he died in the cab, in my arms—the prisoner was perfectly sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the husband of last witness, and father of the deceased—on Thursday last I was with my wife at the Swiss Cottage—I accompanied her and my son to his house—when we got there I saw the prisoner and some other persons—I did not know the prisoner before—he was quarrelling with some woman that was there—my son came up at the same time, and wished him to move on, as he did not want that dis<lb/>turbance in front of his place—the prisoner upon that aimed a blow at him—he stepped on one side out of the way of it, and sprang out into, the road—he said, "Father, I can't stand this, we will find a policeman"—after looking up the road, we came back and found a policeman a few steps from the place where the quarrel was—as my son came up I heard the prisoner say, "That is the man, 'or' the b——' that I wanted to give a <hi rend="italic">prop</hi> to, but he would not take it"—my son got closer to the prisoner, and the prisoner shot out his hand and struck him a tremendous blow in the eye; the marks are there now—I did not see that the prisoner struck him with any<lb/>thing but his fist—my son had not time to say anything—the policeman took hold of the prisoner in an instant—and my son gave him into custody—the policeman laid hold of the prisoner, and they walked along towards the station, and I and my son and my wife as well—when we got up before Mr. Beadle's house, the prisoner called my son in front of him—he nodded his head and said, "Do you mean to give me in custody for this simple crack?"—he said, "Yes, if you don't know better, you must be learnt better"—they had not gone another step farther, I think, before the prisoner muttered something else, and then he reached round in front of the police<lb/>man with his hand, and stabbed my sun in his side, and he fell down instantly</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 293). I was on duty last Thursday night in the Grove Road, Forest Hill—there was a disturbance in the Park Road, in which the prisoner and others were engaged—I tried to disperse them, and desired the prisoner to go home—he was about to fight with a man for a shilling; they were arguing together—I prevented the fight—they afterwards got together again, and said they were determined to fight—I again desired the prisoner to go home—at this time the deceased came up—the prisoner was close by me at the time—the deceased asked for the man that had previously attempted to assault him—I said, "I don't know the man"—he said, "I will point him out"—the prisoner immediately plunged forward, and struck him a blow on the right eye—upon that he gave him into custody—I took him, and we all proceeded together to the station—the prisoner did not say anything when I took him—I took him by the left arm—I put my right arm inside his left, and held him firmly—his right hand was free; he had not much power with his left hand, because I had him by the lower part of that arm—the deceased, and his father and mother, walked on my left—before we got to the station the prisoner asked the deceased if he intended to be so hard-hearted as to lock him up for that common assault—he said he did; if he did not know better he must be taught—we had walked about 300 yards from where I took him when the first question was asked; it was asked on two or three occasions—I should say we went over three-quarters of a mile before there was any further con<lb/>versation—when we arrived in High Street the deceased came by my left arm (I had previously warned him to go and walk by his father and mother in the road)—he came up as if to ask me a question, and the prisoner, leaning his head a little to the front, said to him, "Then you will lock me up, eh?"—the deceased said, "I will"—I then saw the prisoner's arm go very sharply in front of my body, in a moment—I seized the prisoner by the right wrist, and at the same time heard the deceased say, "I am stabbed"—I took this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the prisoner's right hand; it has a spring back to it, so that it will not shut until the spring is touched—it was covered with blood at the time I took it from his hand—I said to the prisoner, "What have you done?"—he said, "The b——won't get over that"—I called for help, and two brother constables coming up behind we took the prisoner to the station—he was sober—I afterwards went book, and took the wounded man to the station, and then assisted him to the hospital—he died on the way.</p>

I am house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital—about 2.30 last Friday morning, the deceased was brought there by his mother and the constable; he was quite dead—later in the morning I examined the body: there was a large bruise on the right eye, and a wound in the side, which had penetrated the liver and a large artery in the abdomen; it went back to the spine—the front wall would press in with the knife, so that it might not be more than three inches in extent—the loss of blood from that wound was the cause of death—a knife of this description would inflict such a wound.</p>

               <p>who was wounded—there were six or seven pistols in the room—it was there I learnt who was the man who had the barrel, and the man who had got something to carry the fuse—Captain Murphy said that they had the powder all right, and then asked what they were to do for a truck to wheel the powder on—someone in the room, I think it was I, said that a man named Maddox, living in Marshall Street, kept a truck—Felix then went out, and he was gone about the time that he would be gone there and come back again—when he came in he said, "All right"—I also saw Captain Murphy load a cavalry pistol there, and give it to a man who was there—Captain Murphy said that we were to meet at 12 o'clock the next day at Desmond's house, to go from there to the House of Detention, for the pur<lb/>pose of rescuing Burke—we were to go in twos and threes—I did not go—a tundish or funnel was spoken about: that is to carry the fuse—Felix said that he had got it—it was not said what the tundish was for, or what was to be done at the House of Detention, but they all understood it—they were to be at the House of Detention at 3.30—Burke knew all about it—nothing was said as to how Burke was to know anything about it, that I am aware of—on Thursday, 12th December, I was at home—I am not aware that I saw either of the prisoners on the Thursday, but on the evening of that day I saw Barrett at Cavanagh's public-house, Pollen Street—Felix, English, and Patten were there, I think there were some others: I do not know their names—it was about eleven o'clock: it was late when I went out—Barrett came part of the way home with me—Felix was with us—I asked Barrett how they got on that day with the barrel, and he told me that the Captain failed in lighting the fuse that day, but that he, Barrett, would light it to-morrow, and blow it to hell—Barrett always went by the name of Jackson—Ryan lived at Sherwood Place, across the street—on the following day I went to Ryan's, to know if he had done some work for me—I saw Captain Murphy and English there—Ryan was there too—I did not see Murphy after that day—I did not see one of the prisoners from that time until after the explosion—in the evening I heard of the explosion—it was about 5 or 5.30—I was in my shop, and went out to see if I could see anything about it in the newspaper—I saw Patten come into my front room, where I work—his ear was bleeding—a conversation took place between us respecting it—he went into, the back room, through a door which communicated—I did not see him again that night—I did not see Barrett at my house that evening—I saw him later in the evening at the Welsh Stores, at the corner of Glasshouse Street—I noticed that his whiskers were off, and he had a short coat on—up to that time his whiskers were something like mine; the whiskers and beard joined—I cannot say whether he had a moustache or not; I think he had a slight one—Barrett wore a blue coat previous to that night—the jacket that he has on now belongs to Patten—I began to chaff him respesting his whiskers being off, and he said, "Don't speak so loud; it was I who fired the barrel"—I asked him who was with him, he said, "Murphy"—he said that he got his whiskers taken off because he feared that he might be noticed: that he might be identified—I did not see Barrett after that until I saw him at the Bow Street Court—I was taken up on the Thursday after the explosion—I did not see Murphy, Fallon, or Patten after the Friday night—on the Friday night Mrs. Koeppl, a work<lb/>woman, came to the public-house—Barrett was there then—I was arrested on a charge of treason-felony, but some time afterwards I was charged with having assisted in this affair, and I then gave evidence before the Magistrate—I</p>

               <p>about meeting at William Desmond's on the Thursday, the day before the explosion, between 12 and 1 o'clock, to go to the House of Detention—that was arranged at the meeting on Wednesday night, the 11th—it was arranged that we should go in twos and threes—there might be sixteen or eighteen persons present at the meeting at Desmond's—they were to go there, and of course to be of some service in carrying out this plot—nothing was said, it was understood—I did not go, because I was too busy, and another thing, I refused—I said it was not proper for any man of family or a married man to go there at all; I said that as well during the week; I always said so—I did not encourage the explosion at all—I knew they reckoned one traitor among them, so I thought that would be the best way to get out of it—I don't think I mentioned at the Police Court about going in twos and threes, or about Felix Fallon asking for my address in order to put the powder there—I think I gave that information to the solicitor of the Treasury previously—I don't think I mentioned to the Magistrate that I asked Fallon what he was going to do with the powder, and that he said he was going to hawk it—I did not think of it—I did not expect to give evidence on that day, and I did not think of these things—I think I had given information of it to the solicitor for the Treasury, but I am not sure—I saw Barrett on the Thursday, the day preceding the explosion: that is a thing I wanted to mention to-day—yesterday I was asked did I see Barrett—Barrett came to my room either on the Wednesday or Thursday of the explosion, I think Thursday, with another man—I thing it was Felix or young Casey, I can't say which, and at night I saw him at Cavanagh's—I did not expect to see him there—it was in the public bar—I was standing at the bar and they were inside the tap-room—there were a great number of people about there—I used to go there nearly every night—the conversa<lb/>tion about the attempt which had been made that day to blow up the House of Detention was on our way home—Fallon was with me at that time, and English was in company with him in the public-house, and so was Patten—I was by myself at the bar and they were inside the tap-room till we came out—I asked Barrett what became of the barrel of powder, or how they got on with it—he said they got it back all right—he said the captain had failed in lighting the fuse, but that he would light it on the morrow and blow it to hell—I asked him where the barrel was—he said if I went with him he would show me—I don't know whether anything more passed about the failure of the attempt, there may be—I did not inquire who took part in it then, it was too late—I can't say whether I said any<lb/>thing at the police office about Barrett's having said the captain had failed to light the powder, I am not sure—I don't know whether an arrangement was then made for the members to be present next day at the House of Detention—I was not with them, I was where they met—I saw that some of them met at Ryan's house—I was not required to be present—I had said I would not attend it—I saw Murphy on the morning of the explosion—I never saw him afterwards—no arrangement was made by Murphy for me to attend on that day, or for the other members to be there, that I am aware of—I saw Barrett again on the Friday evening, the day of the explosion, in the Welsh Stores, at the corner of Warwick Street and Glasshouse Street, or it may be outside the door, I don't know—I recollect my apprentice, Henry Morris, being examined before the Magistrate—I was at that time in the dock—I believe Morris then stated that on the night of the explosion Barrett came to my house, accompanied by a man whose ear was bleeding, and that he</p>

               <p>had been fighting; the man said so himself—I did not see the man whose ear was bleeding, at the Welsh Stores that night—I saw him at my house—he came into my workshop and asked for a needle and thread—I asked him what was the matter with his ear, and he said he had been fighting and a man bit it—I did not see Barrett—I have heard that he was in the back<lb/>room, since; I did not know it—Morris said so at Bow Street—I don't recollect that he said his whiskers were then on—when I saw Barrett the same evening his whiskers were off, and I chaffed him about it at the bar of the public-house—I knew of the explosion then—Mrs. Koeppl, and Barrett, and I were there—Mrs. Koeppl has worked for me about two years—I did not speak in the presence of a number of people, only Mrs. Koeppl—I do not know whether she was in the secrets of the brotherhood—I would not speak about the explosion in her presence, or anybody's, except somebody's who I had confidence in—Barrett said that it was he who lit the barrel, and he took his whiskers off as he should be identified if he kept them on—he said that about 7 o'clock—I was paying my wages, and met Mrs. Koeppl, who asked me for some money, part of her wages—I asked her in with me, and gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I do not know which—there was a change in Barrett's dress, he used to dress in a blue coat and an ordinary hat, but he was then wearing the jacket that he has on now—I never saw him after that night; and never saw Fallon or Murphy afterwards—I saw Ryan during the week after the explosion; I heard since that he was in France—I do not know whether the other men are in England, they may be.</p>

STRAIGHT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What were you before you became a Fenian? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A tailor—I was in the Army at one time—I refuse to say whether I deserted—am I bound, my Lord, to criminate myself?—I ceased to be in the Army in 1859, or 1860—in fact, I answered the question before at the police-court—I am married, and live with my wife—I have a step<lb/>daughter—I cannot say whether this was nearer two than half-past—I was very busy, it was my pay day, and I was at work on the board—I do not know the size of the board, perhaps you had better get a carpenter—it is perhaps eighteen feet long—I did not say I had a shop, it is a room—I cannot always afford to keep a shop to work in—I cannot say whether my step-daughter was there—my wife wag there on the other end of the board—I am positive Timothy Desmond had been drinking when he said <hi rend="italic">"Ahoy"</hi>—he said he had sent his son Danny to sea—I have never been mad—I cannot say that I have ever been under restraint—I used to drink—I can<lb/>not say whether I ever drunk myself into <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—I know Dr. French, he told me I was not to drink, but Dr. Dickinson told me I was to drink—I cannot say whether I have had <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>, or whether I have been under restraint—I was in St. James's workhouse twice—I am a very hard working man—it was after I had commenced being a tailor that I went into St. James's workhouse; in fact, I have been several times in the workhouse, not inside, but applying for relief—I have been in twice as a lodger—I am positive I was not put into the mad part—I do not wish to swear at all—Timothy Desmond might have been a yard and a half from my wife when he whispered to me—he put his mouth right up to my ear—until then he had been talking in the ordinary way to me—he had spoken previously to my wife—he rubbed his side against me, but did not <hi rend="italic">lurch</hi> against me—it was after he asked my wife about his wife that he said he was going to take a jump; it was when he kissed her—the impression on my mind was not that he was going to commit suicide, certainly not; because he winked at me when he said it.</p>

GREENE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are a member of the Fenian Brotherhood you say, have you ever sworn in any members? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I was sworn in—only two persons are present when a man is sworn in—that is the invariable rule—it is not done in the presence of a number of mem<lb/>bers—I did not know the House of Detention was going to be blown up—I knew so much as Timothy Desmond told me—I thought it was only the wall, I said so in my evidence—no mention was made of Barrett in the conversation—I made no allusion to him at my first examination, but sub<lb/>sequently I was informed that a man named Barrett had been arrested and brought up from Scotland, and I was taken to Millbank Prison to identify him—I was asked, did I know any prisoner there? I was to look for the right one—I saw Timothy Desmond, and Anne Justice, and all of them,</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you shown Barrett? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was taken to the cell, and he was called out, but I did not know his name; and another party was called out, I think it was O'Neill, and another man named Clancey—those were the persons who had been arrested—I recognized Barrett—I knew him before; I had seen him twice—I said that the first occasion was in the early part of December; it might have been the 6th—it was about the 6th that I saw him at Cavanagh's; and I saw him about four days afterwards in Regent Street—there was nothing to fix it on my memory more than seeing him with English at Cavanagh's, talking privately—I did not know him con<lb/>nected with the Fenian Brotherhood; there are plenty of us who do not know each other in the Fenian society, it is so large—I did not see him—he is quite a stranger to me—no mention was made of him in the conversa<lb/>tion I had with the Desmonds—when I saw him in December his whiskers were very large, a kind of Dundreary whiskers, coming down in a bunch, and a slight moustache, but no beard; his chin was clean shaved—when I saw him in prison, his whiskers had been shaved off, and had three or four weeks' growth; but, notwithstanding that, I recognized him immediately he came out of the cell.</p>

You say you were in the Army; were you ever tried by court martial? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was once, and was reduced to the ranks—I had been a corporal—that is the only time that I was tried—I refuse to answer how I have been living since I gave information to the police—I have been receiving payment from the police; I cannot say through whom, but through a certain constable, and through different parties at times—that has been my only means of subsistence ever since I gave information—I saw a placard offering a reward before I gave informa<lb/>tion; I did not read it at all—I gave information to Sergeant Cole, I dare say three hours afterwards—I have known him thirteen years, or more—I never drank with him in my life, nor have I been in the habit of going about with him—I expect to get a portion of the reward, if these men are convicted—the conversation which began with <hi rend="italic">"Ahoy"</hi> was not earlier than 1.30, or later than 2.30—it was a few paces off, near Carnaby Street, Golden Square—it could npt have been later than 2.30—I swear that I heard that conversation outside Bow Street police-court, with O'Keefe and two other men, that it was a cruel thing, and there was a great sacrifice of life—that conversation was in the street; I am sure of that, and likewise in the public-house as well—I did not say, "Have you seen English?" when O'Keefe ran over to me I said, "Have you seen <hi rend="italic">Nick</hi>?"—we talked about the explosion previous to going to the public-house—O'Keefe and the two strange men talked about the explosion at the corner of Russell Street, and Bow Street, and likewise at the public-house—I said, at Bow Street, that they talked about the explosion, both in the street and the public-house—I said that it took place in the public-house, and also O'Keefe's answer, "A thing like that cannot be done without a great sacrifice"—that was also said in the public-house—I have not said that the same conversation took place in the street; I said that the first thing that you asked me took place in the street and the public-house, but not the last—O'Keefe said, at the corner of Bow Street, "These things cannot be done without a sacrifice," and he said it in the public-house as well—there were more than five or six people in the public-house, but I never counted them—what was said was not</p>

               <p>said aloud, it was a kind of whisper among the lot of us—I was not drinking that day—it was not said loud enough for the other people in the bar to hear, but loud enough not only for me to hear, but the other parties who were with me—there were five of us in the public-house, O'Keefe, William Desmond, English, and one or two others—they were not strangers; I knew them well, and also the men at the corner of the street, but I do not know their names, only their features—I have known Mullany eighteen months or two years—I have met him on several occasions, and have spoken to him; I have said "Good evening"—I suppose he knew I was a member of the Brotherhood—I did not know that he was, but I was told he was a centre—I have only said "Good day," or "Good evening, "to him; I never had conversations with him—I have been at meetings where he was—I knew his name—he has not addressed me as Vaughan—that is the name I have always gone by up to the present time—I did not change my name when I left the Army—my wife is living with me, and I have been living on the money supplied by the police.</p>

How many years is it since you deserted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was between 1859 and 1861—I was reduced to the ranks for absence without leave—that was before I deserted—I was never tried for anything disgraceful before I went into the Army—I was learning the tailoring trade with, my father, it may be two, three, or four years ago, that I was an indoor dweller in the workhouse, I cannot say—it was then that was I warned by Dr. French about the habit of drinking—my step-daughter is about nine years old—when men are sworn into the Fenian Brotherhood only two persons are present, but there are always others in the room when they are sworn in as centres—I was never present, but I have heard so—I was sworn in in Duck Lane, Soho—I have seen Mullany at different times at Cavanagh's, and at the meeting for Father O'Connor—plenty of people were present when I saw him.</p>

On the day of the explosion I was on duty in plain clothes at the House of Detention—I saw Anne Justice leave the prison, and saw Timothy Desmond about 3.0 in the afternoon—I did not speak to him—he was at the corner of St. James's Walk—he joined Anne Justice, and afterwards left her, and came down Short's Buildings towards me—he went up Bridewell Walk, and turned down Corporation Lane—I followed him, but lost sight of him for two or three minutes at the corner of Corporation Lane—I came up on the opposite side to see whether he was gone by Bowling Green Lane, and looked round the corner of Corporation Lane—I saw him coming back, and saw a truck and a barrel about four or five yards behind him, in Corporation Lane—the barrel was about half on and half off the pavement, and the handle stood up, not quite half a yard from the prison wall—he came towards me and turned down Bridewell Walk—the</p>

               <p>explosion took place about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after that—I did not go into Corporation Lane; I was standing at the corner of Bowling Green Lane, near the public-house—I followed Desmond into Short's Buildings—I lost sight of him there, looking to see if Anne Justice was at the corner of St. James's Walk—I turned to the right, to see where he was gone to, but I did not see him—at the time of the explosion I had gone back towards Corporation Lane to look for him—I was fifteen yards from the corner of Corporation Lane, and I was thrown down—I got up and ran to Short's Buildings, and as I got to the corner of, St. James's Walk I saw Ranger—Anne Justice was then running away, and she and Allen were taken into custody—as we were returning to the prison I saw Timothy Desmond running round the corner of Short's Buildings, from St. James's Walk, towards Clerkenwell Green, away from the prison—I stopped him, catching hold of him with my left hand—a person assisted me, and he was taken, with the other prisoners—I had been on duty in plain clothes the best part of the day, and to the best of my belief I had seen O'Keefe come from St. James's Walk, from Short's Buildings, down Bridewell Walk, towards Corporation Lane, between 3 and 4 that afternoon; he was alone.</p>

               <p>Detention House, on my way to Blackfriars Bridge—I was in Corporation Lane, and saw a man coming up with a truck, and a barrel in it, towards me—I was going towards Farringdon Street—the man turned the truck to the left, and shot it back against the prison wall—another man then came across the street, and assisted him to take the barrel—he threw a cloth over it, and the truck went on in front of me, down Corporation Lane, whecled by the man who brought it—the barrel was then against the wall—the man who threw the cloth over the barrel crossed the street, and stood at the comer of a court on the opposite side of the road—I passed him as I went on my way, and saw him looking after the truck as it went away—two other men were standing in the court or passage; that I saw as I went by—Barrett was the man who was looking after the truck, and who assisted with the truck, and threw the cloth over the barrel—William Desmond is like one of the men standing in the passage, but I cannot say positively—I was twice before the Magistrate, and on the second occasion I saw Barrett, and identified him—his appearance was then different—when I saw him by the barrel his beard was cut off away from his chin; he had long red whiskers, and a very slight moustache, if any—before the Magistrate, he appeared as if all his face had been shaved about a month previously, and his beard and whiskers were a month old since growing—about two minutes after passing the men, I heard the explosion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dairyman, of Turnmill Street, Clerkenwell—on 13th December, I was serving milk in Corporation Lane, at Mrs. Parr's, No. 6, and at other houses—it was about 3.45 when I was at Mrs. Parr's—I then saw a truck coming along with three men with it—it was brought about oppo<lb/>site No. 3<hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi>, then it was turned round, and backed into the gutter—it came from Bowling Green Lane; but it was in Corporation Lane I first saw it—two men were drawing it, and one walking by the side—the two men turned it half round opposite No. 3<hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi>., just past the entrance of St. James's Passage—it was run back into the gutter, and the barrel fell out of itself towards the prison wall—one man spoke with a rough Irish voice to the one with the truck; I thought it was a signal to go on; it was not in English, or I should have understood it, and the truck was taken away by one of the men, back the way it came—one man twisted the barrel round, flung a mackintosh or tarpaulin over it, and walked away—the barrel was then on the pavement, near the wall, but at the edge of the kerb—two men wore there when the tarpaulin was thrown over the barrel; both then crossed the road, and went up St. James's Passage, and I saw no more of them—I was then, I think, at No. 5, Corporation Lane—I saw next a gentleman, in appearance, standing on the pavement by the prison wall—after the man had left the barrel this gentleman walked along by the prison wall till he had passed me, and then he crossed the road—he was not one of the three men—I saw him at the time the others were putting down the barrel at the Woodbridge Street end of Corporation Lane, the opposite end from which the men came—he</p>

               <p>was standing still, with both hands in his pockets—after the two men went into St. James's Passage he walked towards the barrel, passed me, and crossed the road, so that I only saw his side face—I never saw his full face—he then re-crossed the road directly, and went to the barrel—he looked at the head of the barrel, as if he were looking for a name or a num<lb/>ber—the tarpaulin was across the belly of the barrel, and he could see the head without meddling with the tarpaulin—I saw him then take a fusee or match from his pocket, strike a light, and apply it to the head of the barrel—I saw it light something, and then he pulled the tarpaulin over the light, and walked into the passage opposite—I lost sight of him—I went into Japanner's Yard then, and-served two customers—that yard is at the Wood<lb/>bridge Street end of Corporation Lane—I think Mr. Crump lives there—I then came out into Corporation Lane again—I had a horse and cart with me; it was standing in the wide part, where three or four turnings meet, at the end of Corporation Lane—I there met the constable Moriarty, and spoke to him—I then went to the cart, and led the horse into Coburg Street—Moriarty walked towards the barrel after I spoke to him, and very shortly, perhaps not more than a minute, the explosion took place—I recognize Barrett as the man that put the light to the barrel—I cannot make any mistake—he was then dressed differently to what he is now—he had a long brown coat down to the calves of his legs, and a high hat—I saw him next at Millbank, when he was differently dressed, and his whiskers were off—he then had a different coat and a grey felt hat with a big brim—on 13th December, he wore long whiskers, which came down here, and had a flush colour on the side of his face, his whiskers were a kind of sand colour, rather fair and long—at Millbank I saw nine or ten men, and I thought at first that O'Neil was the man who fired the barrel—afterwards, when I turned Barrett round, I knew him directly—I saw his side face—I never saw him full face on the 13th December, and I did not recognize him, full face with short whiskers, at Millbank—I recognised him by his side face, and said I was very sorry I had made the mistake, for Barrett was the man and no other—I am now sure Barrott is the man—I have not the slightest doubt whatever—I believe that Timothy Desmond was one of the three men with the truck—I am not positive whether he was wheeling it or alongside it, but he is one of the three who were with it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did it affect your memory? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it would not prevent me from identifying—I felt very nervous, and very much frightened—when I saw Timothy Desmond on the Saturday it was in the cell, by gaslight—I was examined before two different Coroners—I was five or six times before one—the prisoners were not present—when I saw the man in Corporation Lane I only saw his half face—he had his hat over his eyes, and his hands in his pockets—when I said Desmond was like the man, I said he was a little stouter—I had not then seen Barrett—at Millbank none of the men were pointed out to me—nine or ten stood round the cell, and I looked at them—I believe O'Neil was the first I picked out—I did not think William Desmond was the man: when I said he resembled him, I wished the Magis<lb/>trate to understand that he resembled him, though I was not confident he was the man—I might have said I did not believe he was the man—I did not mean him to understand that he was the man—he resembles him in features; I don't think he does resemble him, because one's whiskers were more carroty than the other's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Koeppl, a tailor, and "worked for Mulltany some time, before the, explosion, in his shop, the front room first floor—I knew English from his coming to Mullany`s several times—I saw William Desmond there once—I knew Barrett there under the name of Jackson—I first saw him, I think, about a month or five weeks before the explosion—he used to be there three or four times a week—I have talked to him at times—I knew a man called Hastings at Mullany's—he often took his meals there—I dined at the same table with him, in the back room—I last saw Hastings, I think on the Monday before the explosion—but I saw Jackson once after that, I don't know the day—I saw Mrs. Berry or Berry there several times—she used to come to see Hastings, she had never been to my knowledge before Hastings came—I did not see any of them after the explosion took place—I remember a person called Brown or Winslow coming to Mullany's—I first knew him as Winslow, and then I was told he was Brown—he first came in the early part of the summer, and he was intro<lb/>duced to me as winslow by Mullany—afterwards I heard Brown spoken of and I asked who Brown was, and then I was told by Mullany that Winslow was Brown—I heard of his beeing arrested, and I saw him yesterday in Newgate—he was not at Mullany's after I heard of his arrest—I remember hearing of the explosion—on the afternoon of that day. I was at work at Mullany's—young Morris was there—a man named patten came in from the back room—I had seen him several times before, both in the street and at Mullany's—his ear was bleeding when he came in—he asked me for a needle and thread to sew on a button—I gave them to him, and he went into the back room—young Morris then went into the back room, either to put an iron on or take one off—that was about 5 or 5.30 in the after<lb/>noon—we had not had a tea—I am not sure whether the gas was alight or not—I have not seen Patten since that afternoon—on the same evening, as coming from a public-house at the corner—Mullany came across the road and spoke to me—I asked him for some money—he said he must get some change, and asked me to go into a public-house with him—I went in and Barrett came in with us to the Welsh Stores at the corner of Warwick Street, Mullany got some change, and gave me some money, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I think, and some bandy, and water, and Barrett had a glass of his own—we remained about five minutes—till that time his whiskers came down his chin; but then his face was clean-shaved and he was dressed differently—he used to wear a long blue Chesterfield outside coat with side pockets; but that night he had on a short jacket—I did not known him till he spoke—I remarked the change in his appearance to myself, but I did not say any<lb/>thing to him about it—I left Barrett and Mullany together at the corner of Warwick Street—I saw him next morning, about 9 o'clock, passing through Sherwood Street, and then I did not see him again till I saw him in custody at Bow Street—his beard was then growing again—I am certain Barrett is the man I knew as Jackson—I knew a man called Lynch at Mullany's also Felix Fallon and Quin; but I have not seen any of them since the ex<lb/>plosion—I knew Ryan; I saw him there three or four times a week and the last time I saw him was the night Mullany was taken into custody.</p>

P.S.—Will you please send me the red Urimean shirt that you will find in my lodging, and drawers are what I need most; you will also find some collars, of which I would like you to send me a few. You may rest assured we are in a miserable enough condition, being without friends or acquaintances to do anything for as. Now please not to neglect what I have told you to do; write at once. Of course all letters are read by the governor. I would also wish you to send me a pair of stockings. See Mr. Lewis at once. Mr.Mullen will bring you to him; he will also bring you to my old lodging.

I am an inspector of the detective police—on the night of 27th December last I went to Clarendon Street, St. Pancras—John Devany was with me—we saw Burke and Casey, and followed, them—Devany made a communication to me—I then got the assistance of a constable in uniform (<hi rend="italic">E</hi> 33)—Devany then left me—I and the stopped Burke and Casey in Woburn Square—I tapped Burke on the shoulder, and said, "I am Inspector Thompson, of the detective police, and hold a warrant for the apprehension of Rickard Burke for a serious offence; I have reason to believe you are the person, and you must therefore consider your<lb/>self a prisoner, and accompany me to the nearest police-station"—he said, "I am not the man at all. I don't know what you mean"—I said, "Then tell me who and what you are"—he said, "I am George Bowrie, a medical student, just arrived from Hamburg"—I said, "Well, whether Burke or Bowrie you must come with me to the station"—he demanded to see my warrant—I said he would see it at the, proper time and place, and he refused to go with me—the constable took hold on one side and I on the other—I told him I should compel him to go with me, and we commenced to pull and drag him—he resisted and struggled—Casey interfered, and struck me several blows—after that Burke became quiet, and we walked on to the end of Russell Square—there he suddenly stopped, and said, "I demand to see your warrant"—I said, "I will show it by-and-bye"—on that he said, "Come, let me go"—I answered, "No"—the then made a sudden effort and wrenched himself out of my grasp, threw the constable off on the other side, and made off—I started in pursuit, when Casey came up and struck me several blows, and tried to prevent me going after him—I pushed him on one side and went after Burke, who had only gone a short distance—I pulled out my revolver, and said, "By God, Burke, if you don't stop I will fire on you"—he said, "Don't do anything desperate"—we then took hold of him again—I called on the bystanders to assist me, but they did not seem disposed to assist me or the prisoners—I got Burke into a cab—Casey wanted to get in—we prevented him, and got away—we went to Bow Street polioe-Station—Casey followed in another cab—I placed Burke in the inspector's room, and charged him with treason-felony—I sent for Deniay—he came into the room, and I asked him if he knew anyone in the room—he pointed to the prisoner, and said, "That is Rickard Burke"—I then proceeded to search Burke—he said, "You may rest assured you will find no treasonable docu<lb/>ments on me"—I searched him, and found various little things on him, and some money—I asked him what name I was to put on the list—he said George Berry—I told him he gave the name Bowrie at first—he said, "That must be a mistake"—and he spelled Berry—he said he was a medical student and had recently come from Hamburg—I asked him for his address—he said he could not tell me where it was, but if I would go out with him he would show me; that it was at an hotel somewhere in the, neighbourhood of Regent Street—Casey had come to the station with Burke, and I directed that he should not be allowed to leave—he said his name was Joseph Theobald Casey, he had been assistant station-master at Gleethorpe, Lin<lb/>colnshire, in the employment of the Great Northern Railway Company, and</p>

                  </hi>. I am twenty-six years of age—I was formerly in the Federal army of the United States, first as a private, and afterwards as a lieutenant—I was in the Federal army in 1862, and knew the prisoner Burke at that time—he was a sergeant in the Federal army, and then became lieutenant and captain in the 15th New York Engineers—I became a Fenian in 1862—I took an oath; it was to overthrow the British Govern<lb/>ment in Ireland, and to establish a republic in its stead—I remained a Fenian until 1866, and attended several Fenian meetings—I saw Burke at a meeting at the head-quarters of the leaders of the Fenian organization—that meeting was held in Douane Street, New York—John O'Mahony, Colonel Roberts, the vice-president, and several of the leading members of the Fenian organisation were there—O'Mahony was at the head of the Fenian organiza<lb/>tion in America—there were none but leaders there—I left for Ireland after the meeting in 1865—military men were sent to Ireland to command the Irish people in the event of a rising—Burke took part in that conversa<lb/>tion, and agreed to that—I landed in Ireland in August, 1865—I saw, in Ireland, Colonel Thomas Kelly—I knew him Intimately—he was a leading man next to Stephens, in Ireland—I saw Stephens in South Ann Street, Dublin—I brought him some despatches from O'Mahony—Stephens was at the head of the Fenian organization in Ireland—he was in prison for a time while I was in Ireland—after he was in prison, I was sent from Ireland to America with despatches from Colonel Kelly to O'Mahohy—Colonel Kelly was in command of the organization in Ireland after Stephens was in prison—I took the despatches to America, and delivered them to O'Mahony—I did not see Burke in America at that time—I passed on two occasions between America and Ireland; once was after the convesation I have spoken of—I was in Ireland in February, 1866—the Habeas Corpus was then suspended there—I was there when it was suspended; it was after<lb/>coming from America the last time—on its being suspended; it Captain Beecher, whose proper name is O'Rourke, ordered me to leave Ireland and go to Liverpool as paymaster of the organization, and I went to Liverpool in Company with other American officers—when I was in Liverpool, Fenian meetings of those officers were held in several places—I saw Burke in Liverpool from April or May, 1866, down to October or November for weeks at a time, but sometimes not for four, five, or six weeks—I did not go to America during 1866—Burke attended Fenian meetings at Liverpool, at which plans were discussed and circles formed for the benefit of the organization—it was part of the organization that circles should be formed, the different members of the Fenian Brother<lb/>hood heading the different circles—circles were formed in America and Liverpool—I belonged to the military circle from America—Burke did not belong to a circle in Liverpool; he was an American officer like myself, just a I was—circle were formed in Liverpool,—with the exception of those for American officers—I belonged to the military circle formed in liverpool—the centre of a circle who has men enough to form a regiment can do so; if it is not large enough for that, he is caption of the company; and if it is not large enough for that, he becomes captain of that circle—no other—arrangements were made or discussed in Liverpool during 1866; we</p>

               <p>paid money, and that was about all, with the exception of receiving money from the organization sometimes—Burke was present at those discussions, but he was told off for the buying of arms, he and Shaw, or Mullidy—I saw them in Liverpool during 1866—I knew him as Harry Mullidy, he was very often at the Fenian meetings, he is the same person as Mullidy—I heard from Mullidy that he was with Burke, buying arms, but no directions were given to him in my presence—I saw both Burke and Mullidy in Liverpool—after coming from America Burke was sent home from James Stephens to see the American officers in Liverpool—Stephens was then in Paris; he and the American officer often came from America—Mullidy told me that Burke came from America in company with nine others—Fenian meetings were held in Liverpool in the early part of January and February, 1867, at which Burke and Mullidy were both present—the first time I saw Burke in 1867 was this meeting I was telling you of, when he came from Stephens to the Directory which was formed in London—all the American officers were present—Beecher, Captain Dohany, Major Penn, two Captain O'Brien's, Lieutenant Joyce, and about twenty in all—Burke represented himself as sent by Stephens to know whether the American officers in Liverpool were satisfied with the steps taken by the Directory in London to take the power out of his hands; whether they would be satisfied in throwing him over<lb/>board for this Directory, as it was a self-constituted affair—something was said about planning the attack on Chester Castle—it was talked of at this meeting, but not finally settled—I attended another meeting, at which it was finally settled—Captain McCafferty, John Flood, the head organizer for England after Stephens left, Major Quin, Mullidy, two centres from Liverpool, and all the American officer of the American Army then in Liverpool, as nearly as I can tell, were present—Burke and Mullidy had been present at the previous meetings, but only Mullidy was present when it was finally decided—it was arranged that men should go from Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, and other large towns to Chester, and obey the orders of their centres—in all there were to be 2, 500 men—Chester Castle was to be attacked, the arms were to be taken out, the mail train was to be seized, and the wires and rails to be torn—this train was to proceed to Holyhead with the arms, and the mail boat at Holyhead was to be seized and the arms put in it, and they were to make the captain of that ship land them where they liked in Ireland—Captain McCafferty was sent by the Directory to command—they were going to have arising or a fight in Ireland and Liverpool, and all the other large towns, as soon as the rising took place in Ireland, were to be burnt by Greek fire—the night of 11th February was fixed for the attack on Chester Castle—the last meeting was about three nights before 11th February—I was at Birkenhead and Liverpool on 11th Feb<lb/>ruary—I saw a lot of the men whom I knew to be Fenians go and take the train at Birkenhead for Chester—I had given information to the Government in September, 1866—I went to Birkenhead on 11th Feb<lb/>ruary, but did not go to Chester—I knew a man named Lawrence at Liverpool, from April to the summer of 1866; he is since dead—he was a Fenian, and I saw him at Fenian meetings—I have seen him in com<lb/>pany with Burke and Mullidy at Liverpool—I had tea with Mullidy sometimes in Salisbury Street, where he lodged with a Mrs. Blackmore—he lodged there with four or five others, all Fenians—Thomas Farrell, who was at one time head centre at Liverpool, Harry Burn, John Lennon, and William Pentony—Farrell went to America, and so did Mullidy after</p>

               <p>the seizure of some Greek fire—Farrell went first—I saw McCafferty, who was to command at Chester, convicted in Dublin—I did not see him on 11th February—I received orders about six days after 11th Feb<lb/>ruary, to go to the Zoological Gardens at Liverpool, and was there told to go to Ireland, and remain there until we received farther orders as to the rising that was to take place—I saw Mullidy get 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the same as I re<lb/>ceived; he was to go to Drogheda—all the Americans who were there got orders, and were sent to different districts in the country, to wait till they got final instructions—I went by myself.</p>

C. Winslow in the districts about Birmingham, where he had been to purchase fire arms for the Brotherhood—he said that he had sent them to Ireland, and that one or two cases had been seized at Queenstown by the police—he said that he had received credit for a short time for several hundred poundt—I think it was about 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I am not sure—I returned to London twice from Ireland, and on my second visit, about the 24th or 25th February, for instructions—I expected that the Chester affair would fail, I am not sure whether I knew that it had failed—I said only a part of a day in London—I learned that the rising was to be the 5th of March, at midnight—General Halpin com<lb/>manded the Dublin district—I was all over the country pretty much, I went to all the principal cities, to have a look at the disposition of the Queen's troops and see what resources the organization had in the way f arms and ammunition—on the night of the 4th of March I left Cork, and was arrested at Limerick Junction two hours after—I remained in custody for some months, and then I turned informr—I was present at General Halpin's trial in Ireland, and also at Colonel Burke's trial, where I was principal witness—Colonel Halpin went by the name of fletcher in London.</p>

They and the needle gun are all the rage now; so much for the bitter experience of a seven days' war. Wait till they keep it up for four long blessed years; won't there be a fine field in Germany then for the sale of crape? I think so. Don't you? I have met with some slight losses since, but that is of little import now. I hope to be able to take a good stock off your hands, just if only to keep my promise, and not necessitate another of thy pet manufactures—apologies—you know.
