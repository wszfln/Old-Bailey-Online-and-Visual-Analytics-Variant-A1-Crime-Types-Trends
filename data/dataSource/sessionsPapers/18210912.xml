When I came to town four or five months ago he got into my wife's room to steal something, and I ordered him off the premises. I had no other quarrel with him. On the 9th of August, about two o'clock in the morning, I heard a great noise in my house - it was quite dark; I got up, came down stairs, and saw the prisoner in the parlour, with a candle, breaking open the door - the pannel of the first door was broken all to pieces; the parlour door was also broken. I saw nothing in his hand. He said,</p>
               <p>"I am the man that is come to murder you." I knocked him down, called for assistance, and some of my lodgers and neighbours came, and helped to secure him. I found nothing on him, no weapon of any kind. A spade was found in the house. The noise he made in breaking the door open alarmed my neighbours as well as me. I believe he was mad drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. You have known him a long time, had he his right senses - A. Yes, my Lord. He is a single man. I found nothing removed in the house, for I came down stairs immediately as he got in.</p>

            . I keep the toll-gate at South Mimms. About two o'clock on this morning I was awoke by a very great noise - I was at the toll-house, alone; the day had not begun to break. I opened the door, went to the corner, and the prisoner came towards the toll-house - I knew him before; I went in again, and bolted both bolts. He came, took hold of the fastening of the door, and ordered me, twice, to open it, which I did, and he came in, paced across the toll-house to where we keep the coals, seized the shovel produced, and then went out with it. I was going to follow him, but he ordered me to stand back. I heard the breaking of Wessen's door, which was about twenty or thirty yards off; I went in, and left my money and watch - he returned to the toll-house, and took a lighted candle - he appeared to me to be as perfectly in his senses as I am; he carried the candle away alight. I afterwards saw him in the prosecutor's house - he had broken open the door, and was trying to escape out; I seized him by the collar, pushed him in again, and saw him secured. The spade produced is mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came home drunk one night, and went into his room by mistake, I laid my hand on his wife, she called out murder! I then went to my own room, and she said she would have her vengeance if it was five years after. Next morning (I owed her 12 s.) she took my waistcoat, breeches, stockings, and hat, and turned me out. About nine o'clock one night I went to his yard for my working tools, he said if I did not leave the premises directly he would put me in the cage. I went to the Justice, who was not at home. I got fuddled, came to this man's house, called to him for a quarter of an hour for my tools, he would not open the door; I was in a passion, got a shovel, and broke it open.</p>
               <p>JURY to WESSEN. Q. Were any of his tools in your house - A. There were two gravel sieves in the yard, worth about 2 d. He knew they were in the yard, and not in the house.</p>

A person asked me what o'clock it was, I said I could not say, for I had no watch, which was false, for I had one; he passed me, and in about two minutes he returned, stood before me, and demanded my money. I undid my coat, put my hand in my pocket, and gave him 4 s.; he then demanded my watch; I pulled it out, and gave it him. I had a bundle in my hand, containing bread. He then said "Give me that ring," which was on my finger. I said No, I would lose my life first. He then walked on, and I saw no more of him till he was at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he armed - A. Yes he had a horse pistol, which he presented to my breast, within three inches of it. I went to Bow-street a few days after, and saw him in custody. This lasted about ten minutes, I should think. I cannot swear to the prisoner, my sight is very bad. He was not dressed the same at Bow-street. I saw nobody else near. I have since seen my watch, and a pistol.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Hawkins, a pawnbroker, of Drury-lane. The prisoner came to the shop on the 10th of August, between three and four o'clock, with a watch, to pawn for 25 s. I asked his name, he said it was Collins. I did not like his appearance, and asked if it was his? He said Yes, and what he gave for it? He said he gave four guineas for it, he could not tell the maker's name; I asked how he wound it up or opened it. He said "What is that to you?" I said "If you cannot tell how to wind it up, how can it be yours." He said "What is it to you if a person sent me with it." I said fetch the person. He said "Give me the watch"? I kept it, and told him to send the owner; he left. I saw no more of him. On Monday. I told the officer that I had the watch, and found the prisoner, was taken. I am quite sure he is the man. He was four or five minutes, with me. I took particular notice of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I ask 25 s. for it - A. As near as I can recollect; he did not say it belonged to Collins, he said his name was Collins, and that he bought it new for four guineas.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 10th of August, about four o'clock in the afternoon, Peters came to the office, and said he had been robbed. I heard his description of the man, and after that saw the prisoner at the corner of the street, as I stood at the office door, and from the description. I was sure he was the man. I called Read. I saw him go up the street, he passed a Jew, and went up to another Jew. I followed him into Long-acre, he walked fast. He turned round looked about him, then stopped to buy some currants. I stopped him, and asked what he was, and where he worked. He said</p>
               <p>"What is that to you?" I said I was an officer, and should take him. I took him to the office, and while I was speaking to the Magistrate he whipped round and was going out, but Blaksley stopped him. He told the Magistrate he lodged at No. 2, Rose-street, Long-acre. I went to the house, and saw the landlady, she shewed me a bed-room, and in a box there, I found this pistol. He told the Magistrate he lodged at the top of the house, but I do not know whether he said the back or front room. I found the pistol, in the back room. I do not think there was above one room at the top. I produced it at the examination; he at first said he did know it, but then said he did not. It was not loaded, nor had it any flint in it. I found no powder or ball in the room. The prosecutor saw it that evening.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not say, I had seen it - A. No, he said he knew it, and then he denied it.</p>

            . I assisted in taking him in Long-acre. He said he lived at No. 2, Rose-street. I did not hear him say what part of the house. We went there and found the pistol, in a box, in the top room. I think there is only one room on a floor. It was produced to the prisoner, and asked if it was his, he said "I might have seen it in my box, up stairs." I believe Lack had told him, where it was found. He afterwards denied knowing any think of it.</p>
               <p>MR. PETERS. I know the watch to be mine, I had had it two years and a half. I believe the pistol, to be the one that was presented to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was looking for work, and met a man, who took me to a public house, called for a pot of beer, and gave me the watch to pawn; I asked what name I was to pawn it in, he said Collins. I said, they would not take it in, if it was not my own; he said then bring it back. The gentleman asked if it was mine, I said "Yes, and I paid four guineas for it," I returned to the house, the man came out, I never saw him again. I went up Bow-street, and asked a Jew if he met a man in a white apron, going down Long-acre.</p>

I followed the prisoner, and kept him in sight all the way, they both ran as fast as they could. The prisoner had the green bag on his shoulder, in Woburn-place. I followed him down to the New-road, he was then walking, I got within fifty yards of him, I ran, and he then dropped the bag; I ran as far as the bag, and then was obliged to give up the pursuit - he escaped. His back was towards me. He turned round several times while I followed him, I saw his face. He was not taken till last Sunday; I am positive he is the man. I brought the bundle to Francis's. Read took it to the office. It then contained part of the articles stated in the indictment. I know the prisoner to be the man, he lodged next door.</p>

I went into the hall, and found the prisoner doing something up in a basket. I asked what he did there; he appeared confused, and on my repeating the question, he asked if I wanted any lemons; I told him to go about his business, he took up his basket, and went. I followed him, and before he got out of the garden, I insisted on looking in his basket, and found, two of my great coats. He was not willing for me to examine it. I could not see what was in it, without opening it. I took him out into the road, and sent for the constable who took him. One of them, was a box coat nearly new, and cost me four guineas and a half. I saw both in the hall the night before. He had two lemons in his hand. There was another man outside who ran away.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Oxford-street. Leary, who lives next door to me, and is a tenant of mine, brought me a quantity of plate, to ascertain its value. I said I should be glad to know whom it belonged to, as it was very good - I insisted on knowing it - he went away. I went to the watch-house, and took the constable to Leary; he took him into custody, and took him to the watch-house (he mentioned Bunbury's name to me when he brought it); he said if we would let him go he would fetch the man whom it belonged to, and he went with the constable, and fetched the prisoner from Mr. Thompson's, and in the evening they were both taken to the office. The prisoner told me he bought the plate at the sales of different silversmiths' property in Ireland, six or seven years back. I asked him how he would look if I proved some of the spoons were made only a year or two back? He said he was positive I could not do that, as he bought them six or seven years ago, at different sales. The plate consisted of spoons and forks - I delivered it to Mr. Sellers. There are letters which silversmiths put on the back, by which we can tell how long they have been made.</p>

            . I live at No. 1, Gee's-court, Oxford-street, next door to Mr. Poyle's. I served my time to a tailor, but keep an old iron shop. I received the plate from the prisoner, and afterwards took it to Poyle. I had known the prisoner about four months - I am an Irishman, and so is he. He told me he was a clerk in Dublin, and was in very good circumstances; that he had a furnished house, had parted with all his plate, and that he wished to know the value of this; I took the plate open through the court, to Poyle, and said,</p>
               <p>"Here is some plate, a friend of mine wishes to know the value of it." He detained me. I took him to the prisoner, who gave it to me. I was taken up myself. I mentioned Bunbury's name immediately Poyle questioned me.</p>

The next thing I missed was twelve desert spoons and two table spoons, and the last was thirteen table forks. The prisoner had access to the plate.

I had a draft for 33 l. 15 s. there. She turned the corner, and ran off; I followed, got hold of her hand, and she called murder; I kept her hand clenched till the watchman came, he opened her hand, and took 9 s. out.

The chain broke. There were three gold seals attached to it. He got them before I could attempt to save them, and ran down Lamb-alley. The second man crossed me to prevent my pursuing him, but as soon as I could recover myself, I followed. The prisoner kept following me, and tapping me on the shoulder, and asking what was the matter. I am certain he was one of the three. When I found the two were too strong for me to take them; I turned round and seized him by the collar, and he instantly began to strike me, as hard as he could. I told him to strike on, as he could not be in better hands then - there were three thieves, and I seized him as one of them. He was close to me when the man took them, and did not attempt to hinder the man. He struck me four or five times. I kept hold, and dragged him out of the alley, into the Ship, public-house. The constable came in, and took him; we were obliged to handcuff him. I should know the other men again if I saw them. I never lost sight of the prisoner, nobody was near, but those three. There was a good light in the alley.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was it moonlight or dark - A. It was lightish, there was a strong gas light, I do not know whether it was moon-light; the men came up in a line, or half-circle - the prisoner was the outside one, next the kennel - the one who took the seals was outside, next the passage, it was done suddenly; I did not see them half a minute before.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not charged a man as one of the other two, who turned out not so - A. No; I fixed on a man, supposed to be in their company, but not as one of the three. I saw him in a public-house, and thought he might be the means of leading me to find the others, as I understood had been with them, at the Three Tuns. I believe his name was Higginbotham; the watch-house keeper said he was a housekeeper, and discharged him.</p>

            . I am beadle of Bishopsgate. I was in Catherine-wheel-alley, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I placed myself across the passage, which is narrow, and the prisoner ran violently up the alley; I stopped him, the prosecutor came up instantly, and charged him with stealing his watch. I did not see the transaction, I only heard the scuffle. The prisoner said three others thrust him into the alley, and he was not the thief. I asked him why he ran away - he made no answer. I found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going by, three men laid hold of me, and shoved me up the alley - two ran down the alley, I ran after them to know why they did it, and the gentleman took hold of me.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Paley, at No. 76, Holborn-bridge. On Friday, the 11th of August, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I was going from my master's house down Newgate-street, and saw the prisoner, in company with another person; they followed me at some distance, then went before me, and crossed the way - I suspected, and watched them; they followed a gentleman, who was going towards Cheapside; they looked about them, and then left him. Another gentleman came down the street, going towards Skinner-street - they turned, and followed him; he went down Butcherhall-lane, they left him, went towards Cheapside, and followed another gentleman, and as I crossed into <placeName id="t18210912-17-crimeloc95">Cheapside</placeName>

I seized him, and took him into Crawford's shop, undid his breeches, and took it out. I ran, but could not find the gentleman. I do not know who he was.

Between three and four o'clock on Saturday afternoon, the 4th of August, the prisoner came to the shop and asked for 1/4 lb. of 8 s. tea, 1 lb. of 1 s. lump sugar, and 1/4 lb. 4 s. coffee; she produced a 1 l. Bank note. I took it in my hand, rather suspected it while I was looking at it; another customer came in, I laid the note down on the counter, and put a brass weight on it, and after waiting on the customer, I took it up again and inspected it - I did not like it, but gave her the change, 16 s., and sent her out of the shop. Before I gave the change, I asked her what address I should put on it, she said, "Roberts, Hart-street, Covent-garden," but if you do not like to put that, you can put "Mr. Norton, No. 16, Cross-street," that is where I am, and she recommended me here for tea and sugar. I put down "Mr. Roberts, Hart-street," in full, and underneath, "No. 16, Cross-street," with the date. I generally put Mr. on the note, she did not say either Mr. or Mrs. I wrote this before I gave her the change. I told my boy to follow her to Cross-street, and if she did not go there, to follow and see where she went - he followed her. I watched, and saw her go into the church-yard, which was the way to Cross-street - the boy is not here; in about ten minutes he returned - I have the note here. I carried it to the Bank on the Tuesday following, the 7th of August, and left it there with Mr. Fish. I saw her again the Monday following, the 6th of August. Between three and four o'clock,

I said, "I can't give change, my good woman, but will you allow me to look at the note;" she gave the note into my hand. I suspected it, and could almost take my oath that it came off the same plate as that I took on Saturday. I asked who the grocery was for, she said, she did not know the person, but it was a person who came to Cross-street, where she lived, and asked her to go and get the grocery, and change for a note. I asked her if she should know the dress of the person who sent her; she said, Yes. I described the dress, and it answered my description. I said, "I am doubtful of the note being good, I will get an officer and take this woman on suspicion of uttering forged notes." I told her to wait till I returned; I went to Mr. Post, a neighbour, and asked his opinion, and then went and got the officer and returned, found Leach still there. We all three went into Cross-street - the prisoner was gone from there. I left word with the woman of the house, if she came back, to detain her. I was standing in my shop about two hours after, and saw the prisoner go by on the other side of the way, and directly I went up to her I knew her, got an officer and gave her in charge. I put the note that Leach presented to me in my pocket, and kept it in my possession till I went to the Bank next day. I then gave it to Mr. Fish, and marked it in his presence - it was never out of my possession till I marked it. I enquired at Hart-street, Covent-garden, but could find no such person as Roberts, neither Mr. nor Mrs. - I enquired at every house.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were consulting your neighbour, was the note out of your possession then, or at any other time - A. Only two minutes, while Mr. Post's young man took it into his counting-house, but I know he returned the same note, by the signature of Lambert, and by its being cut about so.</p>

            . I live at Cross-street, Islington; my husband is a labourer. On Monday, the 6th of August, I saw the prisoner down stairs in the parlour, talking to Mrs. Norton, the landlady. I had seen her there on the Saturday, sitting there, talking - she did not lodge there. On Monday, I heard her talking to Mrs. Norton, asking her to get change for a note - she said she would not.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120012"/>I was up stairs, I went down and said, if it was a good one, I would go; she said I might depend on it, it was a good one, and gave it me; she told me to get two ounces of tea and 2 lbs. of sugar, and she would give me some of it for going. I went to Newman's, and asked Bloomfield for it, and told him a person was waiting for it, he asked how she was dressed - I told him, and gave him the note, and waited till he came back from enquiring. We then went with the constable to Cross-street, the prisoner was gone - I had been gone about half an hour; I saw her again in about an hour and a half; a little girl came from her with a message to me, saying that she was coming again next day. I went with the girl to the bottom of Cross-street, and found her in the street, talking to a boy, about 100 yards from the house. I went up to her and said, "You are the person I want, you must go with me to the grocer's to clear me, that you gave me the note;" she said, "Dont hurt me." I said, "I don't want to hurt you;" she went with me and the boy; I met Bloomfield by the church-yard, and he took her - she was no acquaintance of Norton's that I know of.</p>

            . I live at Stanwell. I have a dwelling-house there. On the 13th of August, about eight o'clock in the morning, I left the house. I was sent for out of the fields, after the robbery, and went through Colebrook. I got Lee, the horse patrol, and overtook the prisoner near the Swan Inn, at Salt-hill; he had my coat and shirt on his back, and my shoes on, and two bundles, which Lee took from him.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. I left the house about ten o'clock in the morning, the doors and windows were fast. I hid the key of my door in a place where we always put it. I left nobody in the house; every thing was then quite safe. I returned about one o'clock, and found the window broken open; a pane of glass was broken in the front window by the asp, it was then opened by putting in the hand. I missed the articles stared in the indictment, which are worth above 40 s. I saw every thing safe before I went out - my husband came home soon after; there was a table against the window, and the poker laid on it.</p>

On the evening of the 10th of September, I had gone out about six o'clock, and returned about half-past twelve. I saw the servant fasten the street door after letting me in. I went immediately to bed, and heard her go to bed, and shut the door; there are two bolts, a chain, and catch-latch to the door - I cannot say whether it was locked. I had been in bed a very short time, when I heard a noise resembling the shutting of my street door; I sat up, listened, and not hearing any more, took no further notice, and went to sleep. About seven o'clock in the morning, the servant awoke me - in consequence of what she said, I went down stairs and found the street door on the latch, without any other fastening, and the kitchen window wide open; there is a small area in front of each window, and one of the gratings had been worn away, and broke off the end, for about a month, but I did not conceive the opening large enough to admit a man through. I missed three copper kettles, a coal skuttle, and a plated gravy spoon. About ten o'clock the officer called on me, and I accompanied him to Bow-street, and found my property, and the prisoner in custody; there was no violence done to the door, it must have been opened inside. I had not noticed the kitchen window on the night before - the opening between the bars and the wall, is ten or twelve inche wide one way, and about two feet the other.</p>

I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120013"/>the last who went to bed. I heard a noise about ten minutes after I got to bed, but thought it was something in the street. I got up first, about seven o'clock in the morning; I found the drawers open, and missed a plated spoon, the window sash was thrown up, and the curtain drawn aside, part of the brick-work by the railing was broken down - it was not so the night before, it appeared to be done by the man's foot - there was brick dust about. I missed the scuttle and tea-kettles, which were in the house the night before. I went to the watch-house the next morning and found them.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I was returning from St. Giles's a little past one o'clock last Tuesday morning, the 10th of September, and met the prisoner within a door or two of the Blue Boar Inn, Holborn, nearly opposite Red Lion-street, with three copper tea-kettles in one hand, and a coal scuttle in the other. I asked what he had there; he said, his own property. I said I was an officer, and must know where he brought it from; he said, from his own place, Fox-court, Gray's Inn-lane, and was going to take it to his brother, as he expected to be seized on in the morning. I said it was an unseasonable hour, and he must go to the watch-house to satisfy me. In going along, he begged me to let him go, I refused, and took him to the watch-house in Eagle-street, and found the gravy-spoon in his left breast pocket. I asked his name and residence; he said he lived where he could. In the morning I told him I had found the owner out; he said, he might as well tell the truth, and that he got them from a house in Brownlow-street, that he got through the broken railing, and came out at the street door.</p>

They hustled me into a house there, there was nobody in the house. There were about four women together. One took me by the collar, struck me in the eye, and scratched my face, and the other two laid hold of my lame side - the prisoner took me by the shoulder with one hand, and with the other laid hold of my breeches, and said "Let us serve him out," using a very bad expression. They then all set on me, and in a few minutes got my money - some of it dropped on the floor; they began to scramble and pick it up - my pocket was torn in the scuffle. The prisoner was the last that I saw snatch at my pocket. I saw one of my crown-pieces, and some shillings and sixpences, on the floor. I had about 3 l., in my pocket consisting of one sovereign, two crowns, and the rest half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences. As soon as they got the money, they all ran out of doors immediately. In about ten minutes the prisoner returned to the house, and seeing me there began to pity me; she wanted to wipe my face, with her apron, but I refused to let her, and said she had done too much already; she then went away, smiling, and I saw her no more, till she was taken, the same night. I stated the case to my brother-in-law, we got an officer at Worship-street, and took him to the house, we found nobody there then; while he was making enquiry, two or three women came in and the prisoner with them, and I gave her in charge. I will swear she is the woman. I had only drank a pint of beer and a glass of peppermint. I received the money at the Dock-yard, that morning.</p>

On the 28th of July he came to me, and shewed me the house - in a few minutes the prisoner and another came in - he said "That is the one who seized me by the side." She denied having been there that day, and said she had been out at work, for fourpence, to get her shift out of pawn. Gregory, an officer, asked her where she had been to work. She said next door, just round the corner. He said he would go and see, he returned and took her. She said she only came in after the robbery to wipe his face.</p>

I kept him employed till the constable came. The constable searched, and found the money - one sovereign, a half sovereign, and a 5 s. piece, in his pocket - there was a mark on the half sovereign, by which I knew it; nobody but him could take it. The servant went into the parlour to fetch the tea up, I stood at the parlour door at the time - she could not have taken it.</p>

            . I live at No. 46, Dean-street, East Smithfield. On the 18th of August, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I went to the Golden Anchor, public-house, Lower East Smithfield, for the newspaper, for my father to read; the prisoner came in, and offered the scarf for sale for 2 l. to the landlady. I gave him 29 s. for it. I am sure he is the man - he said he brought it from abroad, and I thought he was steward of a ship. On Wednesday, the 22d, the landlady sent for me, and told me it was stolen. I produced it at the Mansion-house.</p>

I left Mrs. Courtenay to take some of them; I ran a few yards, and secured the prisoner - the other man ran off; the prisoner said "What is the matter?" I charged him with robbing me of my watch, which he denied, but said he knew the person who did it - I gave him in charge to the watchman. I missed my watch instantly as I was jostled against; it was safe shortly before. I am positive he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You told the Magistrate you was sure I did not take it - A. I said I could not say he took the watch, but he was one of the party. He said he knew who took it.</p>

I was coming down Holborn, two young men jostled against me, and ran down Field-lane, I turned round to see what was the matter, heard no cry, and was going on, when the prosecutor came and laid hold of me. It is not likely I should have let him take me without resisting, if I had been one of the party.</p>

A few days before the Coronation I counted my stock of lamps, and had between eight and nine thousand; after the Coronation I had them counted, and found 891 deficient. I gave information at Bow-street. Davey said, that my man took the lamps out of my warehouse, and gave them to him, and he sold them to Anderson, who keeps a tin-shop. I brought Davey to the shop, and took Blowes down at his own house, at Westminster, he said, he hoped I would not hurt him, but he did take a quantity of lamps, two or three times, and gave them to Davey. I got a search-warrant, and found them at Anderson's.</p>

Tipper (I did not know him), to send a double-barrelled gun and a single one. I was then in London, and went to No. 1, Marlborough-street, to enquire for Mr. Tipper; I saw a woman in the house; I could get no information from her. I went in the afternoon; saw her again, and left my card for Mr. Tipper to call on me. I had not got far from the house before the two prisoners came to me, and asked if my name was Howell - I said it was. Pott asked me if I understood the order he sent, and said his name was Tipper. He fixed Friday, the 20th, to come and look at the patterns of some guns - this was Wednesday, the 18th - they both came on Friday, the 20th, and approved of the guns and pistols I shewed them, and wished to have them; I said they were sold. They desired me to send a single and a double barrelled gun according to their order, as soon as I could, and they promised to pay me a banker's bill. I agreed to allow them five per cent. I went home to Birmingham, and sent up a double and a single barrelled gun to Mr. Sherington, with an order to receive a banker's bill on the delivery of them - they came to 17 l. 2 s. 6 d. Mr. Sherington sent me this bill in a letter, dated the 27th of July; he sent me another letter on the 11th of August, with a bill for 26 l. 17 s.</p>
               <p>(Read. - See indictment.)</p>
               <p>Q. You received that as a valid bill - A. Yes; I paid the bill of 17 l. 2 s. 6 d. into my banker's. I sent the one for 26 l. 17 s. to Mr. Jenns, in London, to see if it was Messrs. Williams' acceptance - it was afterwards returned.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you mark the letter in which you suppose the bill came to you from Sherington - A. Mr. Jenns returned the bill to me; I know the letter, but did not mark it. Both the prisoners were present when the guns were inspected. I am positive that Pott called himself Tipper.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not notice that at Marlborough-street - A. Until they came to Bow-street I did not know their names were false.

               <p>"Have you got some guns from Mr. Howell for me?" I said I had. We went together up into my club-room where the guns were - he said he had a letter from Mr. Howell, saying that he was to give me a banker's bill for these guns, he gave me the bill for 17 l. 2 s. 6 d. - I let him have the guns - I asked his name; he said it was Tipper.</p>
               <p>Q. Well; he came again on the 11th of August - A. Yes; I had received a box from Mr. Howell, with orders to deliver it for such a bill as the last. Pott said he came for the guns - I said, then I must have the bill. He presented another bill instantly. (Looks at one.) This is it. I gave him the box. I had no conversation with him about it. I saw it was accepted the same as the other, and took it. I called him Mr. Tipper - he answered to that name. I remitted the bill to Mr.

             the same day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had another bill for the first guns - A. Yes; my orders were to get another bill just like the last. I made no enquiries about the bills, as I knew the house was respectable. Pott was the only person present when the bill was delivered. After he was in custody, he told me his name was Pott. I am not confounding one with the other. I did not see the other prisoner till he was in custody. I did not go to Birchin-lane. When I delivered the box, only Pott was present - somebody, who he called his man, was in the parlour. That man took the guns on his shoulder by his desire - it was not Tipper.</p>

            . I am a friend of Mr. Howell's. On the 15th of August he sent me a bill for 26 l. 17 s. I should know it again. (Looks at it.) This is it - it is accepted "Williams and Co." I was desired to present it, to see if it was a correct acceptance. I went first to No. 3, Birchin-lane, according to the direction, and saw a gentleman in a lower room, making up newspapers. I thought it a strange place, and asked if it was Williams', the bankers. I was answered it was Williams', but not Williams' the banker's.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a house was it - A. I went into a narrow passage, and on the entrance-door of the passage was "Williams and Co." on a large brass plate also on the glass of the door, at the foot of the stairs - I passed up a narrow flight of stairs, turned to my right, and saw a lady in a small room, folding linen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing like a house of business - A. Not at all. I rapped at a door up stairs, on the same landing where I saw the lady, and on the door were the words "Attendance from Ten till Four," and I think there was Williams and Co. on it. I then went to Williams and Co.'s banking-house, No. 20, presented the bill, shewed them the acceptance, and went away. I went to a house in Newgate-street and wrote a letter to Mr. Howell. I received one from him; and in consequence of that, and one written to the the prisoners, they called on me on Friday the 17th of August, at the Red Lion and Still, public-house, Drury-lane - they left a strip of paper, to say they would call again on the Saturday morning, as I was not at home, which they did, at twelve o'clock, and Pott introduced himself to me as Mr. Tipper - he introduced the other as his friend. He said he called at the request of Mr. Howell, to do business with me. I told him I was not prepared to transact business in the way Mr. Howell desired, and asked him to call on Monday. I wrote to Mr. Howell to come up himself, which he did; and when they called, we took them into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Pott represented himself as Tipper - A. Yes; I did not put down the words. After Pott was in custody he wished to send a friend to his uncle. I said, "Mr. Tipper, I will send for you" - he then said "My name is not Tipper, this is Mr. Tipper," pointing to the other prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Pott say, "I am Mr. Tipper's agent, and this is Mr. Tipper" - A. No; the word "agent" never passed. I asked his name in the first conversation on Saturday morning, and he said it was Tipper. I said, Is your name Mr. Tipper? Pott said, "I am Mr. Tipper" - he did not point to Tipper. I went to Birchin-lane about half-past three o'clock - I went through a door into a passage. "Williams and Co. No. 3," was on the door, on a brass plate, in letters three inches long - the figures were distinct enough. I entered from Cornhill, and came to No. 3, before I came to No. 20. On the first floor I found the lady in one room, and one room was shut.</p>

            . I live at No. 3, Birchin-lane. I know the prisoner Tipper; he had a counting house at our house, in the firm of Williams and Co. - it had been a counting house before; he took a counting house, a dining room, and a bed-room; on the 1st of November last. A man, who said his name was Williams, took it in the name of Williams and Co. - a ship insurance broker had it before him.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of its being taken, did any one reside there - A. Some time after it was taken, Mr. Williams sent for me, and said, he did not wish to occupy it till the 1st of February, and asked leave for a Mr. Jerman and his wife to occupy them for two months, they came, and when the two months was expired, I went into the office, and told Mr. Jerman, it was time for him to go, he refused - they did not go.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any person being in the counting house when Jenns called - A. Yes, I do not know his name, he would never give it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Williams constantly reside there - A. He was never in the house - I never saw him in the house. Tipper was there constantly - I do not recollect whether I ever saw Pott there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was ever any banking business carried on there by Williams and Co. - A. There was at first, some exchanging of notes going forward; this went on till Tipper was taken into custody - Jerman assisted as clerk, Tipper was one of the firm; they were to pay me 80 l. per annum, they paid me a quarter in advance. I applied for the second quarter, they said they would not pay me. Jerman paid me the quarter in advance - I have received no more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Birchin-lane is much used as a place of business, for merchants who do not reside there - A. It is, it was taken as a place of residence for Williams. I objected to his name being put up, but it was done. I saw notes presented there two or three times,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120019"/>and paid. Tipper used to attend from ten o'clock till four. I never saw large notes presented.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Jerman was the only man who acted as clerk - A. No, there were several others after him, there was a man named Green, who appeared to be a clerk, and several other men at different times, they were frequently all together in the counting-house - there were books there; when they first came, they went on very regular.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any persons come to receive cash from them - A. A great number.</p>

            , ESQ. I am in partnership with Williams and Co. bankers, No. 20, Birchin-lane, (looks at the bill) The acceptance is not the hand-writing of any body belonging to our house. We sometimes accept in red ink, and write across as this is - nobody accepts bills for us but the partners - the clerks never accept; this is not the hand-writing of any of my partners. I know of no other Williams and Co. bankers, besides ourselves, neither in Birchin-lane or elsewhere - we accept as Williams and Co. across as this is.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It is very common to write across bills - A. Yes, and common to accept in red ink. It is not the slightest resemblance to any hand-writing of our firm - it is Williams and Co., our house is No. 20. I know No. 3, and have seen the name written on the door. I never knew of letters directed to No. 3, coming to our house by mistake. I have frequently known bills directed to No. 3, come to our house, and have sent them to No. 3. If this bill had been brought to me, I should have said it was not our acceptance, and we had nothing to do with it.</p>

I left six 1 l. notes, with three sovereigns wrapped in them, and 7 l. or 8 l. in silver, in a bottle-stand, in the drawer of the back room - the room door was shut, but not locked, the front door is always open. I returned in about a minute, and saw Mrs. Fryer, in consequence of what she said, I found the drawer open, and the money gone. I had seen it safe a few minutes before, when I went to put some money there - nobody had been in the room before I went out. The prisoner had once been employed to carry out coals for me, and had been in the room several times - I have found none of the money.</p>

            . I live in Brittannia-street. I was in a shop near Hutt's, and saw the prisoner laying down in an empty cart. I saw Mrs. Hutt come out, and go into the milk-shop, two doors off; the moment she went into the milk-shop, the prisoner got out of the cart, and went into her house. I saw him go into the back parlour, and saw him come out in about a minute, with something under his arm, under his jacket; I thought it was his cap, as he had one on, and when he came out, it was off, it looked like leather; he ran up the street. I ran over and told Hutt, she searched her drawers, and missed her money. I am sure he is the boy, I have known him for years.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, I was desired to look after the prisoner. On the Saturday after the robbery, I saw him on a lamp-post by Westminster-hall, looking at the people going to view the hall - he knew me. I asked him to come down, he said he would not until he chose, and directly the hall door was open, and there was a rush, he got down and ran off. I followed and caught hold of him he clung to a coach wheel, gathered a mob round me; the people asked what I was pulling him for? I said, he had robbed a neighbour of mine of 20 l.; he used a very bad expression, and said it was not 20 l., and he could bring twenty people to prove it; the people then made way for me to go, and when he got to Charing-cross he clung to a door-post, and would not go on, the street-keeper came and secured him - nothing was found on him; he had a new pair of shoes on, new trowsers, and a new hat, with the maker's name and lining torn out.</p>

I am constable of St. Pancras, and was returning with my wife from the Lyceum Theatre, and saw the prisoner try the prosecutor's pocket, feeling it with his hand; he then stept aside, and I saw the corner of the prosecutor's handkerchief hanging out of his pocket.

I turned round and perceived the hand of some person taking my watch. I saw the watch come over my left shoulder, and at the same time, saw the prisoner with both his hands up - there was nobody near me but him; when he ran away, the case of my watch dropped, I picked it up with one hand, and laid hold of him with the other - I am sure he is the man who pushed me. I said, "Where is my watch?" he said "I know nothing of it, I am only just walking up." I gave him in charge.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was about thirty yards off, when Mr. Woolf laid hold of the prisoner. I saw a man rush through Three King-court. I found the prisoner in Mr. Woolf's custody - he was taken to the watch-house. I fetched Bedford from the oyster-shop, she said she should know the party; she saw the prisoner among several others, and pointed him out.</p>

I entered it to Mr. Barrett - I never gave him any to sell on his own account; about the 25th of July I discovered they were never delivered - it was worth 2 l. 2 s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The first you sent was in January - A. Yes. I always expected him to give me the order before he took the wine.

Nobody being in the shop, I said I would take him in half an hour; he went away, and Mr. Marriott's foreman came, and claimed them.</p>

I held the prisoner fast till two watchmen came up. My gold seals, and part of my chain were gone, they broke by the violence of the pull - he had got from my hold before the watchmen came up - they secured him; they were worth about three guineas.

I jumped over Phillips, and pursued the prisoner - I saw another man near Phillips; the prisoner left him first, and was about a yard from him when I first caught sight of him, the second person was then between me and Phillips, we could not pass him to follow the prisoner till we got to where the court widened (he ran down the court); the second man squatted down to hinder me.

I understood from him that he had paid the duties; in two or three days I found they were not paid.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. He was not entrusted to receive money - A. He was employed to receive money for checks frequently; he was to take the check to Mr. Watson. He bore a good character - we intended to advance his salary.</p>

            . I am in partnership with the last witness. In consequence of what Bailey, our carman, told me, I asked the prisoner if these duties had been paid, he said they had been paid; I said it was very strange, for Bailey could not get the goods. Next day I told him I would go down to the Custom House, and investigate it myself - he said he would accompany me, and did so; on our arrival there Watson came from his seat, and beckoned to me - I turned round, and found the prisoner had slipped off - he never returned, but was brought back about ten days after by the officer, and said he had been lead by his distresses to make use of the money, to pay some bills; he mentioned some other sums, and wished me to interfere. He said we might receive the money we had been defrauded of from his relations.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you recollect his father's death - A. Yes; I have heard that he supported his father till his death. We gave him 15 s. a week - he did not board with us. He expressed great contrition.</p>

On Friday, the 3d of August, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came - I was alone in the shop; he asked me what I would allow him for a seal he had, in exchange for another; he produced a seal on his watch chain. I told him it would not suit us to change, as it was unsaleable; he then went to the shop door, apparently going out, but returned and asked to look at a smaller seal - at that time some ladies were looking at seals; he sat down by my desire, until I could get the seals. I shewed them to him; he selected one for which he was to pay 32 s.; he threw down a card of address, (looks at one) this is it, (read) "

I put it, together with the card into the till, and gave him three sovereigns and 8 s. - he then left the shop, the ladies had left before him. As soon as he left, I took the notes out of the till (not more than two minutes after), there were other notes in a box in the till; that I received from him was separate from any others. I had received no other Bank note before I took it out. I shewed it to a young man named Purdie, our shopman, who was then in the shop. In consequence of what passed between us, I went to the shop door, and saw the prisoner thirty or forty yards off, going towards the City; I overtook him, begged he would excuse me, but he must come back and change the note he had given me; he hesitated, and said he had no more money about him, and that he must go home to his dinner, as it was waiting for him; after a little persuasion, he returned with me. I found Mr. Austin alone in the shop, with the note in his hand - I had left it in the hands of Purdie, I marked it a few minutes after; (looks at one) this is it - it has my initials on the right hand corner - he delivered me the change and the seal.</p>

I attended to them, they did not purchase any thing - the prisoner went out after buying a seal. I heard him ask the price of a seal, the ladies went out before him. On the prisoner going out, Clark shewed me a 5 l. note - I thought it a bad one; he went out after the man, I was out when he returned. I gave the same note to Mr. Austin, about a minute after I had it from Clark. It was not out of my possession till I gave it to Mr. Austin.</p>

I asked who it was for; he said Mr. Newman. I told him I thought he must be mistaken. He said, No, he made no mistake. I said, Mr. Newman, where? He said, "Mr. Newman, Air-street." I said, "Air-street, Piccadilly?" - he said, "Yes." I told him we had no account with any such person; he replied, "I am going to pay for it." I shewed him the kerseymere; he asked the price; I said 12 s. a yard; he said he was to have one about 10 s., I said we had none at that price, but shewed him one at 11 s.; he said, I will take two yards of each. I then asked if he was correct, as the length of two yards was fit for nothing - he then said, "Cut me four of that at 12 s." I said, "Am I to cut off four yards?" he said, Yes, cut it off; he tendered a 5 l. note, which I suspected to be bad. - I asked if he would like to have a bill; he said "Yes." I went to the desk to make the bill, and looked at the note, but did not endorse it. I called

While he was gone, I asked the prisoner in what part of Air-street Mr. Newman lived; he said, a little up on the left hand side. He said Mr. Newman was a tailor.

               <p>Q. How did he hesitate - A. When I asked him if I should send for Mr. Newman, and said what number, where does he live - the prisoner gave no answer. I asked him why he should hesitate, as he said he came from Mr. Newman; he then said Newman was waiting for him at the corner of the street.

On Saturday the 23d of June, the prisoner came to my shop, and wished to look at some lumps of sugar, for compounds; stating that his mother had driven it off late, and wished particularly to know if I could send a person with him with the goods; I said, Yes. I shewed him three sorts of lumps; he fixed on one sort, and gave me the price I asked, which was 106 s. per cwt. He ordered 56 lbs. I pressed him to take other goods, and sold him 1 lb. of tea and some pepper - they came together to 3 l. 1 s. 6 d.; he tendered me a 5 l. Bank note - I asked his address; his answer was, "Lord, No. 4, Searle's-place." I asked where Searle's place was? he said, Castle-street. I then gave him the change, and put his name and address on the back of it, in his presence. (Looks at one.) This is it; it has that written on it by me, "23 - 6 21". I ordered my shopman,

In consequence of what he said, I went to No. 4, Searle's-place, Carey-street, Chancery-lane, and found no person answering his name or description. Castle-street is on the opposite side of Chancery-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. This was Saturday night - A, Yes, between eight and nine o'clock; he was alone, and was nearly half an hour with me; I was busy, and could not immediately attend to him; my young man was serving in the shop. I found there was no Searle's-place in Castle-street. I think I took no other 5 l. note that night. I cleared out my till about every two hours, and had cleared it previous to taking this - there was no note in it when I put this in; I put others in after. I am positive he is the man. I marked it in his presence.</p>

I heard him ask for sugar, but did not hear the address he gave; I walked behind him all the way with the goods, he went down Gray's Inn-lane, across Holborn, to Southanpton-buildings, down into Chancery-lane - he was joined by another man in Chancery-lane; they both walked on before me together, to Randall's public-house, the Hole-in-the-Wall, Chancery-lane; the prisoner then jumped on the bar before the window, looked into the tap-room, and said,"My father is at home;" the other man immediately said, "The devil he is?" The prisoner said, what shall we do now. The other said to me, if I whistle, bring them in; the prisoner said, never mind whistling, my father must see them, bring them in, they then both took them out of my basket, and carried them in themselves. I went home, and immediately after, went back to the public-house, to search for them, they were gone.</p>

On Monday, the 30th of July, about the middle of the day, the prisoner came to our shop, and produced the duplicate of a coat and waistcoat, which were pawned for 24 s., in the name of Turvey. I gave him them, and he tendered me a 5 l. note. I took 24 s. 5 d., and said</p>

               <p>"The name on the ticket is Turvey, is that the name I am to put on the note?" he said Yes; I then asked for his direction, he said "No. 7, Shire-lane." I wrote that on the note in his presence; (looks at one) this is the note. I think he came again on the 3d of August, to pawn a telescope. On the 16th of August, Van and Mance brought him to our shop, and asked if I knew him; I said, Yes; that is the man, who paid me the note for the coat and waistcoat, but he was not the man who took the watch out - they took him away.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long was he in the shop when he redeemed the coat and waistcoat - A. Perhaps not five minutes. I have no doubt of his being the person. I had seen him frequently at the shop before, pawning and redeeming things. I knew him perfectly well, before he redeemed these. I knew him by the name of Fidler - it is very common for persons who pledge, to use fictitious names. When I asked him if I was to put Turvey on the note, I thought he was taking it out for another person, I said,</p>
               <p>"What is your address." I cannot tell whether he pawned the coat and waistcoat.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Thursday, the 16th of August, I and Mance apprehended the prisoner at a coffee-shop in Shire-lane, playing at cards. I asked his name, he said Fidler. I told him who we were, and that we took him on suspicion of uttering a 5 l. forged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120027"/>note to Mr. Wassell, of Picket-street. He denied all knowledge of the place, or knowing any thing about it. He said he never had a 5 l. note, good or bad, in his possession in his life; he said, he lived in Tower-street, over the water, that he had lived there nearly a month, and had been in the country, purchasing fancy birds, which was the way he got his living. We took him to Wassell's, and the last witness identified him as the man. In going to the office, he said, I was mistaken in him - he was not the person, but that he knew the person who passed it at Wassell's, his name was Turvey, who was then in custody. I afterwards went to No. 7, Little, and No. 7, Great Shire-lane; I could find only one No. 7, in each. I could learn nothing of him there - the coffee-shop is No. 12.</p>

On the 26th of May she left, early in the morning - she left the room door locked. I examined it, missed this property, and found them in pawn. She was taken on the 31st of August, brought to me, and produced the duplicates of them.</p>

The prisoner is not the man who took my watch, but I am positively certain that he was one of the gang who hustled me - I looked at him particularly, he was at my right hand; it was a very dull evening, but there was sufficient light in the street to distinguish countenances - the lamps and shops were lit up. I was hustled down from the main street into the gateway, and several blows were struck at me - this was after the watch was gone. I had an umbrella, with which I warded off several of the blows, I believe they only used their fists. They drove me up against the left side of the gateway, and there was still three or four about me; they detained me there several seconds, I concieved myself in danger, which prevented my crying out at first. I called out Stop thief! while the person who took my watch was in my sight; he went down Halfmoon-street, the prisoner was one of the three who remained with me while I was being struck - as soon as I could I got from them, and ran after the man, who had got my watch, calling Stop thief! I had not entirely lost sight of him - he got away with it - he was in a light dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, and say conscientiously whether you are positive he is one of the men, who hustled you - A. I have not the least doubt. I ran after the man who stole the watch, as far as the Halfmoon, in Halfmoon-street, and just as I got there several people came out of the public-house, who had heard the alarm - they said there was no chance of taking the man. Harding was one of them. On turning round as soon as I had spoke to them, I said,</p>
               <p>"Here is one of them," seeing the prisoner. Harding immediately took him; he made no resistance; he was taken into the public-house, and cried and said, he was innocent. This was hardly five minutes after the watch was taken</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How do you swear to me - A. I looked particularly at him, and know him from the notice I took.</p>

            , on the debit side of the account - A. I have no such entry.</p>
               <p>Q. Read the entry on the debit side - A. The last entry here is 30th May, 1820; "O. Y. 86, to J. Bunn, No. 5281, 10,000 l." - this is in my writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it all your writing - A. It appears to have been altered since I wrote it - when I wrote it, it was P. Y. to J. Penn, and the number was 1181; the date is affixed to a previous entry, not in my writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Read exactly what was written by you - A.20th March, 1821, P. Y. 86, to J. Penn, 1181, 10,000 l. - this was what was written by me on 20th March, 1821.</p>
               <p>Q. Now read the entry as it now is - A. "O. Y. 86, to J. Bunn, 528l, 10,000 l."; without any date - the date is erased I made the entry from the transfer book - O. Y. is the title of the transfer book - 86 is the folio - J. Bunn, is the credit name, and 5281 the number of the transfer.</p>
               <p>Q. It was P. Y. and is now O. Y. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you produce the transfer book from which you made the entry - A. I have been obliged to answer you from memory, in consequence of the alteration, and have made an error; the original entry should be R. Y. the rest is correct.</p>
               <p>Q. Now turn to R. Y. 86. - A. It it not to be found, this is the book in which it should appear, and in which it did appear to me, and from which I made the entry - it appears two pages (that is one leaf) has been taken out, and there appears an alteration in the folio; the following pages to 84 now stand 85 upon an erasure - and the subsequent folios appear to be altered as far as 93 - there is no alteration before 85 - the leaf 93 would not be the corresponding leaf to 85 and 86.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the date of the transfer now in the book on the leaf preceding that which is taken out which is 84 - A.20th March, the date on page 85 is the 20th and 86 the 21st.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. GURNEY. Q. When you speak of the state the entry was when made by yourself, are you speaking from any recollection of the fact - A. No; I speak from reference to entries in other books - I believe those entries are not made by myself; there are about fifty clerks in the office, all of which have access to the ledger occasionally - an entry of the transfer is made by other clerks into other books - each clerk acts as a cheque to the other - the entries are made the same day and chequed afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet sometimes a mistake occurs - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. How many clerks are there in your division - A. Eleven; the prisoner was one of those eleven, on the 20th March - the account of Sir R. Peel would be in that division and of Penn also.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is there one ledger for each division - A. There are several ledgers to each division.</p>

               <p>Q. Explain what these transfer tickets are - A. It is a printed ticket for the purpose of having the name written on it - that is the name from whom the stock came, and to whom it is to go, and the sum - no transfer is made without having such ticket - it is necessary to have the transfer ticket examined to see if the person selling has such stock - the transfer may be entered in the book by the same clerk or another - the tickets, as soon as they are entered, are put on a file and kept, and in the afternoon put into the strong room - I have searched the strong room, and the bundle of tickets which should contain it, and cannot find it - there is no account in the transfer book of any transfer from Sir

               <p>Q. You made the entry in the duplicate from the original transfer book, was it your duty to compare that entry in the duplicate, at the end of the day, with the entry made by a clerk in the primary - A. I made that comparison.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. This entry is in your writing - A. Yes, the primary is examined at one time, and the duplicate afterwards; we never take the entries from the primary and the duplicate at the same time - it is not our general practice, I have known an instance or two of the kind, I think about two.</p>
               <p>Q. If that occurs, may it not also occur that the writer of the primary recites the entry, and you take it from him - A. Never; we read them in the evening, the duplicate clerk reads, and the primary clerk looks at his book; the primary clerk does not read again, and the duplicate clerk examine - we always read the names and sums.</p>
               <p>Q. Always - A. Previous to the beginning of last February, we had at times omitted it, and only read the figures, but after that, in consequence of a representation from the principal of the office, that was discontinued, and I think never happened again.</p>

               <p>Q. He had not called on you to pay it - A. He lent it me at Christmas, it was to be paid at stated periods; the first was in March, which was paid - he had lent me more.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you were in the office when the prisoner was charged with this - A.

We then turned to the other transfers from Penn, making together 10,000 l., and on the name of

             signed to them, some of the transfers are blotted over by ink, they are all witnessed by the prisoner and Smith; he was asked as to the blots that were on several of the transfers - he said the blots on the signature of Penn were not there when the book went out of his hands; he had no recollection of any such - had they taken place before the transfers were signed he should have required their being made over again. He was asked if there were stock receipts? he said there were stock receipts on each transfer which were written by him. He was then asked as to Penn's residence, and said he had no knowledge of it except by the description in the account and the transfer, but had known him by the name of Penn, and as a man of good property, but never visited him - he considered Penn as a man who had made his fortune, and who was making the most of his property. He was Smith last week, but could not give any traces to find him. The stock had been standing in Penn's name only a short time; that he did not recollect whether he witnessed the transfer into his name or not. He was then further questioned by the Governor and Deputy Governors respecting Smith; he said I have known Smith four or five years or more, but was never in his company in private. I think Price, Campbell, and Salisbury knew Smith. Smith was regularly in the habit of attesting transfers. I have generally seen Smith in the middle of the Rotunda. He was then asked by the Chief Accountant whether Smith had a box in the Rotunda, as some persons who attend the Rotunda have; he said I think he has not a box with his name on it in the Rotunda. It was then observed to him that the name of

             to several of the transfers was signed differently, that they did not all appear one signature - he said he had observed the variation of signatures by Penn when the transfers were made, but knowing him to be the same individual he did not object to it. He was then ordered to withdraw - but recalled in a few minutes, and informed that he could not be permitted to return home, but could send a note to his wife, and must remain under the care of Foy, a police officer, untill next morning; he sent a note to his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see him again - A. This passed on Wednesday, the 9th of May. I saw him again on the Saturday, in St. Bartholemew's Hospital - he sent for me, he was in bed, wounded; I told him I understood he had sent for me, he said, Yes; he had, and that he felt that circumstances, and appearance were very much against him, that he wished to see me, and make some communication to me; I told him, I could not receive any confidential communication from him, and that he knew my situation, and that whatever he stated, I must communicate again to my employers, and also elsewhere if necessary. He then said, that he had been ill-advised, misled, and defraudd, by a set of d - d rascals, by whom he had lost a great deal of money. I said, how can that be Mr. Turner, when it appears you have sold out all this stock, and received the benefit. I am not quite sure whether I mentioned the amount, he referred to Penn's stock; to the transfer. He was anxious he said, to explain the circumstance of the transfer. I said how can that be Mr. Turner, when it appears you sold out all the stock, and received the money for it. He said he did. I then said, what have you done with the money. He said, he paid it to that rascal Penn, I said Mr. Turner you know as well as I do, that there is no such person as

I said Yes, Mr. Turner, it appears by a book found at your house, that you had large time transactions with him, in the funds and that you paid him very large difference; he said, he had; he then urged me to permit him to be removed from the hospital, to his own house. I told him, that could not be; for I was afraid when he was removed, it must be to a place of confinement. I asked what could make him so desperate, as to leap out of a two pair of stairs window, as nothing had been said to him, about being committed to prison, he said if I knew the distress and anguish of mind he was in, I should not be surprised at that.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On the 9th of May, I took the prisoner in charge and took him to the Bank, and from there to the Crown Tavern, Clerkenwell-green, and arrived there about five o'clock in the afternoon; he was to remain there all night, and occupied a room in the upper story of the house, and I had the adjoining room. I was alarmed during the night, and threw up the window and saw Mr. Turner lying on the pavement in the street; I went down and found him much injured. After that I went into the room he was in, and found the bed clothes off the bed, and fixed to the legs of a chest of drawers; the quilt, sheets and blankets were knotted together and thrown into the street.</p>

               <p>Q. Now turn to the two transfers of the 17th of April, of 2,000 l. and of 200 l. - A. I can only speak to the attesting signature being the prisoners; I know nothing of the signature of Penn or Smith; I know no person of the name of Smith; I have searched to ascertain whether any person of that name has identified transfers previous to the 23d March, and found one which has been identified six or seven months since, but the signature bore no sort<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120036"/>of resemblance to this. I do not know how far back I searched; it is the only identification by Smith that I found. I found it three months ago, but do not know when it was made. I have searched for the transfer ticket of the entry of the 21st of March, in the proper place; I do not recollect whether I found it, but all I found I gave Mr. Norris. I searched for all the transfers of this transaction.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. GURNEY. Q. Mr. Turner has been in the Bank eighteen years - A. I have been there seventeen years, he was there before me; other clerks may, or may not, be as well acquainted with his handwriting as me. I have seen him write numbers of times.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not every one of you been asked in the office if you could make out whether the name of J. Penn was in the prisoner's writing - A. I have heard some asked.</p>

I cannot go so far as that, I speak from the similarity it bears; if I had seen it entirely detached from Bank business, I should not.</p>
               <p>Q. If it was shewn to you attached to a Bank receipt without any thing more, should you have said it was his writing - A. Without his name being mentioned to call him to my recollection I should not. If it had been made in the ledger and I had been asked whose writing it was, I should have said Mr. Turner's, from its resemblance to his writing. I have not been blamed about the business.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Having been apprized that to person's standing in my forlorn situation a statement from counsel was not allowed, I have committed to paper such topics of defence as my mind was capable of suggesting, under such an awful visitation.</p>
               <p>The case submitted to the Bank Directors was one undoubtedly of suspicion, and they have considered this investigation to be their duty; but I place unlimited confidence in the impartial wisdom of a British judge, and in an enlightened and considerate jury; therefore with you, Gentlemen, I trust suspicion will not operate, nor prejudice find place; that you will act on nothing but clear and satisfactory proof, before you doom me to a cruel death, and my wretched family to want and degradation. Gentlemen, you must see that to prove my perfect innocence is not possible, because the only witness who could have done so - the man for whose iniquities I am standing here, has fled from scrutiny; but I can prove to you that all the probabilities are at utter variance with the supposition of my guilt, and that though I may have been careless, incautious, and credulous; I was not a criminal, and ought not to be a victim. During eighteen years I have been a faithful servant of the Bank, and in the riots of 1780, my father, Sir

            , was the means of preserving its treasury from plunder, so that my attachment to the Bank might be said to be hereditary; but I ask no indulgence on that account, it entitles me to none, if guilty. I seek acquittal only on the ground of my innocence. Gentlemen of the Jury, the way in which I was entrapped into this melancholy situation is plain and simple. I was applied to by one of those, who under the guise of gentlemen infest society and prey upon the credulous, for the loan of money, which he had no doubt discovered I had at my command. For this he offered me a valuable consideration, and in answer to my demand of security he referred me to a credit which stood in his name to the amount of 10,000 l. upon the Bank books. He said he had family reasons for wishing it to appear there in his name, at least for a little longer; and described himself as a man of substance resident at Highgate. His account was plausible, his terms liberal, his appearance above suspicion, and without the over cantion of an enquiry at Highgate, I waited until an inspection of the books the next day should assure me of my security. If I had any suspicion, which unfortunately I had not, this inspection was sufficient to remove it. I there found in his name, the actual entry and investment to which he had referred me. I had no doubt of its authenticity - as an original account it appeared regular, and as a new account opened in the stock ledger, in consequence of transfer, as turns out to be the case. I could have no suspicion, because I knew that before any new account could be thus opened the transfer must have been inspected by the clerk who opened it, and that such transfer must have been posted, not by me, but by two clerks under pain of suspension There, however, Gentlemen, stood the credit regularly entered by Mr. Prideaux, in the stock ledger, there it stood in black and white, and I had just as much reason<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120037"/>to suppose that the whole book was a forgery, as that this credit so presented to me was fictitions. I advanced the sum required without any further scrutiny. I could not doubt the evidence of my senses, and thus begun those pecuniary transactions which have ended in this miscreant's flight, and in my most calamitous, but guiltless embarrassment. To no purpose should I detail to you the various devices by which an accomplished swindler, such as he appeared to be, led me into the maze of his money transactions. For some pecuniary advantages which he held out, and, to do him justice, uniformly realized, I became his agent in the sale and transfer of the stock. Gentlemen, if it be asked, why I continued his agent in these sales? the answer is most obvious, I occasionally repaid myself out of the proceeds, the particular sums which from time to time I had advanced to him, and thus enabling me to be my own paymaster. I returned to him whatever there was of surplusage, and this fact accounts for many of the Bank notes which were the produce of the stock sold, being traced to my possession only, and not to his. And now, gentlemen, give me leave to ask you by what right could I have suspected Mr. Penn? When I found his account opened by Mr. Prideaux, the stock in his name correct, his transfers regular, his receipts correct, his remuneration to myself, liberal and punctual, and no taint whatever in his pecuniary transactions! By what right or title could I have suspected him? It is suggested against me that the entry in his name is altogether a fictitious one, because the original transfer upon which it is founded, was in itself fictitious, that such original transfer was forged by me, and that the leaf containing that forged transfer from Sir

             to Penn, was torn out by me. Gentlemen, if the account opened to Penn's credit in the stock ledger had been opened by my hands, there might have been some colour for the accusation - but it was not. It was confessedly opened by Mr. Prideaux, and he could not, or should not have so opened it until he saw that the original transfer on which it is founded had been regularly executed, and in raising the credit to Penn, he must, or should have been assisted by another clerk. This is the strict and imperative rule of the establishment. The book out of which a leaf has been torn, is a public book, a book of constant reference - it was subject to the daily reference of nearly fifty clerks, it was accessible to the whole office. Two months had elapsed from the date of the supposed transfer from Sir

             to Penn, to the day of the discovery; during all this time, with the exception of ten days, I was in daily attendance, and during those excepted ten days, I was on leave of absence on the sea-coast, where there was ample opportunity for escape, if I had been guilty. The imputed scheme had been successfully executed, the transfers had been made, the stock sold, the receipts open, the money realized, and a few hours would have put me beyond all fear of danger. But how did I act? I remained publicly at Hastings during my leave of absence, and then deliberately returned to the Bank - the scene of inevitable detection, had I been guilty. Would not any man who had such a consciousness have profited by such an opportunity? vessels in abundance, the French coast in sight, the imputed plunder safe in my possession. Is it credible that any man in his senses, that any man capable of the deep contrivance which this fraud imputes, would have thus surrendered himself and liberty, and rushed into the jaws of inevitable destruction. Will it be said, that I hoped the case might be kept secret? Secret in a public book! Secret, in an establishment where observation never slept! Try it however by the most unerring test, I was actually, I had almost said, providentially present when the discovery was made. I appeal to every one in that crowded office, was there any thing about me of peculiarity or embarrassment, any change in my manners, any variation in my countenance, any of the unequivocal, unavoidable accompaniments of guilt? did I not remain even twenty minutes beyond my time, I, who if I was guilty must have seen, in the event of discovery, a certain death! But conscious of innocence, I felt no fear. I returned, as usual, to my own well known habitation, and there I remained, accessible, as usual to every visitor. Was this the conduct of a guilty man? Examine my conduct still further. It is alledged that I tore away the missing leaf, and that to this, I trusted for security; why then did I not destroy the other leaves, in which the suspicious transfers were inserted? the leaves which contained the only evidence against me, the leaves which once removed place me beyond the reach of accusation. I, who they say forged them, I who had them in my power, I who trusted as they say, to this method of evasion. But gentlemen, it must occur to you to enquire, had I any temptation to this crime? was I in any pecuniary embarresment? far from it - my income from the Bank, was in itself a competence. I succeeded on the death of my mother, two years ago, to 2000 l. I received with my wife, only last year, upwards of 5000 l., and with this increased income, my mode of living was nearly the same, I remained in the same house, I owed no man a shilling, and three clerks in my department had been for months, and were at the time of my alledged criminality, my debtors to the amount of nearly 400 l.; so that, I, with abundance in possession, with unclaimed money due, without a debt on earth, with temperate and domestic habits, must be supposed to be voluntarily, deliberataly, and causelessly rushing upon infamy and death. You are called upon to believe, that of my own freewill, I avoided escape, and almost solicited detection, and preserved, when I might have destroyed the proofs which would lead to my conviction. Gentlemen, this is one of the cases in which, not general character alone, but particular circumstances, (lending to refute by probabilities, a charge resting on appearances and probabilities alone), must be of importance; and I trust effectually to convince you, that in my previous life, there is nothing to countenance a criminal presumption. Is there a man living, can impute to me dishonesty? In any dealing have I ever incurred suspicion? Has any creditor any unsatisfied demand on me? Had any tradesman occasion to call on me twice for the same debt? I never asked my fellow clerks in the Bank for my own, at the time, when I am said to have been the plunderer of others. I can prove that I voluntarily discharged unliquidated debts of my deceased parents, for one shilling of which I I was not legally responsible. The brokers who purchased this very stock from me (an unconscious agent), know that in my own transactions, they never had cause to be dissatisfied.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120038"/>One of them, in particular, Mr. Harman, has confided in me to the amount of nearly 5,000 l. by taking my draft for that sum, and I always repaid him to the utmost farthing; they all know that in our various dealings, I could frequently have enriched myself at their expence, without the peril I this day stand in; and the Directors of the Bank themselves must know that from my command of the dividend warrants, I might, had I been so disposed, have defrauded them to ten times the sum imputed to me. Gentlemen, the only crime which can he justly imputed to me is, I have not been so cautious as I ought - I have been a dupe, but not a criminal. Gentlemen, when I was brought before the Directors, I gave them the account which I have given you to-day; I gave it on the instant, and without premeditation. Gentlemen, I must now advert, and I do it with great pain, to an unhappy occurrence, since I was arrested - when I found that I was imposed upon; when I found that the Directors of the Bank were determined to drag me thus before the public, and doom me to a trial, under which, even acquittal cannot efface all the marks of disgrace, I did seek to avoid such an exposure; when it burst upon me, that Penn was an impostor, and that I, his duped, his credulous, his unsuspecting agent, was to be dragged to this bar, covered with the most colourable suspicions, deprived by his flight of the only witness who could demonstrate my innocence, my mind became distracted, I knew that the very charge would taint me in Society, and that even acquittal would not purify me in the eye of the censorious - I saw in the spotless memory of my parents, in my own career of unimpeachable integrity, and in the character which my life had acquired for me, only so many sacrifices to this horrid accusation, and scarcely knowing what I was about, and now but imperfectly remembering it, I did in my distraction seek either escape, or what I thought more probable and more welcome; certain death. In this rash attempt, four of my bones were fractured; the agony which I have suffered, has almost unfitted me for a defence; but it has, I hope, made my peace with Heaven, for the impiety of the attempt, and under its mercy, to you, I trust, for that which is only less dear to me, the vindication of my innocence. Gentlemen, I know you will not let this circumstance operate to my disadvantage. I felt. when I sent for Mr. Kay, and afterwards for the Governor and him, all the deep concern which an honest man could feel, upon having been the innocent cause of so large a loss to an establishment I had served faithfully for eighteen years; I beg very particularly to remark, I then (from the four fractured bones) considered myself a dying man - I told the Governor and Mr. Kay, both, I considered myself a dying man, and as such, most solemnly denied all guilt, but expressed the greatest concern that from carelessness, I had caused so heavy a loss to the Bank; for I had then found I had been dreadfully imposed on, I declared, (observe Gentlemen, in these dreadful circumstances, expecting firmly, as I told the governor and Mr. Kay, immediate dissolution) that I was innocent of every crime against the establishment, but the careless credence I had given to a designing villain; and Mr. Kay has done me the justice to say, that from the first I declared I had been defrauded by Penn. Gentlemen, this is a case, as you must see, resting on both sides, merely on probabilities, balance those probabilities, and then say whether I am not entitled to even more than the effect of a doubt - to pronounce me innocent, you have only to believe it possible that I may have been imposed on, that I gave credence to an artful man, and not even that, until I saw upon the Bank books the regular documentary evidence in corroboration of his assertion - but to pronounce me guilty, you must believe that I forged the transfer from Sir

             to Penn, that I did it so as to pass the scrutiny of two experienced clerks as the rule of the Bank requires such transfer to be posted by two persons - that I did it so as to impose on another old and experienced clerk, who supervised it the next day - two other experienced clerks who abstracted it, and the superintendant of the division who had to observe if it was correctly posted. All these six clerks, well acquainted with my hand writing for many years; and you must believe that after a new account had been opened in the stock book, to the credit of Mr. Penn, not opened by me, observe, but by another clerk; you must believe I tore away the fraudulent leaf from the original book, that book, a public book, in the hands of the whole office, daily. You must believe that I not only tore away that leaf, but with my eyes open, the corresponding leaf each of these leaves known to contain three separate transfers in other names, to any one of which, reference might have become at any moment necessary. You must believe, that having forged the name of Sir R. Peel, and having forged the name of Penn, in a book in hourly use, I took upon myself, the sale of fictitious transfers in the common market. You must believe, that with this conciousness, amid the needless ostentation of my own forgeries, I attended regularly and punctually at the Bank, where detection was inevitable, and might have been immediate. You must believe, that having been given leave of absence, being on the sea coast, successful in my scheme, and as they say, with the spoils in my pocket, I chose to return to the very spot, where perhaps detection awaited my arrival. You must believe, that when the discovery was made in my immediate presence, I concious of guilt, with death before me, the witnesses around me, and the whole establishment aroused to vigilence - not only remained there tranquil, twenty minutes beyond my time, but being at large, and at leisure to escape, actually repaired to my habitual residence, accessible even to the visits of a stranger. You must believe, that having committed the forgeries, having personally published them, having realized their proceeds, having avoided escape, and solicited detection; I did all this without any earthly motive, with an ample salary, with 7000 l. in my possession, and with 400 l. due from the very clerks around me, not having asked them for repayment. You must believe, that I did this for the sake of money, which I did not want, against all the evidence of my former life - against all the chances of human probability. That I did it, who have ever shewn the very reverse of avarice, who have paid debts which could not be recovered, who have had thousands in my hands, to the last farthing punctually discharged - who have been often trusted without any security, and who might frequently and safely have defrauded to ten times the amount now imputed to me. Weigh well, I implore you, Gentlemen, all these probabilities - remember my existence hangs upon your breath, for to cases<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120039"/>such as this, after conviction, mercy is a stranger. If you should not even feel assured of my innocence - if you should have a doubt of my guilt - the law gives me - your own hearts will give me the benefit of that doubt. Cut me not off I implore it of your justice, of your humanity, in the very summer of my years. I implore it not for myself, but for the memory of those whose name has been unsullied - for the sake of a character, accusation never stained, for the sake of a home - a happy home, my death would render desolate - for the sake of an innocent and helpless wife, who has bound up her wretched destiny in mine. In his name I ask it, who will not forget hereafter, the mercy with which you may have imparted justice here.</p>

            . I am a patrol of St. Giles's. I was at the watch-house door, Miss Stamp came and applied for an officer, saying she had been robbed of her ridicule, crossing Charlotte-street. She described the person. I went into Church-lane, St. Giles's, and saw a dozen boys together, and the prisoner among them, and from the description I took him; he asked me what I wanted with him; I told him for snatching a lady's ridicule; he said he was willing to go, as he was not the person. I took him to Bow-street, and on the way I met Miss Stamp, she said he was the boy; this was about a quarter of an hour after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence, (written.) When this lady's ridicule was taken I was standing at the corner of Charlotte-street, and saw two boys running, and as they turned the corner of Phoenix-street I saw a bricklayer's labourer stop one of them, and saw the ridicule fall from under his frock; and the little boy who was running with him picked it up, and ran off with it. The cry of Stop thief, was rose, but to no purpose. I crossed the road and asked the lady what was the matter? she said she had lost her ridicule, containing two or three shillings, and a long lawn handkerchief, and several papers. She went to Bow-street, and laid information that two boys about fifteen or sixteen robbed her. A patrol came up and said I must go with him; she said she could not swear to the person, but the little boy had a fustian frock on and two pearl buttons in front, just like mine, and that is what she swears to me by, it is hard to have my life sworn away by two buttons, for I am innocent.</p>
               <p>MISS STAMP. I never expressed a doubt of his being the person. I do not know Phoenix-street. I was coming from Museum-street; I had not been near Phoenix-street. It was not a little boy who took it, it was the prisoner, he had a frock with pearl buttons.</p>

I am positive to the prisoner's identity; he came to my shop on Thursday, the 9th of August, between one and three o'clock in the afternoon, and asked for a polishing iron and a beating hammer, for a person resident in Bell-yard, a bookbinder; he mentioned the same, but I do not recollect it. I asked him what weight he wished the hammer to be, as they varied from eight to sixteen pounds - he said he did not know. I told him to return to his master and enquire. In about twenty minutes he returned, and said it might be about ten pounds. I said, the hammer was ready all but facing, and if he would call in half an hour, it should be ready; he said he would take the polishing iron, and call in half an hour for the hammer, he said he would pay for both the articles, and tendered me apparently, a 5 l. Bank note - the things came to 11 s. Not having change, I marked the note with my initials, in his presence, and sent the boy with it to Mr. Barratt, my neighbour - he brought back four sovereigns, and 20 s. in silver. I gave the prisoner the change, 4 l. 9 s., he went away, and never returned for the hammer - nobody ever came for it (looks at a note) this is the note. I put my initials on it immediately - I had no other note in my hand. I saw no more of him till the Saturday following, when he was in custody.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You recollect that it was Thursday - A. Yes; I generally dine about two o'clock. I think he came before two o'clock, but cannot be certain of the time. I am positive he is the boy. I do not remember seeing him before. When I saw him on the Saturday, he was at Guildhall, at the bar, that place distinguished him from other persons. I am almost positive that I did not speak to any body before the Magistrate asked me if he was the person. Close was not examined in my presence, he was a stranger to me. I had not spoken to him about having taken a forged note.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that - A. I cannot say positively; I never told any body that I was uncertain about who gave me the note. I told the Magistrate immediately that he was the person. I invariably put my initials on all my notes, and in the same place. I had no other 5 l. note in the house that day, nor had I passed any between that and Saturday.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. How long was he with you the first time - A. Very few minutes. I had the conversation with him myself; he came twice, and promised to come again for the hammer. On my oath, I have not the slightest doubt of his being the person.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You mark all notes with your initials, how can you distinguish this from any other that passed through your hands - A. I sent it to my neighbour, who returned it, saying, he presumed it to be forged. I kept it in my possession separate from any other, being informed he was in custody. I sent my neighbour no other note that day. I kept it till I delivered it to Mr. Lees.</p>

I put my initials on it, and Timbury's name; I gave change, and put it in my cash-box. I took it out next morning, and knew it to be the same from the marks - I took it back to Timbury next morning.

               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. Did you change any other 5 l. note for Timbury that day - A. No, nor the day before. I think I had no other 5 l. note in the box. I had no other with Timbury's name I am positive. I wrote his name in the boy's presence.</p>

            . I live in Castle-street, Long-acre. I am in the service of Mr. Hough, a gold-beater, in Fetter-lane. On the 9th of August, the prisoner came to the shop for 200 leaves of gold, which came to 12 s. - I tied it up; he produced a 5 l. note. I asked him who it was for, he said, for Mr. Rowley, a book-binder, St. Andrew's-hill, Doctor's Commons. I told him I had no change, and my master was from home, but I would see if I could get it of a neighbour. I called our lad into the shop, to remain with the prisoner while I went to Mr. Stevens's, a cheesemonger, within three doors of my master's, and shewed him the note; he said he was doubtful whether it was not a bad one; he carried it to Mr. Barratt, to look at it - this was between two and three o'clock; he returned in a minute or two and gave me back the note. I returned and told the prisoner, I thought it was not a good note. I gave it to him, and said I would put on my coat and go to his master's with him, to explain it. I went with him to St. Andrew's-hill; he stopped at a door, with the name Wakeling and Penny on it; he then hesitated, and stopped opposite, as if he was going in. I was proceeding to ring the bell, when he said, he was not sent from there, he was to bring it there; that a person met him at the corner, and told him to fetch it and bring it there. I put him against the wall, told him I was convinced he was a bad boy, and I insisted on his stopping with me - I rang the bell, and asked for Mr. Wakeling. Mr. Penny came down stairs; I asked if he knew the prisoner, (I made him go in) he said, No; nor had he sent him. I asked the prisoner for the note, he felt in his pockets, could not find it, and said he had lost it. I related the circumstance to Mr. Penny, and asked if he knew Rowley - he said there was a person of that name who lived in Wardrobe-place, Blackfriars-churchyard. I took the prisoner there - he is a bookbinder; Mr. Rowley said he had no knowledge of the prisoner, and had not sent him for the gold, and that a 5 l. note had been passed in his name at Mr. Warwick's, a gold-beater, in Fetter-lane, who had called on him about it. Rowley accompanied me with the prisoner to Mr. Warwick, they knew nothing of him there. I then gave him in charge to Kinsley, who searched him, and found no note on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. What time was this - A. Nearer three than two o'clock.</p>

I gave him in charge, he was taken to the watch-house; I gave Godfrey the officer the note, I marked it first with my name before it went out of my sight - I got it from the Bank, and now produce it; this is it, it has my name on it - I saw him searched at the watch-house about 1 l. 11 s. 7 1/2 d. was found on him, all in silver and halfpence - I never saw him before.</p>

I heard the cry of Stop thief! and hastened to the spot, and found the prisoner in the custody of Rice, a watchman, who is not here - Pemberton said, he has tendered a forged 1 l. note to me, the prisoner appeared alarmed, and said, what is the matter, I have done nothing; I took him to the watch-house, Pemberton gave me the note, after having marked his name on it; I am sure it is the note he gave me - he said the prisoner gave his address, No. 54, Aldersgate-street, which I wrote on myself - I asked the prisoner his address, he said, No. 1. Wright's-Buildings, West-street, Smithfield, which I also wrote on it. Hare, the officer of the night, also put his name on it - I took it to the inspector of the Bank on Monday morning (Mr. Lees), I gave it to him - I asked how he became possessed of the note; he, at first, said he did not know, but on pressing him, he said he took it in the way of trade, of some person at Highgate, who he did not know, and he was a general hawker - I went to No. 54, Aldersgate-street, but they knew nothing of him; thirty-one shillings and seven pence halfpenny was found on him in silver and copper.</p>

The prisoner has worked on the farm for two or three summers. I was well acquainted with his person. I was at the Green Man, public-house, on the Uxbridge-road, near the seven mile stone, last Sunday week, the 9th of September, the prisoner was there. I came away about ten minutes after nine o'clock, he followed me. A young man came about a quarter of a mile with me, and then he went to the left, and the prisoner hesitated whether he should go with him or me, he said he should go with him. I got about one hundred yards to go to the stile, and before I could get to the stile he overtook me. I said George,</p>
               <p>"What are you going my way?" he said, Yes, I have altered my mind, I shall go to my old lodging. We went over this one field, we had eight to go over, and every field that we came to he asked if that was not the last. I kept telling him no. When we come to the last field but one he asked twice, and when we got near to the gate he asked me again. I said</p>
               <p>"As soon as we got through that field we shall be in the home field, if we brush along we shall get there before it rains again;" he then mended his pace and caught hold of my collar, and said d - n your eyes, old chap, you must heel up to me - I turned and looked in his face, and said</p>
               <p>"George what do you mean by that?" he said,</p>
               <p>"d - n your old eyes I'll let you know presently, I will do for you in a very little time." I said,</p>
               <p>"George, you ought to know better, I have used you like a master. and like a father, and my wife has been like a mother to you?" he said,</p>
               <p>"don't you tell me nothing of that, for I'll do for you in two minutes, in a very short time." I caught hold of his collar thinking that if I could get loose I could run home. I begged of him to loose me, and let me go, he held me so fast by the shirt collar and handkerchief, and stuck his knuckles into my neck, he almost winded me - I got weaker and weaker - I scuffled with him for some time, he got the better of me, and said if I did not deliver up what I had about me he had a pistol in his pocket and would blow my brains out; but before this he had draged me back two or three poles, under an oak tree, under some stubs. I begged of him as we lay in the hedge, not to injure me there; then he pulled me up into the footpath, I told him I only had two shillings and sixpence and an old watch. He kept feeling in his pocket, and said if I did not deliver it up he had a pistol in his pocket and would blow, my b - y brains out in one moment. I delivered it up expecting to lose my life every moment. I gave him the watch and half-crown. He then loosed me and went the same road as he came, and I went home. I am quite sure he is the man, I have seen my watch since.</p>

            , sheweth, that your petitioner was at work for the prosecutor at a farm near Greenford; the cause of my being here arose from a quarrel I had, he agreed with me to cut corn at twelve shillings and sixpence an acre. I finished my work and had three shillings and three halfpence to receive. I fell in with him at the Green Man, and had a few words with him because he had not paid me, and as I returned home with him being intoxicated I did not know what I was about, he was in liquor as well as myself, I laid hold of him, and asked him for the three shillings and three halfpence, he said he would pay me no more than what he had, I laid hold of him again, and he gave me his watch and half-a-crown, saying that was all he had, and we parted; in coming home I was taken; when I came to my senses in the morning, I was quite astonished, as I knew no more of it than a child unborn.</p>

On Saturday, the 28th of July, having missed a variety of articles, I desired my wife to search the house - her box was searched first; a piece of lace, and afterwards four others, were found in it. She took out a bundle herself and endeavoured to secrete it, by putting it behind her, and, on opening it, most of the articles stated in the indictment, were found; they must have been taken at various times; a shift and pair of stockings were found on her person. She begged forgiveness, and we consented to her remaining with us; but about four o'clock in the morning of the 30th, the watchman rang the bell, we found she had escaped out of the kitchen window; he brought her back, with a bundle. Four napkins, a pair of ear-rings and a razor were found in her pocket, and my umbrella in her hand.</p>

I went down stairs to consult my wife about it; she was then in the shop - I refused to take it. I gave her my card and desired her to go back to her mistress; she came back in about half an hour, and said they were for a respectable lady, who called about a week ago. I told her I could not take less than thirty-eight shillings and sixpence for them; she said I might pack them up in paper, and send them to Mrs. Taylor, No. 4, Staple's Inn. I sent them by

            . I am employed in the prosecutors' warehouse; I was there on the 6th of September; the prisoners came in together about nine o'clock, the man apologised for not coming before, saying he had the rheumatism in his leg; he asked to see some blue cloth - which I showed him; Kendal came in just as they were going away; he was then shewed black cloth. The woman was then standing in the front of the warehouse, against the door - she appeared pregnant. I took the counting-house stool down for her to sit on, if she was disposed. I believe she did not sit down. There was a number of pieces of cloth, standing on their ends on the ground; Kendal went back to cut patterns, while he was gone I was in the front warehouse - the man opened the door for the woman to go out, and shut it after her. Stevens brought her back. I did not see her take anything, nor had I any suspicion - there is a yard which they must cross from the warehouse and on the left hand is the carpet warehouse, the door of which they would pass. When she was brought back I saw the cloth drop from her; it appeared suspended from her right side; but when she got in it dropped upon the warehouse floor. The male prisoner slapped her bonnet, and said,</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Her being pregnant prevented your suspicions - A. Yes; the man slightly slapped her bonnet, and said, in an angry tone, "What did you do that for?" He stood at her side.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you observe her when she moved to go to the door - A. The man stood behind her - I was behind him, within five yards of him. He opened the door and shut it after her.</p>

            . I am porter to the prosecutors. My suspicions were excited by something before; and on Thursday I saw the prisoner come in, and heard the door open, and saw the woman go out by herself - I was in the carpet warehouse in the passage; she came along close by the door - I ran to the window, looked at her, and thought she looked rather more bulky on her right side than when she came in - I went up to her, and hit my left hand against the cloth, and said. "You have got it, have you, and I have got you" - she sighed, I took her back, it dropped from her - I produce it, having kept it ever since.</p>

            . I am in the service of the prosecutors. I found an apron among some cloths where I had seen the prisoners walking, in the front warehouse - I found it directly she was taken; it does not belong to the warehouse.</p>
               <p>MR. LESTER. The cloth is ours, and contains eighteen yards and a quarter. We charge it at seventeen yards; it cost us upwards of 16 l., as the manufacturers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is the cost price - A. As near as I can guess, 16 l. odd shillings. We do not expose goods for sale; our names are on the door, and woollen warehouse - our chief trade is on commission; we never sell less than an end.</p>

            . I recollect Billen coming to Smithfield. I got the six sheep at Hackney, from a man whose name I do not know, I went to Hackney for them, but I saw them first on Friday, in the possession of the prisoner at Smithfield - I do not know what became of them then. On the Monday following, Mr. Cox sent me to Hackney to fetch them, I brought them to Smithfield, and Billen took them from me. Tilby, the butcher, accompanied me to Hackney to pay for them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw the prisoner with them at Smithfield on Friday - A. Yes; I did not know him before, but am quite sure he is the man. He did not say they were his own. I do not think I can swear to the sheep. I can swear from the marks, that those I fetched from Hackney were the same that I saw at Smithfield. Tilby had the same sheep.</p>

            . I am a butcher. On Friday, the 8th of July, I saw the prisoner at Smithfield, and bought six sheep of him, and employed the last witness to go to Hackney with me on Monday for them, to drive them to Smithfield - they were the same that I bought of him. The prisoner took them on the Friday, to the Bull's Head, or Red Bull, public-house, Hackney, and on the Monday, the last witness and I drove them from there to Smithfield, and about one o'clock Billen claimed them - I gave them up to him; they were the same that I bought of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you buy them - A. At Smithfield. I never saw the prisoner before, but am sure he is the man.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you see him on Monday - A. At Smithfield; he went down with me and Abrahams to Hackney, I paid him there. He had no other sheep besides these six, either on Friday or Monday.</p>

            . I am constable of Hendon. On Wednesday after the Monday, I apprehended the prisoner at Winchmore-hill - he lived there. I took him to his own house, which is six or seven miles from Hendon. I went there about three o'clock in the morning with Mr. Wager, it was all shut up till about seven o'clock, when a young man opened the shutters. I enquired for the prisoner, and afterwards broke the door open, and found him sitting in the kitchen dressed in woman's clothes - this was between seven and eight o'clock. I had been refused admittance a good while. I did not know him, being in disguise. I went up stairs and saw his wife; I could not find him, but Wager called out, that he had caught him in woman's clothes. I had demanded admission, and told them I came to apprehend him for felony.</p>

            . I assisted in apprehending the prisoner. Austin went up stairs, I remained outside, and the prisoner came out having hold of his son's arm, dressed in woman's clothes, and a white handkerchief covered over his face - I did not know him at first - he passed me about fifty yards; when he came out he was crying, and when he got about the distance of fifty yards, I noticed his shoes, followed and laid hold of his arm, pulled the handkerchief from his face, and told him he must come back directly.</p>
               <p>MR. BILLEN. The sheep were worth about thirty-two shillings each.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I beg leave to state I am totally innocent of the crime, and humbly submit there is nothing to warrant a conviction, the only thing that materially affects me, is the sheep being found in my possession. On the 6th of July, I was going to Smithfield to buy some sheep, and on the road, about three o'clock in the morning, I overtook a man with nine, going to Romford market; after some conversation, he said he would sell them to me, I asked the price, he said 12 l. 10 s., which I agreed to give him, but was to have ten shillings returned, having paid for them, they were delivered to me, and the man left me, first saying that his name was Thoms, and he lived at Harrow; but on enquiry I find no such man lives there, nor have I been able to find him, or I would have had him here to-day. I then proceeded on and a butcher overtook me, and asked the price of three, I said 27 s. 6 d. each, which he agreed to give; paid for them and took them in his cart towards Tottenham. I brought the other six to Smithfield, put them in an open pen for sale for six hours, and the prosecutor often passed the pen, but took no notice of the sheep or myself, though I was personally known to him; at length a butcher came, and agreed for them at 28 s. each, saying he had not money enough to pay, but would meet me on Monday morning, at six o'clock, on the Kingsland-road, at the bridge, and pay for them. I took them there, did not see him, and went on to Smithfield, and did not meet him till I got there; he said I have been after you, but believe I went to the wrong bridge, and asked if I had got them; we went to Kingsland and he took them away. I humbly trust I have accounted for how I became possessed of them, and that you will think there is nothing improbable in this. I declare I was totally ignorant of their being stolen, or I would not have stood openly with them in the face of day. Had I stolen them, I should have been more guarded and circumspect, and not have stood six hours in the public market with them, nor have consented to take them home, and wait till market-day for the butcher to bring the money, but have disposed of them at any price. I have been in the habit of attending Smithfield market, and am well known there. I beg to state that the prosecutor lives at Hendon, six miles from where I bought the sheep, and from there to town is six miles, and there are three turnpikes I must go through, and run the chance of being detected; the direct road from Harrow to London is only six miles, and there are no turnpikes; is it reasonable to suppose, I should take them six miles round if I had stolen them.

            . I am a farming man. In July last, I was out of work looking for employ, I came from Ware, in Hertfordshire, and was coming to Mr. Rhodes for work, Dixon was with me. On the 6th of July we were on the the Enfield-road.</p>
               <p>Q. By what do you know that it was the 6th of July - A. Being Smithfield market and a Friday. I did not know the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him - A. On the Enfield-road, coming towards town, just on this side of the Three Jolly Butchers, which is four or five miles from London.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know whether it was past the four or five mile stone - A. I cannot say, for it was night when I came that way, and morning when I started. I saw him there early in the morning, it was day-light, about three or four o'clock. Dixon and I were in a field laying under a hedge asleep, and heard them making a noise on the road, a dog was barking. Dixon was also asleep, I awoke him, and we saw a man like a drover, he had a large dog, they were driving a sheep up to the gate, intending to catch her.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were they - A. The prisoner and another man, dressed in dark clothes; he had a sort of jacket coat with the flaps cut off, he had no smock frock; there were nine sheep; I heard the man say he should give him 13 l. for them, and the prisoner said if he gave him 13 l., he must<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120048"/>return 10 s. back, he said he would; the man with the dog went back towards Enfield, and the prisoner and sheep towards London. I took no notice, nor said any thing to the prisoner. I came to town and got work at Rhodes', and have been working since that at Mr. Bowden's, a cow-keeper at Marylebone; did not know the prisoner before, and have not seen him since till to-day.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you here - A. When I was working at Rhodes', we heard the men in the field talking about this affair, and they told me where to find his son.</p>



               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. How did you know he had a son - A. A man in the hay field said he knew his son. I have been to Newgate and seen the prisoner once, which was last Thursday, I came with his son. I set out from Ware about nine o'clock in the morning, to walk about the country for work, and then heard Rhodes', of Islington, had plenty of work.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was Dixon - A. A stranger to me; I first saw him at the Red Cow, public-house, at Ware, that night; I did not know him before; we have been together ever since - he does hay-making and harvesting; we lodge together - he has been working at Rhodes' and at Bowden's with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it day-light when you saw these people on the road - A. Yes; I never spoke to them, I heard a noise and was afraid it was somebody coming to make a noise about our being asleep in the field, we went to sleep again, and slept an hour or two; we continued on the ground till about five o'clock, and came on through Tottenham and Edmonton; we saw the prisoner on the other side of Edmonton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend here last Sessions to give evidence on this trial - A. No, the first time I was asked to come here was three weeks ago, his son asked me. I could not have been known of as a witness last Sessions. *</p>
               <p>* This trial was postponed last Sessions on an affidavit made by the prisoner that he had material evidence in his behalf.</p>
               <p>Q. Thirteen pounds, bating ten shillings, was the price paid for the sheep - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you first hear of the prisoner being charged with stealing sheep - A. I cannot rightly tell, it was while I was at work at Rhodes, I worked there six weeks; the men said a man was taken up for buying stolen sheep in the Enfield-road. Dixon was with me and heard it; the prisoner's name was mentioned in the field.</p>

            , on a Friday morning in July, I think it was the 6th, we were sleeping under a hedge near the Three Jolly Butchers, public-house, about three miles from Islington, on the Enfield-road. How awoke me and told me to get up, I laid still and looked through the hedge and saw two men driving some sheep up to the gate of a field to catch them, there was a dog there, I looked through the hedge so as not to be perceived, and heard them talking about selling some sheep; there were nine sheep, the man said,</p>
               <p>"If I give you thirteen pounds for the sheep you must return me ten shillings;" he said, "Very well, I don't mind returning it." After talking together, I saw him pull out some bills, I suppose they must be money or he would not have given him the sheep. I saw him return the ten shillings. The prisoner is the man who bought them. About a fortnight or three weeks after, when I was working at Mr. Rhodes's, I heard of this.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have you been working since - A. I have done porter's work at Covent-garden market, and at Billingsgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have you lived since - A. In East Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Does any one else lodge with you - A. No, I have a room to myself, there are plenty of lodgers but none that I am acquainted with, for I always keep myself to myself.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Your partner's name is John - A. Yes, I always call him John, and he answers to that name.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first meet him, in the field - A. No, we had been together for three months looking after work.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been together three months before the night you slept under the hedge - A. Yes. I met him before July, it was the beginning of April, we have been together ever since. I have not been working for a Mr. Bowden. I went once to Newgate to see the prisoner, it was the beginning of August.</p>

            . I am a drover. I was coming to town with some sheep on the 29th of June, and this one got mixed with mine, near the Jolly Butchers, public-house, in coming to Green-lane; it was in the prisoner's possession when it got mixed with mine. I saw him there with eight more besides this ewe. He overtook me between two and three o'clock in the morning, he was driving them, they all got mixed with mine. I told him I was going to London and they might go together, but I got this ewe away - it appeared<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120049"/>an odd one. I told him I thought it was an odd one, and had got mixed with them; he said it had. I said I thought it belonged to some of the neighbours, and we would leave it at the Queen's Head public-house. It did not appear the same sort as the others. He proposed to take it to London, and said he would sell it, and give the money to the man it belonged to, if he could find the owner. I said we had better leave it at the public-house, as it would be handier for the people to find. He agreed to that. The other eight were a kind of half-bred sheep, and I think all wethers. I do not think they had any mark; they were about half meat. I should know them again if I had seen them. He told me he was going to call at Holland's, the butcher's, at Islington, and he would buy them; he knocked at his door, and I said "Do not knock him up, if he wants them he will come to market," He said he would give any thing for a pen; they were taken to Smithfield and put in a pen. I gave the ewe to Wager, at the Queen's Head.</p>
               <p>Q. Who first made the observation about the ewe - A. I did. I said I thought it was one of our commoners, and had got mixed with them; he hesitated a little, then said it had got mixed with them. We walked about a mile together after I made the observation before he said it had got mixed; he kept talking to me about what the sheep were worth; I told him I did not know where it came from, as I had not seen a sheep on the road that morning. I am sure he is the man; the first time I saw him was on Good Friday, and once after that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say it was half a mile from where you first met him that he said the sheep had joined his - A. We had come nearly half a mile. I suppose it was twenty minutes after I made the observation about it belonging to one of the commoners, that he said it might have strayed among his; during that time we were talking about the sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he begun talking to you about the value of the sheep before you made this remark - A. No. He did not say it was his; he said it might have strayed among his, and he was willing to leave it or take it and sell it, and give the owner the money.</p>

            . I live in the Mile-end-road. On the 1st of September, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was going home on the <placeName id="t18210912-84-crimeloc473">Mile-end-road</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18210912-84-crimeloc473" type="placeName" value="Mile-end-road"/>

I was walking on the broad stone, and went on the gravel to let them pass, and all of a sudden, just as they were passing me, I received a violent blow on my right breast, which knocked me down, and was senseless for a minute or two. As soon as I recovered. I found one hand at the pocket where I keep my pocketbook, and another at my other pocket - I was laying on the ground. I was strong enough to keep my hand before me, to close my pocket. I pressed my arms together, which held the man's hand. I wanted to get up, and found one man holding me down by the collar behind; I found a hand very near my left-hand pocket, I dropped my left hand and took the man by the wrist. I then found he was attempting to put his hand in my right-hand pocket - this was not the person who was before feeling in my pockets, as I was holding those hands. On dropping my right hand to take hold of the hand that was going into my right-hand pocket, a knife, or some sharp instrument, cut off part of my fore finger - my nail, and part of my finger were cut off, and the surgeon cut off two or three bits of the bone when he dressed it. On receiving the cut, I cried out as loud as I could for assistance, and Mr. Watson, who I knew very well, came to my assistance - I knew his voice, and said,</p>
               <p>"Watson, for God's sake come and help me, for I am robbed, and likely to be murdered." I did not then know but what I was robbed; he assisted me, and one or more of them said,</p>
               <p>"Somebody has knocked this gentleman down, and we are helping him up." I said,</p>
               <p>"You are the very rogues and thieves that knocked me down, and attempted to take my life;" the men all got off - I do not know whether they walked or ran. I was taken to Mr. Langley's, where a surgeon dressed my wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you state how many men there were upon you - A. There were at least three. I do not know what it was that cut me. I was attempting to seize the hand, but do not think I had touched it when I was cut. I was sensible of the wound at the time, and called out</p>
               <p>"Murder," it gave me much pain.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had hold of the other hand, had you squeezed or twisted it - A. Yes, I twisted that man's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120050"/>hand with my left hand, so as to make him feel. I do not recollect any thing being said. I am positive the prisoner is one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you the opportunity of seeing him, so as to speak with confidence - A. I saw them at a little distance before they came up, and observed the prisoner particularly, and when I was on the ground, after Watson came to my assistance, I saw all four very plain, three of them I can positively swear to. When Watson came up, one laid on my legs, and another was by my side, with his hands at my side - I do not know whether he was on me or not. I cannot say what the prisoner did, whether he was the person who cut my hand, but he was one of them; three of them were about me when Watson came up, and the prisoner was one of those three; there were four together when they knocked me down. I do not know whether there were more than three when Watson came up. My hand is very bad now, and in a good deal of pain. It happened on Saturday, the 1st of September. I saw the prisoner in custody on the Tuesday or Wednesday following, and knew him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. Q. Was it a light night - A. It was star-light, and there were lights from the lamps; it is a very few doors on this side Charrington's brewhouse - there are some trees there, the lamps are parish lamps, there was one very near me, and the houses and shops were not shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there not trees between the lamps and where you were knocked down - A. I am not certain. I was alarmed certainly. I never saw any of them before. I had no reason to remark one more than another. I saw the prisoner in custody at Lambeth-street office; he was pointed out to me, and I was asked if he was the man, I said, Yes. I went there to see whether he was one, the officer said he had got a suspicious man.</p>

            . I know the prosecuter. On the 1st of September, I was passing towards London, on the Mile-end-road, and about twenty yards off, I observed a bustle, I sprung forwards, and called out very loud "Hallo! what are you all about?"</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by a bustle - A. Four persons, were attacking the prosecutor, and when I came up, I found him on his back, and two holding him by his feet or knees, and the other two at his arms, holding him down; the sudden manner of my coming up alarmed them, and the two who held his arms stood up - I then recognised Maunder as a neighbour - they were bending down before, and the other two were actually kneeling on him. My coming up gave him confidence - I told him not to be alarmed, as he was among his friends. I should have laid hold of the prisoner at the time, but one of the men or a gentleman came up, and said, I think the gentleman is tipsy, this took off my attention, and finding he was wounded, I lifted him up, and took him to Mr. Langley's, saw his wound, and fetched a medical gentleman. I am certain the prisoner was one of the men, he was at his left arm, and rose up when I came up; I had an excellent opportunity of noticing him - I looked him very hard in the face, and observed his features and dress, and have no doubt of him. Mr. Maunder called for help, and said he was robbed. I do not know whether it was the prisoner or a gentleman, who said he was tipsy. On the Friday, following I went with Partridge to the Earl of Effingham, public-house, Whitechapel, and took the prisoner - he was with fourteen or sixteen more; I follow the officer, he called on him to stand up, he stood up - I gave the officer, a nudge as a signal, and when we came out, I said he was the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The whole four were strangers to you - A. All of them. There was nothing particularly remarkable in the prisoner. I was more collected than I am now. I found the prosecutor on the gravel. There is a regular pavement.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the officer point out any particular man - A. He told one man to stand up; I do not know whether he mentioned a name. I remarked one other young man in the room. I have always been as positive to the prisoner, as I am now. None of them attempted to run away, nor was any resistance made - he came quietly. I wish to say that I am positive the prisoner is not the man who inflicted the wound, nor did he use any violence to the prosecutor while I was there. I am certain he is the man, who held the arm.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prosecutor appear in any respect intoxicated - A. No; he was agitated.</p>

            . I am an engraver and live in Widegate-street, Bishopsgate-street, City. I know the prisoner,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120051"/>I have known him personally for twenty years, but did no business for him. In March or April, he came into my shop and said, I have a little business to do in the engraving; I said, "Very well, walk in, pray what is it." He gave me a specimen of this ticket (looks at one), it was like this; he asked whether I could engrave such a thing, I said I could, and said "Pray what is it?" he said Prussian; I said, "What?" he said, a ticket; "A ticket of what?" said I; he said, "A ticket of admission;" I was looking at it; and saw the word "current" on it, which was the only thing I could make out; I began to say for what - he said, "God bless my soul, do you think I am giving you any thing wrong to do, you know me very well;" I said "I do." I have known him by being a neighbour, and occasionally meeting him; he wanted me to engrave two plates and have 30,000 impressions, if I could get them done, but there was no restricted number. I asked what time he would allow - a fortnight or three weeks was mentioned; I said, that was too short to get so large a number, but I would get about 10,000 done. We calculated that the 10,000, with the plates, would come to about 30 l., which made about 10 l. a thousand in all, including the plates. I took some impressions afterwards on certain qualities of paper, after engraving the plate, and he took the proofs with him. I was to supply the plates and print 10,000, he thought the paper I had would do; but after having proofs pulled, and taking them away, he said it would not do, and agreed to find the paper. The paper was included in the 10 l. a thousand.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do in consequence of the order he gave - A. I entered it in my order-book, and proceeded to put it in execution, and struck off 10,000 from the plate. The order was complete before a fortnight or three weeks; we used to lay them on the counter to dry, and he came repeatedly and sat in the shop, and cut them, gathered them up, and took them away as we got them dry, in thousands, packed up in hundreds. I employed three plates on them, as one was worn out; they were struck off in the common way of copper-plate printing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing added after the engraving was struck off - A. A line of letter-press was afterwards introduced, with this instrument (producing it) in red ink; this is the worn-out plate (looking at it), it was the plate of the reverse side of the instrument; I struck off 7 or 8000 with it, it was then worn out, I told him so; he said we must have another; I said, I could not afford it at the price; he said, he would give me two guineas to do another. The plates were left with me (looks at two others), these are them, they completed the instrument, except the red ink line; one of my men composed the letter-press instrument. The prisoner ordered it to be a complete copy of the one he brought. I did the 10,000, and about August he called, and said he had a fresh order for 5000 more, that it was a shipping order, and he wanted them done as speedily as possible; the order was entered in my book. I had received the first paper from the prisoner, in reams made up from the maker's, and some of it was left; it was made purposely, each sheet made two tickets.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Foy coming to your house - A. Yes, the second order was then in progress, only 300 were done, and when he came in they were on my counter, drying. The plates, tickets, and paper, found by Foy, were the same which the prisoner directed to be made and finished; he called many times while they were in progress, I should think thirty times, and was very anxious to get them done.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this, is it one of the tickets, as the prisoner described them, impressed from the plate you have in your hand - A. It is, both sides correspond with the two plates, it was struck by his direction from the plates made by his order; those set out in the indictment (looking at it) are impressed from the same plate, but I did not make the impression; the letter-press of these is not mine. Here is the original ticket (looking at it) which he gave me to engrave the plates from.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You have known him twenty years - Yes; I call him Goldston; he said they were tickets of admission, he did not say it was to a theatre; he had proofs of some for approbation. I pulled him a proof as a matter of course; he did not say he wanted them for approbation, each time an alteration was made in the plate, he had an impression, he might take away several at different times; he said they were a shipping order, and I considered that he took them for approbation; he never said the order was for somebody else.</p>
               <p>A JUROR. Q. Are the types foreign or English - A. English. The plate is fairly reduced to its present state by working, I intended to repair it; and before that we have them planished, we send them to a copper-plate printer to be planished, and it came in that state to me, either from Harrison's, in Shoe-lane; or Shafe's, in Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Q. There is tin or lead at the back - A. Yes, I had them first engraved to work two at the time, and they were laid on a bed of tin.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you understand either the German and French language - A. I do not, my Lord.</p>

In February last I executed an order for paper of this description; we sent up 1000 sheets, and were afterwards directed to alter the water mark, the substance of the sheet; and the colour; after that I saw the prisoner, another person was with him he selected a sheet of paper for the substance of it, and another as to colour, and said he wished to have the water mark more perfect. I made it so, here is the water mark, and the mould it was made from. We made about 26,000 sheets, each being double.

            . (Through an interpreter.) I speak the German language. I am inspector of the police of Berlin. It is my duty to inspect the dollar notes, among other things, with a view to know if they are forged. I am one of the inspectors, (looks at the note) this is a treasury note or receipt of one dollar, it is a false one. I have seen a number of them in possession of Foy, they are false. In May last several Jews were taken up at Berlin for passing these notes. Among others I arrested two of the name of Lob, they were transported from Berlin, and one Simeon was in custody. I came over to England with him, we arrived on the 10th of July. I put a letter in the post at Hamburgh, directed to the prisoner.</p>

I have nothing to do with the office from which the notes are issued, but have orders from the Treasury respecting them; there is nobody here from the office. They are issued in Prussia instead of money, they are current money; whoever presents them receives money for them; they are received at all the Treasuries in payment of duties, and in exchange for money. I have seen money given for them at the Treasury an hundred times, no deduction is made. It is a treasury note or receipt, and is current money through the whole kingdom in every business.</p>

            . I live in Villiers-street, Strand. I have known the prisoner as long as I have been in this country, about nine years; I never had any dealings with him except the transaction in question. I first saw him on the subject on the 11th of July, I had arrived in England the day before with the Inspector of the Police. I was in custody at Berlin. I saw the prisoner the day after our arrival, and had some conversation with him. I told him I was sent here from Mr. Lobb, of Hamburgh, to obtain the 5000 Prussian notes, and that I had the money to pay for them, and told him he had a letter to that effect; he said he had received the letter. I had no occasion to tell him who I came from, for I was present several times before when the prisoner delivered Lobb some at No. 43, Lant-street, Borough, last March or April; they were such as these produced - my application to him was for notes of the same description, as I had seen him give Lobb before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what language the prisoner speaks - A. He always spoke German to me. He said he would try to get them for me, but I must give him 5 l. beforehand, and not having it in my pocket, I promised to give it him next day. I told Foy of it - he gave me a 5 l. note, marked; I gave it to the prisoner, and he gave me a receipt for it, which I produce. I paid it; to him on account of the 5000 notes; he gave me some notes which I immediately brought with Clement, the officer, to Foy. The officer searched me before I went in for the notes, and I met him just as I came out - he stood opposite when I went in. I received notes twice from the prisoner; the first time 1200, and the second time 2100. He appointed to meet me to pay him 10 l. more at Somerset-house, I did so, and gave him 10 l. which I received from Foy, and he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You are a Prussian - A. Yes. I was never in custody except on this occasion; they kept me in custody from the 21st of May, to the 28th of June. I am now on parole.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw the prisoner give Lobb notes in March and April - A. I heard Lobb give the prisoner an order for 30,000 notes; he received on that occasion, an original note from his brother to give the prisoner.</p>

I received from him on the 30th of July, 1200 notes, 100 of which I marked, and sealed the others up. I produce one. I took the prisoner in Waterloo-street, Strand; I had given Simeon on that day, August the 1st, two 5 l. notes, the prisoner had those two 5 l. notes in his hand when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120053"/>I took him. I asked where he got them from, he said from Mr., I asked for what purpose, he said for watches, which he had sold him. I told him, he was charged with forging Prussian notes; he said he knew nothing about these. I said I was certain he did, and asked where the plates were. I said I was certain he knew, for they were at Newman's in Widegate-alley - he denied all knowledge of them. I said, I should send him to the office, and search Newman's-house; he said if I did, I should not succeed in finding the plates, but if I would allow him to go, he would point out the place where they were to be found. I said I could not, and sent him to the office. I and Mr. Eckard, accompanied by a constable, went to Newman's - he was not at home, but was sent for. I told him he was printing some work for a man named Goldstein, I went up stairs, and found two men at work, printing with the plates - these are the plates that we brought away. In the printing-office, I found notes in various states, some paper half worked, and some wholly so. I also found some paper, and the type set up with red ink.

I accompanied him again next day, and saw him go into the house, he returned with a great quantity of these notes, and gave them to Foy at the Crown tavern. I did not lose sight of him till he delivered them. I assisted in apprehending the prisoner, and went with Foy to Newman's, and found a quantity of notes being printed.</p>

               <p>MR. ECKARD. They are all forged instruments.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent. I never had a felonious intent in my mind - it was through distress. I have a wife and seven children. I had an execution in my house - the man saw what distress I was in; I told him of it - he put his hand to his heart, and said - So help him G - d, there was not the least illegality in it; that he had known me in better circumstances, and only wanted to relieve me.</p>

The Learned Judge stated, that as this was the first conviction of its nature, he should reserve it on that and other points, for the consideration of the Twelve Judges.</p>

I ran round and crossed the prisoner in the fields; Mr. Price was pursuing him, they were the only two in the fields; he jumped across a ditch, stumbled, and I secured him. Mr. Price came up instantly, and said he was the man. He said he was running after the man, but there was nobody before him. He resisted being taken to the watch-house.</p>

The tobacco imported is deposited in the London Docks or Excise, till the duties are paid. When the merchant wants his tobacco he gives notice at the Tobacco Office, it is then weighed, and the officer who weighs it sends an account to the office of the weight, and gives another to the merchant; the officer makes out one account for himself, the merchant makes out one for himself, and the officer signs the one the merchant has. The officer deposits his account in our office, and the merchant takes the other to the collector. The amount of duty is ascertained from the weight at the collector's office, and paid by the merchant, the collector then gives him a certificate of its having been paid, and the merchant endorses the landing marks, number of the import, and delivery weights, and the person to whom it is to be delivered.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this, is it such an instrument as is given at the collector's office - A. It is; after this the merchant carries the certificate signed by the collector to the comptroller's office for his signature. It then comes to our office. The prisoner was a <rs id="t18210912-89-deflabel497" type="occupation">clerk</rs>

He has the custody of the weighing officer's note, and is to compare the certificate with it, and to examine the certificate and see if the signatures of the collector and comptroller is correct, but we are not very nice about these things; but we are always particular in comparing the note with the certificate, if he is satisfied that it is correct, he gives the broker or merchant a permit, and puts the certificate in the drawer. The certificates and permits are always numbered.</p>
               <p>Q. Should the two numbers correspond - A. No; sometimes it is omitted to put the number of the permit on the certificate. There are also counterparts of the permits. There is a book kept in which the certificates are entered - We call it the duty-paid ledger. It was the prisoner's duty to enter the certificates in that ledger, in the course of the week, as we compare accounts at the end of the week and make them up; and a voucher is drawn which is a copy of of the duty-paid ledger. It was the prisoner's business to make out the voucher; it should contain an account of all the certificates granted in the course of the week. When the voucher is made out it is examined with the duty-paid ledger, and the certificates are also compared with it. It is also compared with the counterpart; the certificates are always compared with the counterpart of the permits; they then go to another clerk, who enters them in the import ledger, and they are laid up in weekly bundles.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the certificates of the preceding week would not be in the drawer - A. No. I believe they are sometimes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120055"/>left in for a fortnight, but then the first week's are always tied in a bundle, the bundle is not always made up at the end of the week. At the latter end of July, I think on a Tuesday, I received some information from the clerks, and set about making enquiry, and saw the prisoner. I think he told me there was a double No. 198 of the certificate, meaning that there was two certificates of that number. (I think this was on Monday). I went with him afterwards to Mr. Mayo's office, and as we went along he said</p>
               <p>"I think I had better not say any thing about No. 202," which was another certificate. I compared the permits and ledger with Mr. Phipps, the general surveyor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Where is your office - A. By the Docks. He had been four years, in our office. I know Mr. Grant, he was clerk to his cousin, who is a broker; he was to pay the money. He absconded, about a month ago; it was before I was at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner remained at the office - A. The 10th of August was the last day he was there. We went to Bow-street, ten days after. The discovery was made a fortnight or three weeks before.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not very nice about examining the signature of the collector - A. No; we do not always know them; as they are often changed. The permits are not always issued in their regular order of numbers - the certificates are put in a drawer which is open to all the clerks. I never saw a broker go to it. I believe it is not locked.</p>
               <p>Q. The voucher is a copy of the ledger, and ought to contain the week's certificate - A. Yes; if a certificate is omitted it will not agree with the collector's account.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the enquiry suggested by the prisoner himself, in consequence of his having made complaint about Grant, who has absconded - A. He made a complaint, about No. 198. I have never seen Grant since. The prisoner complained of Grant.</p>
               <p>MR. WALFORD. Q. The double number that the prisoner disclosed was No. 198 - A. Yes he mentioned no other number to me. His seat is railed in.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you continue at the office that morning - A. Yes. The prisoner said to me, that the account I had brought up did not agree, and the difference was the amount of a certificate paid by Mr. Grant. I think he named 327 l. odd, as the amount. Mr. Jones came into the office, and he named it to him. I knew

            , his business frequently called him to our office; the prisoner, and he seemed very good friends, merely passing civilities, nothing more that I saw - I have seen them go out of the office together occasionally.

             came to the office that day, and I think brought down some warrants, Sutherin named something to him about double numbers. I heard Grant say, he knew he had paid the duties, and that was all he cared about. I have not seen him since.</p>
               <p>Q. On the next day, Tuesday, the 31st of July, did Jones direct you to make out a search - A. Yes, to see where the error laid, and could not discover any weighing bill tallying with the warrant. Between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I, Hoare, and Henler, made further search (the office shuts at four o'clock); they came, and wished to look at the warrants paid by Grant on the preceding day, the 30th; I opened the drawer in the prisoner's seat, which contained the warrants, and took them out, they examined them. I know Mr. Smith the collector; to the best of my belief, the signature is not his writing. I do not know about Wright's signature.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it found in a bundle tied up, or how - A. Loose. The bundle of the preceding week was in the drawer, not tied up, but folded up.</p>
               <p>Q. Now turn to the ledger, and tell me whether there is any entry there of No. 202 - A. There are two of No. 202. I saw the account when there was no double entry of No. 202, that account is not now in the ledger, the entry is made by the prisoner, and so was the first that I saw. On Wednesday the 1st of August, I saw the prisoner making entries in the ledger, from a loose leaf not then attached to the book, but it was a leaf of the ledger, and the same I saw in it before, it was ruled exactly the same, and in his writing. I do not know what became of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Grant was a respectable decent young man - A. Yes. There was no particular familiarity, between him and the prisoner. The prisoner was the first person who spoke of the warrant No. 198, and that set the enquiry afloat respecting this. I heard him talking to him in the office, about double numbers, and after that I saw

             no more. If I took the certificate up in a cursory way, I might not notice that it was not Smith's signature. I know when he was absent he sent a sick note.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Have you the counterpart of the permit - A. Yes, of No. 202.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does the account you got from the collector, contain either No. 198 or 202 - A. No; I delivered it to the prisoner to examine; he said it did not correspond as to 198; 198 was entered in his voucher and his book, but 202 was not in his account, and his account was 327 l. and odd more than the collector's, but it had No. 198 in it.</p>

             was in my service, on the 26th of that month I directed him to clear five hogsheads of tobacco, for which I gave him a check of 303 l. 19 s. for one hogshead, and Fish and Co. furnished him with the money for the others. I produce the check which I got from my bankers; the amount of duty is 303 l. 16 s. 2 s. rent, and 1 s. Dock charges; the other four hogsheads were for Fish and Co. St. John-street, the duty on them was 1146 l. 4 s., rent 8 s. charges 4 s., and the transfer on thirty-one hogsheads, 5 l. 2 s., making altogether 1135 l. 1 s. 2 d. On the Tuesday morning following, I was at the Collector's office on business, and met Crouch, and heard from him that there was a mistake in a warrant; he requested me to look into my books and see if such a hogshead, No. 198, was cleared on that day. I did, and went to the office to find a duplicate-paper of the warrant, but could not, and informed Crouch and Jones; they found the hogshead had been cleared, but could not find the duplicate - I knew the tobacco was cleared; he then informed me, the warrant was supposed to be a forgery, after which I came back from the office, and not having seen my young man all the day, raised my suspicions. In coming from the Dock, at the corner of the street where I live, I met the prisoner; he asked me where Robert, my young man was to be found, or where his friends lived, as he must and would see him. I told him his mother lived in Hans-square, Sloane-street, and said I was going myself to Clapham, where his brother lived. He wished me to go home and dine with him, I said my mind was too much agitated, and I would go to Clapham immediately, to seek the young man out if I could - this was about three o'clock. He then left me apparently to go towards Thames-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Look to this certificate, No. 202, can you speak to any of the writing in it - A. Yes, the body of the warrant is certainly my clerk's writing, but the date is not; the endorsement is my clerk's writing, except the No. 26. I went from my own house over to Clapham, and not finding him there, I went to Hans-square. I have not seen him since.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this No. 198 also - A. The body of the warrant is my clerk's hand-writing, but the date of the importation, 6th of November, 1820, is not. I have since paid to the Excise the duty on this tobacco. I have paid them twice, once to Grant, and now to the Excise. I saw the prisoner a few days afterwards at the office, the conversation turned on this business, and in the course of conversation, he said he knew my clerk kept a horse and gig. I asked how he came to be possessed of this information, he said he has been seen in one down at Chelsea, and had been seen to get out of this gig and go into the fisting shop; that the prisoner's brother and his uncle Johnson had seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go to the prisoner's house - A. I did, after some discovery; he lived in Gray's-walk, Lambeth; Mr. Bailey accompanied me. I knocked at the door twice before we got admittance - his wife opened it - I was shewn up stairs; she went to a pair of folding doors, which separated two rooms, as if to go in, but they appeared to be fastened; she immediately said,</p>
               <p>"Sutherin, Mr. Grant has called to see you," he said,</p>
               <p>"Why don't you come in?" she said,</p>
               <p>"How can I, when the door is fastened." After this he came in, and asked if I had heard any thing of Robert, I said, I had not; he then asked if any thing more was discovered. I said, I understood there was, but I could not tell him the particulars; he said, what an unlucky thing it was for him; that Robert had frequently been there, and always gave him to understand that he slept in Leicester-square; he said they had had some money transaction together once, about the sixteenth of a lottery ticket, and that he had conducted himself with great propriety.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He said he must and would find him - A. Yes. He did not tell me where he lived himself.</p>

            . On Saturday the 21st of July, late in the afternoon, four cases were landed as passengers' baggage, under a sufferance, there was not time to clear them. M'Donald and Slater, the Dock Company's officers, had the charge of them; they were placed on the wharf, and contained seeds, roots, stuffed birds, and insects, from the Cape of Good Hope. I stopped them for the duty, and put the broad arrow upon them, that they might not be removed until the duty was paid. I saw them on the wharf on Monday, and afterwards before the Magistrate, they contained the same goods; the Magistrate ordered the articles to be delivered and the boxes kept.</p>

               <p>"Never mind, it will not fall on your head." I said I would take good care it should not, and he had better have nothing to do with them, and put them on shore again; he had one on board and one in his hand when I spoke to him. On the Monday the officers came on board to search for them; the prisoner came to me and said,</p>
               <p>"I will give you a pound note if you say nothing;" I asked, about what; he said,</p>
               <p>"About what happened last night;" I told him his pound note would not save his neck, nor me from transportation. The officers took the boxes.

I said if I had known they were there I could have seized them myself. Soon after the steward came on board, and invited me to drink, after that he locked the cabin and left the key with Ridge, who pressed me to accept of two bottles of wine. I refused, he still pressed me, and I pushed him from me; he began to vociferate against me in a blasphemous manner. I went to bed to get rid of him.</p>

On the 23d of July my wife informed me that a bag of linen was taken from the ball-room. I missed it, and as I was in King-street I met the prisoner with a small bundle, and asked her what it was? She said it was her gown, which she had redeemed. I went to Mr. Temple's, in Panton-street, and found three shirts and the curtains. I then got an officer and found the rest of the articles stated in the indictment at her lodging. She has worked for my family twenty-seven years, as a faithful servant.</p>

My sister Frances, was also servant there, she was in the house but no more of the family. I was in the front dining room, I thought I heard a noise, went to the window and saw the prisoner looking down the area, he was outside on the pavement, he looked at me and said something, what I do not know. I went down stairs instantly, and missed the articles stated in the indictment, which I had seen safe ten minutes before in the room next the area. I am no judge of their value. I found the area gate open, and found the prisoner in custody about a week after with the property. I am sure he is man; he was gone when I came up stairs.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the morning of the 3d of August, about half past five o'clock, I was on duty in the New-road, and saw the prisoners and another in Maida-hill, coming from towards Kilburn, at Paddington, it was the right way to come from this house to avoid us, it is a bye way; Smith and Lee were with me, we were coming off duty; the prisoners were in company, about twenty yards from the turnpike; they saw us, and Bennet threw a sack off his shoulder into the ditch, and sat by the side of the bank, they were both in company. I went up and asked Bennet what he had in the sack he had just thrown away? he said he did not know, as he had picked it up in West End-lane, which is three quarters of a mile from there, and quite in a different direction. Ditton said he was very sorry that we came so soon upon them. We seized them and the bag which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120059"/>contained lead. We walked fifteen miles to find the owner. Taylor came to the watch-house and complained of losing lead. I saw it fitted to the place, every nail corresponded.</p>

            , I met her at Cheltenham; she went with me to Bath and Reading, where we lodged some time; she had a former sweetheart named Smart, and she found out that he lived within a mile or two of Reading, and repeatedly went after him when I was away. I then brought her to town, and furnished her a house at Chelsea. I went to Cambridge to see my uncle, and she sold off every thing, and when I returned, I could find her no where, but at last heard she was at Mr. Shackle's. I went sixteen times after her, the master said if I came there, he would shoot me. I kept single for three years, and thought it necessary for a young man like me to marry again.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 22d of August, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I took the prisoner in Great James-street, Lisson Green. I found two pint pots buttoned inside his breeches, and two quart pots in his coat pockets. I asked where he got them, he gave no account - the prosecutors' names were on them.</p>

The prisoner offered me a pot of beer to let him go - the baker ran away and left me; he said the halfpence were his, but he did not know his pocket had been picked. When I took the prisoner's hand from the pocket, it had halfpence in it he had no halfpence in his hand before he put it in, for it was wide open as he put it in. I do not know the baker's name.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. James's. On the 18th of August, about ten o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner coming down Swallow-street, with his coat on his arm, he crossed over into Chapel-court, where there are some houses being pulled down. Some lead had been stolen before, and I watched him by the ruins, and in five minutes I waited to see if he returned, but could not see him. I went to the ruins and found he had got over one wall, and was getting a leaden pipe out of a wooden spout - wrenching it off. I saw the lead hanging over the door; it was drawn from the nails, but still fixed - I secured him.</p>

Some moulds were missed about the time he left, and while he was there, and some since, but they might have been taken before. I made these moulds, their value was from 3 l. to 3 l. 10 s., but they are not worth that now. He worked their ten or twelve months, we missed none till he came.

            . I am a printer, and live at No. 3, Redcross-court, Barbican. I work for Mr. Macdonald, of Great Sutton-street, Clerkenwell. I have known the prisoner four or five months - about that time ago, he told me he had some printing materials to sell, which were the remaining stock of his business, as a letter-founder at Bristol - he gave me a sample of the type as a specimen to sell for him; and shewed me some in a box, but I did not understand them - he said one Williamson was his partner - I offered the type to Mason, six or seven weeks ago, and shewed him the sample, and in consequence of what he said, I brought him the rest of the type. I got it from Hughes's, the prisoner helped me to carry it - it was 56 lbs. It was weighed at Masons; the prisoner did not go into Mason's with me, he brought it to the door, I said I would take it in myself; a mould was with it, like those which printers use - I told the prisoner to write a bill, he wrote it in the name of Williamson and Co., and asked me to copy it - he said Williamson was more known in the trade as a letter-founder, as he was the principal workman - he gave that as his reason for having the bill in that name - I copied it to alter the price, as I was to have a profit on the sale - I delivered the bill to Mason, and after that, called several times for the money, as he was busy; I told the prisoner from time to time that Mason was putting me off, but as he was poor, I gave him 1 l. in advance. The last time I went, which was the 18th of August, Mason told me he had his suspicions, and that Figgins had claimed it. I immediately went to Figgins (no charge was made against me), this was on a Saturday - I arranged with Figgins to meet him at the Lamb and Flag, public-house, Clerkenwell-green, on Monday - I told the prisoner of it, he said he would be there at one o'clock - I returned and told Figgins the hour appointed; I went, according to appointment - Figgins, Mason, and a man named Williamson came, as his name had been used, but I did not know him - we waited an hour, then Williamson and I were taken up - I was in custody a fortnight, and then admitted to bail - I had seen the prisoner at times, at his lodgings at Hughes's, and think I remember his taking some type out in a pocket handkerchief to be weighed, opposite to where he lodged - I was to ask 18 d. a lb. for the type; I agreed to sell it to Mason at 1 s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not offer it to M'Donald first - A. Yes; and told him I had it from one Hopkins, who had been in business at Bristol, and said I became acquainted with him through my brother - I never said I took it for a bad debt; I told Mason that I had it from Hopkins, I did not say at the office that I had it from Williamson, I said he was in the business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the Magistrate send you to the House of Correction for prevarication - A. He committed me, I do not know what for; I might say the type weighed about 51 1/2 lbs.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you tell Mason you had it from Williamson - A. No; I copied the bill which was in that name - As soon as the prisoner was in custody, I and Williamson were discharged.</p>

On examining of the type, I suspected it was not honestly come by, as there was none of some letters, and very few of others - I made enquiry, and sent to Figgins, and appointed to meet him, and Bass (whom I had told that Figgins claimed the property) at the Lamb and Flag - I went on Monday, Figgins, Bass, Williamson, and Read were there; the prisoner did not come - Bass and Williamson were taken into custody. I was to give 1 s. a lb. for the type, and 10 s. for the mould - Bass had worked for me about a year and a half ago; I told him it was Figgin's; he was willing to go to him - Read took the type.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did Bass say he had it from Williamson - A. At first he said from Williamson, and then from Hopkins.</p>

            . I was formerly in Mr. Figgins's employ. I was never at Bristol in my life, and was never in partnership with the prisoner, except that I did some work for Mason, and the prisoner and I parted the money which the mould earned, that was before Christmas, 1819, This is the mould we used; he brought it to me; he was at that time in Figgins's employ; it was not in this state when I had it - it was in a stereotype state - I have used it both before and since it was altered - that was before Christmas, 1819; also, I put this board on it - I believe it to be the mould, but will not be certain.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Grange, a gardener of Kingsland-road, and live within fifty yards of this house. On the 1st of August, about twenty-five minutes before five o'clock, I saw the prisoners for about twenty minutes walking together, and looking over into the gardens of these houses. Gladden went over into the garden of the empty house, and was there about twenty minutes, then returned and gave this pipe over the wall to Greystock, also a brass cock and some pears which he gave Parker; he then came over and they began to break up the pipe; Greystock put the cock and part of it under his coat; Gladden took the other two pieces and put under his jacket. I came down stairs and followed them towards town to the end of Margaret-street, and met a man, told him what I had seen; they then went down by the side of the canal towards Hackney again; I followed, and took Greystock, the others turned back, and the man secured them. We delivered them to a constable, and found the lead on them, it appeared quite fresh broken.</p>

On the 4th of September I went to bed at ten minutes before eleven o'clock, leaving the other servants up. I had bolted the door which led to the area with two bolts, and fastened the kitchen door with two bolts and a bar across. I got up between five and six o'clock and found the kitchen door open; a hole was made in it large enough for a person to put their hand through and undo the bolt; the area door was unbolted but not open; the cellar door was shut but not locked. I did not go into the cellar; it was not locked over night. I opened it, and saw an iron candlestick standing on a box; Mr. Turton had two of these candlesticks. The pantry door was a-jar - I had not noticed that at night. Mr. Turton saw the premises in the same state that I did. I went up and called

            , ESQ. - I live at No. 9, Chester-street, Grosvenor-place, in the parish of St. George's, Hanover-square. The prisoner was in my service; he came at the latter end of June or beginning of July, and was going to leave me on the 5th of September, not for any fault. On the 5th of September he was to have called me at a quarter before six o'clock, but did not, and I got up at a quarter past six o'clock - it was my usual custom to give him orders to call me every morning, but he was rather irregular in calling me at all times. On my coming down I first saw

            , who told me the house was robbed; I went into the kitchen and she followed me. I there saw the cook, and the prisoner near the door. The prisoner first spoke - he said</p>
               <p>"The house has been robbed, or they have broken in here, and they have stolen every bit of the plate, and my silver watch: I broke the glass of it on Saturday, and left it in the pantry and forgot to take it away." - I did not exactly know myself where the plate was kept, but I understood from him that it was kept in a drawer in the pantry adjoining the kitchen, he had the charge of it. The plate in his care was in use at dinner time on the day preceding. I know he had only part of the spoons in his care - the party at dinner were eight. I saw several spoons in use that day - butter ladles: a butter knife, and a cruet stand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine your premises - A. I did, when he spoke to me in the morning; he added,</p>
               <p>"And my watch; but I know the maker's name, and have that in my Bible at home." I then spoke to him again, and he pointed out the cellar (the door of which is opposite the kitchen door, and both are inclosed by the area door), and said they must have been concealed here, and they have left a candle here. I went into the cellar and saw the candlestick; it was an iron one, and had the appearance of having had a candle burnt out in it, the tallow having run down on the box. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120065"/>then examined the kitchen door; it is here - it is in the same state as it was that morning; several persons have put their hands through the hole, as well as myself, and that has smoothened the surface; but it appeared to have been done by different punctures by a gimblet-hole. On the outside of the door between the kitchen and cellar doors were several pieces of wood, which appeared to have been taken out of the door - the hole might have been made by persons outside the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you say how those broken pieces of wood which you picked up had been taken out - A. I ordered them to remain in the same state till the officer came; they were then taken up and tied together, and afterwards put into the hole. I found by putting my arm into the hole I could reach the bolts, and get about the centre of the door. A strong bar went across, which was fastened at the end with a staple, and at the other end with a small iron pin, it was within reach of the hole; the bar could not be let down well without making a considerable noise, as it was very heavy. At the bottom of the door is another bolt, smaller to the one at the top; that appeared to be shot, and the staple, which was not a strong one, appeared to be forced. The door opens into the area, but it is within the area door.</p>
               <p>Q. The pieces of wood were laid together - what appearance did they exhibit - A. It appeared that by making a number of holes with a gimblet, they had been forced out. I then asked the prisoner when he went to bed; he said at two o'clock, and that he and

             were the last persons up - his bed-room was over the coach-house, which was separated from the house by a small yard at the back of the house, and to go to this yard you pass through the scullery - I think nothing further passed at this time. In the course of the morning, having then no suspicion of him, I told him if he had not got another place, if it was any accommodation to him, he might continue to sleep on the premises as usual, and told him as I should be coming to town occasionally, and bring no servant, he would have an opportunity of earning a few shillings by cleaning my things, instead of strangers - he made no answer - I thought at the time it was a little foolish pride, and said "You have not got a place, have you?" he said  "No." - I said "Then I think you may as well stay and earn a few shillings;" he said "Yes." I examined the area door, and perceived no marks of violence at all - I found it closed, but not bolted. In the course of the day it was determined to search all the servants and their boxes - they all consented, and Gillmor and Dew, the officers, went with me to his room over the stables, where he slept with Griffiths - a box was searched, which he said was his, and in this was a few articles of clothes, and a small bag containing five sovereigns. I should have stated before, that I only thought the plate was gone - but after this I had occasion to go to a drawer in my dressing table, (about eight o'clock) - the officers came about half past seven o'clock - I first went into my dressing room about a quarter before seven, but did not suspect any thing then - I had undressed there the night before, and it appeared, in every respect, as I had left it the night before. About eight o'clock I went to the drawer, where I occasionally kept a few pounds. I found this drawer open - I don't know that it was locked over night - I believe it was not - I opened it, and found two common canvas bags gone; one had contained 43 l. or 48 l. consisting of 5 l. notes, and the rest in sovereigns. The dressing room is just at the top of the kitchen stairs, at the back of the dining room, not on the same floor as the kitchen: in the other bag there was five guineas, a half-sovereign, and some sovereigns, amounting altogether to about 10 l. - this was gone. I had left them there on the Friday preceding, and had not seen them since. When I left home on Sunday, I had occasion to open the only drawer in that table which I kept locked, and being rather hurried I left my keys in it, and when I returned on the Tuesday I asked him if he had not seen them - he said he had, and had given them, on the following day, to Mrs. Turton, who gave them to me. I had locked the drawer which contained the money, on Friday. When I missed the money, I found the drawer, in which I left the keys, locked, and all of them closed. The sovereigns, in the drawer, were of the coinage of 1817 and 1821. When the sovereigns were found in the prisoner's box, Gillmor said, "Where did you get these?" he answered, "Worked for them to be sure." He said "Who paid them to you," he answered, "Captain 
               <persName id="t18210912-108-person1189">Losant</persName>
            ." Gillmore said "What for?" he said, "For my wages." They then searched his breeches pocket, and found another sovereign, which he said he had worked for, and received that also in the same way. I said, "How much did Captain 
               <persName id="t18210912-108-person1190">Losant</persName>
             pay you?" he said, "About 7 l." that he had paid him in notes, but that Mr. Noell, Mr. Penny's butler, gave him sovereigns in exchange. I asked how many Noell gave him, he said "Five." Then said I, "How came you by the other?" he answered, "He did not know." We then proceeded to search some drawers in his bed-room, - he said they were his - that the clothes found in them were his. One of the drawers was locked. Gillmor said, "What drawer is this?" he said "Mine," - that he had lost the key a fortnight ago. Gillmor asked what was in it, he said, he did not know, there was not much; the same question was put, and he repeated it several times - the officers forced it open - there was some broken seals and other things, and a phosphorus box and matches. A brass candlestick stood on the drawers which were searched. Gillmor asked, "Who brought that up?" Griffiths, who had returned, said, that it had been there from the day before, and that the prisoner brought it up the night before, (on the Monday night), and that it had been there ever since. After some further search, we proceeded to examine the kitchen door again, and the drawer in which the prisoner said the plate was kept the night before. One of the officers said, "This drawer has been forced with a chisel." (Here the witness produced the drawer, and the upper part which the bolt of the lock entered). I examined it, and thought it corresponded with a chisel which had been in an open tool box of mine, which chest also contained a gimblet. I compared the chisel with the marks on the drawer in the prisoner's presence; it appeared that my chisel and gimblet had made the marks on the drawer. I pointed out a particular dent which corresponded - he said nothing. During the whole time the examination of the door and drawer were going on he made no observations. We then went to the door, here are the pieces of wood which filled up the hole in the door, the holes were tried with the gimblet and corresponded with the bore. These tools had not been used to my knowledge for some months, and in the pipe of the gimblet, which I took out of the chest, were some small particles of saw-dust, as if it had been just used. I shewed this to the officers in his presence. There was another hole inside<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120066"/>the door in a different part, which corresponded with the gimblet; and there was a similar puncture in another part of it, which corresponded with the point of the gimblet. He was asked whether he had locked the pantry door that night - he said he locked it and the door also, and took the keys up to bed with him. I examined the pantry door, and discovered no marks of violence, but did not examine it minutely. He said he had locked that door, and shewn the keys to

             that morning. Subsequent to this second conversation about the door, I examined the pantry door a third time, and found a small mark on the side of the door, about two inches above the lock, but there was not a dent so large as the dent in the drawer, it was, evidently, not large enough to have admitted the door to open, and the bolt of the lock of the door, which shuts into the wood, had not made the slightest mark on the door post, and it moves with considerable difficulty; for on trying it with a chisel, it snapped before I could move it at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. He came into your service in June from Captain 
               <persName id="t18210912-108-person1192">Losant</persName>
             - A. Yes: I had a most excellent character with him. He did not appear to have lived in London as a servant, but appeared to know London perfectly well. Griffiths has lived with me about a fortnight less than him; he came as a temporary servant. I took him without a character - he referred me to Lord Belfast, but I did not go.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the inside of the door, you will see a piece of wood split, has not that been done from without - A. Certainly: I believe most of it is done from without. I have only brought half the door here.</p>
               <p>Q. On the other half, was there not the mark of a crow bar outside - A. I think not - there was the mark of some instrument being applied outside, I think it was a poker, or something of the sort. The prisoner would have no occasion to go to the area: he slept at the back of the house - he had a key of the plate drawer. A picklock key would certainly open the pantry-door. Griffiths said in his presence that he assisted him to clean the plate, and that they counted it and locked it up; and he said Griffiths had assisted him that day as well as at other times. The chisel and gimblet are very common ones - my tool-chest is in my dressing room. I am certain the money was safe when I left the keys in the drawer. I dont think if Mrs. Turton had occasion for money she would go to the drawer - she had the keys, but did not know the money was kept there. I know Mr. Penny is in Somersetshire, and believe Noell is with him. I offered a reward of 40 l. for information to lead to the discovery of my property.</p>

            . I am house-maid to Mr. Turton - I was so on the 4th of August; in the evening the cook went to bed about half-past eleven o'clock, leaving me, and the groom, and the prisoner up; the groom went to bed about a quarter-past one o'clock, leaving the prisoner and myself up. About half-past one o'clock, I heard a noise at the kitchen door, as if something was boring into the door; the prisoner was sitting by me at the same time: I said,</p>
               <p>"I heard a noise;" he said "No, I dont think there is, it is only your fancy." I did not always set up so late, but my mistress was up till half-past eleven o'clock. Just after I heard the noise, I went into the housekeeper's room (which is on the same floor as master's dressing room), to fold up some linen which I had been ironing in the laundry; while I was there the prisoner came to me, this was a quarter to two, or two o'clock; he asked whether I was going to bed; I said yes, as soon as I have folded up my things: I went to bed just after it struck two o'clock, and left him down in the kitchen. When he left me he had a candlestick and the lamp of the drawing room; it was an iron candlestick like that produced, master has two of those candlesticks and three flat ones; there is one more besides that produced. After he left me I heard him go into the pantry or laundry, and then into the scullery, and heard the candlestick put down; there is a door at the top of the kitchen stairs, which I shut after the prisoner went down; when I went to shut it, I saw him standing at the bottom of the kitchen stairs, looking at me shutting the door; he was very near the pantry, and the pantry door was open, I cant say whether he shut it or not. I got up about a quarter before six o'clock in the morning, it was then light - the cook called me. I went down into the kitchen to see the confusion, as she said the house was robbed. After looking about, I went and called the prisoner; I called him three different times at the bottom of the stable stairs - he made no answer; I went up stairs and knocked at the door, he opened it, he was very near dressed; I said,</p>
               <p>"Somebody has broken into the house," he said, "Is there - it is impossible, for I have the keys of the pantry in my pocket;" he came down stairs into the pantry, I went in with him, he only looked and said nothing. I never heard him say any thing about the robbery. The pantry door was wide open when we went in. I told him he was to have called his master at half-past five, or a quarter to six o'clock, he said nothing. I recollect on the Saturday before the robbery, Mrs. Turton asking the prisoner to lend her a sovereign; he said he had not got one, or any silver. On Sunday afternoon I saw him putting on his boots, he asked me to lend him 3 or 4 s. I said I had no more than I wanted.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Had he any particular business to keep him up that night - A. I dont know that he had.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had a dinner party that day, and he had to get his things ready to go next day - A. Yes: when I went to call him Griffiths was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you only say somebody had broken into the house - A. Yes; I said, "and every bit of the plate is gone." And then he made that answer - I came down directly and he followed me.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mrs. Turton asked for a sovereign she wanted it immediately - A. Yes. I heard him put the candlestick down in the scullery, if any body broke in they could go to the scullery and get it.</p>

            . I am groom to Mr. Turton, and was so on the day of the robbery. The prisoner slept with me over the stable. I generally went into the house of a morning to brush my master's clothes, and the footman takes them up. On the 4th of September, I helped to carry up the dinner; six persons, besides my master and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120067"/>mistress, were there. I went to bed a quarter before one o'clock; the cook went a quarter before eleven o'clock. I helped the prisoner that day to wipe the plate up, which I had done before; it was finished about half-past 12 o'clock. When I went to bed I left him and Clench up. When he wiped the plate he counted it over, and there was a fork and spoon missing, he went and found them, and he put them in the drawer, locked it, and put the key in his pocket; the articles stated in the indictment were there. I went to bed at a quarter to one o'clock, and at two o'clock, as well as I can guess, he came into the room with a light, and I supposed he was coming to bed; I went to sleep and cannot say whether he came to bed or not, but I awoke about four o'clock as near as I can guess, and he was not in bed then. I was awoke at five o'clock by his coming into bed, he got on at the wrong side, for I had taken all the bed to myself in finding he was not coming. When he came it was day break - I said, "Why do you come to bed at this time of morning?" He said he had been in bed all night. I said that was wrong, for I had missed him at four o'clock, and asked him what brought him on my side of the bed - he made no answer. I am sure he was not in bed when I first awoke. Clench came and called him, he was up and dressed; she said, "William, the house is broken open, the pantry is opened, and all the plate is gone." He said, "Is it;" he said no more, but went down. I know he had a watch; I have not seen it since.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Sunday preceding did he say any thing to you about money - A. He asked me to lend him some, I said I had not much, and lent him 2 s.; he had borrowed 1 s. of me the day before and not paid it; he said he should have some money from his master soon and would pay me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know you went to bed at a quarter to one o'clock - A. I looked at the clock. I went to sleep in about five minutes - I only guess that I awoke at four o'clock, it might be a quarter past, I was rather sleepy; it was break of day at four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What in September - A. Yes; I was up at half-past four o'clock this morning and it was break of day then. I did not hear him say, when Clench came up, that it was impossible, for he had the key - I will not swear he did not say so; I was in the room and heard what passed. He went down immediately; I did not go down till master called me, about half-past six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not in a hurry - A. I had no suspicion whatever, I merely thought it a joke, I thought they were sweethearting.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray when did you first tell your master about the prisoner not coming to bed - A. I believe a day or two after, I cannot tell whether it was not six or seven days after, it was not the next day; I never told till I was asked about it.</p>
               <p>Q. You were out that day - A. Master sent me out about two or three o'clock, I dont know that I went out before, except to fetch the officers between seven and eight o'clock; I came back as soon as possible, I might be gone half an hour. I left word at the office for them to come directly, and master sent me again about a quarter to nine o'clock. I did not go out again till master sent me to Queen-square, Haymarket, in the afternoon; I was gone about two hours.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Where did your master send you first - A. To Queen-square, I went straight there and came straight back, and so I did when he sent me a second time.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to bed at a quarter before one o'clock - A. Yes, it was moonlight when I went to bed; the day broke about four; it had not broken when he came in the room with the candle, but when I awoke the second time, it was light enough for me to see that he was not in bed. When Clench came up, she went down before him and he after her.</p>
               <p>Q. When she said the house was broken open, you did not think it was - A. No; they had correspondence and loveship together, I thought it was a joke, and they were courting; I thought he had been sitting up with the girl, and did not suspect him.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. What was your reason for noticing the time the cook went to bed - A. I had no reason, I just looked at the clock when she fastened the doors. I am not generally in the house, only they had company and wanted me; I had assisted him once before.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen Square. I went to Mr. Turton's, on the 4th of September, with Dew, about 7 o'clock in the morning. Mr. Turton told me what had passed. We went into the area, and found no marks of violence on the area door. On the kitchen door we observed an instrument, apparently a gimblet, had been used, to make a hole large enough to put an arm through - the holes appeared to me to have been made on both sides. One hole inside was not drilled through, and the pieces of wood were picked up outside the door, so that they appeared to have been forced from inside, and to have fallen without. On going afterwards to the area steps, I saw marks of three footsteps, apparently from the same foot - two were on the side next the house, and the other as if the person had got over the area rails. A person could not get to the kitchen door without coming through the area door - the space between the doors is enclosed - the steps pointed as if they went from the house - there were two marks on Mr. Turton's side of the parapet - a small quantity of dirt stuck on the top of the rails, as if a person had put his foot up, and got over out of the area. I examined the pantry drawer, and then went to the prisoner's bed-room. I found a little cotton bag in his trunk, containing five sovereigns - I produced it, and on his person I found another sovereign - he said he got the five from a person he formerly lived servant with. He afterward said, he exchanged the notes with a butler for them, and he had had the one some time. He said he had lost the key of his drawer, Dew broke it open, and found a phosphorus box with matches in it. I compared the drawer with the chisel which Mr. Turton brought down - it appeared to have been done with a chisel of this size, and the gimblet fitted the holes in the door. I rather think, by the footmarks, that the person had small nails in his shoes.</p>
               <p>JURY to Mr. Turton. Q. The chisel is now broken, was it in that state when you last saw it. A. It was not, for I had my tools all done up, and had not used it for nine months - they were open to every body. A person climbing over the rails, could not get between the area and kitchen door, it is enclosed - the candlestick was found within the enclosure. If any one was concealed in the cellar, they could unbolt the area door and go out, and if they wished to go into the kitchen, they must break the kitchen door open. There certainly was an appearance of somebody having been concealed in the cellar. A hamper stood open in the middle, and the dirt appeared to be moved, as if somebody had been there.</p>

            . I am an officer, I went with Gillmor to examine Mr. Turton's premises, and saw the chisel applied to the drawer, and the gimblet to the door. I should consider that they had been forced from the inside, from the directions in which I found them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If a person outside bored two or three holes, they could put their fingers in and pull a piece out. - A. They might after getting the first piece out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. All I have to say is, that Griffiths is false in saying I was not in bed at 4 o'clock. I went to bed at 2 o'clock as near as I can imagine, and from then till about five o'clock was not out of bed. I never awoke till five o'clock, and then he awoke me by throwing his arms across the bed. I then looked at his watch, and said, "Dear me, it is half past 6 o'clock," he said his watch was an hour too fast. I got up, and Clench came and said the house was broken open and the plate gone. I said, "How could that be when I had the key in my pocket;" which I believe I shewed her.</p>

            . ESQ. I live in Chester-street, Grosvenor-place, the prisoner was in my service from the latter end of June until September; he was to leave me on this day. In consequence of certain suspicions, I ordered Gillmor and Dew to search his person and boxes; we searched him in his bed room, and in his waistcoat pockets we found four mother-of-pearl counters, which I immediately knew to be my property. I said,</p>
               <p>"William, how came you by these?" - He said, they came down on the tray one night about three weeks ago. I said that was impossible;</p>
               <p>"for we have not played at cards since you lived with us." He said,</p>
               <p>"I know you have not." - We searched his boxes and drawers, and found very little linen there. I asked him where his linen was - he said in the laundry; we then went towards the laundry, but I went into the kitchen with Gillmor, and Mrs. Turton was there; the prisoner went with Dew into the laundry. We had not been there many seconds before I heard Dew call out, "Gillmor, come along, he is making away with something." - On which I immediately went in, and saw Dew and the prisoner standing by one of the dressers in the laundry; there were three bundles before him; Dew was untying one, and the prisoner just as I went in undid the knot of another, and Gillmor laid hold of it. He was asked who these bundles belonged to - He said they were his, they contained linen of his with his name at full length on them. When I saw him untying the bundle, I said, "What are you about, William?" He said, only shewing the officers the things. I said, "Let them alone, and let the officers search themselves." The officers proceeded to search it, and in it they found folded and rolled up in a paper parcel, three pair of stockings and a pair of gloves, all of which I knew to be mine. I said, "William, how came these here?" - He said, "I brought them down when I unpacked your gig seat the last time we went out;" he afterwards said, the last time but one. I said, "Were not these with the other things?" He said, "Yes, they were." - I said,"Then how came you by these down here when you put the others by?" His answer, I think was, "I brought them down because I was going away." Captain 
               <persName id="t18210912-108-person1203">Gambier</persName>
            , who was present, said, "If you were going away, you had no occasion to bring them here." He made no answer. - I should say, he had been in the habit of unpacking my things when I came from the country, but on these occasions I always gave him the key of the place they were in, and the key of my wardrobe, desiring him to put them by, and return me the key; and on the occasion spoken of, I had no stockings in my gig seat; for I had come to town from Croydon assizes, it was on that day week, the officers proceeded further in the search, and pulled out two dinner napkins from the same bundle in a dirty state. I said, "Halloa! what is this?" He said, "These are some of the dinner napkins in common use." I asked him what business they had in his bundle? - he said he put them there by mistake. Mrs. Turton said, "William, that is very odd; for I asked you this morning if you had any more napkins, and told you that five were missing." - He made no answer. Captain 
               <persName id="t18210912-108-person1204">Gambier</persName>
             then searched his great coat pocket, which hung up, and pulling a pair of my kid gloves out which had been worn, he said, "Whose are these?" He said, "I dont know." - I said, "Why this is another pair of my gloves." - He said nothing. This is the second pair that were found. The first pair I can swear to as mine. I cannot swear with certainty to those found in the coat, as they are soiled, the others have never been worn. I had eight or ten pair in my wardrobe, and can tell them from the make and texture - the stockings and napkins are mine. Mrs. Turton, Captain

            , and the two officers were present at the search, but only the officers were present at this time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He was about to leave your service that day? A. Yes; he was to have left at twelve o'clock, his linen was all tied up in bundles apparently ready to be taken away with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have not the least doubt but that the property was taken at different times? - A. I have no reason to suppose they were; most probably they were not taken all at once. I had had some friends the day before, he did not have a good deal to do, we had a mere family dinner. I searched his bundles at three o'clock in the afternoon; there had been an alarm in the house in the morning, and I had sent for the officers; he knew they were coming, but not that a search was to be made. I staid in the kitchen till they came in the morning to look at the premises; I dont think he knew they were coming in the afternoon. I dont think he had an opportunity of moving goods<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120069"/>without much hazard, for the laundry is much frequented by the servants. He had no business to touch the stockings. I do not wash at home; nobody but the housekeeper has any business with them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you ever given him stockings? - A. I never gave him a pair, nor allowed him to take them; they are what I was wearing; all he had to do with my things was to put them in the wardrobe.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have some recollection of the things being brought down either in master's trunk or gig seat. I have unpacked his trunk and brought things down in the laundry to go away, and they were put in a drawer where table cloths and napkins are kept; I saw no more of them till this morning, when I found them wrapped in paper. I put them on the table, intending to take them up, but in the hurry forgot it. I never put them in the bundle, nor were they ever in it; the officer scattered the things over them, and said he found them in the bundle.</p>

            . I am watch-house keeper. About half-past four o'clock on the morning of the 7th, Clunes called me up. I went to Carmarthen-street, and he drove the four pigs and a sow to the watch-house, and about half-past ten o'clock that morning, the prisoner came and claimed them. I asked him about them; he said his father bought them at Barnet - he was permitted to go at large - the prosecutor saw and claimed them. I afterwards went and took the prisoner in Euston-square. I went up to him, and asked, when he wanted to fetch the pigs; he said directly, and went with me. I asked what they cost, he said 4 l. or four guineas. When he got into the next street, he ran away - I ran and secured him.</p>

            , she is five years old. On the 21st of August, about nine o'clock at night, she was sitting on the step of the door, I heard a person come by and say, "Ah, my little dear," and the child said, "Ah;" she said, "Will you go along with me and buy some nice cakes?" the child said, Yes, but she would go and ask her mother first. She came in and asked me if she might go with the lady; I said, what lady; she said, a lady who I did not know, but it was a lady in a white shawl who would buy her some nice cakes;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120071"/>I said No, she should not go, if she did I would whip her; the child ran out, and I heard her say, she must not go; but what more was said I do not know; the child ran in to me and cried, and said, "Do let me go, she will buy me such nice cakes;" I forbid her going again. A person came in who took off my attention. The child ran out again, and I heard her say, "I must not go." I heard no more till I heard the child and somebody going out of the Rents, I sent a girl after her, before she could have got out of the Rents, as I missed her. A little girl came in and gave me information; I ran out and met a gentleman at the end of the Rents with the child, and found the prisoner at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What time passed between your missing the child and meeting the gentleman with it - A. Not more than twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You heard a person wishing the child to go with her and she would give her some cakes - A. Yes; I will not swear the person heard me refuse her. I had a glimpse of her - I think she must have heard it. The Rents are a great thoroughfare. A little girl, about eight years old, sat at the door with my child. The prisoner said nothing in my presence about her wanting to send the child to some chambers. The child was dressed in the clothes stated in the indictment.</p>
               <p>PHILIP ERSWELL. I am a glass dealer, and live in Chancery-lane. On the 21st of August, a little before nine o'clock in the evening, I was nearly opposite Symond's Inn, in Chancery-lane, I saw the prisoner there going down with a child on each side of her, walking, she had not got hold of their hands then; I heard her say she would buy them some cakes - she was walking as from Mrs. King's, she asked King's child how her sister Sally did, she said she had no sister Sally; she then hurried up Carey-street, and Bell-yard - I kept following her. I saw Kearney, the beadle, told him my suspicions - he went and took her in my presence; I went and found the mother.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear her state she intended to send the child to Symond's Inn - A. No.</p>

            . I am beadle of the Rolls liberty. About half-past eight o'clock, Erswell gave me information. I saw the prisoner about the middle of Bell-yard, walking very fast with two children, I ran down and overtook her about the middle of Bell-yard, near Fleet-street, and asked where she was going with them; she said to Surry-street; I asked if the children were her's, or did she live there; she said something in a very great fright, I could not understand what it was; I laid hold of her, she had a doll in her arm which she gave the child, and flew from me in a moment when I said I would take her to the watch-house; two witnesses came and assisted in securing her. I took her to the watch-house - she said there that she did not intend to do the children any harm. She wanted to send them on an errand; I asked where - she said, to a gentleman in Symond's Inn; I asked why she did not go into Symond's Inn, for she had passed it, and asked why, she said she was going to Surry-street, she said to buy cakes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then she said she passed Symond's Inn, for the purpose of buying cakes - A. She said she was going to buy cakes in Surry-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. They were playing about, I asked them to go to Symond-inn and did not do them any harm, the biggest child, took me down the place to buy cakes, instead of me taking them. I did not think it any harm to send them where I had sent different children before. I told the man I had been in company with people in Surry-street, and he said I said I was going to take the children there. At the first hearing, the child was brought full dressed, and at the second hearing, it was brought meanly dressed, as I first saw it.</p>

I had a tin box, containing one 50 l.; one 20 l.; five 10 l., and one 5 l., notes, five guineas, one of which was Queen Ann's, two 7 s., pieces and some silver, and two promisary notes, one for 1500 l., and the other for 750 l.; I left the box locked, in the bed-room cupboard, where I always keep it, the box was also locked, and I had the key with me, and the key of my bed room also. I came home between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, went up stairs to unlock the doors, but found them forced open, the cupboard door was also broken open, and the cash-box gone, the doors had been forced open by some sort of a chisel, there was some blood on a cupboard door, were there was two silver spoons, which spoons were also gone, and there was some blood on the dressing table cloth, in the bed-room. I have recovered none of my property. My cash box has been produced to me by the officers.

At this time, I lived in Wright's-passage, Tothill-street; I remember Fairlop-fair, it was the first Friday in July - I know the prisoners and know Mrs. Garton; I saw her on that day about half-past three o'clock, going into Nightingale's house with another woman; they went in at the back door, there is a gateway leading into the yard - I was at work in the yard in a shed; there is a dog that lets nobody in, but those he knows - as soon as the two women came into the yard, he knew Mrs. Garton, he got up, and she held him while the other woman went into the house and she followed - a few minutes after that a boy came for me to get some mortar, and as I was going for it, I met the prisoner Garton at the Bricklayer's Arms, the corner of Stretton-ground, about 200 yards from the house; I saw him afterwards in Orchard-street, which is farther off; he was then going into Stretton-ground, walking in a hurry, or running - it was about ten minutes before five o'clock, as I heard the clock strike when I got to Nightingale's - I do not know whether he was going towards the house or from it.</p>

               <p>Q. While these women were there, did any knock come at the front door - A. Yes; Mrs. Garton went up, I followed her, and saw it was a man, who said he was Mrs. Topp's doctor - I had never seen him before; I heard no other knock at the door; when the women were gone, I went up stairs, and found the front door open.</p>
               <p>Q. While Thurston, Darvell, and the boy Nightingale were at dinner, were they out of your sight - A. No; they could not have gone to Topp's room then, without my knowing it. Thurston came at four o'clock to tea, and staid a quarter of an hour, or rather better; he had tea in the kitchen with Darvell and Nightingale, they came and went away together. Between seven and eight o'clock, Thurston came again for the key of his room; Mrs. Topp and Mrs. Nightingale came home about twelve o'clock - I then left, and did not know of any thing wrong; Mr. Topp and Nightingale came home about half an hour after.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Thurston was in want of money - A. I do not know, he had money of me that week, he had given me a sovereign to keep, and he had it of me; I do not know whether I had more money of his.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. He came to dinner and tea, and stopped in the kitchen with you till he went - A. Yes; they came and went away together. I have seen a man named Holland, it was not him that I saw at the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. These women came and staid about three quarters of an hour - A. Yes; I was in the kitchen all that time, except when I went to the door, and was absent then a very short time, not five minutes - she gave an answer to the man, and I came down.</p>
               <p>Q. In that time, Jarvis might have gone up stairs, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120073"/>pass you, without your knowing it - A. I do not think she could, for we were on the landing place; and when I went into the kitchen, I found her there - I went to the door as quick as usual, and returned; the doctor merely asked if Mrs. Topp was at home, Mrs. Garton said</p>
               <p>"No; she was gone out." He said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, then, she is better", and left, I believe, for I went down and left her to shut the door - she was not long before she came into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. When the women went away, did you accompany them up stairs - A. No; Mrs. Garton was in the habit of coming to the house, and knew the way as well as I did; she went out at the front door, whether she left it open or not, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was it possible for Jarvis to go up to the room while you were answering the doctor, without your seeing her - A. No; for she must pass close by me.</p>

            . I am a single woman, and live in Orchard-street, Westminster. I take in washing and go out charing. Between two and three o'clock on the day of Fairlop fair I saw Mrs. Garton, she took me to Nightingale's house, we went in at the back door, there was a large black dog in the yard, I was frightened at it, she went in first, it let her pass, and she held it while I came in; old Mrs. Nightingale was on the kitchen stairs and asked us down, we went down, nobody else was in the kitchen, we were there about three quarters of an hour, a knock came at the door, in about half an hour Mrs. Garton went up first and the old lady after her. I heard nothing that passed at the door, they were not gone above two minutes, and came down one after the other; when we left we came out at the front door, I went out first and she after me, I do not know whether she shut the door or not. We went to my place in Orchard-street, and staid at my door together, and while we were there I saw the prisoner Garton running up Orchard-street, towards my door, he beckoned to her with his hand, and using a bad expression desired her to make haste over to him, he seemed agitated, she went to him, I saw her give him something out of her pocket, what it was I do not know, she came back to me immediately, and went up stairs with me and staid about ten minutes. She looked out of window, saw some person in the street and left. I did not see Garton again that evening. I was taken out of bed the next day, and taken to prison. Mrs. Garton was also taken up, we were sent to the same prison, but kept separate. While I was there, on the Thursday week after I first went, Garton came to me in prison, I had not sent for him, he put his hand through a small hole to shake hands with me, and asked me how I did. I said I was very indifferent, and he knew very well that I was perfectly innocent of what I was there for, and it was a pity that I should stay there innocently; he said he knew I was innocent, and said he was the man who robbed Mr. Topp, and that Thurston was in the kitchen, keeping old Mrs. Nightingale in conversation while he (Garton) broke open the place, he said he broke open a one pair of stairs front room door, and a one pair of stairs back room door, and that back room was a bed-room, that he broke open a closet in that bed room, and in that closet was a tin box, he took the tin box out of the closet, laid it on the bed, and in breaking open the box he cut one of his fingers, he held up one of his fingers which was cut across; I saw that it was cut; he said that when he opened the box, he took out a 50 l. note, a 20 l. note, and five 10 l. notes, some guineas, among which was a Queen Ann's guinea, and some promissory notes, and one silver spoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he took the spoon out of the box or cupboard - A. I do not know which. He said he changed the notes and got sovereigns for them of a Jew in Whitechapel, and lost two hog in the pound in changing them. He did not say how many sovereigns he got. He said he broke all the the three doors open with a crow-bar, and that he threw the box away, he did not say where; he said he threw the crow-bar away in the Willow-walk. He called for a pot of porter, gave me some and took the rest away. I saw no more of him. I was discharged on the Saturday following, and have been out of custody ever since.</p>

I do not know that she cohabits with him. I never heard her say that if she could get her husband convicted and sent to Botany Bay she would marry him. I have seen them together at the public-house, not in a private room. Garton's wife was discharged when I was, and was afterwards taken into custody to be a witness. I never moved from my chair while the old lady was up stairs. I never saw the box. He only told me once about it. I remember the amount of the notes and all about it.</p>

I did not go near enough to hear what Garton said to his wife. It was between four and five o'clock, about the time for tea; she said she gave him the key. I never saw Holland in custody on this charge. I did not see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120074"/>Garton there when I was examined, only me and his wife were put to the bar.</p>

He mentioned promissory notes, those were his very words. Perhaps half a dozen women were in the same place talking to their friends; the grating is about a yard and a quarter long, if they paid attention they might hear what he said. I stood at the end of the grating on one side. I went and told Topp of it on the Saturday, after I was liberated, and told the Justice.

I immediately seized it, and in that hand I found in a little leather bag sixteen sovereigns, and a gold chased ring and in his fob a silver watch, two gold seals, a gold key, and metal chain. On the 1st of August, I went to Brown's-gardens to look for the box, and found it down a privy. Topp claimed it. I searched in Willow-walk, but could not find the crow bar.

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 24th of August between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I apprehended Amos at a house in Colvill-court, Charlotte-street, and asked her for the duplicates of the things she had pawned that day; she said she had none, but would give me some of things she had pawned on a former occasion. She was the only person in the room, and in the table drawer I found two caps, and under the bed, concealed behind a box, were a gown, a spencer, and a handkerchief. I then searched her person, and from under her stays, after great resistance, I found a pocket concealed, containing three duplicates, and then found another duplicate in the drawer. Wood claimed the things in pawn. Next morning I took Jones in Church-street, St. Giles's; she said she was at Amos's when she brought some things, but she knew nothing of them.</p>

            . I lodge in the kitchen of George Housham's house. On the 12th of August at the six o'clock in the morning I saw my things safe. I went to the Angel, public-house, and returned about half-past six o'clock. The prisoner and another woman followed me out of the Angel, public-house, and asked me for something to drink. I gave them a glass of liquor, they went home with me and staid about an hour. I fell asleep. I was not sober. My landlord awoke me and said I had been robbed. The women were then gone and the property. Between eight and nine that morning, the prisoner passed the door and I took her, only three shillings were found on her.</p>

            . This house is mine. I heard somebody talking in the kitchen, and soon after the prisoner came out with a pint pot, an Italian iron, and a saucepan in her hand. I found another woman below, the prisoner came back with some liquor, but without the saucepan or iron; she stopped about twenty minutes then came up with a paper box. I ran after her and said, that is not your's; she said, it was not mine. I went down and found Crook fast asleep with the woman, and told him he was robbed; he came a little to himself at last, and said they had left him nothing but one penny. In about half an hour the prisoner came by and he took her.</p>

On the 15th of August, about twelve o'clock, the prisoner came in, sat in the tap-room and had some beer; she went backwards three or four times in the course of half an hour, which rose my suspicion - these things were in a tub wet. I went backward and saw her standing by the tub, taking a wet stocking to wipe her face - she had no business there. I went to call my wife to see if any thing was missing, she followed me out and sat in the tap-room - my wife missed the things and sent for an officer, who came; she then confessed to taking them, and begged for mercy. She did not hear me speak to my wife.</p>

            . I am an officer of Mile-end. On the 19th of August, I met the prisoner in Mile-end-road with a bundle, and asked what he had got in it, he said, some things which he had brought from Colchester. I asked who from, he said from a friend, and was going to take them to his sister at Limehouse. I said he was going a direct line from there, and asked what was in the bundle, he said there was a curtain, and he could not tell the rest exactly. I secured him, and found out the prosecutor - he was three miles from Stratford.</p>

I sent my man up one street, I went round another way and secured them. Stephens had a bag with the beef and suet in it. I asked where they got it, they said nothing, and we took them to the office - they were in company.</p>

            . I work at upholstery work. I was near Angel-alley, and saw the prisoner and two others standing at the corner of George-yard, about twenty yards from Angel-alley; they passed me all of a sudden, and a little further on, one of them snatched the ridicule from this lady, and ran up the alley. I am sure they were all in company together. The prisoner did not snatch it, but he was in company with them, and was the second that run up the alley; the third stood at the end of the alley, as if to bid defiance to any one who went up - I am certain of the prisoner. I met the officers and described him; he was taken in ten minutes - he was then warm as if he had been running.</p>

            . I am a newsman. I was in the Curtain-road, about 200 yards from this stand, about half-past ten o'clock, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I went up, and saw a mob round the prisoner; he threw down this basket, and the plumbs fell out - they were dark plumbs. He said, he would be taken by no man, and used very bad expressions; he then went and laid himself down at a door in Holywell-lane, and with great difficulty I got him to the office. He said I could not hang him, but only send him back to where he came from, and he wished he had a knife to stick into our eyes.</p>

I think he must have heard the cry - I pursued, calling Stop thief! then a watchman came up and threw him down; some shillings and sixpences fell from him, I should think eight or nine shillings. Hughes came up almost directly, caught hold of him, and said, "You have robbed me," I believe he denied it.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to see the Abbey. He charged me with picking his pocket; I took out my money and shewed it to him, to see it was not his. He said, if I gave him the money back he would not wish to hurt me.</p>

Among this copper was 2 s., I I gave them the copper with a view of getting rid of them, I took the silver from the copper, and kept it in my hand, and was going away, Mascoe held my coat, I turned round and said "Let my coat go" - a severe bow came from some of the party, at the side of my heard. I had done nothing to provoke them, nor said anything, it was a tall boy who struck me, it knocked me down - I got up and another struck me over the eye, with a mop stick, with a nail at the end of it, it nearly cut my eye open, I put my hand up to my eye, and then they all went off in different directions. I lost the money in the scuffle, when I was knocked down, I dropped it, and never saw it after, I did not look for it.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say then that the money ever came into their posession - A. No; I did not look to see if it was left, for I could not see for the blood. They did not attempt to open my hand. Mascoe was taken ten minutes after, and Shirley next day. I never saw either of them before, nor have I seen the money. Joshua Roberts is the boy who struck me, and asked me for the copper.</p>

I was going through Orchard-street, about four o'clock on the 15th of July with Ward, I had seen a quantity of boys before this, they had followed me to the watch-house, the prisoners were among them - that was before this affair. I apprehended Mascoe afterwards on the spot or within five yards of it, I said, I took him for robbing a man, he said he knew nothing of it. I found no silver on him. I took Shirley on the Tuesday, and told him, I took him for robbing Abel, he denied it, and said he was at some distance from the place, but afterwards he said he was there, but had nothing to do with it.</p>

I went to take a walk on this day, and was coming back into Orchard-street, between three and four o'clock, and saw the prosecutor and four boys tussling in a row; he was very much intoxicated; there were only four boys together, others were about.</p>
               <p>Q. Take care what you say, there are more persons to speak to the prosecutor's state than himself. You saw four boys - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your husband coachman to a gentleman - A. No; he is a post-boy, he goes out with coaches at times, he now drives a post-chaise. I only saw four boys together at play. I saw the prosecutor have hold of Josuah Roberts's coat who I knew by sight, I have seen him since but not for three weeks. The prosecutor was very much intoxicated, I think he did not know what he was about. He gave himself a fling, and Roberts threw him down and Roberts fell with him.

Shirley was on the other side of the road looking on. I did not interfere. I could not get to him for he was very drunk. I did not speak to the boys.

I left as soon as the row was over, and did not see the officers come up. I went to Queen's-square on the Monday, and told the Magistrate what I knew, he said I was to come at the next hearing; I went and was not admitted.</p>

            . I live at No. 27, Duck-lane. On the 15th of July, on St. Swithin's day, Sunday, between three and four o'clock, I saw the prosecutor turn the end of Duck-lane and four boys with him, he turned out of Orchard-street to go into Duck-lane, and got about the space of one door in Duck-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Which is widest Duck-lane, or Orchard-street - A. Orchard-street. This happened in Duck-lane. I was looking out of my room window. The four boys were Roberts, Barney, Hunt and Yates.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120081"/>Q.You saw no other boys - A. I saw the prisoner standing on the opposite side of the way, in Duck-lane, the prosecutor had hold of Joshna Roberts's coat, they were only a few doors from me; I was looking out of a one pair of stairs window, and could see what passed in Orchard-street; I had been looking out of the window ten minutes, and saw them in Orchard-street - I saw them turn into Duck-lane, Roberts gave himself a turn round, and struck the prosecutor on the breast, and as the prosecutor fell, his hat fell off, he was very much intoxicated, he staggered very much in Orchard-street; he stopped to pick his hat up, Barney stood along side of him with a broomstick, and cut him about the eye; I saw the blood trickle down his face directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Any body there must have seen it, I suppose - A. Yes; Mrs. Wright lives in the neighbourhood, I did not see her there; Shirley stood on the opposite side of Duck-lane. If Wright had stood there too, I must have seen her; I think I saw her at Queen-square next day - I know Mascoe, I did not see him there, I saw none but the four boys; Shirley was there.</p>
               <p>Q. How many boys did you see then - A. Some boys ran when they heard the skirmish.</p>
               <p>Q. What skirmish - A. Why the prosecutor crying out, he d - d and swore about the boys, he did not say he had lost any thing. This passed in Duck-lane, I did not see the prosecutor give the boys any money; I did not go down to enquire what was the matter, nor speak to the boys.</p>

On the 22d of February, about nine o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner go into my malting door, I never saw him before; thinking he wanted me, I opened my door and went out; he said, "I understand you have some malt to sell;" I said, "Very little, my stock is short"; he said, "I was informed you had a great deal to sell. I come from Messrs. Cavey and Killing, you know them" (one of them is a maltster in the neighbourhood); I said, "I know them very well, but I have very little malt to sell, what I have I will shew you; will you walk in and take breakfast." He breakfasted with me - he said, "You do not know me, I am doing business for Thatchell and Rowell, of Winsley-street, near the Pantheon, Oxford-street, brewers;" I knew them to be brewers. I shewed him the malt, and said I had not many to spare, but if they liked them, as my house was in full work, I could soon make them; he said, "I want sixty quarters, and if my employers approve of them when they come in, we will make it two hundred;" he said, I understand the nature of malting, I have been in that line myself, and yours are just such malts as we want to make our stock beer; I asked him 64 s. a quarter; he said, "That is rather too much, as I want them for ready money." I do not know whether you know my employers' manner of business, but we do not ask credit of any man." I said, to be sure ready money was an object, and I would take off 1 s. a quarter; we finally agreed that 63 s. a quarter should be the price for sixty quarters. They were to be delivered in scores; he was anxious to have the first delivery as early as he could, as he said the time of year for making stock beer was spending fast. This was Tuesday, I said it would not be possible to send them next day, as they would require some getting ready, and agreed to send them on Thursday to Thatchell and Rowell; he said "You need not trouble yourself to come up, if you send a bill and receipt by the waggoner, it will be the same thing as if you came for the money." I, not knowing any thing of the parties, replied, that I was going as far as Greenwich that morning, and would tide up and receive the money, which was to be sixty guineas; he went with me into the counting-house, and I took down, from his mouth, the address of the persons they were going to, "Messrs. Thatchell and Rowell, Winsley-street, near Oxford-street." He left, I do not believe that I asked his name - I dealt with him from his own expression of his employers, we alluding to Thatchell and Co. I had the malt made ready and sent it on Thurday morning by my waggoner, and told him to take them to Thatchell and Co.'s, and not to get there till nine in the morning, when I would be there and see them all measured myself. When I got there I found neither the malt or waggon; I saw Mr. Rowell, he said he knew nothing of the transaction. I suspected there was some trick - I did not find my waggon till I got home. I immediately commenced a search for the prisoner, but could not find him till three weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You found where the malt was - I found it at Holmes's brew-house, near the Yorkshire Stingo, at Paddington. The money has been offered me since he has been in custody; a man, who came with a letter from the officer, offered it to me, and it was offered again at Marlborough-street. I would not have taken it if I had not been advised not; the Magistrate did not advise me to take it - he advised the man to put the money up, and say no more about it. It was not tendered to me; the prisoner mentioned Thatchell and Co., when he first looked at the malt, I did not treat with him on his own account, but as their agent; I should not have looked to him for the money, if they had failed.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you brought an action against Holmes for the money - A. No; I have demanded the money several times from him.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you know his name, or any thing about him - A. No; I took down Thatchell and Co. and considered them as the buyers - the money was offered three weeks ago.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have clerks - A. Two; named Bewsher and Miell. No malt was offered me, at this time I had a good supply; if I wanted any, I should have applied myself.</p>
               <p>MR. ROWELL. In February, I was in partnership with Mr. Thatchell. The prisoner was never employed to do any thing for our house. I have seen him once before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where - A. At our counting-house. It was not to offer malt, I know nothing of any proposal being made to send me sixty quarters about this time.</p>

I had known the prisoner three or four years; I met her in Old-street, she asked me to give her a cup of tea - she came up, and had tea with me that afternoon, and came and drank tea with me regularly every day for a fortnight, and on this day fortnight she came up, I was washing - she was backwards and forwards all day, I was busy, I let her do as she liked; she brought a bundle in with her, and said she was going to take it to the washerwoman's in Gee-street, she put it in a chair close by the trunk; I went to the trunk, pulled out the coat and waistcoat, and threw them over my arm - she saw me put them back into the trunk. I turned my back to her, and went on washing; she went out of the room shortly after, and said she would return in half an hour. I looked out of the window, and saw that her bundle looked much larger than when she brought it in; I turned to the trunk, missed these things and my apron. I was never out of the room. She had the apron on when she came to the office. She is an unfortunate girl. My husband keeps me.</p>

A man came in at the back door, and in a few minutes I heard a noise over the kitchen, I went up into the bed-room, saw no one, and came down again, and in a few minutes heard somebody coming down stairs. I stopped down in the passage, a man came to the bottom of the stairs, went out at the back door, and went towards New Brentford - he held his face down so low. I could not see his features - my husband gave an alarm, I went up and found my brother-in-law's box broken open - the prisoner was in the house that afternoon, but I will not swear he is the one I saw come down stairs.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On Monday, the 10th of September, at half past one o'clock at night I was on duty in Leicester-place, and met the prisoner carrying this lead tied in an old apron and an old handkerchief. I asked what he had there. He said a parcel which a gentleman gave him sixpence to carry for him to a coffee shop in Crown-street, Soho. I said, "I must take it and you to the watch-house." - He said the gentleman was coming behind. I said I would leave word with the rest of the watchman to tell him where he was gone. Next day I took the lead to Mr. Woods, it tallied and fitted with two pieces the plumber shewed me.</p>

I found a sovereign, three half-crowns, 1 s. 6 d. and 13 d. in copper, on Sullivan; she said she took the sovereign of a captain at Blackwall-stairs for cherries. Bryan said, "If you have got the money and know it is the man's why not give it him." I only found 2 1/2 d. on her. I locked them up. Bryan then said she took the money from the man and gave it to Sullivan; she called to me on purpose to tell me.</p>

I arrived here the day after the coronation. On Saturday night the 4th of August, I spent the evening with a friend in James Street, near Buckingham House. I passed through Buckingham Gate on my way to Park-lane, and went up <placeName id="t18210912-162-crimeloc947">Constitution-hill</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18210912-162-crimeloc947" type="placeName" value="Constitution-hill"/>

The other said, "No." I went past; I heard one say, "He will do as well" - this was the stout man (the prisoner). I suspected they had some ill intention, and turned round; I began to walk quicker, and as I looked round I saw one of them coming after me; the other said, "Shall I go with you?" He said, "No; I can do it myself." I walked about twenty yards further on, when he overtook me, and asked why I walked so fast; he walked up quite close to me: I said I was afraid the gate would be shut, "It is almost ten o'clock, dont you think it is?" While this was going on we were walking together He said, "No, it is of no consequence, you will not go through that gate to night." I said, "Why so - is it locked?" he immediately caught hold of my arm, and said, "The short and long of it is this; I am a poor man out of employ, and you are a gentleman, and unless you give me 2 l. immediately, d - n my eye, if I wont knock your brains out immediately." I said, "what do you mean, who are you that you get your living in this way." He immediately gave me a blow under the right ear with his fist, and I ran out to the carriage way. I run round and took my purse out of my pocket, and put it inside my neckhandkerchief, and pushed my hat up from my forehead; I ran round and gave him a blow and knocked him down; he immediately got up and came to me again, and I again knocked him down, and waited for him on the footpath.</p>
               <p>Q. You knocked him down twice, and waited for him to come up again? - A. Yes: he immediately got up, and came and struck at me several times, but I always guarded him off.</p>
               <p>Q. So that he did not hit you? - After that, we were fighting together for nearly a quarter of an hour, I believe; he beat me severely about the body, but always guarded my face. I fought at least for three quarters of an hour with one and the other (there were two of them -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120089"/>one escaped); he then gave me a blow and nearly knocked me down; I ran furiously at him -</p>
               <p>Q. You ran up furiously to him, is this correct? - A. Yes: and knocked him down; when he fell, he cried out "Bill, d - n you, where are you, he is doing me." Bill came up with his fists prepared to hit me, and I knocked Bill down as soon as he came up; Bill immediately got up again, and I again knocked him down: the other remained down on the road, while Bill was knocked down twice on the footway: they were both down. Both of them immediately got up; I was much exhausted, and both of them ran to me at once and knocked me down. I dont know which got me down, they were both over me. I found the two hands of one, or both of them in my pantaloon pockets; they rifled my pockets; I lost all recollection of where my purse was, (being engaged with them so long;) they tore open my coat, and dragged open my bosom, and tore my shirt, which I have now; they searched all over my body; one said to the other "You know he had it, you have got it I am sure." The other said, "I am d - d if I have got it - it is a d - d lie, I have not got it, but you have, for you know he had it." While I was down, and before I was down, I was crying out murder and robbery all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What all the three quarters of an hour. - A. Yes. - not three quarters of an hour. It was when the second came at me, I did not cry till Bill came up - it was about a quarter to ten o'clock when it commenced.</p>
               <p>Q. What next happened. - A. I heard footsteps of a third person, and did not know but it was another ruffian coming to their assistance. As soon as he came within six yards of me they stopped, and Bill got off me, and gave me a blow with the heel of his shoe, stamping, which has rendered me lame ever since, and ran away. The third person came up and said, "For God's sake don't kill that person," and when I heard it was somebody for my protection it gave me fresh courage. I immediately caught hold of him by the cravat - he endeavoured to get loose, but I would not let him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the prisoner. - A. It was, my Lord. I held him fast, and with the person's assistance, dragged him to the gate, and found the porter at the lodge, and asked why he did not come to my assistance when he heard me cry so long - he said he had told the watchman of it, who refused going. I went up to the ruffian again, and he gave me a blow. I dragged him through the crowd. A hackney coachman came up, and said, "Stick to the ruffian, I know there are two of them there nightly." I said, "Don't be afraid, I'll take care of him." I dragged him through the turnpike, and met the watchman, who refused taking him in charge. I dragged him again through the crowd, and found an officer, who immediately took him to Mount-street watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You did not say where you lived. - A. At 26, Upper Titchfield-street, Cavendish-square. I lived there on the 4th of August. I was going to the washerwoman in Park-lane, to tell her to send my things home. I went to James-street at half-past six o'clock, and left a quarter to ten. I had been in Italy six years and a half. I first lived with the Marquis's father, and then with his son. Before I went to Italy I lived with Earls Bridgwater and Paulet.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you crying robbery and murder. - A. Above twenty-five minutes - it was as soon as Bill came up. I cried as loud as I could. I think I was not above fifty yards from Piccadilly gate. I could see the lamps in Piccadilly very well - people who passed the rails must have heard my cries. I don't think I could be heard in the Mall. I believe it was after ten o'clock when I began hallooing, for the first was engaged with me nearly half an hour. I did not halloo while the first man only was with me, as I could manage him very well. I have a witness here, his name is John something - he is a boy about sixteen or seventeen.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have you seen him since this affair? A. At Bow-street, and here, nowhere else. I saw him one day at the porter's lodge in Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him nowhere else. - I really am not quite positive. I never went to his lodging - I don't know where they are, nor has he called on me. I have sent to him this evening to come here. He has called at my lodgings for me to attend at Hicks's Hall - the officer desired him to call - he only called once to my recollection. I have only seen him there once - I never gave him any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. During all this fighting and scuffling was your coat buttoned. - A. No: I stripped it open, while fighting, to give me more air. He tore my waistcoat and shirt - my coat, pantaloons, and waistcoat were covered with blood. I was wounded in the nose, and the blood spirted from my mouth. Nobody saw me slip my purse into my cravat. One of them said to the other, "You know he had it."</p>
               <p>Q. How could either of them know you had a purse. - A. I don't know. I was setting in a liquor shop with my friend, and changed a sovereign; they might be there and see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was at a liquor shop that you and your friend were at: what was the sign. - A.George Arms, kept by

             - I don't say they were there. When I got to the gate, my face and handkerchief were covered with blood. I put up my hand, and felt my purse in my handkerchief, and gave it to a respectable man to take care of. I have got it now. I have brought my cravat here, it is a black silk one. I told the park gate-keeper to come here - he said it was no business of his. He said that sixteen carriages had stopped to ask the reason why nobody went to my assistance. I have not subpoened him, or the watchman, or hackney coachman - I did not know his number, and have not seen him since. I had spent my evening with Raikes and his family - several people were there who I had no acquaintance with.</p>

            . I am servant to Captain Seymour, Elm-place, Chelsea. I was out of service on the 4th of August, and was passing the park in Piccadilly about half past ten o'clock, and heard the cry of robbery proceed from Constitution-hill. I took no notice till I heard the cry of murder. I stopt, and heard it again. I got over the rails, and two young men got over also - they said they were afraid to go down to the place, and I said I would go by myself. I run till I got within six yards of the spot, that was about one third of the way from the gate to the palace, it might be about 200 yards from Piccadilly. Just as I got there I perceived a man run away, and run among the trees towards the Queen's garden, where I lost him. I came up and found the prosecutor laying underneath, and the prisoner laying on his g-ts at the top of him - he had hold of the prosecutor by each arm across the breast - the prosecutor had hold of the prisoner's neck; he had his hand inside his neckcloth. The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"You have got it about you, and if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120090"/>you dont give me it I will knock your brains out." This passed while he was laying upon him; but when I came up I found the prisoner's breeches all undone about his heels; how they came so I dont know - they were down to his knees as low as they could be. I said, "Halloo here, what are you at?" The prosecutor called out to me to assist him. I seized the prisoner's collar, and said, "Halloo, this wont do, get off, are you killing the gentleman or murdering him." I could not get him up for some time, the prosecutor would not let him go. He said, "Wont you let me go?" He said "No, you must go with me to the watch-house." Both their hats were off, and laid about four yards from them. After they got up the prisoner said, "I am d - d if I dont give charge of you, you s - d - e and son of a b - , and you shall see if I cant get some recompence for this." Then the prosecutor held him while I picked up their hats. I gave them each their hats. The prosecutor said he should go to the watch-house - and the prisoner said he should go to the watch-house with him. They each came along very gently till they came to the gate. They each said they should go to the watch-house - the prisoner charged him with being a ***, and the other said he was a highway robber - they still kept hold of each other coming up, though they came quietly. The two lads met us about fifty yards down the walk. When we came to the gate the prosecutor let go of him, and the prisoner gave him a knock in the face, and said, "There you d - d s - son of a ***, do you want any more of me?" The prosecutor then let go of him, and went to the gate and inquired the reason that no one came to his assistance. Somebody said they called the watchman, but he would not come. The prosecutor then came back again to the prisoner; he stood still in the place where he left him; and he said, "You must go with me to the watch-house;" and when the prisoner found the people came round, he said, He would be d - d if he did not give charge of him too. - When we came to the watchman he would not take charge, for they were both so bloody he did not know what to do. The prosecutor would not let the prisoner be taken in charge unless he had hold of one of his arms himself. Jeffreys came up and said,</p>
               <p>"You take one, and I'll take care of the other." Cross-examined. Q. Where did you live at this time? A. I lodged at No. 7, George-street, St. Giles's. I live now with the Captain, I have been five weeks in his service. Before that I lived pot-boy at the Plaisterer's Arms, Marybone-street. When I lived in George-street I sold laces and different things, and part of the time I was haymaking; I was there nearly six months.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many people in Piccadilly when you got over the gate? - A. Not many near the gate; there were some by the coach stand - they must have heard the cries.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prosecutor speaks to you does he call you by your name? - A. I never associate with him; he called me by the name of Asberry at Bow-street and Hick's Hall, and here. I have seen him at several places. I have seen him at his house, No. 26, Titchfield-street, four or five times; I called for him of a morning; may have seen him about three times at his house, and sat in his room while he dressed, and we both came out together - he was not at home at other times; we went to Hicks's Hall and Bow-street together; he always called me Asberry; he sometimes called me John. I was present from the time I came up with them in the park till they got to the watch-house. I have told all that passed. Some man patted the prosecutor behind and told him to stick to him. One day last week the park gate-keeper told me to tell the prosecutor he wished to see him, and I told him when I saw him here - he went to the lodge with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever give you any thing? - A. He gave me eightpence on the night of the scuffle, and gave me an old hat once - nothing else except a pint of beer or so.</p>

            . I was at my duty at Hyde Park corner. A little before eleven o'clock I heard a noise coming from the park. An inspector told me not to interfere, for he thought it was a drunken row, and we were obliged to abide by orders. I saw a good lot of people go down towards St. George's Hospital; they all came back together. I followed and asked what was the matter. When we came to the corner of Park-lane, I said, "I will take one and you take the other" - I told a watchman so. As we went to the watch-house together I found them both all over blood; the prosecutor's shirt and waistcoat were torn. I asked who he was? he said a butler, and that he came from abroad. I said unless he gave me security I should not let him go. The prisoner sent me to Westminster where I found his discharge from the guards, and found he now belongs to the West Middlesex militia.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time do you go on duty? - A. About eight o'clock. We were all talking together; but I think if there had been a cry of robbery and murder for twenty-five minutes I must have heard it. I always pay attention to the park. I believe the gate is locked at ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in his defence stated that the prosecutor forced his conversation on him, and detailed several indecent acts which the prisoner stated that he resisted with force, and the prosecutor then charged him with attempting to rob him.</p>

            . I am constable of the Thames Police. On the 18th of August, about seven o'clock in the morning, I and Wilson were in Nightingale-lane, and saw the male prisoners coming towards us; they turned down Burr-street. Law was carring a sack full of something; Jaggers looked round several times to see if they were watched; he had his own hat on, and another under his jacket; they saw us and rather mended their pace; we lost Laws in Lower East Smithfield. I followed Jaggers, and asked what he had got there, he said only a hat. I turned back and went into a cook-shop there, and found Laws standing up with the sack, which was then empty; it had contained coals: I asked where he brought them from - he said from a coalshed at Wapping<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120091"/>several times; I wished to know what shed; he then said, he brought them from Bryant's, and that they were a few sweepings which he had saved up. Atkinson came into the shop from backward, I asked where the coals were shot, and I think it was her that said they were shot in the kitchen; I went backward and found they were shot down by the copper side; she said the man ran in and ran backward and shot them before she had time to see what they were, and said they were sweepings. I took her word for attending the office, which she did. I went and found Jaggers at work at Bryants, I asked him for Law's hat, he fetched it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. If the 1 l. 19 s. was not an altered entry your account with Smith would be right? - A. Yes, but I have no right to receive 10 s. instead of 1 l. 19 s. I can swear I only received 10 s. on that day. I had a copy taken of the cash-book which I examined six or seven weeks ago. When he paid me money I examined his account and signed it as correct.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Leslie, and have been so seventeen months. I produce the cash book in which the prisoner entered what he received in the course of the day; there is no entry of 1 l. being paid by Smith on the 16th of April; the entries are made by him. There is an entry of 1 l. 19 s. on the 7th of May, but it was originally only 10 s. I can take on myself to say, that till the 21st of July, the entry remained 10 s. for on that day I took a copy of the cash-book by master's order, in order to detect any thing wrong; I have the copy here. In the cash-book, there has been a figure of I put in the pounds column, and the 0 in the shillings column is turned into 9; I received no money from him on Smith's account in April or June.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this paper, is it in the prisoner's writing? - A. I do believe it to be; (reads it), "Alter the cash-book, May the 7th, Smith 10 s. to 1 l. 19 s. to correspond with the Ledger."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You dont know where that paper comes from? - A. No: I believe it to be his writing; I began to copy the book on the 21st of July, and finished it on the 23d; the entry was then 10 s. Mr. Leslie does not interfere much in the business; I cannot say what his memory is; he has been very ill; I cannot say whether his memory was affected.</p>
               <p>Q. It is rather an awkward question to propose - but, do you believe in the Scripture? - A. I believe in a portion of them. I believe them generally.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe the New Testament to be a revelation from God? - A. It is impossible for me to say whether it is or not; it very probably may be so. I do not profess not to believe it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe it. - A. I have given very little thought about it. I am bound to speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose bye and bye you will say, you are bound, in a moral sense, to speak truth, but do you believe the New Testament, on which you have been sworn, to be a revelation from God. - A. Very probably it might have been - I can say nothing against it. I do believe it.</p>
               <p>Q. To be what. - A. To be a history.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, do you believe the whole of the New Testament to be the revealed word of God. - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not say so at first. - A. I did not completely comprehend your question.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not professed not to believe the Holy Scriptures, and that Jesus Christ was not the son of God. - A. I certainly have disputed it, and do dispute it now. Is is impossible for me to say what it is. I cannot contradict it. I believe it in certain parts.</p>

I said nine o'clock in the morning was the best time. He asked about the taxes - I said Mr. Wallis would inform him. He came out of the gate down the road, and crossed the fields towards Sommer's-town. I went into the house, and found a lock taken off the door, and laid on the drawing room stairs. I found the locks taken off all the doors, and put in a bag in the house - there were six in all. None were carried out of the house, but some of the handles were gone. They both went away together.

When they came up to me, I saw Johnson throw several things from his pockets. I dont know what they were, one thing looked like a watch. I called out, "It is all over with you, for you may depend upon it I'll have you." He jumped over a ditch into my garden, and then over a hedge; - his foot slipped, and he fell. I saw him throw some screws from his pocket - I seized him, and Bittle took Nash - we took them to the watch-house - returned, and in the way they ran a bell pull was found.</p>

On the 3d of September I missed these things from the captain's bed in the cabin; he knew where I kept them - I went ashore, returned between six and seven o'clock on the morning of the 4th, and they were gone - he had left the ship about an hour and a half after me. When he was apprehended my handkerchief was found in his hat. I have found nothing else. My clothes were new; I paid 3 l. 18 s. for them on the night they were stolen.</p>

He had his hat on, which was wet; I told him, if he went near the glass bell over the lamp it would fly to pieces; he took it off, and began talking about his brother Tom - he went to the door, called "Tom," and ran out with the card of four seals. I followed immediately and knocked him down, I secured him without loosing sight of him. I suppose he dropped them in the mud, as I have not found them. I distinctly saw him take them. On the way to Bow-street I met Dallas, who took him back to my house to search him, and there he exchanged my coat for his, which I did not discover till I got to Bow-street.</p>

On the 8th of August, between five and six o'clock in the morning, I and my family were all in bed. I was awoke by a loud knocking at the street door, saying, "Norman, get up, there are thieves in your wood yard". I immediately came down, went to the private door to open it, seeing the chain down, I could not open it, which I thought strange, as the bolts were undone - one of the witnesses was holding it to prevent their escaping - I then ran into the shop, opened the shop door, and found my neighbours in front - I instantly ran down the wood yard, and after looking about some time, saw Washer on the top of the adjoining house; I kept my eye on him - they got a neighbour's ladder, put it against the wall, and I saw the witness collar one of them; I went and slipped on my things, went round to the street, and helped to take them to the watch-house - both prisoners were found on the top of the house. I lost a table-spoon and two tea-spoons, four crown pieces, and some halfpence; I had left them in the back parlour cupboard.</p>

            . On the 8th of August, early in the morning, I heard a noise in the street, got up, ran to the the window, and saw Norman in his shirt, in the street; I ran down stairs, and understood that thieves were backward - I kept outside the door, and presently saw a person's hat on the top of the house, above the coping; I watched till somebody brought a ladder - I then got on the top of the house, and found both the prisoners lying in the gutter; I collared Washer, and said, "Come, get up," and in rising, some silver spoons dropped from under his smock frock, and a brown paper with some copper in it. I handed him down the ladder to the watchman, then went back, Flanery still laid in the gutter; I handed him down the ladder to the watchman, we all went to the watch-house, and there two crown pieces were found in one of their bats.</p>

I opened my window, looked out, and saw them both return to the same spot; it struck me all was not right, I went up by Norman's house, and met a man at the top of the road, and told him I thought all was not right; I went up to Norman's door, gave a good knock, and directly heard something inside - I looked over the yard door, and Flanery was on the planks in the yard coming towards me, he made his way back again, and they got on the adjoining house - I saw them in the gutter.</p>

Lyon's called me to give her a light in the passage, I came up, there was a barrow in the passage, and a blue box between the handles of it; whether Maroney or Lyons took it into Lyons's room, I cannot say. The box was opened, and Maroney took the things out, tied them up, and took them away; he said, he got them from the Hare and Hounds, public-house. I told Lyons they were stolen, and it was a shame, and told the neighbours. She took the box to Elcom's after it was emptied - they took all the things out, and took them away. Finnerty was in the passage, but not in the room; next morning, the articles stated in the indictment were found in the passage where the barrow stood.</p>

I got up and came down; he asked if I could give him a lodging; I said "No;" he said, if I did not, he should be put in the watch-house or something. I agreed to it, and in the morning he got up an hour before me, and awoke me about half-past five o'clock; he asked if I would run away from my uncle; I said, No, I did not want to go. I went down stairs on purpose to get him down; he asked if he might put on my shoes. I said Yes; as they were an old pair, and about four doors from the house he tried the shoes on, and said he could not wear them. He went up again, and brought the sheet down, he said, "Now go away with me."

            . I was officer of the night. About half-past five o'clock in the morning, I left the watch-house to go home, and saw the prisoner, who appeared a suspicious character, with something like a sheet stuck out of his coat, which was buttoned. I asked what he had there? he said it was nothing to me. I said he should not pass till I was satisfied; he then said it was a sheet which he was taking from his mother to his aunt. He could not tell where his mother or aunt lived - I took him and Wilkinson to the watch-house. I found a sheet round the prisoner's body, in his hat a shirt, and in his pocket a dirty cloth - he said the sheet was his aunt's. On Wilkinson, I found 8 lbs. of lead in one pocket, and 1 lb. in the other; he said the prisoner stole it from his master, and after he left gave it him to carry, as he had made up his mind to leave his master.</p>

On the 22d of August, about eight o'clock at night, I was in St. John-street, opposite Mr. Garland's, and saw Green and Dougan come up to this handkerchief, the prisoners were all three together, a few yards from the shop; one of them cut or tore down some handkerchiefs, which hung at the door - Haylett stood five or six yards off, the other two beckoned to her, she went up and took the handkerchief, and crossed the street, saw me, and set off running - I went and took them out of her apron, the other two were taken.</p>

            . I am a blind painter, and live in Tottenham-court-road. On Sunday the 19th of August, a little after seven o'clock, I was in Goswell-street, about a quarter of a mile from Queen-street, and saw the prisoner walking towards Old-street with this child in her arms, she going away from Queen-street, the child was repeatedly calling to be carried home and seemed uneasy. I requested her to take it home, she said she was going home; I asked where she lived, she said in Holborn. I then suspected that she did not know the way, or that it was not her child, and asked whose child it was, she said it was her own. The child kept crying to be taken home, I asked if she knew the way she was going, and told her she was not going in a direction for Holborn, and asked her what part of Holborn she lived in; she said in Hatton-garden. I asked her what number, she would not answer. I then told her the child was stolen, and I would accompany her to the watch-house or workhouse. She remained where she was, a crowd collected round, and a little girl said she had seen the child in Queen-street, we took her back to Queen-street, and on the road she said she had just come from Chelsea. The child is now in Court.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prisoner was given in my charge, she said she did not mean to hurt the child. I asked her where she got it from, she said from the the corner of Red Lion-street, that she lived in Eyre-street, Hatton-garden, and had left her husband at Chelsea with three children. Several people followed us, and there was a cry of "Rescue" several times.</p>

He said his father belonged to the letter carrier, and he expected to meet him there. After waiting three-quarters of an hour, he said he supposed his father had stoped at a public-house in Drury-lane, we went and waited there about an hour; he said as his father was not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120098"/>come he would go to his sister's, and get the money, and told me to be sure and be particular in taking care of these parcels of his, particularly the small one, as there was something very valuable in it, and he would take my parcel with him as it would save him the trouble of going back again; he went with the parcel, and after waiting a considerable time I came home with the parcels, and on opening them found they were filled with grass. I never saw him till he was taken.</p>

On the 20th of August, I met the prisoner in Queen-street; I knew him by sight before, I asked him to drink, as I knew his brother; I never saw him before, but by his features, I asked if he was not that man's brother, he said, Yes; we went to the Cooper's-arms, public-house, and had two pots of beer - it was about half-past ten o'clock at night. I was taken very poorly there, and a friend of mine who was there took me home, the prisoner went with me, they both stripped me, and put me to bed, he sat on the chair by the bed, I asked him to go home, he pretended to be in liquor; he took and folded my shawl up, I asked what he was doing with it; he then laid it on the table, I went to sleep, and felt him taking my pocket from under my head; I said, "Young man, do not take my things;" and he went out with my shawl, leaving my pocket on the table, and no money in it, there was a candle in the room all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you sent for any doctor - A. No; I am married, my husband's name is George, he has left me - I have not found the shawl, I saw him next morning, and asked him for it, he pushed me down, and went off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you not in liquor - A. No; not at all, I had not been drinking all day with him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to say he did not meet you before half-past ten o'clock - A. I believe it was between six and seven o'clock, I met him standing at the door of the Hoop and Grapes, public-house, he treated me with a pot of beer there, we had nothing but three pots of beer.</p>

On the 27th of August, I was up stairs looking out of window, and saw a man looking at a Bath stove which stood at the door; my mistress went to the door, the man was gone then, and there was a mob round the stove.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see who took it - A. No; I was examined before the Magistrate, and told the truth there - I do not know who the man was, he went away after I missed the stove, he was looking at it, and when mistress went to the door, he was gone - I found the stove up the court by a house, it was not covered over.</p>
               <p>Q. How old are you - A. I am going on for fifteen. There was nothing on the stove, I never said that there was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you run down to your mistress, and tell her the stove was gone - A. No; I did not tell the Magistrate where it was taken; I do not know who dropped it; I did not tell the Magistrate who did. Nothing was read over to me before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. I caution you, you are fifteen years old, and old enough to know what you are about; you must tell the truth, and nothing but the truth; I want to know if you ever said at any place, or before the Magistrate that you saw a man take the stove - A. No; I never did - I did not go after any body or overtake any body, I saw nobody drop it, I did not run after the prisoner; I never told the Magistrate that the prisoner was the man who took it, and that I saw him take it.</p>
               <p>Q. Mind what you are about, I caution you again to tell the truth; you will be committed and tried unless you do; I ask you whether you did not swear before the Magistrate that you saw the prisoner at the bar take the stove, go away with it, that you went after him, overtook him, and asked him to bring it back - A. No; I never said it nor swore it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was taken in custody that day - A. I do not know rightly who was the man, I saw nobody taken in custody - nobody has been talking to me about this prosecution - I recollect going before the Magistrate at Worship-street, I was examined, but did not give evidence against the man; what I said was taken down in writing, it was not read over to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Now boy, let me caution you to speak the truth, look at this (the deposition) do you remember putting your mark to it - A. Not as I remember.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the officer is here who heard the paper read to you, saw you put your mark to it, and while it was being written down, heard the statement which is put on that paper come from your lips; do you mean to say after that, that it was never read over to you, and that you did not state and relate what is written in that paper - (No answer).</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know you put your mark to it - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Had you a pen in your hand - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who has convered with you about this business - A. Nobody; the prisoner's friends nor my master never spoke to me about it - I did not see the prisoner nor any body take the stove, nor ever said that I did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You were at the two pair of stairs window when you saw this going on - A. Yes.</p>

            . On Monday the 27th of August, between twelve and one o'clock, as near as I can recollect; a little boy in the neighbourhood, named Frank Groom, told me the stove was taken away; it stood outside the door. I went out, the prisoner was pointed out to me. The stove laid on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you go before you got up to him - A. He turned the corner towards Finsbury-market. I think I went about twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a man drop the stove - A. It was on the ground when I came up. I did not see him drop it, he stood close to it. I was sworn before the Magistrate, and what I said was taken down. I put my mark to it. I spoke the truth then the same as I do now.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him drop it - A. He was stooping over it just as if he was laying it down; it was too heavy for him, he being in liquor. I brought him and the boy brought the stove back.</p>
               <p>Q. What boy - A. Kelly. He got up before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him when the man put the stove down - A. He was with the man before I got to him, he saw more than I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the prisoner was drunk - A. Very drunk indeed, I do not think he could carry the stove further than the twenty yards. I had seen the stove at the door an hour before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say before the Magistrate</p>
               <p>"I ran round the corner and saw the prisoner drop the stove now produced" - A. Yes, I did say it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why not tell us the truth here - A. I am sorry to see a man of those years -</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What do you mean by his dropping it - A. He had it in his arms - he laid it on the ground. The first information I had was from a strange boy. I saw a man named Hawkes there - he is a man I would not trust. I said at the time that the prisoner would not have been there, if Hawkes had not brought him. I sent for a constable - the prisoner went away and came back again; the stove is not worth much - there was more valuable things, and a good deal better stoves. I have not seen Hawkes since.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Am I to understand you saw him place the stove out of his hand on the ground - A. When I pushed the mob away it was on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him place it out of his hand on the ground - A. Yes.</p>

I objected going with the prisoner, and offered her a shilling to go when the light came up, as she had two black eyes. I put eleven shillings in my handkerchief in my breeches pocket, and went to bed; and in three quarters of an hour I awoke, by hearing her calling to be let out. I jumped up and knocked against the wainscot to awake my friend - he came, and the prisoner came up stairs, as she could not get out. My friend fetched a watchman who came up; she strongly denied it, and took out 1 s. which I had given her, and a few halfpence; she declared it was all she had in the world, and wished her Maker might strike her dead if it was not - she stripped herself, the watchman put his hand behind her head, she screamed out, and he took the eleven shillings from among her hair, tied in a piece of a handkerchief.</p>

I took it off the ground, and by it I found the silk shawl at Wood's.

On Sunday night, the 9th of September, between twelve and one o'clock, I was locked out of my lodging, and wandered about the streets until five o'clock in the morning, I was quite sober. In George-street, St. Giles's, a man shoved me off the footway. I asked why he did it - he then knocked me down, and as I was getting up he knocked me down again; the prisoner then came up, and pretended to take my part, and another tall man with him - the man who knocked me down went away. I took the prisoner and the other man to a public-house, and treated them with half a gallon of beer for their civility; they told me they knew the man who had abused me so, and if I would go and lay down at their lodging and take some rest, they would get me some breakfast in the morning; they took me to No. 9, <placeName id="t18210912-202-crimeloc1183">Church-street</placeName>

I took off my shoes and hat - I had my watch in my fob. It was about seven o'clock when I laid down, and about nine o'clock, I found the prisoner fumbling in my waistcoat pocket. I asked what was the matter, he said, "Nothing, I am only putting the clothes on you;" nobody but him was in the room. I got up and they were all off, and my coat, shoes, and hat also, and my watch was gone from my fob. I found the slider and ring of it on the bed - it was fastened to the ribbon - I had my watch with me when I left my lodging. I have found nothing since. I went out and alarmed the neighbourhood; the prisoner was taken between four and five o'clock that day. We took him to the public-house, and the landlord said he was one of the two who were with me, and he did not deny it - I am certain of him.</p>

On the 29th of August, about twelve o'clock he came in and said he was rather the worse for liquor, and must go up stairs and lay down. He came down in about an hour, and went out with a bundle. I went up and missed these things from the cupboard, ran out but could not overtake him. I have never found the things.</p>

I then went alone to Nicholls's; he said if any were pawned there, the prisoner was the woman who pawned them. I went to Armstrong's, and found some things pawned in the name of Glass, which I redeemed - they were wrapped in one of my aprons. A little girl fetched me into Leather-lane, where I saw the prisoner with her child, and asked why she took the things, she said she would make them good. I said "Why did you take them, you knew she was distressed, and has six children; give me the tickets and I will take them out." She said she would see her d - d first.</p>

            . The prisoner's uncle came to me, and told me I should find him in bed at a public-house, in Clipstone-street, Marylebone. I was up there all night, and at five o'clock in the morning, a man said he was in bed at home. I went up three pair of stairs, and saw him in bed, and I told him I wanted him about a watch, he denied knowing any thing of it. I locked him up at the watch-house; his uncle wished to speak to him. I brought him out, and he said he sold it for 13 s., at No. 13, Crown-street, Soho; for three half crowns, 6 d., and 5 s. He took me to the shop, kept by Carey, it is a rag-shop. I did not find it. He told me as he went along that he had taken his cousin's shawl which cost two guineas and a half, and sold it at the same shop for 5 s. He belongs to very respectable parents, but has had connexions.</p>

            . On the 1st of September, about eight o'clock in the morning, I saw all the prisoners in company together, coming down Pentonville. Boswell had an apron tied before him, he went up two garden walks, came out and joined the other two. He then went up the walk of No. 18, Pleasant-row, and got in at the window which was open, and came out with the milk-pot in his hand, and was stuffing it in among some shavings which he he had in his apron; the other two waited for him two doors off - he joined them. I took him and pulled the pot out, and asked where he got it, he made no answer. I took him to the house, the servant claimed it. I kept all three in custody.</p>

Another box was robbed of several things, and a counterpane of my master's - they said next day they had lost a purse, containing twenty guineas, and hoped I would keep it secret, or they would be discharged, I agreed. As to the things, I do not know how I became possessed of them, unless they got mixed with mine at the mangle. The prosecutrix was much embittered against me for not conniving at her changing some feathers out of the bed - she said she would be my destruction, unless I gave her a sum of money.</p>

               <p>- HANSON. I live in Henry-street, Hampstead. A man asked if I wanted a job, he took me to Palace-row, where there where four sacks of beans. I took them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120107"/>to Camden-town - Mason told me to carry them to be weighed; Mason said to me "Come on" - I shot some of the corn at his house, he sent me over the way to get a pot of beer, and the man who employed me gave me 1 s. 6 d. I cannot say that the prisoner is the man, he may be, I left them at Mason's, sacks, corn, and all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 12th of April, I went to a lime wharf at Paddington with my cart, stopped at the Red Lion, public-house, Edgware-road, and met a man who called himself Mr. Wilson, a corn-dealer, of Edgware-road. He said he wished to exchange his cart away for a good horse; my horse came to 7 l. 10 s., and his cart to 4 l. 10 s. He proposed to pay the 3 l. in about a week, I refused; he said he would furnish me with two quarters of beans, at 30 s. a quarter - I agreed, and was to meet him next morning, and on the way, I met him; he said he was going to Tottenham-court-road, and expected the beans would be there soon, and authorized me to take them in my possession. I went to the White Lion, public-house, saw the cart, and asked the carter if the beans were for me, he said, "Yes." I asked if he had brought any bran, he said, "No;" I received the beans, and left them at my house.</p>
