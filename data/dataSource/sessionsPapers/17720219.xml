            . I had been up to Middlerow, Holborn, on the 25th of last month. Coming back about three o'clock, I went into the Horse-shoe, a public house in Holborn. I saw there the prisoner, the accomplice, and another who is not taken, they were drinking together; while I was drinking my beer, they asked me where I was going; I said, to Leaden-hall. They asked me to drink with them. They said they were going that way, and asked me if we should have a coach among us. I said, I did not mind it much. One went into Smithfield and ordered a coach, and instead of going to Leaden-hall, they carried me up Long-lane and into Goswell-street, and from thence to the Duke's-head at Islington. I said we were going wrong; they said, No, it all came into one road. Then they brought me back to the old Sun-dial just by Swan-alley; there we went in and had a pot of beer, which I paid for; it was then between six and seven o'clock. The woman of the house would have had me lay there that night. They said, I came in with them, and should go with them; when we came to that house they sent the coach away.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid for the coach?</p>
               <p>Gates. It cost me a pot of beer and six-pence. After we had drank a pot of beer, we came out of that house; as soon as I got out of the door they said, this is your way, pointing down the Rope-walk, <placeName id="t17720219-1-crimeloc3">Swan-alley</placeName>

As soon as they had got my purse, they ran away down Swan-alley; I got up and pursued them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call out when they robbed you?</p>
               <p>Gates. I durst not; I was afraid of my life.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you in your purse?</p>
               <p>Gates. Fourteen shillings within a few half-pence; I had counted it about two or three hours before.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner was one of them?</p>
               <p>Gates. Yes.</p>
               <p>Gates. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Gates. I had drank a little, but I was sober.</p>
               <p>Court. Consider, this is a heavy charge you bring against these people; are you very certain the prisoner is one of them?</p>
               <p>Gates. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What place is this rope-walk? is it a thoroughfare?</p>
               <p>Gates. Yes. I ran after them, and called out, Stop thief! but they got out of my sight presently. I met only a man and a woman there.</p>
               <p>Q. You was sober enough to run?</p>
               <p>Gates. Yes; and I had a hand-basket upon my arm, that I had carried some sowls in from my master.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did the woman want you to lay at the alehouse?</p>
               <p>Gates. She would have me lie there, because she thought I was in bad company, as I was a countryman.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Gates. In Essex.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you not pretty well acquainted with London streets?</p>
               <p>Gates. I have been at Leadenhall-market, but I am not much acquainted with London.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you pulled your purse out while you was in their company?</p>
               <p>Gates. Yes, I had, to pay my reckoning.</p>
               <p>Jonathan Shilcock. The prisoner, his brother John and I were drinking at the Horse-shoe and Chequer on Snow-hill, we had two pints of beer before the prosecutor came in; he called for a pint of beer, and asked me to drink. He said, he liked a good hearty fellow; that he had got 8 s. in his pocket, and if we had a mind to go and have a frolick, he would spend it upon us. He told me he had a cart in Whitechapel or Leadenhall-market; I said, he had best go through Smithfield. He was in liquor, and did not care to walk, so we went all together to Smithfield; there we took a coach. We ordered the coachman to stop at the Black Horse in Long-lane, and I think we had a pot of beer. There was one

             there, an acquaintance of the prisoner's and mine. I lodge at the prisoner's mother's, and have known him these four years. I never saw Gates before. We took this Sweatman into the coach, and the prisoner's brother got upon the box. We ordered the coachman to drive up Goswell street to Islington. We went to the Turk's head (I believe it is) The prosecutor paid 6 d. and the prisoner or the other man, paid the other 6 d. for the coach. We discharged the coach there, and the coachman went into the rank. We staid there half an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177202190004"/> hour, and had a pot of beer and half a pint of gin. Then we called the same coach out of the rank again. We stopped at the Pyed Bull coming down Islington; there we had half a pint of aniseed, which the prisoner and his brother paid for between them. From thence we went to the Gun in Goswell-street, where we had a pint of aniseed. Then we went to Swan-alley, where we discharged the coach. We all four went into a public house at the corner, I don't know the sign; we had a pot of beer, which the prosecutor paid for. We staid there about a quarter of an hour; the prosecutor was not willing to go out of the house; we told him it was a house where they enlisted people for the East-India service, and he would be trepanned; he was so fuddled he could hardly stand. We all four went out together; the prosecutor wanted to go into Bishopsgate-street or Whitechapel; we told him it would be as near to go down the Rope-walk. When we had got about two or three yards down the Rope-walk, he was not willing to pay his reckoning.</p>
               <p>Q. You said he paid for the pot of beer and other things?</p>
               <p>Shilcock. He did not pay his share; we had liquor at other houses which he did not pay towards; we all got about him and held him, I can't say which held him; there was the prisoner, his brother, Sweatman, and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he pushed down?</p>
               <p>Shilcock. No; he was pushed up against the wall; there was a hole in the bottom of his purse, and a shilling or so might drop out; there was 9 s. 6 d. I believe, and a bad shilling in the purse; they held him while I took the purse out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his money at any time before this?</p>
               <p>Shilcock. Yes, I saw him pull his purse out at the Duke's Head at Islington. When I took his purse, I told the other three to come to me at the Magpie, Clerkenwell, to share the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Gates pursue you?</p>
               <p>Shilcock. I saw no more of him till I was taken the next morning, near Hicks's-hall; I surrendered myself to the watchman. We shared the money among us at the Magpie, Clerkenwell-green.</p>

I did, and he picked up what he had dropt; then I seized him and took him to the watch-house. In about half an hour the man that was robbed came down, and said they were the persons that robbed him.</p>

I ordered one of the samples to be cut off the pattern book, and sent it round to the piece-brokers, to desire them to stop it if it should be offered to them. There had been none offered that night; I sent again next morning, and one Mr. Davis said some had been offered him in samples; that the man was to come again with the whole quantity, and then he would stop him; the 30th was Thursday. On the Tuesday following, one Mr. Teage told me a person had offered to sell him some silk; as we had sent to stop twist, he thought it might be mine. I went to his house, and the prisoner came in while I was there. He said he had been in search of the persons he bought it of, to shew that he came honestly by it, but could not find them. I asked him if he had ever sold any thing in Bedfordbury before; he said, no. I mentioned Mr. Davis's name; he said, no. I then desired him to walk with me to Mr. Davis's; he made no objection, but went with me; just before he came to the door, he said, he did recollect Mr. Davis, for he had bought a parcel of twist at the same time that he bought the silk, and had sold it to Mr. Davis. We went into Mr. Davis's shop, and Mrs. Davis said they had bought the twist two days before I sent; and that her husband bid her say she had not bought it; he was not at home.

I carry coals for a coal shed in Houndsditch; I was going by the prosecutor's, and I saw the prisoner and another standing under Mr. Caley's window; I had about forty yards to go; they were standing there when I came back; the prisoner stared me in the face; I heard a pane crack, and I saw them draw something out of the window; and they run up Church Row; I told Mr. Caley; so he went after them, and brought back the prisoner; he is the same man that I saw under the window; I saw Mr. Caley's Sister take one parcel out of his apron and two other parcels lay right under his feet, there were no parcels there before he was brought in.</p>

            . When the prisoner was brought back into my brother's shop, I saw one parcel of handkerchiefs drop out of his lap as he stood in the middle of the shop; his apron was tuck'd up; after that I saw another parcel in his apron, which was searched. The handkerchiefs laid quite in view. I took them out of his apron. I suppose the other parcels had dropt before.</p>

I said, I would give them my money, but I was not willing to part with my watch. The prisoner said, if I did not give both, he would shoot me dead, or blow my brains out, or words to that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it?</p>
               <p>Haysom. A moon-light night. The prisoner stood by my side at my horse's head; Collins was behind me, and Tudor was on my left side. I gave them two guineas, I believe, and a half guinea, and 6 or 8 s. in silver. The prisoner felt up my thigh for my watch; he could not easily get it out; he said if I did not pull it out myself, he would instantly blow my brains out. I am a messenger; I was going to Mr. Stevens at the Admiralty.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know their names?</p>
               <p>Haysom. Collins turned evidence. I have never seen my watch or money since. After I had delivered my watch and money, Collins said, D - n him, blow his brains out. The prisoner said, D - n you, what would you have? he has behaved like a gentleman, and delivered up his all; you shan't hurt him; and gave me a shilling to pay the turnpike. I refused the money at first, but afterwards I thought it was most prudent to take it.</p>

               <p>Haysom. No; I only said, I believed him to be the man; I never swore positive to him before, but I am sure he is the man; I should have been glad to have made him an evidence; for I had no intent to hurt him, because I believe he saved my life.</p>

               <p>Hill. He did not sign any thing; he said he could not be easy till he came back to me.</p>

             M'Carty. I was sitting in Mr. Hill's house when the prisoner came in. Mr. Hill had bid me stop him if I met with him. He had been impressed the day before at the India-house, and Mr. Hill stood bonds-man for him. Mr. Hill accused him with taking his money; after some little time he confessed that he took three guineas, seven half guineas, three quarter guineas and a moidore, out of Hill's drawer. I went with him before the Justice; he confessed the same there, and that he had bought these clothes with the money.</p>

               <p>- Fletcher. I was on duty at Somerset-house on the 22d of January, and was stationed at the back of the Savoy. I saw two men, between ten and eleven o'clock at night at the water-side; I challenged them; they ran away at first; then one said to the other, D - n it, it is only the sentry. Then they came back; they passed me, and went among the craft. I know one to be Hart. I went back to my post, and in five minutes time the same two men came up, each had a sack on his shoulder; they went up towards the Strand; I followed them to the steps that went up to the Strand; Hart called me by my name. I said, I don't know you. He said, D - n it, don't you know Will. Hart? then I recollected it was a man I had been at a trial with. I gave information of it to Mr. Smith; in consequence of that, Hart was taken up; at first he denied it, afterwards he confessed that he and Field stole the oats, and sold them to a baker in St. Ann's-lane, Westminster.</p>
               <p>The constable confirmed this evidence respecting the confession, and that they sold the oats and some sacks at the baker's, but that the sacks had no marks.</p>

               <p>I am innocent; if I confessed any thing, it was when I was very much in liquor.</p>

I went out on the 20th of January, about three o'clock in the afternoon and returned again about six, when I saw West at the window, looking into the shop; when he saw me, he shifted his place, and went on the other side of the way. I went into my house and drank tea, and then, as I suspected West, I went to see what was become of him. Then I perceived that half a pane of glass was taken out; the pane was cracked before, and there were two pair of shoes gone, that lay against that pane. The hole was big enough for a man to put his arm in at.</p>

               <p>Smith. Yes; I am certain I lost two pair. I searched for the piece of glass, but could not find it. I saw no more of West that night. Then I went to the pawnbrokers, and informed them how I was robbed, and desired them to stop the shoes if they should be offered.</p>

            . The prosecutor came to me on the 20th of January, and informed me he had been robbed of two pair of shoes. On the Tuesday following a woman came to my shop with the shoes Mr. Smith had desired me to stop. I told her, I must stop her. She said, she had them of one West. She went away, and West came, and said he bought them in Rosemary-lane, for 3 s. 6 d. I told him I would enquire of Mr. Smith, before I delivered the shoes to him; and that if he, Mr. Smith, did not claim them, he should have them the next morning. The prisoner went away.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. Was the shop door shut?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes; but I took no particular notice of the window at that time, as my attention was fixed upon West.</p>
               <p>White. West came again, and Kirk with him; but Kirk said nothing about the shoes.</p>

Gordon and the two lads were saying in the tap-room, that these two girls had got away with the notes; they asked me to stop the girls. A little after that they were leaning their heads down, I saw two lottery tickets that were 20 l. prizes. I said, what is that? Gordon immediately went and thrust them into the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you distinguish that they were prizes?</p>
               <p>Rooke. There was an L, a figure of 2, and an o, wrote in ink. After they had desired me to stop this girl, they wanted me to let them out. I said, No; having stopt her, I will stop you all; I will send for Mr. Noakes to take charge of you. The two women frequented the house before I kept it; they sold fish about, and paid their way very well; one of the sisters owes me a score now. I never heard any thing bad of them till this affair.</p>
               <p>Court. Nor of Gordon, nor the boys, I dare say?</p>
               <p>Rooke. No farther than frequenting my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your house frequented by a great deal of such company as that?</p>
               <p>Rooke. It was frequented by such company as that before I kept it.</p>
               <p>Court. I hope the Justices have taken away your licence.</p>
               <p>Rooke. It is already taken away. I can't help my house being bad.</p>
               <p>Court. No; it is not the house that is bad; it is the keeper of it that is bad.</p>
               <p>Rooke. The boys said, it was a pretty thing for them to run the hazard of their lives for it; and they would, sooner than she should have it, go and lay an information before Sir

               <p>Q. Did the boys say what these papers were?</p>

             the evidence took me down to St. Anne's-lane, where Mitchel and Graham lived; they told me the pocket-book was burnt. The evidence gave me a lottery ticket, which he said dropt out of the pocket-book, when they opened it in Covent-Garden. I raked among the ashes, and found some bits of a pocket-book, (producing them.) The prosecutor said, part appeared like a rivet to the pocket-book, and part of an opera ticket. They said that Miller was with them, and had got the pocket-book; she was taken next day.</p>

             was standing by; we were all together under the piazza's at Govent-Garden, it was about ten at night. Smith went to pick the gentleman's pocket; he came back, and said there was nothing but a pocket-book. We sent him back again, and he brought the pocket-book. I believe the gentleman had come from the play-house; it was just at the corner, coming out across the way. He brought it behind his coat; we took it from him, and went into Govent-garden market with it; we opened it; we saw some notes in it, and a locket fell out, that Mr. Noakes has; there is a true-lover's knot to it; I took it up, and put it into my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How many went into the market to examine it?</p>
               <p>Kenney. All of us. Gordon said, give it me; I said, I will keep it myself; I put it in my pocket. He said, let's go to Westminster. We went to the Oak in Thieving-lane. Gordon saw Graham at the Hope, and we all went with her; she opened the pocket-book, and saw some silver instruments in it, and she pulled out two lottery tickets. Upon searching farther, she said to Gordon, here is a 50 l. bank note; come and kiss me, my dear. The gentleman said there was a 25 l. note; I did not see that.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177202190014"/> She searched the book over, and said there were notes. We tore the book, and burnt it and the other papers; Gordon had the lottery tickets, and brought them to the Hope afterwards. Graham asked Gordon if he would have any beef for supper; she said, she had got a shilling. She went out with pretence to get some, but did not return again; and I saw her no more till she was taken; she took Miller with her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in this way?</p>
               <p>Kenney. Not long; I was a porter before, and worked very hard.</p>
               <p>Q. What had Michener to do in it?</p>
               <p>Kenney. She only fetched a candle, and was in the room at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Does any body lodge with Graham?</p>
               <p>Kenney. Yes, Michener.</p>
               <p>Q. from Jennings. Where was I when the pocket-book was taken?</p>
               <p>Kenney. About ten yards behind.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Birch any thing to do with it?</p>
               <p>Kenney. No; he was under the gate-way.</p>
               <p>Q. And went afterwards to the Hope with you?</p>
               <p>Kenney. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. He went out of pure love then; had nothing to do with it?</p>
               <p>Kenney. Yes; out of pure love.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you usually let those into your secrets to see what prizes you have, that have not been concerned in the business?</p>

            . The prisoner came into our house after his uncle; he was crying: he began abusing my husband, and said he would lay him on his own fire and burn him, and he hit his head against the wall. There was liquor left to pay: he would not pay it, and went away. He went out, I desired my husband to shut the windows: then the prisoner came back, and said he would push my husband's head in the dunghill: he hit him, and when he pushed him down the second time, his leg caught in the drain, and broke; which was the cause of his death. He ran at him, as if he was going to hit him again, and threatened that he would hit him; but did not: he died of a mortification in his leg.</p>

She said her husband did not call the prisoner back when he was gone away, but only called after him, and told him, that both he and his uncle were shuffling fellows; that the prisoner stript, and came back again, and then the accident happen'd. She said that Parsons and James were not by at the same time, but at a distance by Dewell's cloaths; that her husband took hold of the prisoner by the collar, and tore his shirt, but that he only took hold of the prisoner's collar in order to support himself.</p>

            . The prisoner came to my shop on the 20th of January, and bought three yards of ribbon. Soon after they were gone, I missed a piece of blue ribbon, and a piece of rose-colloured pink. On the 23d they came again, and asked if I had any more of the same ribbon that they bought before. I told them I had not: Then Davis asked for some black ribbon; I pulled out a drawer, and shewed her some; the drawer was of the inside the counter, and opened towards me; presently after, Smith threw a long red cloak over a drawer that was in the window. I suspected she had took something; and when they were gone, I missed some ribbon. I sent my servant,

            . I keep Penny's Folly in Islington-road, facing the Reservoir. The prisoner and three more men came into my house on Monday morning the 4th of March about a quarter after eight o'clock, they asked for some hot wine. I made a quart hot, and lighted a fire in the room fronting the road. They asked for breakfast, which was got. They had two or three more quarts of wine after that, and paid for every thing as they had it in.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any boxes?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. No; One went out to fetch a horse; which of them I can't tell. In about a quarter or half an hour the horse came to the door. I offered to put the horse in my stable, which they refused, and said, perhaps they might not stay ten minutes, or perhaps they might dine. They were consulting backwards and forwards, sometimes one, sometimes two were out together. Presently I heard the found of gold. I went in to see if they were gaming, but I could not perceive that they were. One man and Hopkins went out together; when they had been out about four or five minutes, the other two came to me and said if the gentlemen came and enquired for him he desired I would tell them they were gone to the Brown-Bear in Smithfield. I forgot to mention that I saw one box opened, and I saw some lace in it; it was such a box as these.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who brought them?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I did not take notice. The man that told me that went out and the prisoner took the wallets off the table, and put them across the horse; the boxes were in the wallet. I held the horse, and he went down the road very easy; my house is built fifty feet from the road. I went as far as the road for a fight, and came back very gently.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any part of the conversation, when the four men were in the room?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. No; I heard no talk about the lace. I lifted it up at the end and saw it was lace, while the four men were in the room. I was no sooner come in doors, than Hopkins came back and enquired what was become of the gentlemen? I told him they were gone to the Brown-Bear in Smithfield; the prisoner rode upon the horse. I did not observe which way the other went.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who brought the boxes into the house?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the prisoner might bring them for what you know?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard no noise or disturbance in the room?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. No; only once; as I said, I heard the sound of gold; when I went in, all was quiet.</p>
               <p>Q. Any person there might have purchased the boxes for what you know?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I looked upon them to be companions together.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know that these are the boxes?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. No; they were such boxes as these.</p>

We went to the house and searched it; we found there this empty box; we could not find any more boxes, or any lace in the house. He said, you need hunt no further, for the lace I did buy of one Mr. Vivason; I sold it again to a gentleman in Spitalfields, whose name I don't know. Langley sent for a gentleman that he sold it to. He came to their house, and said he had sold it to a gentleman in the Borough. He said, I did not know, Mr. Langley, that it had been stoln, or I would not have bought it of you. He said, if you will go to any tavern in the Borough, I will see and have this lace sent to you. We went to a house; and a porter came in about half an hour, with two boxes, and enquired for Mr. Langley.</p>

               <p>Mr. - Levi. I had this note of Mr. Morris at Mr. Cardineaux's, in his presence.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom was the application made with regard to this note? Was you employed as attorney for Mr. Cardineaux?</p>
               <p>Levi. No; I applied to him to get possession of this note; I heard it was a forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore went to Mr. Cardineaux?</p>
               <p>Levi. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. No money was paid on it then, I believe?</p>
               <p>Levi. Yes; I believe there was.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you tell Cardineaux?</p>
               <p>Levi. I desired he would give me the note.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177202190023"/>Q. For what purpose?</p>
               <p>Levi. I believe I told him no purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. An attorney go to Mr. Cardineaux, desire a note of 100 l. and not tell him for what purpose?</p>
               <p>Levi. I asked Mr. Cardineaux, when coming away, if he would be willing to prosecute Bolland? he said, he would; but desired three or four days time to consider of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard it was a forgery?</p>
               <p>Levi. I had; and in the course of conversation with Mr. Cardineaux, I believe it was mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave Mr. Cardineaux a receipt?</p>
               <p>Levi. I gave Mr. Morris one.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the purport of it?</p>
               <p>Levi. To deliver it up, or be accountable for it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to hear of this note at all?</p>
               <p>Levi. I believe I was informed of it by Mr. Pritchard.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been concerned for him?</p>
               <p>Levi. Yes, seven years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew of very considerable dealings between them?</p>
               <p>Levi. I am sorry to say that there should be; it was against my advice.</p>
               <p>Q. To a great many thousand pounds, I believe?</p>
               <p>Levi. God knows; it was a great deal in the bill way. I have a good many in my pocket, if you think they would be of any service to your client. I believe I asked if he was desirous to prosecute this forgery; he desired three or four days time to consider of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Something must have passed with regard to its being a forgery?</p>
               <p>Levi. I believe it was mentioned by each of us in the back parlour of its being a forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Cardineaux did not know it at that time, I believe?</p>
               <p>Levi. I believe he did long before that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it by Mr. Pritchard's order you went to get this note?</p>
               <p>Levi. It was by his desire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or not, tell Mr. Cardineaux it was a forgery?</p>
               <p>Levi. To the best of my recollection, Mr. Cardineaux acknowledged it to be a forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or not, tell Mr. Cardineaux it was a forgery?</p>
               <p>Levi. I believe not; he had given a collateral security for it. Cardineaux and Morris refused to give it him. I went and asked for the bill. In the course of the conversation the forgery was mentioned, whether by Cardineaux, Morris, or me, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not say you did not mention it?</p>
               <p>Levi. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any one word mentioned by you, that you was taking this to carry before a magistrate?</p>
               <p>Levi. No; not a word, I believe, was mentioned about a magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you propose to return the money?</p>
               <p>Levi. No; I was to return the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you was not concerned for Cardineaux, but for Pritchard?</p>
               <p>Levi. No, as a friend; not as an attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you, by a receipt, gave him to understand that you would return it him again?</p>
               <p>Levi. Yes; to Mr. Morris.</p>
               <p>Q. In Cardineaux's presence?</p>
               <p>Levi. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then Cardineaux gave you the note, and you carried it to the magistrate?</p>
               <p>Levi. No; some time after that, Cardineaux and Morris went with me to Hickes's-hall, to find a bill of indictment for this forgery. It was the adjournment day; the jury did not sit long enough; they were gone. Then Cardineaux appointed me to meet him at Sir

               <p>Levi. I heard there was no defence; he has recovered 1490 odd pounds. I was informed by Pritchard's attorney that there was no defence, Pritchard being a bankrupt, and no assignees being chosen; I had the evidence in my pocket, and could have controverted that fact.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you take it up yourself?</p>
               <p>Levi. I do, as a friend to the community.</p>
               <p>Q. Without his desiring it?</p>
               <p>Levi. I did mention it at Sir

               <p>Q. Then you took it up as the prosecutor, without Mr. Cardineaux. Upon the faith and conscience of an honest man, has there been any quarrel between Bolland and you?</p>
               <p>Levi. On the faith and conscience of an honest man and a christian, I have not the least prejudice, or owe him the least ill will in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any personal quarrel with him?</p>
               <p>Levi. No; but he has done some of my clients great mischief, two eminent merchants in London; I shall not mention the circumstance unless the prisoner's council desires it.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray be a little particular respecting the conversation that passed between you and Cardineaux, when you gave him this receipt?</p>
               <p>Levi. I cannot really recollect any more of it.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time, for what purpose did you get the note of him?</p>
               <p>Levi. For the purpose it has answered; to prosecute him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Cardineaux that?</p>
               <p>Levi. I think not. What passed at Mr. Cardineaux's was, I said, are you willing or desirous to prosecute this man?</p>
               <p>Q. That was afterwards?</p>
               <p>Levi. No; at that meeting.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen Mr. Cardineaux till that time?</p>
               <p>Levi. No; to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cardineaux. This was the bill delivered to Mr. Levi at my house, in my presence.</p>
               <p>- Jesson. I had some business with one Mr. Lilburne, who appointed me to meet him at the George and Vultur tavern, Cornhill, on the 13th or 14th of October. I went about three o'clock; I was shewn into a public room; Mr. Lilburne and Mr. Bolland were there. I immediately asked Mr. Bolland when he would settle a note of fifty guineas of his, which I had discounted, which was due, and laid unpaid, as the person that held it was very desirous to settle it. He produced this note, and desired me to discount it, as he was out of cash, I read it; I knew Bradshaw, being a neighbour; and I knew Pritchard. The 50 l. note I had discounted was on Pritchard. This note was endorsed 
               <persName id="t17720219-46-person400">

            . I told him, that his name being on the back of it, I could not, or would not negociate it. I said, I looked upon Bradshaw to be good; but did not chuse to be on the same paper with Mr. Bolland's name, or to offer it indeed; and, I believe, I threw it down upon the table. Upon that he said, I can take off my name; and Mr. Lilburne took up one of the table knives, with intention to erase all the name. I believe, when he had erased all but the B, for he began at the latter end of the name, Bolland said, Don't scratch it all out, for it may disfigure it or cancel it, by scratching a hole in it. He said, he would think of some other name that begins with a B; and immediately filled it up with anks, which made the name of Banks; and when that was done, returned it to me. I did not like the transaction, it rather staggered me; but looking on Bradshaw to be a very good man, and Pritchard bore a very good character, as far as I could find, I thought I might as well take this security; it might be a means of getting the other matter settled; therefore I put it in my pocket. The next day I asked Mr. Cardineaux to discount me a note of Mr. Bradshaw's, of Charles-street, Covent-garden; he was a customer of Mr. Cardineaux's. He said, he would take it, and would probably do it on Friday, which is the day he did his business at his banker's. I left the bill with Mr. Cardineaux; and next day (Thursday) having some money to make up, I asked Cardineaux to let me have 15 l. 16 s. and if he did not discount the bill, I would return it him. He gave me a draft upon his banker for that sum; this was Thursday or Friday. On Saturday morning Mr. Bolland came up to my office; (I keep a lottery-office under the Piazza, Covent-garden) to enquire whether I had done the business or no. I told him, I had left the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177202190025"/> bill in the hands of Mr. Cardineaux; and he might enquire who Cardineaux was, as I could not go into the city then. I understood Mr. Bolland, that he saw Mr. Cardineaux; however, in the evening Mr. Handsforth came in, and told me, Mr. Bolland desired to see me in the Piazzas. I went out; he insisted upon having the bill or money; for he was greatly pushed for money, and must and would have it immediately. I believe he told me that he had seen Mr. Cardineaux in the city, and he would call upon me. I told him, if he would go to any public house in the neighbourhood, I would come to him. Upon that, he and Mr. Handsforth went to the Rainbow coffee-house in Queen-street, to wait for me. I sent down one of my clerks to Mr. Cardineaux, and he came up to the office soon after. I told him, that the person I had the note of, was gone to the coffee-house, and was anxious to have it settled. We went together to the Rainbow coffee-house; we went into a back room. I told Mr. Cardineaux, That is Mr. Bolland, the owner of the bill of Mr. Bradshaw's, that I left in your hands; and I shall be glad if you will settle it with him. Mr. Cardineaux said, he had never a banker's check in his pocket, and did not like to give a draft upon plain paper. He began to enquire who Mr. Pritchard and who Mr. Banks were. While Mr. Bolland was satisfying him who Pritchard was, I told Mr. Cardineaux, that rather than have the trouble of another meeting, I would go home and fetch him a check. Mr. Cardineaux gave me his keys, and I went down to his house in Craven-buildings, Drury-lane. I delivered the keys to Mrs. Cardineaux, and she gave me a banker's check. On my coming back, I found Mr. Bolland had satisfied Mr. Cardineaux concerning Banks and Pritchard; and he produced another bill for 10 l. which Mr. Cardineaux had agreed to discount for him.</p>
               <p>Q. At the George and Vulture in Cornhill, was any thing said by the prisoner who Banks was?</p>
               <p>Jesson. I believe I omitted that circumstance.</p>
               <p>Council for the prisoner. That is in London.</p>
               <p>Court. Certainly; and if an uttering is not proved in Middlesex, what passed in London to be sure is nothing; but what happened in London does make a part of the general story, and can't be omitted.</p>
               <p>Council for the prisoner. I am aware of that.</p>
               <p>Jesson. When I had it, after the name of Banks was on it, I put it into my pocket. I said, I shall give it to a particular friend of mine, and he will undoubtedly ask me who Banks is. He said, Banks is a publican or victualler, and lives near or in Rathbone-place.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the note produced then at the Rainbow coffee-house.</p>
               <p>Jesson. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed there then?</p>
               <p>Q. Jesson. I think the prisoner told him at that time, that he was a publican or victualler, in or near Rathbone-place; and I think he added, that he was a man of good character; a responsible man is what I mean by it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. At the George and Vulture you applied to Bolland about some money?</p>
               <p>Jesson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And a bill was produced?</p>
               <p>Jesson. This bill was produced.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it proposed by the prisoner to have that bill negociated in the state it then was?</p>
               <p>Jesson. Yes; he offered it me as it then stood.</p>
               <p>Q. You objected to taking the bill with his name on it?</p>
               <p>Jesson. I did; and he proposed to take his name off.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing at that time meant or intended by Bolland, or you, or Lilburne, more than to take Bolland's name entirely off, and to leave it on the credit of Bradshaw and Pritchard the indorser?</p>
               <p>Jesson. It was my opinion that it should be taken off; and Lilburne took it up to erase the name entirely off, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew Bradshaw then?</p>
               <p>Jesson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was a man in credit and character?</p>
               <p>Jesson. Yes, and credit; and Pritchard was in credit at that time. I had discounted a bill on Pritchard; I had enquired, and had a very good character of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you or not, an intention to pass this bill with Cardineaux on the credit of Bradshaw, at that time a good man?</p>
               <p>Jesson. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the intention was to take the name entirely off?</p>
               <p>Jesson. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177202190026"/>Q. And not to put any thing on it, thinking Bradshaw's name enough?</p>
               <p>Jesson. Bradshaw and Pritchard.</p>
               <p>Q. And I believe you would have taken it to Mr. Cardineaux, to discount it on the credit of Bradshaw and Pritchard, without any endorsement further?</p>
               <p>Jesson. I believe I should; but I should have taken an engagement of Bolland, to secure the money if it was not paid.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you, or not, before you had the bill of Bolland, at any time mentioned to Cardineanx, that you had a bill of this kind drawn by Bradshaw, and indorsed by Pritchard?</p>
               <p>Jesson. I do not remember that I had; I took it out and shewed it him, and said, Will you, Mr. Cardineaux discount this bill? I think I gave him the bill into his hand at the same time. I put the bill into his hand, and said, Here is a bill of Mr. Bradshaw's, will you discount me this note? or to that purpose. He said, At present it did not suit him to do it; probably in a day or two he would; this was, I think, Wednesday, and that Friday was the day he did business with his banker.</p>
               <p>Q. Cardineaux, you said, was enquiring after Pritchard, when you went home for a check to his house?</p>
               <p>Jesson. He was enquiring about Pritchard when I went for the check; the name Banks was mentioned either before or after.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it an apprehension that it might be mentioned?</p>
               <p>Jesson. I am certain it was mentioned that he was a publican or victualler, or some such thing, and lived near Rathbone-place.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure Cardineaux has not told you so since; or that you heard him?</p>
               <p>Jesson. I am sure I heard him tell him so.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect whether that note in your hand was produced at the Rainbow, or not?</p>
               <p>Jesson. I think it was; but am not clear.</p>
               <p>Court. How happened it that the names of the endorsers were known or remembered, if the note was not there? Was there any memorandum produced?</p>
               <p>Jesson. I think the bill itself was produced, to the best of my recollection; I got as far as Mr. Cardineaux said, It did not suit him to give all in cash; and he agreed to give so much cash and his own note, payable at the same time this bill should become due. I think he gave him his draft for 44 l. and his own note for the remainder of the money, except the 15 l. 16 s. which I paid to Bolland, reckoning that as so much already accounted for. Cardineaux left us; and Bolland said, Do you want this 15 l. 16 s. for any time? I said, it was just the hurry of our business; money is serviceable to us just at the drawing of the lottery; I will give you my note for a month. He 
               <persName id="t17720219-46-person401">
                  drew
               <interp inst="t17720219-46-person401" type="given" value="drew"/>

                  </persName>
             the note himself, and I signed it; and I paid it when due.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see Bolland, or had you any discourse with him afterwards?</p>
               <p>Jesson. When I saw in the paper that Bradshaw was a bankrupt, Mr. Cardineaux came to me, and said, You must take care of that 100 l. note of Bolland; for it is a hundred to one but my banker will return it to me immediately; I believe it is unusual to keep a note after a man is a bankrupt. I told him, I would take an opportunity to see Bolland. I was going that day into the city, and called at his house; he was not at home; but I saw him afterwards at the Sword-blade coffee-house. I said to him, That note of 100 l. of Bradshaw's, which I got Mr. Cardineaux to discount for you, will not be paid, for Bradshaw is in the papers to-day; he is a bankrupt; you must take care of it against it becomes due. Upon that he looked at me: What note? says he. I said, that note that I got Mr. Cardineaux to discount for you. The note was discounted the 18th or 19th of October; and I believe Bradshaw became a bankrupt between a fortnight and three weeks after. Upon mentioning this to Bolland, he said, What note are you talking of? I said, Bradshaw's note, payable to Pritchard; you must take care of it. Said he, Is my name upon it? I said, No; your name was upon it, but Banks's name is now upon it; you stood in his shoes, and must take care of it. He said, indeed, he knew nothing at all of it. I said, you know Mr. Lilburne was present, and you must take care of it. He said, indeed, he knew nothing of it, nor should. I said, very well; then I will let Mr. Cardineaux know immediately the circumstances, and your putting of Banks's name on it; upon which he laughed or sneered at me, and said, I'll forgive you all you can do upon that account. I told him I would acquaint Mr. Cardineaux of the transaction, and on my return home I called upon Mr. Cardineaux; he was not at home; but he called upon me next morning, and at the same time Mr. Handsforth came in, and I immediately acquainted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177202190027"/> Mr. Cardineaux with the transaction of the ank's being put upon the note, and that it was not likely that he would get any satisfaction of Bolland.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You said Bolland must stand to it; then you considered the name of Banks as the indorsement of Bolland?</p>
               <p>Jesson. Yes; I knew he had the money for it, and it was nothing but right that he should pay it.</p>
               <p>Q. And he was liable to pay it?</p>
               <p>Jesson. Yes; and if he had paid it when it became due, nothing of this I believe would have happened.</p>
               <p>Q. From the Jury. At the time the erasement was made, and the name of Banks added to it, in what light did you take it, by way of giving more credit to the note, or by way of filling up the erasement?</p>
               <p>Jesson. I looked upon it he did it to make the bill negotiable; for a person would hardly take a bill in payment after a name is erased, for they imagine there is some reason for its being scratched out.</p>
               <p>Q. Council for the prisoner. Do you know how Mr. Lilburne came to stop at the letter B? was there any fold of the bill?</p>
               <p>Jesson. No; it does not go to the fold.</p>
               <p>Q. From one of the Jury. I imagine you looked upon it to be a mere fictitious name at that time?</p>
               <p>Court. No; he gave an account who this Banks was.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. Mr. Cardineaux, please to tell what passed about that note when Jesson brought it to you.</p>
               <p>Cardineaux. Jesson came to me with this note, and asked me if I could discount it; and that the person would lend him 15 l. if I would do it; and he said, I should do him a service. I told him I knew Bradshaw very well, but did not know Pritchard nor Banks, therefore could not discount it till I was satisfied of both the indorsers. Jesson said, he knew Pritchard very well, that he was a dealer in horses, and as for Banks he did not know him. I desired him to enquire, and I would till then keep the bill by me. He went out and brought me in writing the direction of Banks; that he dealt in wine and brandy, and lived in Rathbone place. I kept the bill by me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at either of these times tell you whom he had the bill of?</p>
               <p>Cardineaux. He did not then. And I kept the bill till the Saturday; then Mr. Jesson told me, that Mr. Bolland was the proprietor of the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known Bolland at that time?</p>
               <p>Cardineaux. No; I had never seen him. On Saturday, I was at the Edinburgh coffee-house near the Exchange; Bolland came there, and asked me, whether I would discount the bill Jesson gave me. I told him I had not had time to enquire about the endorsers; that I knew the drawer very well. He said, Pritchard was well known by every body; that he was a dealer in horses, and a man of great property, he told me Banks was also a man of property, and dealt largely in wine and spirits in Rathbone place, and I told him, I would consider about his bill. He wanted the money he said. I told him I had the bill of Mr. Jesson, and must see him before I accounted for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask Bolland to indorse the note?</p>
               <p>Cardineaux. No; I went to Jesson: upon my enquiring why Bolland's name was not upon the bill; he said that Bolland, though a man of property, it was better that his name should not appear upon the bill, because he was formerly a sheriff's officer, and that I could not pass the bill properly to my banker with his endorsement, therefore his name was not on it. I was afterwards sent for by Jesson; he and I went to the coffee-house in King-street Covent-Garden; that was Saturday: I found there Mr. Bolland and one Mr. Handsforth; Mr. Jesson came with me there. I took the bill out of my pocket. I had not had time to enquire about Pritchard and Banks. Bolland told me, that they were men of property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing more about Banks?</p>
               <p>Cardineaux. He told me Pritchard was a man of property, well known to be so, and that Banks was so, and dealt largely in wine and spirits, and lived in Rathbone place: upon my telling Bolland, it was not convenient for me to give him all in cash, he said he would be contented with half in cash, and he took my note at two months for 50 l. Not having any check with me, I gave Mr. Jesson the key of my beaureau, and he brought me a check. Mr. Bolland shewed me another little bill of ten guineas, and asked me to give him cash for it. I said I would; so I had the two bills, which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177202190028"/> made 110 l. 10 s. and I gave him a draft upon my banker for 44 l. 5 s. 10 d. - 15 l. 16 s. I had before given to Mr. Jesson; that, with my note of hand for 50 l. and 9 s. discount, made up the money.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you advanced the money for these notes, did you apply to Bolland to indorse it?</p>
               <p>Cardineaux. No; because Jesson said it was better his name should not appear on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or any body in your presence, desire him to indorse it?</p>
               <p>Cardineaux. No; some time after Bradshaw appeared in the Gazette; that made me uneasy, because I did not know the solidity of the endorsers; not knowing where Bolland lived, I went to Jesson's and got a direction to him; I went to his house, but he was not at home; then I went to Jesson and told him to go to Bolland, and tell him that I must have a security from the endorsers. I forgot to mention that when I paid the money, Bolland desired me to make the draft on my banker, in the name of Handsforth; as I said before, I could not meet with Mr. Bolland; I went into the City at last about business, to the Hamburgh coffee-house. I saw Bolland there. I said, that bill I discounted for you will not be paid: he, with an air of astonishment, said, what bill! I said the bill I discounted for you at such a coffee-house; said he, I never discounted a bill with you, sir, you mistake me, my name is 
               <persName id="t17720219-46-person402">

            , I never saw you in my life, nor you have no bill with my indorsement. Upon which being informed by Mr. Jesson, previous to that, that he did alter the name, I went to him privately in the coffee-house, and said, Mr. Bolland, you must not deny the thing, for I know all the transaction; I know who wrote Banks upon the bill. Upon that, he said, make yourself easy, the bill will be paid when due, and signified that I should prove the debts against Bradshaw, and what ever I received, he would pay the residue. I said, no, I would not; my business was with Mr. Pritchard and Mr. Banks; upon which I went out of the coffee-house. I told Bolland another time, that if he was not in present cash, if he had any good bill I would take it in payment, but he had no bill to offer me that I could approve; and he put me off, and said I must go to Pritchard, that he was going to sell part of his effects and would pay me. I did, but could get none; I left the bill with Mr. Morris, and desired he would call upon Mr. Bolland for the money; for the bill was then due; since that time I have never seen Mr. Bolland: after Mr. Bolland was taken, a person brought the 100 l. in the name of

               <p>Cardineaux. Because I delivered it to Mr. Morris; and he delivered it to Mr. Levi, who gave him a receipt for it.</p>

               <p>Cardineaux. I told Mr. Pritchard of the forgery; and he told Mr. Levi. Mr. Levi came to me, and asked me if I was willing to prosecute Mr. Bolland. I said, if I thought it was the duty of an honest man to do it, I would do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think it the duty of an honest man or not?</p>
               <p>Cardineaux. I thought it was. I looked upon my money to be lost. Pritchard was then a bankrupt as well as Bradshaw.</p>
               <p>Q. You mentioned, that besides this bill of 100 l. there was another of 10 l. 10 s. Who was that note made to?</p>

               <p>Council for the crown. Then this receipt was a draft upon Bolland's banker for to pay a 100 l. due upon a 200 l. note?</p>

               <p>I never in my life forged with intent to cheat or defraud any person in the world. Please to ask Mr. Cardineaux, when he applied to me if I did not desire him to prove his debt under Bradshaw's commission and I would make good the deficiency; so I could have no design to cheat: there were two 100 l. notes to Pritchard; one he took back; I gave him a draft upon Sir

               <p>Court. You must take that together with the evidence of Pritchard's clerk, who tells you this particular 100 l. was paid for a particular purpose.</p>

On the 23d of January, about half after one, I was sitting in my counting-house behind my shop; the prisoner came into the shop; she put her bundle on the counter and took it up again, and with it this piece of calicoe. We were all at dinner at the time. I shewed her a handkerchief, and asked her half a crown; she bid me 1 s. 6 d. that strengthened my suspicion of her having stole something. I let her go out of the shop; then I went after her and brought her back; and throwing back her cloak, I took from under her arm this calicoe.</p>

               <p>Lewis. I don't know; I am not cert ain whether she had the bundle afterwards, because another person was with her; she cried, and begged I would not prosecute her. I told her, I had so many things of the kind lately, that I could not forgive it.</p>

               <p>Lewis. She had a bundle in her hand, which she laid down upon a great many goods which were upon the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe where she put her bundle upon it?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I could not see exactly. She did it but bunglingly; and as she stood I could see it under her cloak, as she held her cloak on one side.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was her bundle then?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I believe under her other arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to it?</p>
               <p>Lewis. There is no mark upon it; I believe it to be mine.</p>

On the first of February the prisoner came to my master's in the evening, to ask for a bit of black stuff; I shewed her a remnant of half a yard, which she agreed to give 6 d. for. She stood close to the shew-board in the window. There were two red cloaks and a black sattin<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177202190031"/> one; they were folded up; she had a child in her arms; she put the child on the counter between me and the window. She gave me a 5 s. 3 d. I said, I cannot change it for 6 d. Then she said she would have a bit of pink stuff; I went backwards to get the change, and when I came to her again, I observed her drawing a cloak out of the window upon the counter. I sold her a yard of the stuff, and gave her change. I called our young man up, and asked him if he had taken the cloak out of the window; he said, No. The prisoner went out; I followed her when she had got about ten yards, and desired her to walk in again. She said, what do you want? I have got nothing of yours. As she was coming back, I saw her attempt to drop something from under her arm; I held her arm, and the cloak from under it. (The cloak produced.) Here is my master's shop mark upon it. She confessed she was a little in liquor, and did not intend to take it; but if I would let her go, she would give me all she had, and go into the country.</p>

               <p>The prisoner in her defence said, she set her child down upon the counter; and whether the child took it up or no, she could not tell; that she had been a wet-nurse since her husband's death; and that she was in liquor at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. to Chitlow. Had she the child in her arms?</p>
               <p>Chitlow. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the cloak under the same arm as the child?</p>
               <p>Chitlow. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in liquor?</p>
               <p>Chitlow. I believe she was a little.</p>

I was in the back room; my opposite neighbour came in, and said a person had stole my roll of cloth and run up Chick-lane. I missed the cloth and ran after him; I catched him just by Black-boy-alley. He got away from me by main force, and went down King's-arms-yard in Chick-lane. He was taken that night in Black-boy-alley, in a disorderly house, for beating a woman. A constable was got, who took him, and found in his pocket some tools for house-breaking. I was sent for to appear against him; I took him before the Lord Mayor.

I was alarmed at five o'clock the next morning by a lodger in the house; I ran down stairs almost naked. When I saw the situation of things I judged that a servant had done it, and I suspected a servant that had left me a short time before that. I found the bar open, and a hole was cut in the bar big enough to put a hand in to pull back the spring-lock and the bolt, and then they could get the shutters down.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they down?</p>
               <p>Bellinger. Yes, it was all thrown open, and there were seven table-spoons, a large soupspoon, and two tea-spoons. The drawer in which they were was shut in with a cupboard; the drawer of the till was cut open; a piece of wood was cut off, and so the till was got out: there was about a crown's-worth of half-pence taken out of the till. I found a tool that is used by bricklayers labourers, that I shewed in court, upon the trial of two of the men, I have not got it now. I can say nothing of my own knowledge against the prisoner.

            . I was a supernumerary watchman that night. I went round at ten o'clock and twelve. At half after twelve o'clock the prisoner came and whistled through his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177202190034"/> fingers three times; he was dressed in light cloaths; I am sure he is the man; the moon shone as bright as day. After he had whistled, the sash was thrown up, and one looked out at the window up two pair of stairs in the prosecutrix's house, and they discoursed together for a considerable time. The prisoner stood upon the ground by me when the accomplice talked to him out at the window. I thought they were both lodgers in the house. At last the accomplice asked where they were; the prisoner said, all together. The prisoner asked him whether he would come down or no; he said he would not. Then the clock struck one; I took my candle and lanthorn and called the hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you think the three whistles were for?</p>
               <p>Weatherby. To call his comrade; I thought he was a lodger and wanted to get in. When I came back he was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is your box from the house?</p>
               <p>Weatherby. About ten yards.</p>
               <p>Q. How far do you go when you cry the hour?</p>
               <p>Weatherby. It takes me up very near a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay upon the stand?</p>
               <p>Weatherby. Till almost six in the morning. About half after two o'clock Samuel Higbed, who had been a waiter in the house, came by himself. I thought he had lived in the house. Then he threw something up to the window; I went to him, and told him he should not throw any thing up at the window, for if he broke the window I should be answerable for it. He flung something out of his hand; I heard it. rattle against the window. I saw the sash move up, and somebody put out a hand and wagged it. I could see nothing but the hand. I went to the door, and found it unshut; two men came out, and after that two more; I thought they were lodgers, and were going to their work.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner one of them?</p>
               <p>Weatherby. He that had white cloaths on was one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner one of the first two or last?</p>
               <p>Weatherby. He was the third, I believe. I walked backwards and forwards all the time, to prevent any disturbance, because the door was a-jar. When the man came up to light the fire, I told him the people they kept in the house were very irregular.</p>

            . As I was going down Ludgate-hill, in my way home, on January 14, I met the prisoner following this gentleman; he walked a great peace, so that sometimes the prisoner was on a trot just before I got to Ave-Maria-lane, above Ludgate-Church, I saw him take a handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket. I did not stop the prisoner, for fear I should loose the prosecutor, but went up to the gentleman, and told him he was robbed of his handkerchief, he said he should have three handkerchiefs; he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out two, and said he had lost one. I told him if he would go along with me I dare say I should catch the person that stole it before he got to Temple-bar; soon after that I heard the prisoner in the coachway hallowing out Tom. I took him to the salop shop; there was a woman at the door, she took up a handkerchief which she said the prisoner dropt; the prosecutor said if it was his handkerchief, it was tore at one corner; upon examining it, we found it was tore at the corner.</p>

My man shewed her a petticoat; she agreed to give 19 s. for it. She wanted an ordinary crape. I looked it for her. She said she was going a little further and could not conveniently stay, but would call in half an hour: her countenance changing, I suspected she had taken something.

Then Westley struck Unwin again, and Unwin fell under the grate a-cross the sender, and there was blood came from his mouth and nose. I gave him some spiritous liquors to wash his mouth with; he went away, and came again in the evening with two or three other people, and made a great riot.

            . I am a journeyman apothecary. I attended the deceased the day after Christmas-day; he complained of being very ill, and said it was occasioned by the kick of a horse. He said he had been in the country. I understood him to speak of a transaction on Sunday. I opened his face; there were two wounds; his nose and eyes were black, they were closed up with a swelling; and there was a contusion on his forehead. There were no symptoms of a fracture. There was bleeding at the ears and nose, and occasionary delirium, and an inclination to vomit, which we consider as a symptom of a fracture or concussion of the brain. I could find no fracture or fissure; but I concluded from these symptoms, that there must be a concussion of the brain in consequence of an injury he had received. I attended him ten days; three or four of those days he was delirious; at the time I dressed him he was delirious. The first time, when he talked of a kick of a horse, he was sensible by degrees as the swelling went off; and he had complaints of another nature, he seemed asthmatic, and something dropsical. At the end of these ten days I was taken ill myself; in consequence of which another person attended him. When I got better I carried in my bill for my attendance upon him. I found then the visible external injuries were all got well; the confusion and the swellings were gone, and the wounds upon his nose had a scab on them, so that all appearances of danger were over, but he complained of shortness of breath, and was in danger of suffocation. He was sent to the hospital, and I saw no more of him till he was dead. I understand that at the hospital he was treated by Dr. Pitcairn as for a dropsy.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual for a concussion of the brain to take that turn?</p>
               <p>Clows. I can't say I know that; but I have known these asthmatic complaints to follow upon such a dropsy.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in his defence said, that the deceased first began the fray, by taking him by the nose, and threatening him; that he called him a kidnapper, because he raised recruits for the india company; that upon that Unwin came forward, and asked him how the prisoner knew him to be a kidnapper; that then he said something which enraged Unwin, and Unwin struck him a second blow; that as he was going to strike him a third time, that then he struck him, and he fell upon the hearth. He called several witnesses, who corroborated his defence, and others that deposed, that he was a peaceable man, but if injured would stand upon his defence.</p>
