                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, at 11, Greek Street, Soho—on 26th July last, the prisoner came and wished to borrow some money on some furs—he brought forty-three sables, a gold watch, and a ring—I asked who he was, and he produced this bill head; I then asked him as to the value of the property—he produced this invoice and said it represented forty of the forty-three sables that he brought—I remarked that the invoice purported that the sables had tails, and those he produced had no tails—he said he had cut off the tails and used them in his business for muffs, &amp;c.—I said that the invoice represented forty, whereas the goods offered were forty-three sables—he said he had brought three sables from his stock—I then lent him 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on this agreement note; I lent the money, believing that the forty skins cost 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—before I lent the money he signed this agreement note. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 26th July</hi>, 1875, <hi rend="italic">signed "M. Bernard Co.</hi>, 3, <hi rend="italic">Princes Street, Finsbury"</hi>) He showed me a letter or telegram and stated that he had to take up an acceptance which had been dishonoured—I am a judge of the value of jewellery—the value of the watch and ring is from 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—after he had got the money the skins were done up in a parcel and sent, upstairs into the warehouse, the. jewellery was done up with the invoice and sent downstairs into the plate-room, and the ticket No. 802 was pinned on to the skins, which number corresponded with the number of the agreement which the prisoner signed—at the expiration of the term the goods were sent to public sale; but there was no bid for them—I went to Mr. Davis, and afterwards went to the police-court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I advanced the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., believing the skins cost 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have a good many establishments at the West-end—I have not a good deal of experience in furs—the prisoner came to me three times—he pledged furs on two occasions, this was the first transaction: he came and. had</p>

               <p>another loan of 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have four assistants on the premises; I advanced the money without inquiring as to the value of the furs, that is not the way I generally do business, but my manager was away on his holiday, and therefore I had nobody I could send out—I thought I had a good property from the representations made—"Bernard Co." I presume means a partner; I don't know it of my own actual knowledge that he had a p partner—I have not tried to find out, or inquired—I found out that the invoice was a fraudulent one after I had sent the goods to sale, I first found out that the furs were not of the value, I supposed—he did not leave some of the goods with me first of all for me to look at—he came into my private office—he was there from fifteen to twenty minutes—from three to five days elapsed between the first and second time of his coming—I believe he brought all the 120 skins together to me on the second occasion—perhaps I said before the Magistrate that he first brought eighty and forty subsequently; if it is put down I presume I did say so—any fool would know that the tails were gone from the furs—the skins are all here—I will not say that this was the first transaction in skins that I ever had, but it was the first one I can remember, certainly the first to this amount, I may have had a skin for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or something of that sort—shortly before this I had a great quantify of sealskins left, but I did not lend any money on them, they had been in the house ten years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He produced an invoice on the second occasion—I have not got back my 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the third time he came I believe was on 3rd August, and he wanted some more money lent; I did not see him then; I implicitly believed in this document, without such a document I would not have parted with the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not advance anything on the third parcel of skins; I kept them—they were perhaps of the value of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I have kept them up to this time and refused to give them up—I may have said that his partner brought the third lot.</p>

Davis Co., fur skin merchants—this is one of my printed memorandum forms—I do not know the writing on this paper—there has been no such transaction with my firm as is represented there—no one in jay firm authorised the making of such a memorandum—I have do idea how that memorandum came off my premises, we never had any trans<lb/>action with the prisoner—I don't know him—I have looked at these skins; I should say the outside value of them would be between 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and.25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—skins vary greatly in value, from 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., according to quality.</p>

               <p>the Magistrate "I know Bernard, of Finsbury Square personally, he has been to our place of business"—I have seen Bernard once or twice—I don't know whether he was in partnership with the prisoner—I knew he was something in the fur trade—I have not had any dealings with him, nor has my firm—the firm consists of myself, my father and brother—I am not always there, if I am not my brother is—this is not the writing of any person in our firm.</p>

The furs upon which the prisoner got 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. were sent to auction and they were bought in without a bid—when he came the third time the skins were stopped, that was without his consent; he did not summons me to the police-court for detaining them, but Mr. Knox sent a constable and asked me to come round, and I went before Mr. Knox and explained the matter—I satisfied him that the 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been fraudulently obtained, and he said that there was not a shadow of a stain resting upon me—when I left the Court the clerk came out with me, the prisoner was annoying me in the street, and the clerk said, "You had better come round to the police-station and be charged, rather than let him follow you", I did so, and the inspector refused to take the charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cellar man, and live 33, Burnside Street, Bow—on 25th February, a little after 7 o'clock, I heard a cry of "Stop thief" as I was coming up St. Peter's Road, I saw Parker running round the corner, I caught him by the collar—he said "Let me go, it is only an affair of punching a man in the nose"—I said "I shall do nothing of the kind, stop with me"—I held him and the old lady and gentleman came up—the prosecutor said "Give me my watch and chain"—he said "I have not got your watch and chain"—he said "No, you have got my chain"—he turned round and said "I never done such a thing as this before," and he went on his knee and cried, or attempted to cry, and said "If I tell you where your chain is, will you let me go"—the prosecutor said "I will"—he said "There it is in the gutter, there"—the old lady picked it up and gave it to me—a policeman came up in a few minutes and I handed him over and gave the chain to the sergeant at the station—I saw nothing of Wortley.</p>

               <p>out, and I appealed to my own crew and the gentlemen passengers to come out for God's sake and let the ladies have the first chance—some men got out, gentlemen passengers and some of my own crew, and two or three of the ladies <hi rend="italic">got</hi> out, saying "If it will help you, captain, we will get out"—they <hi rend="italic">got</hi> out and I directed them to go into the other lifeboat on the star-board side, which they did—we then swung the port lifeboat out and lowered her down into the water—I saw the boat unhooked from the tackles and told the crew to shove off—just at this moment a heavy sea, caused, I think, by the sinking of the vessel's stern, drove the boat forcibly against the ship's side and overturned her—I then immediately turned my attention to the starboard lifeboat, but seeing the ship had sunk so much then I saw we had no time to endeavour to lower her, and I gave orders to unhook the tackles and get her all cleared, so that she might float off the dock—there were a number of people in her; this had already been done; I could not be sure whether the whole of this order had been executed before I was washed off the bridge; the ship bad gone down so far that the bridge was submerged—I found myself on the fore part of the deck—I was washed over the fore part of the bridge on to the forepart of the deck—I scrambled up to the bows, the ship was then lying so that her deck was a good inclined plane—I looked round and saw that the starboard lifeboat was bottom upwards—I then looked around to see what assistance was near us, and I saw the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> steaming away—I saw the barque <hi rend="italic">Queen of Nations</hi>—I did not know then that it was the <hi rend="italic">Queen of Nations</hi>, but I saw a barque, I saw a Deal lugger and a tug boat—at this moment the vessel seemed to me to be going down entirely and not being much of a swimmer I took a plank under my arm and jumped overboard—as I floated beyond the ship I saw two ladies in the water holding on to a rope that was attached to the ship; with a little as<lb/>sistance from me they left the rope and joined me holding the plank; one of the ladies seemed very much exhausted and held on only a few minutes, and then she dropped off and sank—the other lady remained on the plank for nearly half an hour with me, I was talking to her, I knew her by her face; I knew who she was, a lady named Tubbs, I think; I had been intro<lb/>duced to her the afternoon previous; I think I knew her very well by face, but I could not remember the name until I saw her likeness after coming on shore and then I recognised her, it was the same Mrs. Tubbs—I helped her and encouraged her and tried to keep her mouth shut, she was calling for help and praying, and calling on her children, and seemed to be swallow<lb/>ing a great deal of water, and at last she let go the plank; I got her by the shoulder and pulled her towards me again, I saw that her face was lying under water, I lifted it up and tried to hold her, and I did, I think, for a minute or two, but I was getting so exhausted myself and I thought she was dead that I had to let her go—I was. ultimately picked up by the Deal lugger <hi rend="italic">Early Morn</hi>—I had been in the water about forty minutes, as near as I can judge—we were about 2 miles from Dover Pier when my vessel was struck by the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> and about 2 1/4 miles from the land—the tonnage of my vessel was 1,254 nett register and 1950 gross register.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. We were a little over half a mile, I think, from Dover Pier, when we stopped to land the pilot, he landed on our port side, we were off the pier a little more than ten minutes before we started again on our course, the head of the Admiralty Pier, is about S S E, I think—while we were waiting there we were pushed further towards the cast by the wind and tide—the tide was flowing about E S E—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187604030024"/>
               <p>we were about a mile east of the pier when we started on our course for the Channel, perhaps rather more—the head of our vessel was then nearly south, a little to the east of south—I first saw the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>, just previous to starting, but took no particular notice of her then—I first began to take particular notice of her as soon as I had given the order to full speed ahead; I judged her then to be about 3 miles off, or between 3 or 4; I really could not judge the distance correctly, but that was the idea I formed at the time, I think—she was then taking her course down Channel, I think that would be WSW, (I was steering S W by S,) that was her right course; she never altered her course at all that I noticed; she appeared to come on the same course until just previous to the collision—I had her in sight the whole of the time, now and again, I was watching her, coming along, of course I had to look out ahead of my ship, not astern—the only thing I did, was to port my helm, half a point before the collision—I say that the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> was a following vessel—I was not crossing her bows—had our courses been parallel we could not have crossed, but they were not parallel, and therefore at one time either one vessel or the other must have crossed; I don't say I would have gone across her bows, she might have gone across mine, she appeared to me to be going that way—the captain standing on the bridge of the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>, might have formed reasonably the judgment that we were coming across his bows—the lines were so nearly parallel, and the <hi rend="italic">Franconia's</hi> bows being on our stern, I naturally concluded seeing that she was coming after, that she was a following vessel, also a crossing vessel, in the sense that at some point our courses must have crossed—she might also naturally conclude that we were a crossing vessel—I judged she was about quarter of a mile distant when she put her helm to port—if she had put her helm hard to port half mile, she would have gone under our stern—she struck us about 60 feet from our stern, I am not sure—it was a question of 60 feet, I suppose whether she came into collision with us or not, when her helm was ported—had she been a little further off it would have been easier for her to have ported; she ought to have ported a little sooner than she did, perhaps she could have done it safely, 300 or 400 yards sooner—I did not see the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> wave us to port; I am not aware that any one on our vessel did see him; I have not heard of it from any of our own people; I have heard it said in the other Court, on the other side—we were 1 1/4 miles from the Admiralty Pier when the collision took place, nearly 2 1/2 miles, I am not sure of the distance, I don't think it would be 2 1/2 miles—I intended to have gone out about 5 miles in order to get an offing—in the state of the weather that day I considered it not my duty to go only half a mile from the Admiralty Pier, and then take the course for the Channel W S W—the weather was moderate, there was nothing in the way previous to the collision, it had been raining—it was perfectly clear at the time of the collison—we could have steered out half a mile, and then taken a course straight down channel, but that would have taken us very close to the land—the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> was going straight down channel—I say she was going more rapidly than we were, because I saw her approaching us so quickly—I did not get out of her way and turn down channel, because article 17 of the rules of the road at sea, says, that the vessel who is ahead or who is on the starboard side of another one must keep her course, and the other one must keep out of her way—I think articles 14 and 17 refer to that—I am not allowed to keep clear of her, I should have done</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187604030025"/>
               <p>wrong had I gone away, moreover I believed that she was the vessel that had to keep out of the way, and I thought she would—our full speed is nine knots, the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> appeared to be going at a greater rate, of course, I could not positively tell—it would take us some little time to obtain the speed of nine knots, although the engines started full speed, we were going nine knots for about sixteen minutes. (<hi rend="italic">Rule</hi> 17 <hi rend="italic">was read by Counsel:</hi> "A vessel overtaking any other vessel shall keep out of the way of the said last mentioned vessel.") The <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> could not in some sense he said to be an overtaking vessel—our stern was beyond her bow; we were ahead of her—it was a question of who was crossing the bows—we would have crossed, but whether she would have crossed us or we her was a question relating to speed; it was a question which would cross the bows of the other first—I am quite familiar with article 16, which says: "A steam ship when approaching another ship so as to. involve risk of collision, shall slacken her speed, or if necessary stop and reverse"—I did not slacken and reverse, because I was not the overtaking ship—that was my only reason, it was not my duty to do it I say, and at the same time had I done it the collision would have occurred—when I saw that the collision was inevitable, then the rules tell me to do something to prevent it; that is my judgment—when I saw that the collision was certain I did try to avoid it, not pre<lb/>vious—when I saw it was certain I attempted to avoid it—if other ships had been coming in the same course as the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>, I must have crossed them, either at the bow or the stern—I know that it is usual for vessels of our description to go out more than a mile—I mean a large ship with passengers on board—I am aware that the bearing of the wreck of the <hi rend="italic">Strathclythe</hi> is S S E of the Admiralty pier—I am aware of articles 19 and '20. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "In obeying and construing these rules, due regard must he had to all dangers of navigation, and due regard must also he had to any special circumstances which may exist in particular cases rendering a departure from the above rules necessary in order to avoid immediate danger." "Nothing in these rules shall exonerate any ship or owner, or master or crew thereof from the consequences of any neglect to carry any lights or signals, or any precaution which may be requisite by the ordinary practice of seamen, or by the special circumstances of the case.") I consider those two rules in the light of controlling rules of the others—they give a large discretion to the captain of a ship in the management of his vessel when he sees danger; at the point of danger I did do something.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE SOLICITOR-GENERAL</hi>. Those articles are only provisoes in certain cases—Article 18 says "By the above rules one £two ships is to keep out of the way, the other shall keep her course, subject to the qualify<lb/>cation contained in the following articles"—my strict rule would have been to keep my course and not alter it at all till I saw danger, but when I saw danger of collision I did alter my course by half a point, so that I did as far as I could follow that exceptional rule (<hi rend="italic">Article</hi> 14 <hi rend="italic">again read</hi>)—I never had the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> on my starboard side—I had not the slightest reason to sup-pose that the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> would not act according to these rules, and if she had there would have been no collision—it was not a proper course to run it so fine as to port within 400 feet, not when there was plenty of room—as a matter of fact I was going down Channel—had we been going right across to Calais we should have been going almost at right angles to the course of the <hi rend="italic">Franconia:</hi> he would still, in my opinion, have been a following vessel, his bow was astern of us, on our quarter—when I first saw him he was between 3</p>

               <p>and 4 miles east of us; the course of both of us was west, with a modicum of south, towards the S W; we were both coming from the east—my reason for going out 5 miles was that it had been raining previously, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, and the fog had hung about the high lands, and I thought it was going to be <hi rend="italic">foggy</hi> that night; the wind was westerly, and I knew that this west wind would be bringing a number of sailing ships up Channel towards Dungeness for pilots, where the pilots are put on board—1 should have to clear Dungeness—having landed my pilot I wanted no further com<lb/>munication with the shore, and therefore I thought it was best to go outside the track of the vessels coming up seeking pilots at Dungeness, and I would have passed Dungeness between 7 and 8 miles off—it did become foggy that night, before dark—I consider it was the proper course to take in coming out that way, and I think it was the prudent course, considering the number of lives I had under my charge, that I ought to have taken.</p>

There is a light on the S W of the Barne Sand—if I had kept on my course of 5 miles, allowing for the tide that was running against me, it would have left me 3 miles away from the Barne Sand, and I should not have come near the N E bay—by the course I was steering I was coming more out to the lightship, which is a considerable dis<lb/>tance further from the pier head than the bay—when I had got to the 5 miles I should have altered my course down channel, taking the Red sand light as my mark, which is about 11 1/2 miles from Dungeness—I was making a straight line for about 6 miles off Dungeness.</p>

               <p>Us; she turned sharp round to the right, bringing her bows in the direction of our vessel—I did not see anybody on the forepart of the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> at that moment; to the best of my belief there was not anybody—the collision occurred almost immediately afterwards, there was a terrible shock, I was thrown off my legs by it—I did not notice the hole that was made by the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> in the side of our vessel—I stood looking at the vessel for some moments, and then ran up the rigging; several persons crowded up the rigging—I slid down almost immediately, as the vessels were separating, and ran down the companion to my cabin and got my belt and put it on; I then came on deck and went on the bridge—I got into the lifeboat for a short time—I did not hear the captain, speak, a lady spoke, and then I came out and saw others come out also—I saw the port lifeboat lowered, I did not see it swamped—I walked across the deck and got into the starboard lifeboat—then I noticed that the stern of our vessel went down, and almost imme<lb/>diately afterwards there was a puff of steam went up close by me and there was a cry that the boilers would burst, and I then looked round and saw the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> steaming away in the distance towards the land on our starboard quarter—shortly after that our vessel went down and the starboard lifeboat was capsized—the first thing I can remember after being capsized was being under the boat; I managed to get clear of it, and when I came to the sur<lb/>face I caught hold of a hencoop that was floating by and by means of that was picked up by a boat called the <hi rend="italic">Brave Nelson</hi> of Deal—I did not see a number of people in the water; just before I was capsized I noticed Captain Beckett pass by me, he was in the water—a few seconds elapsed between the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> turning sharp round and the collision; it is difficult to say, but not more than a few seconds.</p>

               <p>considering that we were going 9 or 9 1/2 knots, the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> must have been going at least 11—I did not see any change in her speed as she approached us—she struck us more than once; she first struck us and then rebounded; she must have done so—she was towering above us, very much higher, when she was in collision with us—I took a momentary glance at the damage done to our vessel, and saw a tremendous gash in our ship—I saw others rushing up the rigging, and I rushed up also and got on board the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>, others did the same, the rigging was crowded—when I got on board the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>, I rushed along the deck and shouted "boats" pointing to them to everybody I met—I did not see the defendant at that time. I did afterwards, while we were working at the starboard boat to try and get it out, other persons on board the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> worked at it afterwards, they were some of my own men—I heard an exclamation in English, "My God, my poor shipmates", I looked up and saw my ship sinking, and then I ran to the bridge—it was George Mclntyre, who made the exclamation—when I went on to the bridge I saw the defendant and another man who proved to be the English pilot—I stood between them and pointed to my ship and begged them to go back to her—I said "Go to my ship, go back to my ship," pointing to her—she must have been half a mile off then as near as I could judge—the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> had been going on towards Dover, while I was on board—the English pilot replied, "My dear man we are sinking too"—I could not say whether the defendant was there then, he was standing there, walking across the bridge, the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> appeared to be going pretty fast in the water; I said various things to the defendant at different intervals, nothing further about our ship that I remember—I saw her sink, that could not be ten minutes after she was struck—none of the boats of the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> were lowered into the water—she was sounded, after a suggestion made by myself to sound her; I suggested to the captain that soundings should be taken—I asked him if she was making water—he told me the fore compartment was full—some one came to the bridge and received orders from the captain to sound her and a report was brought back sometime after that she was making no water—that was about twenty minutes or half an hour after the collision; she did not at any time appear to be sinking—we went on to Dover Bay—a man came on board in a row boat from the shore—all the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> boats, but two or three were swung outside ready, level with the ship's rail—the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> went to the Downs, before she stopped—there would be a difficulty in lowering boats with a vessel going through the water; if she had stopped there would have been no difficulty whatever in lowering boats.</p>

I did not see the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> when she was lying off the Admiralty Pier—I saw her at about 2 miles distance as near as I could judge—I looked at her occasionally; I did not watch her particularly—I may have looked at her more than once when I was by the side of the captain, I don't remember—I presume our helm was ported half a point because the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> was coming near us; I dare say that was the reason, I believe it to have been the reason—that was the only thing that was done on board our ship before the collision—we were going full speed, that is from 8 1/2 to 9 knots—when the collision took place I received no orders from anyone to go on board the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>—it was the impulse of the moment, seeing others rush to the rigging; I thought the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> would go right over our ship—I got from the rigging over her rail—I saw no ropes hanging from the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>, I was too much excited</p>

                  </hi>. I was a quarter-master of the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi>—I was at the wheel after she left Dover—soon after we left; the captain gave the course S W by S and soon after S W half S—when that alteration was made the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> was almost abeam of us, a little abaft the port beam—I should say she was a quarter of a mile from us, perhaps less, perhaps more—the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> was going faster than we were—as far as I know our vessel kept on the same speed between the change of course and the time of the collision—the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> came gradually nearer and nearer from the time I first saw her—I could not say how long before the collision I noticed her bow overlapping our stern—the next thing I saw was that she was heading quite in for us—she appeared to have altered her course—the captain thereupon gave orders to port and hard a port—we put it over as quickly as we could—the collision took place a very short time indeed after that order was given, we had answered our port helm about a point—the second blow followed shortly after the first—an attempt was then made to get out the boats—I was washed off the bridge into the water, and was ultimately picked up by the <hi rend="italic">Early Morn</hi> lugger.</p>

               <p>appeared to me to be coming down channel—I saw her now and again until the collision, that was I should think twenty-five minutes—almost all our hands were forward—I don't know that there was not a special look out, and I don't know that there was—I and Short were at the helm—I should say we were going between 8 and 9 knots; I should not think it was 9 1/2—I should think it would be rather under 9 than over—I did not see the hole in the <hi rend="italic">Franconia's</hi> bows at the time—I have seen it since, in the Victoria dock, not in dry dock—I did not see any steam tug either before or after the collision, nor any boats—I saw a barque—I believe it was the <hi rend="italic">Queen of Nations.</hi>

We were lying off Dover when I first saw the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>, she was coming from the east, down channel—I know nothing about its being her regular course; I simply saw her, <hi rend="italic">she</hi> was coming at a good speed—the bows of the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> were a little abaft our beam when the order to port was given, she was overlapping our stem—I should say she was then about a quarter of a mile off I should think—it was very short time after the order to SW half S that I saw the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> turning directly on us, then the order was directly, port, hard-a-port—our vessel answered her helm very quick indeed—I noticed that through the day; I had plenty of chance of ascertaining that—she had commenced to answer her <hi rend="italic">helm</hi> about a point before the collision, after the order to port and hard a port.</p>

                  </hi>. I was second quarter-master of the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi>—just after we started from Dover, when we had left the pilot I first perceived the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>, she was on our port quarter, and 1 1/2 miles off—I was with the last witness Jarman, at the wheel—we steered SW by S—I remember Captain Eaton altering the course half a point—the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> was then nearly abeam—the captain next gave the order to port, hard-a-port—we obeyed that order and the vessel had answered her helm before the collision—I think the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> had lessened speed before she struck us—she had altered her course between seven or eight points to starboard, porting her helm so that her head came round to starboard—she struck as about the after part of the bridge and I left the wheel—she then seemed to back off and came back and struck us a second time—in clearing off the second time she struck the port-quarter boat which I was clearing away ready to lower—the effect of that was to knock me into the water—I saw a line over my head from the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> and held on to it till a bow was put over for me to get into, and I did so—the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> continued backing off and stopped, and then she went off—I was busy with the boats, and afterwards I found she was some distance away and the <hi rend="italic">Slrathclyde</hi> sank; my attention was fixed on the boats when I got on board the <hi rend="italic">Francoina</hi> and I found the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> sinking, and then we found there was about a mile distance between the two vessels—the <hi rend="italic">Franconia's</hi> engines were going and her bow was to the land.</p>

The <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> was about two lengths from us, as near as I could judge, when the order was given to port the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi>—her stem was then overlapping our midships; she was then abeam of us—I had seen the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> about ten minutes from the first—I saw a hole in the <hi rend="italic">Franconia's</hi> bows—I did not see any ropes thrown over, I saw one rope when I came to the surface—I did not <hi rend="italic">get</hi> up by that rope, another rope was thrown—I did not see three boats lowered within 5 or 6 feet of the water—I saw the starting, I do not think she was a mile off—</p>

                  </hi>.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. I saw the hole in the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>—my firm impression when I found myself hanging there was that she was in danger—it was a serious hole, as far as I could judge at the time—she went away at about half speed—I have been at sea sixteen or seventeen years—I did not hear an order given by the captain to sound the well—I heard no statement by the carpenter or any one that the forehold was full of water—I heard no order given to shore up the bulkhead—I was not very much alarmed—my attention was carefully directed to lowering the boats—the crew were not assisting us—the first boat was" a steam launch; that would not have been of much use—they did not assist us at the second boat, there was no reason for that that I know of—the second boat had a hole in her—the third boat they lowered themselves some time afterwards within 5 or 6 feet of the water—I did not see any ropes thrown over the side—a rope was hanging, and I got in by it—I did not hear the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> the moment after the collision give orders to lower the boats—I did not see the English pilot on board—I heard nothing he said—I did not hear him say to the captain "My God, get on shore as soon as you can, we are sinking"—in order to lower a boat thoroughly it is necessary to stop the engines—the <hi rend="italic">Franconia's</hi> engines were not stopped after I was on board, they may have been eased off Dover—she was going at half speed—I saw a steamtug three-quarters of a mile or a mile away, and I should say that those on board of her must have seen the collision—the tug came near to the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>, but that was half an hour afterwards; she went inside first—she did not bear down to help—she afterwards came alongside the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>—I did not see any other luggers or boats about that might have helped—the tug was not very large, she would only tow a small class of vessels—if she had come down alongside the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> she could have saved many lives; I think a great deal of help might have been given—I could not judge on board the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> whether there was a general fear and alarm that she would sink—I did not hear any explanation the pilot made, or anybody else</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> After I went on board I went so far as to get the assistance of somebody to lower the boats—we may have been a quarter of a mile from the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi>, at that time—there was nothing so far as I know to prevent the boats being lowered at that time—between that time and the time we got to Dover, the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> was not stopped at all—some of the crew came to get the third and fourth boats lowered—we were then from three-quarters of a mile to a mile from the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi>, she was then sinking, she was stern down, her bows were up, and her stern under water—we had increased our distance half a mile at that time—the tug boat was then nearer to us than to the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi>, and about the same distance from the land as we were, and about the same distance from the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> as we were—she had a mud lighter in tow and was making out seawards with it—we left the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> at the Downs, between 6 and 7 o'clock—from the time I got on board of her to the time I got off, I saw no reason to suppose that she was on the point of sinking—none of the boats were ever actually lowered to the water.</p>

I am a Channel pilot and boatman—on 17th February, I was on board the <hi rend="italic">Queen of Nations</hi> which was lying to, waiting for a pilot on the west of Shakspeare's Cliff and about a couple of miles I should judge, from Dover pier—my boat is called the <hi rend="italic">Brave Nelson</hi>, and I had come out in her to the <hi rend="italic">Queen of Nations</hi>—mine is a pilot boat—I saw the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> start from Dover Bay and saw the course she steered—I judge that when she started she was standing S S W—there was a moderate breeze, it had been blowing all the morning—I could see, I judge, 6 or 7 <hi rend="italic">miles</hi>—I <hi rend="italic">first saw the Franconia about 3 miles</hi> away <hi rend="italic">to the eastward</hi>; she might be a couple of miles from the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> then—the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> appeared to me to be going a great deal faster then the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> was—I did not see them go into collision but I saw the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> backing her stem from' the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi>—I judge that I saw both vessels about three minutes before the collision—I can not say whether if the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> had star boarded her helm at that time there would have been any collision; I was rather too far off—after the collision I saw the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> backing out, she seemed to lay there about three minutes and then she ported her helm and steamed away into Dover—at the time of the collision the tugboat was close off the Admiralty Pier; I mean near to the pier—there was a breeze in the morning but there was no sea to prevent the lowering of boats.</p>

               <p>bulkhead which was 11 ft. abaft the stem, but the bulkhead was sound as far as I could see, with one slight exception, which was a little bulging on the starboard side—I was given to understand she had come down from the Downs to London—her entire length is about 360 ft—she was quite safe going at a moderate rate of speed in fine weather, as far as my judgment goes—there was no imminent danger of sinking as far as I could see—she had another bulkhead as near as I can recollect, about 21 ft. abaft that—it was not water tight—there was one about 39 or 40 ft. abaft that, which was watertight up as far as the lower deck—the first bulkhead was about 21 ft, from the collision bulkhead, and the next about 40 ft—the second was not watertight, because it had a hole in the bottom—I did not see the size of it, the ship was too narrow for me—I did not go down, I was informed by the carpenter that it was 1 1/2 to 3 inches in diameter—I don't think the vessel would have sunk at all from those injuries if she was going slowly; if she had been driving at full speed it is impossible to say how long she would have taken to sink; if the collision bulkhead was sufficiently tight to stand the force of <hi rend="italic">going</hi> against the sea she <hi rend="italic">would</hi> not fill in the other compartments, and she would not sink at all—supposing it did give way, I should think it would take five or six hours to fill the fore part up to the next watertight compartment—I should doubt whether that would sink her, it would bring her down by the head—the collision bulkhead is made strong for that very purpose—this was very strongly made and well supported.</p>

               <p>whether there was danger of the collision bulkhead giving way; that was not the object 1 had in view in seeing the ship; I looked at it and saw that it had not given way—I have a certain amount of practical experience which would enable me to judge when I see a bulkhead, whether it is strong enough or not, or whether it has given way—I examined the plates on the inside of the bulkhead carefully, and I examined those on the after side as far down as I could see, I could not see any broken—I could not undertake to say whether one was broken—I did not see any danger of the collision bulkhead giving way—I tried to see on the inside, I went down and examined it, as far as I could get, I suppose about 6 ft. off the bottom of the ship—without going down to the bottom you could not for certain ascertain the danger of its giving way—I say as far as I could see there was no danger of its giving way—I have not seen her in dry dock since the collision—I have not been asked to do so—if the collision bulkhead had given way I should say about 350 tons of water would have got into the ship—I will not undertake to say that 600 tons would not have got in—I took no measurement that would enable me to say that only 350 tons would come in, it is a guess—I looked at the plates in the immediate vicinity of the bulkhead—I did not notice any particular damage abaft the collision bulkhead—I am not prepared to swear there was not any—viewing it from the front I should say it would indicate great danger—if I had seen it at the moment, I might, as an experienced captain have feared that the collision bulkhead would hare given way; I might have thought there was imminent danger—I noticed that there was a small shore there—I did not take its dimensions, it struck me from the look of it as being small—I did not observe any shore there above 6 inches thick—I can't say whether there was only one shore, I did not pay any attention to the amount of shoring, if it had been heavily shored I should have observed it—I mean, with heavy baulks of timber—I observed only one shore between one of the frames and the bulkhead—I did not pay any particular attention to it; I will not undertake to swear how many shores there were, or how thick they were—it would have taken about five minutes to put up the small shore I saw—I can't conceive it would take an hour—I have seen a bulkhead shored before, I saw one on board the <hi rend="italic">Baltimore</hi> that went on shore at Hastings, about eight years ago—that was the last time I saw a bulkhead shored up; that is the only time I can call to mind—I was examined before the Coroner, at Poplar—I did not hear Mr. Barnard examined—I heard of his having been appointed by the Coroner to examine the vessel, and I saw his examination in the paper the next day—the Second bulkhead was not watertight; I took that from the carpenter—I did not go sufficiently low down to see whether there was a hole or no—I could not get down, I tried—I noticed some iron doors on the lower deck, at the end of one of the bulkheads; those doors were not nearly watertight, so that that bulkhead would not be watertight above the lower deck—the time it would take for the vessel to sink would partly depend upon the quantity of water that would get into her—if I am wrong in my estimate of 350 tons of water getting in from the collision bulkhead giving way, I may be entirely wrong in my estimate of the time it would take to sink the vessel—there is a good deal to be seen in dry dock which cannot be seen when the vessel is not in dry dock—a good deal of valuable information as to the state of a ship is to be obtained from examining the bottom of it—I had no opportunity of properly judging of the state of this ship—I had no opportunity further than the examination 1 made in the Victoria Dock.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">interpreted</hi>). I was chief officer of the steam ship <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> on the 17th of February last—I understand a little English—the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> is a German ship and carries a German flag—the captain is a German and the crew nearly all German—the ship carries passengers as well as cargo—on 17th February the number of the crew was seventy-three, and we had four passengers and the mails on board, bound to Havre, and ultimately to St. Thomas, West Indies—we had an English pilot on board named Porter; we took him at Grimsby—we passed the South Sand Head light on the right hand—we also had a French pilot on board, who was to take us to Havre from Dungeness—the English pilot was also going to Havre—when we passed the South Sand Head light we were steering S W by W, that would not be the right course to Dungeness—after passing the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187604030040"/>
               <p>South Sand lightship our course was altered to W S W 1/4 S; that was the right course to Dungeness; that course was not altered or deviated from up to the time of the collision, and if there had been no collision we should have continued that course right away to Dungeness—Captain Key was on the bridge up to the collision, I was with him—I know the course was W S W 1/4 S from an examination of the compass, which had been adjusted at Grimsby—after we had passed the lightship a little, I noticed the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi>, about 3 miles off, 6 points on our starboard bow—when I first saw her she appeared to be going the same course as the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>—after I saw her again she had altered her course, because she came from land towards me and appeared as if she wanted to cross our bows—our engines were stopped by the captain's orders—the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde was</hi> then about 2 ship's lengths off—the order was first stop and then go astern, and then he gave the orders to me to port the helm, and I waved my hand to the quartermaster to turn the helm over, which was done—the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> still had headway about 4 miles at the time of the collision—we were going down Channel at 8 3/4 knots by the log before that—the engines were going astern about two minutes before the collision—the captain waved to the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> with his cap to port his helm and shouted "Keep off!"—I hardly believe the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> could have heard it—I did not see the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> on the bridge—I felt the shock of the collision—I did not see the damage that was done to the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>—I remained on the bridge—the captain left the bridge and ran forward; he came back directly and gave me orders to get the boats out to save the men from the other ship—I and the crew got the boats ready—I think the engines were then still going astern; I believe they were stopped after, but I did not take any notice—the crew were in good order and obeyed the orders that were given—we got the port boat out first over the side, ready to be lowered down—I then went over to the starboard boat—the second officer, Lubbe, came on deck just when the collision happened and took command of the port boat—I and the crew got the starboard boat ready—we had seven boats altogether and one steam launch; we got three ready for lowering, they were lowered within a few feet of the water—I saw a steam tug at this time about a quarter of a mile off us and about the same distance from the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi>—at the time of the collision the English pilot was below—directly after it happened I saw him run forward—I did not hear him say anything to the captain—before I got the starboard boat quite ready I got the order from the captain to go down below to see whether there was water forward; I found the forward compartment was full—the collision bulkhead was bent and water was coming through it—the fore compartment was full up to the draught of the ship, 15 feet—I came on deck and reported to the captain—I was sent down again and remained for about half an hour for the purpose of watching.</p>

I am a sailor myself; I hare been at sea since 1853, and have been in command of vessels—the English pilot continued on duty till we got to the South Sand Head light vessel, and then the captain took command—we passed about a mile seawards of the light—the captain gave me orders to steer a course W S W 1/4 S—at that time I saw the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> about N W from me, a little northerly, about off the South Foreland—we had no look-out, it being clear weather—our course was kept till within two ships' lengths of the collision—I know that she being on our starboard bow it was our duty to keep out of the way, but not at such a great distance, not sooner than there was danger apprehended—we</p>

               <p>believed she would go down the Channel the same way as we did—we stopped and went astern—I consider coming into danger, a few ships' lengths—the ships were a good two ships' lengths apart when I considered they were coming into danger—the captain was then at the telegraph—if I saw there was danger I should consider it my duty to speak to the captain, although he was in command—I did not speak to him, because he was already at the telegraph—I was examined before the Coroner; my evidence was taken down in writing, and I signed it—I said then that if I had been in command I would not have gone so close to the vessel, but I meant if I had been in command as officer, not in command as captain—I understood if I had had command as officer in my position, but not so much so as if I was captain—the captain has much more right to do a thing than I have as officer—if I had been acting on my own judgment and in my own command as chief officer I would not have gone so close—if I enter a port where I go in as captain of the ship I should not enter that same port perhaps if I was officer of the ship—there was not so much risk in my judgment in getting so close, but if I had been chief officer in command I would not have done so—if we had starboarded our helm the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> would have run into us with her stem—I remember being asked that question before the Coroner, and I said "I was not in command, so I cannot say why the helm was not starboarded"—I believe there would have been a collision if we had starboarded our helm three ships' lengths away from the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi>—I did not say that the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> ported her helm; I cannot swear that she did not, because—I did not see it—I cannot swear whether she has done so or whether she has not done so—I did not see any alteration in her course; perhaps I did not attend to it—I am not able to say whether she did or did not—if she had ported her helm, and we had starboarded, it is difficult to say whether there would have been any collision; it may be possible that she would touch the after part of the vessel—I heard our captain give the order to port our helm when the engine began to go astern—the first order was "stop" and at once "astern"—the first order was to stop and reverse the engines, and then as to the helm, to port—the order to port may have been given about a minute before the collision—the effect of that would be to bring our vessel's head nearer to the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> at first, but very little—we still had way on the vessel at the time of the collision—we had, I think, got the tide against us—I cannot say, but 1 think you can reverse the engines and stop the vessel dead in about four minutes, till the ship goes astern—it is, of course, easier to do that when the tide is against us than when it is with us; the vessel will stop sooner—the wind was on our port bow a very little; if you call a quarter of a point on the port side the port bow, then yes—I went down to the compartment it may have been seven minutes after the collision—the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> was not then making her way to Dover; I am positive of that—she was in motion, but I do not know in what direction; I did not look over the side—I know she was not going to Dover because we had the land on our starboard side—I did not take notice whether we were making our way to land—the first boat was ready about six minutes after the collision—she was got ready directly after the collision—I began it and the second officer finished getting her ready—I did not see the mate of the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> come on board—I did not hear him ask somebody to get ready the boats—I saw one man from the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> come on board when I was at the port boat—I understand a little English—I heard one call out "My poor ship," but who it was I do not know—I did</p>

               <p>not also hear him ask to have the boats made ready to save them from drowning, or say anything about the boats—I did not speak to the captain at all, but he gave me the order to get the boats ready—I said before the Coroner that if I had been in command of the ship I would have lowered the boats, but I added to it "if I was not afraid my own ship was sinking"—I mean to say that I added that before the Coroner; I said "Yes, if I was not afraid of myself"—I also said "The boats were never put into the water, because we never stopped"—I was asked "If you had been in command of the ship would you not have stopped by the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> and got out the boats?"and my answer was "Yes, I would do so if I was not afraid for myself"—I was asked "If your ship had been in danger of sinking. would you not have wanted your boats in the water to save yourselves?"—I answered "I do not think so"—they would, have been obliged to get our boats into the water as soon as the bulkhead was burst in—as a matter of fact our boats were never lowered into the water—I remained down examining the damage for half an hour—I cannot say whether the vessel was ever stopped during that time; I was at work down below, and I could not hear the engines forward in the ship—I don't believe that the ship stopped, though I cannot say; I did not take notice—when I had examined the damage I went up and reported it to the captain; I said that the bulkhead was bent and water was coming through on the starboard side, and the fore compartment was full of water—when I told him that the boats were outside ready to be lowered they were lowered a few feet from the water, but not to the water—the engines, I believe, were still going at that time—when I came on deck again I saw that the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> had sunk—I did not see her sink—this occurred on the afternoon of the 17th—the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> started from the Downs at 7 o'clock next morning on her journey to London, and we arrived in the Victoria Docks on the evening of the 18th when it was getting dark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have known captain Keyn one year—this was the fourth voyage I made with him—I always found him a careful and cautious commander—I have the fullest confidence in his skill and judgement—he was humane and kind man—whether he was right or wrong he tried to do the best he could, what he thought was the best—after the collision and when the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> was going towards Dover, towards the land, the English pilot was on the bridge and as far as I know he took her in—I know article 16 which Bays "Every steamship when approaching another ship so as to involve risk of collision shall slacken her speed or if necessary stop and reverse"—if the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> had slackened her speed as she was approaching the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>, and the accident had happened at all it would not have been so severe—when I said that the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> appeared to be wishing to cross our bows, I meant that she appeared as if she wanted to cross our bows to go across ahead of us—at the time of the collision she was lying at a pointed angle in reference to the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>—supposing the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> had been distant enough away so as not to interfere with her, that position would have enabled her to cross the <hi rend="italic">Franeonia</hi> bows—I said before the Coroner "If we had put our helm to starboard when we were 100 yards off I think the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> would have struck us; the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> looked as if she, the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi>, wanted to cross our bows"—this is the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> and this is the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde (pointing</hi>) if we had gone to starboard we should have gone that way and the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> would have run into the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>—if I had been in the captain's position at the time of the collision I should have stopped and reversed the</p>

               <p>engines as he did and it is possible that I might hare ordered the helm hard a port, and perhaps not, it is difficult to say—the boats could not have been lowered into the water while the engines were going ahead—I heard some one say "My God, my poor ship" or some expression of that kind—at that time I was getting the boats ready—I did not hear the pilot say anything to the captain or urge him to proceed or anything of that kind—anybody could see that the mate of the other vessel was excited—I do not know that gentleman (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Gellatly</hi>).</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By a Juror.</hi> We were running at 8 3/4 knots an hour, and when we struck it was only 4 knots—we could stop the vessel in four boats' lengths—I had not power as chief officer to order the helm to be put hard a port—when the order was given to stop and then to reverse, the <hi rend="italic">effect</hi> was to lessen the speed as soon as the engine was turned astern—at the time of the collision the ship may have been running at the rate of 3 miles or 4 miles; that would be possible against wind and tide—they would take effect against the vessel, but she would possibly be still surging through the water at 3 miles an hour, or it might be less; I cannot say exactly.</p>

I am chief engineer of the <hi rend="italic">Fran-conia</hi>—I had charge of the engines, and had three assistant-engineers under me—at the time of the collision I was superintending the engines; they are of 350-horse power, and will work up to 1,100—up to a very short time before the collision we were going at full speed; that would be 8 3/4 <hi rend="italic">knots</hi> an hour, and making 54 1/2 revolutions per minute—we were using what is called the expansive gear—I was near the engine room at 4.2—it was Suspensor, the third engineer's watch—the second engineer had changed with the third at 1 o'clock—at about 4.2 I received an order from the bridge by telegraph "Stop; full speed astern"—those were separate orders suddenly given, one after the other—it was the third engineer's duty to execute that order in the engine room, and he executed it at once—he stopped at first and then full speed astern—in about two minutes after going astern I felt a light shock.—the first minute after the order "Full speed astern" the engine made thirty revolutions, the second minute forty—the engines were going astern about five minutes; they then stopped for about a minute—they began to stop two or three minutes after the <hi rend="italic">collision</hi>—the next thing was "<hi rend="italic">Slowly</hi> ahead" for a short time, and then "Stop" for one minute—all the orders for these different movements were executed by the third engineer—I saw-nothing of the collision; I was down in the engine-room.</p>

I am a licensed Trinity House pilot from Hull to the South Foreland—I have been a pilot twenty years along this route—I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> in Grimsby Dock—I had piloted her six time before on a similar voyage to that which she was going—she always goes from Ham<lb/>burgh to Grimsby, then to Havre and the West Indies—she was in dock at Grimsby—we arrived safely at the South Sand lightship, and then took her course down Channel—my duties terminate at the South Sand lightship—I remained on the bridge about a mile to the westward of the South Foreland—I saw the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> inshore of us, about two points before our beam, close to the land, about the easternmost part of Dover; she appeared to be landing her pilot—I did not notice what course she took afterwards—I was off the deck then—the captain ordered me below—I stayed on the deck a few minutes—I know what the ordinary course is down channel coming out of Dover Bay—when they have a pilot to land, if they are half a mile from the pier, they will sail W by W or S W by W 1/2 W, some will—the whole of the course to Dungeness, half a mile in, is in deep soundings, plenty of water for the largest ship in the world—when I was ordered below I had been twenty-four hours on duty and had had no rest, only sitting down a minute'—I went into the after saloon—our vessel was going S and by S W to W. there was a quarter of a point deviation in the compass—she was going in the direct course towards Dungeness, that course would have taken us about four or five miles outside Dungeness—while I was in the cabin I sat right aft over the propeller drinking a cup of coffee; I sat 20 minutes, and I heard the ship stop; directly she stopped it was "full speed astern;" you—can tell when you are sitting over the propeller—she went full speed astern then, I should say, for three minutes; then I heard the crush, and I thought it was the shaft, I jumped on deck and saw the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> lying athwart</p>

               <p>our bows, with her head about S and by E 1/2 E—I wont forward, and the ships were separated from each other then, and I saw them hauling the men in over the starboard bow, and other men with ropes, but they were no use, they could not reach the vessel, she was a long distance off then—I looked over our port bow, and I saw our bow from about 6 or 8 feet turned right out like a bulkhead, up and down, and I said to the captain "For Gods's sake, captain, put the helm a port, and let us go for the land, our ship will go down"—my object was to put the vessel on the beach—at that time I thought she would go down, I only expected so—I saw the chief officer of the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> about five minutes after he was on board, I saw him rowing about the deck; he afterwards came on the bridge and said to me "What. are you going to do?"—I said "My good man," at least I said "Captain, my good man, go forward and look at our bows"—he said "I am not captain, unfortunately, if I had been it would not have happened"—afterwards he asked the captain for grog—I was on the bridge all the time after saying to the captain "For God's sake take her on shore"—I was not giving directions and acting as pilot till we got into the bay, the captain gave me charge then—I saw the steam tug—she was, I should say, from three-quarters to a mile from the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi>—I can't say that the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> dipped his flag in sign of distress, he was on the bridge with me, the men did it—I know where the wreck of the <hi rend="italic">Strathcyde</hi> now lies, she lies about N W and by N 1/2 N from Dover Pier—if she had been going S W by W, taking that course down Channel, I do not believe that she could possibly have got where she now lies—I will show you where he would be if he had started about a mile from the pier (<hi rend="italic">marking the chart</hi>)—I have taken the course as S W by W (<hi rend="italic">the witness also marked the position of the wreck on the chart</hi>)—the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi>, if she had been going the course I have marked, could not have got to the spot where the wreck is—she must have been going S by E.</p>

I have marked the chart three miles from the coast, unless I have made a mistake—I see I have measured a mile from the shore, instead of from the end of the pier—I made no mistake about the scale, the wreck lies about 2 miles and a half from the end of the pier, as near as I can guess—the pier is N W by N 1/2 N from the wreck.

               <p>about saving the lives on board the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi>—I said at Poplar, that I never thought of saving lives from the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi>, or of trying, to save lives from the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi>, I considered our own lives were as good as others—I did not look to see whether the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> was sinking—I was looking to see if our own ship would sink—I saw the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> go down—I heard the carpenter report to the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>, that there was water in the ship, but very little, that was after we had shored up—I think so; I did not trouble my head with that—I only think so; I am not sure—the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi>, had disappeared altogether when we were in Dover Bay—the people were drowned then, and I am very sorry for it—we were 2 miles and a half from Dover Pier, at the time of the collision—I said. before the Coroner "We got within quarter of a mile or so of Dover Pier," the captain had before that in my hearing, ordered the carpenter to go and shore the bulk-head up—it might have been before, I cannot toll you, I heard him say so, but I don't know whether it was before he shored up or after—the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> boats were got within about 3 feet of the water—I can give a reason why they were not lowered into the water to save the lives on board <hi rend="italic">the Strathclyde</hi>, because if our vessel went down, we could jump into them in a minute—I did not know that the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> had got a collision bulk-head—I cannot, tell you whether that would have made any difference in my advice to beach the vessel—I took the bearings of the wreck when I went on the bridge, not since—I had piloted this vessel before from Grimsby six times—I have sometimes landed at Dover, and sometimes at Deal, and sometimes in Havre; I have landed in Havre, I should think twenty times with the same captain—I have been to Havre three times in the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>, the last time was three months before this 17th February, there is no arrangement made—if it is fine weather I land, and if it is bad weather I go on—I did not land this time at Dover, because I did not want to trouble them to go inside—we usually go nearer than 2 1/2 miles, going to Havre—when I have landed at Dover, the captain steers. his course for Dungeness, S S W half a mile from the pier, or three-quarters at least—when we passed the East Goodwin, it was thick weather and I made up my mind then to go to Havre—the captain never asked me where I was going to land—I can't say whether I said anything to him—he told me to go down below and get dressed; I was tired.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARKY</hi>. We had a French pilot on board to take us to Havre, Mr. Crochemoro—he had taken us to Havre before—on this occasion we steered from the Newsome Float light-ship, S E by S to the Dudgeon coming from Grimsby, that is about 24 miles from the shore—we steered S S W from the Dudgeon, for about four hours and when we came within 4 miles of the land—and when we got down to the South Foreland at the time of this accident the ship was going right on to Havre—I honestly and conscientiously believed that my ship was sinking or might sink, and that was the-reason of my giving the advice which I did to the captain—I have known the Defendant about 6 or 7 years; I had been with him before in other ships on several voyages, he had confidence in me and I in him—he is a perfect sailor, a man of skill in his profession, and very strict—I have always found him a kind-hearted and humane man, and a perfect gentleman.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">interpreted</hi>). I am a licensed pilot to the port of Havre—I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> at Grimsby at 6 o'clock in the morning of the 10th February to pilot her into Havre—at 3.45 on the 17th February I was down below and the cabin doctor said some<lb/>thing to me—I went on deck and saw a steamboat on our starboard side about two ship's lengths, steering S W by S—I went on the bridge—and looked at the compass—our vessel's head was W S W, a few degrees &amp;—the captain was on the bridge on the starboard side; I saw him walk quickly towards the telegraph and he brought the handle of the telegraph upright, which means stop her—he then turned it towards the after part of the ship, which means astern full speed—he then walked to the extreme port side of the bridge, and said "Port the helm," and waved for the helm to be ported—he then went to the starboard side of the bridge, took off his cap and waved it, and made use of an English word which I did not understand—I saw no effect at all on the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi>—the courses of the two vessels crossed immediately afterwards and the collision happened—when I saw the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> before the collision she was certainly crossing our course—we were steering W S W and the other one S W by S—the courses were crossing each other by 3 points, that is only approximately—at the time of the collision Dover was abreast of us about—I did not pay attention whether our course was changed—three of the <hi rend="italic">Franconia's</hi> boats were got over the side—the English pilot was shouting out to port the helm and to go ahead.</p>

I had been about three hours down below when the doctor spoke to me—I arrived on the bridge at the time the captain was setting the engines astern—the vessels may have been a little nearer than two ships' lengths then—I took notice of their courses—the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> was going full speed astern when the collision took place; the vessel herself might have been going two knots ahead—I cannot say exactly what headway she had lost, but I should estimate three-quarters of her speed—I did not say before the Coroner that the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> had lost half a knot, it was done so quickly—it must be an error—I signed my de<lb/>position, and had an interpreter—I am ready to swear that I do not re<lb/>member having said so, or that it is a misinterpretation—it is impossible that I could have spoken of half a knot—I have been a pilot sixteen years, conducting large iron screw steamers—I cannot say what means would have avoided the collision—I know there is a rule with crossing vessels, that it is the duty of the vessel that has the other on its starboard side to keep out of the way, but what rule it is I don't know—I heard the captain give the order to put the helm a port, and then I saw the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> go with her head stem on into the other vessel.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a consulting engineer, of the City of Lon<lb/>don—I have had great experience with ships, especially iron ships—I have made a careful examination of the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>—I examined her in the Vic<lb/>toria Docks, and more recently in the dry dock—on the first occasion she was afloat—in such a case as this you cannot ascertain when she is afloat all the damage a ship may have sustained in a severe collision—it takes several days to carefully survey and ascertain the damage done to a ship similar to the damage done on the present occasion—it is impossible to do much in three-quarters of an hour—I have carefully examined the condition of the collision bulkhead—it was shored up when I saw it—it is not true that there was only one small shoring; there were six shores and two stiffeners toler<lb/>ably thick and strong—it would take much longer than half an hour to shore up those bulkheads—I do not think anyone could have examined that bulkhead carefully who said that there was only one small shoring—I found on the first occasion the forepart of the ship, from the stem to the collision bulkhead, from the shear streak down to the surface of the water, completely crushed and puckered and bent over—I am speaking of the skin of the ship; I am coming to the bulkhead—a great portion of the plating was crushed, and it fell overboard; all the frames were broken up to the collision bulkhead, and some of the frames of the collision bulkhead itself on the starboard side—the frames on the collision bulkhead were twisted inwards—"puckering" is indentation, and of course the deeper it is indented the weaker it becomes—the collision bulkhead had sustained con<lb/>siderable damage, and there was considerable risk of its giving way, and if it had given way it would have caused serious danger to the ship—there are three water-tight bulkheads in the ship, two are water-tight up to the main deck and one to the lower deck—if the collision bulkhead had given way 533 tons of water would have got into that compartment—I have calcu<lb/>lated that carefully—if that quantity of water had got into the ship the next bulkhead would have given way, and in that case the ship would have been in imminent danger—there is an open hatchway in the fore peak which is not water-tight, and if the collision bulkhead had given way that hatch<lb/>way would have been 2 feet below the level of the water—on my examina<lb/>tion before the Coroner I had not been able to get sufficiently low down in the ship to know that the second division was not water-tight, and I assumed that it was water-tight—another surveyor and I went down and found a hole, and found that it was not water-tight, and I found that it was never intended to be water-tight—as regards the bottom of the ship, which I could not examine when she was afloat, I found that the stem was entirely gone—that shook the bulkhead very much—the stem would act as a stay and support to the bulkhead—when it had gone it would not tend to injure the bulkhead, but having given way it started the bottom—the ship making 10,12, and very soon 14 inches of water almost immediately after the col<lb/>lision clearly showed that it had started the bulkhead—supposing the colli<lb/>sion bulkhead had given way, what I call the division bulkhead, the hatch<lb/>way would have got below the level of the sea, and the ship must have gone down in a very short time—the collision bulkhead and the bow must have presented an appearance such as to alarm a captain of ordinary skill; it must have made him believe that the vessel would sink; it cer<lb/>tainly was such as to make a careful captain believe that his ship would sink—the shoring of the bulkhead had some effect in strengthening it—if</p>

               <p>it had not been shored I think it would have been very risky—it would not have been safe for the ship to have gone ahead with that bulkhead un<lb/>shored—I think it would have given way—it would, I should say, take ten minutes to launch the steam launch, and she could not be rowed if she were launched—she is too big a thing for two men to row, and it would take at least a quarter of an hour to get up her steam—I saw the <hi rend="italic">Palmer-ston</hi> tug, and I know her size—she is large enough to have saved all the lives if she had got to the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde—if</hi> I had seen this collision take place, and had seen the damage to the collision bulkhead, and noticed the water coming through, and had seen the state of the bows, I think a prudent man might have considered it necessary to have beached his vessel—I have no interest whatever in this matter.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. What I mean to convey is this, if I had been in command of the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> and seen the damage she had received I would have steamed away to Dover and let the people drown, and I am as humane a man as most people are—I should certainly have been so much alarmed and felt so much for my crew that I should have felt it my duty—I have heard that three boats were put over the side of the ship and that there were about five others—I do not know whether there were eight, I have not been listening to the evidence—I do not know whether the cap train could have put some of the boats in the the water and put some of his crew into them before he started to Dover—I do not know whether the <hi rend="italic">Franconia's</hi> boats would hold the crews of both vessels and all the people in them—the collision bulkhead is a structure for the especial purpose of pre<lb/>venting the water getting into the other part of the ship, supposing a colli<lb/>sion occurs and the stem is injured, but not for such a crash as this; that is the object of it; it is a strong bulkhead, made of iron—the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> is very strongly built—it would take, I should say, two hours to shore up the bulkhead—it was shored up and it was very efficiently done—I heard the carpenter say that the first thing he did when he went down was to clear away, and then, I suppose he would begin to shore it—there would be a little more pressure if he did it when the vessel was going 8 1/2 knots than when she was at rest, but not very much—I do not know that it would make much difference—there would be a little danger when going through the water at considerable speed, of widening the aperture made in the stem, but not much—twenty-eight plates of the stem were injured, down to the bottom from the shear streak to the keel, fourteen on each side—the plates on the starboard side were very much crushed and puckered, and on the port side there was nothing to prevent any body of water rushing in—I am an engineer, I have not had command of vessels—in my opinion, as an engineer, I do not think the most prudent thing for the time for the <hi rend="italic">Fran<lb/>conia</hi> to have done would have been to remain still, for this reason, she was in a tide way, as I understand, and every minute she remained at rest she would he going from shore—the next compartment I speak of was 22 feet further to the stern than the collision bulkhead, and it extends up to the lower deck—there would be an ordinary bulkhead to divide it from the pro<lb/>vision hold—I supposed it to be an ordinary bulkhead before I examined it, and I supposed it to be watertight, as it ran on to the main deck; I could not get at it on the first occasion; there were some Custom House things in it on the first occasion, there was a seal on the door, and I could not get in—the collision bulkhead I examined was originally perfectly sound and strong, but not when I examined it; it was started and puckered on the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187604030055"/>
               <p>starboard side in this shape; it would not admit a great quantity of water; if that bulkhead had given way it would probably have been an hour before the vessel sank—I do not say that if the bulkhead gave way the captain of tie <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> would have had an hour to do whatever he wanted; the ship would have been perfectly unmanageable before that—the boats would have lowered themselves, the vessel would have gone down so rapidly—the crew could have lowered the boats in an hour if they had nothing else to do, if they had not the ship to save and their own lives—when I said before the Coroner "I should be sorry to insure her life more than five hours if the bulkhead had given way," that was assuming that the bulkhead, which I call the divisional bulkhead, had been watertight—if the divisional bulkhead bad been watertight she would have floated five hours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The craw do not generally remain on board till a ship sinks—the captain was perfectly right in my opinion in taking his vessel towards the land when he saw the <hi rend="italic">Palmerston</hi>, steaming towards the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde—</hi> if the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> had gone at full speed there would have been serious danger of the collision bulkhead giving way—I should not have allowed the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> to have gone at full speed with that bulkhead—I have examined the bulkhead very carefully, and am perfectly astonished at its not giving way, it is next to a miracle that it did not.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE JUTY</hi>. I think it was a miracle that it did not give way, or that its efficiency was not entirely destroyed—you must not take it that it turned out stronger than I estimated, on the contrary, I found when she was perfectly dry that the danger was much more serious than I at first anticipated, in fact, the bulkhead was merely hanging as it were by a string; had it not been for these shores she must have gone down—it is a difficult question to say how many shores were necessary to take away the imminent danger, and how long it would take to place them—I have explained to you that it was an awkward place to get at—there is a hatch, say 2 feet square, and then you are landed on a place 6 feet deep, and it is very difficult to get the shores down; you cannot get the materials down, there would not be space enough—I do not think shoring alone would take away the imminent danger of the bulkhead giving way, because the sides of the ship were started and we wanted something to take away the strain—it is no use shoring unless you have something to shore against, and the shores which they had got there occupied all the space which you could shore against—there was never in my opinion 15 feet of water inside the ship; certainly not in the bulkhead, nor in any part—I say that, because when water gets into a ship it generally leaves a mark, just as you would see in the tide, and I found no trace of it.</p>

I should think there may have been 15 or 16 feet depth of water on the outside of the collision bulkhead, between the bow side of it and the stem—if you were to drop a line down to the bottom of the keel, on the side next the bow, it would be 15 or 16 feet deep, and that portion of the ship from the bulkhead forward to the stem was open to the sea.</p>

               <p>dry dock, and have thereby arrived at a more accurate knowledge of her condition—I have heard Mr. Harrington's evidence, and quite agree with it—the collision bulkhead was puckered back 4 inches and the frames were started from the bottom and were cracked in the throat, which is the internal part of the angle, and the rivets were started from the top of the collision bulkhead to the keel on the starboard side—I also examined the bottom of the ship in the dry, dock to the stem—there was considerable clanger of the collision bulkhead giving way when I saw it afterwards—I found it shored up with several wood shores—anybody who says that it was only shored with small shores could not have gone down to examine it at all—there were I think eight pieces of timber—he could not get at it to shore without clearing away—it might take an hour and a half to two hours to do that shoring, it is such a small place to work it—if there had been no shoring I should only have liked to go very slow indeed—the bows of the vessel were entirely gone—I have a rough sketch here in Court—that part of. the ship in front of the collision bulkhead was full of water—I am not at all astonished to hear that there was in the other part of the vessel from 14 to 15 inches of water; the port side where the collision bulkhead came in, was open 1 inch and I put my hand in, and on the other side three-eighths of an inch, it was broken off short—the next was not a watertight compartment, nor was it intended to be—if the collision bulk head had given—way and there was a rush of water, I have no doubt that the next compartment would have given way, and there would have been serious danger to the ship—she would have floated some time, but she could not have been navigated, her helm would have been useless to her—the crew could not have remained on board—if the. two compartments had given way, two hatches would have been under water, she would have gone down rapidly and the water would have come into the main forehold—I have been at sea twelve years—if after this collision I had seen the bulk head in this condition, I should have thought most decidedly that there was danger of its giving way—as captain of that ship, I should have thought that she was in imminent danger; it is easy to be wise after the event—it would take a great number of men to launch the steam-launch; two men could not have moved it with rapidity, nor ten—I know the tug <hi rend="italic">Palmerston</hi> well—I have heard that the English pilot on looking at the bows, cried out to the captain to bench his vessel—I heard him say that when he saw the <hi rend="italic">Palmerston</hi> standing down towards the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi>, he ordered the engines to go ahead to bring the vessel nearer the land—that was not improper in my opinion—I dare say the <hi rend="italic">Palmerston</hi> could carry on her deck 200 people—I also heard that there was a barque and a lugger—the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> cer<lb/>tainly could not with any consideration for her own safety have gone ahead with that bulkhead injured; the bulkhead would have given way I am certain—having seen its condition I should not have liked to go at any speed with it unshared—I had not seen the ship in dry dock when I gave my evidence, she was in the Victoria Dock, afloat—when I saw her in the dry dock she appeared far more damaged below the water-line than when I saw her afloat—my evidence before the Coroner when I saw her afloat was not the same as today—I had not the opportunity of saying what I say now—it was absolutely necessary to see her in the dry dock, and I re<lb/>marked that to the Coroner—Captain Black must have been very smart to have ascertained the damage to the collision bulkhead in three-quarters of an hour—I was there on three different occasions; the <hi rend="italic">debris</hi> had to be</p>

               <p>cleared away, piece by piece; the bulkhead to be cleared away, and it was on my fourth visit that I saw the bottom of the bulkhead—having devoted so much care and time I say that the vessel was in imminent danger before the bulkhead was shored up—it could not have been shored up in half an hour; there were eight shores.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. They could have done it better when she was still, than when she was going through the water—the screw was going very slow to keep her from going out to sea, and the crew would occupy themselves in shoring it up as quickly as they could to prevent further damage—if I had been the captain I should not have liked to go quickly through the water; I should have gone slowly, but I cannot say that I think I should then have been tolerably safe because it might have given way; not safe for the sea, considering that I should have been on a damaged vessel—if the bulkhead had given way; the hold would hold some 530 tons which would have brought her to the water line, and the water line I calculate from a drawing would come down 20 or 22 feet, and the hatches would both be under water which would fill the other compart<lb/>ment, and the rush of water would come in very fast—if the bulkhead had given way it would perhaps have been a couple of hours before the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> went down—when I say "perhaps," that is the opinion I arrive at after making the best calculation in my power—if I had been master of the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>, I think I should have thought it prudent to man my boats with part of the crew, and then steamed towards the shore—if that had been done a good many lives might have been saved—I have not heard what the weather was—there was no well into which they pumped the water—the 14 inches of water was from the keel up to the floor, I suppose; all along the vessel, I suppose—there were some powerful pumps and taking those 14 inches of water, in seasonable weather I should probably have stood by and seen whether I could have saved any of the lives, but it is hard to say what you would do on an occasion like this—she was a fairly strong vessel; I have seen stronger—it would take ten minutes or a quarter of an hour to get the steam launch over the side, and when launched she would have been useless—I cannot say whether the other boats could have been got out—a reasonably nimble crew if a boat is properly managed can get her out in about five minutes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> To lower a boat the engines must be stopped, and the tide would carry the vessel away unless she was fitted with patent shifting gear which she was not—if the boats had gone away, perhaps the ship might have been in a reasonable condition of safety for some time; I cannot say for how long—if I had been placed in this position of emergency as captain, I should have thought no doubt that my vessel was in very great danger—I know nothing about any pumps, I merely examined the damage done—I do not suppose the crew would remain on board the whole time that the ship remained afloat, because she would have been going gradually down by the head all the time.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. I have not made a very distinct mark, that would occupy too much room—it is this left-hand cross—there are two or three crosses—the wreck is 1 mile and 9 cables from the Pier Head: it is given as 2 miles in the notice to mariners, but that is an approximate thing—I decimal 9 is right; that is 1 mile and 9-10ths—it would depend upon how long the ship was sinking how far she got after her engines were stopped—she would drift some distance—if the tide was set<lb/>ting E N E that would bring the vessel a very little nearer to the laud, almost parallel to the land—having got to the bottom she would never move afterwards—the state of the tide would not drive the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> out to sea—I have heard two or three different courses as that which the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> was making, that she was S W by S when left Dover, that she then altered half a point and made it 1/2 S—if the captain started S W by S to get into the offing, and when he saw the vessels approaching each other altered his course to S 1/2 S, that would be altering her course to the west; that would bring her head half a point to the westward—if the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi>, when she started from Dover, was a mile to the east of the Admiralty Pier she would get into the stream if she steered S W by S—I mean into the line of the tide; she would get decidedly to the west of the position she did, but not a great deal to the west—S W by S would bring her 2 miles to the south from the Pier Head—I think I said before the Coroner "If the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> left a mile east of Dover Pier she would get into the position she has if steering S W by S; if half a mile off the pier she might have come into the same position, but if east of the pier, she could not."</p>

I am the wife of Andrew Nairn, of 237, Cable Street—on the night of 28th February, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I heard a voice in broken English in the street say "You have stolen my watch," and he then called "Police!"and I heard three heavy blows—I went to my win<lb/>dow and looked out and saw the prosecutor lying on a grating on the oppo<lb/>site side of the road and a man was stooping over him, emptying his pockets and putting into his own whatever he took from him—I raised the window, and the man who was robbing stood up erect and looked at me, he had no hat on—he then ran, and as he ran he stooped and picked up a hat that was lying on the pavement and put it on, it was a large felt hat, a wide awake.—the prosecutor made a mistake in saying it was a high hat, it was a round hat: he speaks very bad English—I believe the prisoner to be the man that robbed him, although I could not swear to him—I picked him out of about twenty at the police-station that night or the next, and I feel confident in my own mind that he is the man; there was a lamp very close and it shone on his face as he stooped to pick up the hat and it is a face once seen not forgotten.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The omnibus was very full—there was not a boy stand<lb/>ing—I put the money into my pocket just before I went out of my house—it was not in a purse, but loose in my pocket—a half-sovereign and silver—I could not say how many pieces altogether—I got out of the omnibus behind this woman—she got out first—I think I sat second from the door and she would be third—there were other ladies opposite—I was dressed exactly as I am now—my money was in an outside pocket.</p>

I will pay you"—they said they were not frightened of the money—Perry went away saying "I will come out and let you know when they are ready"—Payne remained with me—Perry came back in about a quarter of an hour and said the goods were loaded and they would be out directly, and that he had put some flocks on the top of them—he gave me another advice note and said "When you get the goods you can burn that b——note"—I saw the van come out in charge of Butcher—I saw the flocks on the top of the bottles, I did not see where the van went to, I left it there—I had at that time given all the in<lb/>formation to the police, and all the notes and as the prisoners gave them to me.</p>

I am foreman porter at the inwards goods department, King's Cross—the prisoners were in the employ of the Great Northern Railway Company—Perry as a porter in the crate and bottle department, and Payne as assistant under him—Perry has been nineteen years in the company's service, and Payne about three months—it is my duty, amongst other things, to look after the bottles that are stored in the warehouse—in January last I gave Perry instructions to repack certain bottles in stronger crates and to put them in order—he did so, and they were placed at the end of the warehouse—amongst others there were five crates of mother's feeding bottles—Payne assisted Perry in repacking them—and labels were placed upon them similar to these produced; they are in Payne's writing—in consequence of a communication made to me by the police I took stock of those bottles on 19th March—I then found a large quantity missing—I was shown those found in the van, they were of a similar quality and description to those that were missing—neither of the prisoners had any authority to dispose of the bottles—this piece of paper with "736, Jas. Perry" on it, looks like Swinscoe's writing, but I could not say—these advice notes, "B" and "C" are in Perry's writing; the entry on the delivery sheet "Peter Street, Boker", I believe is Swinscoe's writing, with the word "im<lb/>portant" attached to it, the portion at the bottom, is in the writing of one of the clerks in <hi rend="italic">the</hi> office—the letter "D" is Swinscoe's writing; also the envelope—this list is in Payne's writing.</p>

I did draw ray knife in the excitement of the moment and cut him.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 469, New Cross Road—I was in business as a licensed victualler twenty-five years—I have left it about eighteen months—on 25th May, 1875, the prisoner was introduced to me by a person named Rywall, an auctioneer at New Cross—he said he wanted a little money—I asked what security he could give; he said I might go home to his house in Cooper's Row, Kent Road, and see his furniture; he would give me that as security—I asked him whether, it was encumbered or whether he had any lodgers; he said no, it was all his own—I went with Rywall to the house 30, Cooper's Row, and we took an inventory of two rooms—the prisoner said that all the furniture there belonged to him—his daughter was not there at that time—this bill of sale was written out by</p>

               <p>Rywall on that same day, and the prisoner signed it—this is his signature, "W. Chas. Smith" (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—I advanced him 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the security of that bill of sale—in August he came again, and said he wanted to increase the loan to about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to purchase a horse and cart—he said he was an, egg merchant, and was supplying the Crystal Palace with eggs and butter—I Bad some stone bottles, to contain from two to seven gallons, and he said he could work them in his business very nicely if I could sell them cheap—they cost me about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I sold them to him for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were branded with other names, which made them rather unsolvable—I gave him 46<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked him what security he was going to give for it; he said he would give the horse and cart that he was about buying with, the money I was going to lend him—that was added to the bill of sale—no part of the money miss repaid—he put me off several times; at last, hearing that he was in very great difficulties, I went to his house—I then saw him and his daughter—I said I had come for my money—he wanted to put me off a little longer, and said he would pay me every. halfpenny—to make a long story short, I left a man in possession—the daughter said to me, "Is that your authority? this is mine," producing some papers rolled up in her hand—she did not show me what they contained—she said she had got a bill of sale, on the furniture; that her father would be the ruin of them;. it was all her own furniture, and he knew it—she said that in his presence—I afterwards instructed the man to take the goods (away—I afterwards received a notice not to part with them—I kept them for a month in case the prisoner should, redeem them, and then they were sold—an action was brought against me by the daughter in the Common Pleas, and she recovered a verdict for 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and costs 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I never had any of my money—the prisoner offered me 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before I took the goods away.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Essex and was treasurer for three or four years up to June, 1875, for the London district of this society; the defendant acted as secretary—(<hi rend="italic">looking at three-papers marked F. E. and K., and referring to three sums of money</hi>), he has never given me these sums of money—he used to see me at my place of business when I did not attend the meetings to hand over to me the monies he had—I believe I miscalled all the counterfoils for monies received—(<hi rend="italic">treasurer's cash book produced</hi>) this book has not always been compared with the check-book—the entries were made by my clerk always in my presence—I never entered them myself—even at the district meeting I put them on a sheet if paper and took it home for my clerk to enter—I compared the sheet if paper with the book and checked the amounts—this will enable me to ay positively that he did not account for these three sums.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I attended to the business as treasurer like most others I did not attend regularly—it is my duty to attend every district meeting—I do not know that in my absence he acted for me—when I was at the meetings I signed every counterfoil—when I was not there I signed them other night. (<hi rend="italic">The witness' depositions, being read, stated;</hi> "I have not received from the prisoner those monies. I used to attend the meetings, at I did not attend regularly. I cannot say what I received. When I did at attend he used to come or send to me. I used to receipt the counter hills and the receipts were given in my absence"). (<hi rend="italic">One of the society's rules ad as follows was:</hi> "The treasurer shall receive and pay all monies.") I day it is my duty to receive monies, but only from the secretary—that is my perpetration of the <hi rend="italic">rule</hi> with regard to the monies he received on behalf of the society—the entries were made by either my clerk, daughter, or myself—I do not know that the prisoner after I had made entries saw them in deer to know if I had them down all right.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Jury stated that the whole difficulty in the case arose from the loose and tersely bad way of keeping the books. The prisoner was charged on two other documents on which no evidence was offered.</hi>
