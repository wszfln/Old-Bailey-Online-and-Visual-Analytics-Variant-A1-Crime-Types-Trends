I said I would not have any. She whipt my Bundle out of my Hand, ran up Stairs, and I ran after her; she called a Woman up with a Quartern of Gin, and said, Damn you, you shall not have it under Six-pence. So I came out of the House. Mr Dickerson's Man, seeing I was robbed, sent me a Shilling to get a Warrant, and I took her up; When we got her to the Cross-Daggers, she said she would send for the Things if I would make it up; and the Things were brought, but I would not make it up; this was three or four Hours afterwards.</p>

I rode up to my Lord, and acquainted him with what had happened: Says he, my Retinue is very well provided, and my Fellows are all couragious , they shall pursue him: I described the Man to him; says he, I remember such a Person as you speak of; he had the Cape of his Coat about his Face, and he said, he looked like a sickly Sort of a Fellow; I think he had the same Cloaths on then as the poor unhappy Man has now; he said it was the first Fact that ever he committed. - There were three Crown Pieces; two of them were King William's, and one of them was Charles the Second's. - I had them in my Pocket upon the Road for two or three Journeys together; he confessed he took them from me: He had no Disguise, only the Cape of his Coat was buttoned round his Face. - I am positive that is the Man; my Lord Carpenter's Servants brought him up directly to my Lord Carpenter, and he confessed he was the Man that robbed me. - To the best of my Knowledge I can swear to this Money.</p>
               <p>Mr Lawrence. I was in Company with Mr Gates September 28. I was in one Track, and Mr Gates in another; the Prisoner came up to me first, and presented a Pistol to me, and without robbing me turned about to Mr Gates.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the Prisoner to turn from you to Mr Gates?</p>
               <p>Lawrence. I do not know any other Reason, than that Mr Gates was better dressed than I was, and he thought the Money might be upon him; I clapped Spurs to my Horse and rode off, and left him with Mr Gates, and went to my Lord Carpenter, and he sent his Servants after him. - I am sure that is the Man.</p>
               <p>Lord Carpenter's Servant - Stockwell. As I was coming to London, the 28th of September, Mr Gates came up to my Lord, and said he had been robbed. By whom says my Lord? Mr Gates described the Man; I had taken Notice of the Man's riding by our Coach with a Cape round his Face, and his Hat flapped : These two Men and I pursued him about two Miles to a little Publick-House by Hanwell Bridge , where I believe he had called for a Pint of Beer: We all three whipt in upon him, and seized him, and took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174210130004"/> a Pistol, two Bullets, and two Flints out of his Pocket, and brought him to my Lord Carpenter. - There were three Crown-Pieces, several Shillings , and some Half-pence. - I said to him, honest Man, I think it is a surprising thing for a Man in your Condition to rob; for he seemed to be in a very bad Way; says he, it is entirely Necessity that has brought me to it; he confessed he came from London on purpose to rob, that he hired the Horse and bought the Pistol. - That he was really in Want.</p>
               <p>- Clark. My Lord sent us after him; we found him at a Place the People told us was called Chevy-Chace , by Hanwell-Bridge ; he confessed he robbed the Gentleman, and that he did it for want.</p>
               <p>Bryan confirmed the foregoing Evidence. I can.</p>
               <p>The Confession he made before the Lord Carpenter was proved, and read; he therein owned, that on the 28th of September he hired a Bay-Horse in Finsbury , by Chiswell-Street , with an Intention to rob on the High-way, and that about a Quarter of an Hour past one o'Clock, he stopped Mr Gates and robbed him, and soon after was pursued and taken by three Men on Horseback. <rs id="t17421013-5-verdict24" type="verdictDescription">

I discharged her the third of October, and she went to live with that Woman, which gave me a Suspicion they were not gone the Way she told me. I went to Mr Goodwin the Pawnbroker, to know if this Woman had pawned any thing there. I found my Linnen there, but the Spoons were fetched out the Day before. - These are all Mine.</p>

I know nothing of Vearpoint's stealing of them. About last Monday the two Prisoners at the Bar came to our House about Mrs Godfrey's Spoons. I said I lent Bristow 14 s. 6 d. on them, Vearpoint said, if Bristow had 14 s. 6 d. she sent her but 10 s. 6 d. said she, then she has kept the rest herself.</p>

We went into a House where there was a little Room in the Yard. They put me into the inner Part of the Room, and the Prisoner was next to the Door; after they had drank some Wine, they began to talk of cutting of Cards, particularly the Prisoner, who went out under a Pretence of buying Cards; but I believe he had them in his Pocket at the Time, because he returned so quick; the Prisoner and the other played, I was prevailed on to bet a Shilling, and I won two Shillings; so this Man who had picked up the Shilling, he cut good Cards, Court Cards; says he to me, Do you cut; I apprehend he had two Packs, for when I came to cut, I cut nothing but Aces and Duces, and the like, and I lost the two Shillings that I had got. Says he, I will venture another Shilling, says I, I have never a Shilling: What, says he, have you no Watch nor nothing to put down? Yes, says I, I have a Watch, so I put my Watch down upon the Table, and cut two or three Times; still the Cards were low, that I lost every Time; I lost two or three Shillings that Way; and please you, my Lord, he took up my Watch and went away with it directly. I went out as fast as I could, but he was gone, and I saw no more of him till about a Fortnight afterwards; as I was coming up Newgate-street I met with him, and one more of his Companions; as soon as ever he saw me, he began to run; I cried out Stop Thief, and caught him before he got to the End of the Street; but the other was a brisk Fellow, and he got off; says the Prisoner, if you will release me you shall have your Watch again. He begged me to go into a Publick-House, and the People persuaded me to let him go in; said they, may be you may have your Watch again; and he said I should have my Watch. So some of the People persuaded me to make it up, and others not to make it up, for if I did he might trouble me; so I would not make it up, but would have him before a Magistrate; he did not care to walk on Foot, but he would have a Coach, and before we got to Guild-Hall, he was fumbling in his Pocket; I was in Hopes I should have my Watch again, but they were two Packs of Cards that he had in his Pocket.</p>

            , Surgeon. I came there about an Hour an half after the Accident, and found she had left a great deal of Blood. She had four or five Wounds in her Head; two of them were attended with a Fracture in her Skull, and her Brain was wounded. The Wound was upon the left Side of the Head, upon the Temple; which was the Occasion of her Death. The Prisoner had hid himself in the Cellar, and was found there, whilst I was dressing the Woman: I asked him how he came to do such a villainous Thing; he said she assaulted him first with a Poker, or some such Thing. I asked her who did it, but she was not able to say any more than Lord! Lord!</p>

            . I was there about eight o'Clock in the Morning: I searched the House, and found the Prisoner at the Bar in the Cellar, under a Hamper. I asked him how he came to use the Gentlewoman in so barbarous a Manner; he denied it a little at first, and desired to see the Gentlewoman. I taxed him with it, and he owned afterwards the committing of the Fact.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Can you swear I was the Person that did it?</p>
               <p>Palmer. There was no body else in the House: Near the Place where he was I found an Iron, which I suppose he did it with, covered over with some Dirt; it was a Piece of an Iron Bar; this is the Iron, it was bloody when I took it from under the Dirt; the Prisoner's Hand was very bloody. - I cannot say whether his Linnen was bloody or not.</p>
               <p>Mr Cooch, the Constable. The Prisoner's Master hearing a Cry of Murder in the House, sent for me to come directly; when I came, he said, he believed there was somebody murdered in the House, and desired I would get the Door broke open as soon as possible: I fetched a Smith, and broke open the Door, and saw the Blood running through the Floor, upon the Cieling. I got a Surgeon, and he said, she could not live above two or three Hours. A Woman told me, she saw a Man with a Woollen Cap put the Curtain on one Side, and look through the Window; and then I set two or three People to watch, that he did not get away. My Lad took a Stick and a Bayonet, and searched the Cellar; he struck a Hamper, and out jumps the Prisoner; he said he wanted to see Mrs. Dicks, to know whether she would live: Said I, Tom, how came your Hand bloody? Why, said he, my Nose has bled . Said I, you lying Rogue, it has not bled. I turn'd his Head up, and saw it had not. - His Hand was all over bloody, to his Fingers Ends. I got a Coach, in order to carry him before an Alderman. When he was in the Coach, I asked him, how he came to do such a Thing as this? He said, he could not help it, he did not do it with a Design to murder her, but to rob her. He said he had a Design to do it for five or six Weeks, but his Heart always misgave him. He told the Alderman it was a Bar that he did it with, and that it lay somewhere in the Cellar. He said he had got out of his Bed several times with an Intent to do it; but on the 1st of August he resolved to do it: He said he went in at the Cellar-Window, between four and five in the Morning, and lay concealed till between six and seven: He wrenched the Lock of the Stairs-foot Door off, in order to get to her . She came down some of the Stairs, and said, Tom, what do you want? but she run back, frightened, into the Room, and he run after her, with the Bar in his Hand: She clapped a Chair and Table against the Door, and took up the Poker or Tongs to strike him with, and he knocked her down, and repeated the Blows till he thought he had killed her, as he confessed himself. He said, when he thought he had killed her, he was going to rob the Drawers, but her crying out Murder, and the People making a Noise without, and the Blood running down, he run down into the Cellar, and hid himself under a Hamper. - She crying out, he was afraid of being discovered, and so murdered her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You have said several Things, that as I am a little deaf, I could not hear: Did you see me take the Lock off the Door?</p>
               <p>Coach . No, I did not.</p>

             . The Constable sent for me to aid and assist him to get into the House. I went and fetched a Ladder, and set it up against the Side of the House, and looked in at the Window, and saw the Gentlewoman lying in her Blood. I heard the Prisoner say, he did not design to murder her ,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174210130008"/> but she struck at him with the Poker, and he struck at her again, and followed his Blows till he brought her to that Condition.

Says I, what do you do here? Says Kent, Damn you, as you are come, take this up, and carry it away; and I being in Liquor, fell down before I had got a Stones-throw. When I came to Ken t's House, I fell down upon the Stairs, with a Load upon my Back. When I came up Stairs, the Goods were all in the Middle of the Room; then they took the Goods up again, and went away: When we got to Grub-street, says Kent, Pritchet, you may go back again now. Said I, you may as well let me see where the Goods go now. No, by G - d, says he, you shall not. When I came back again, the Goods were all gone. Says Kent to me,

On the 16th of July, about three o'Clock, the Watchman called me as usual. - I sell Physical Herbs; and the Watchman told me, the High-Constable had taken up my Wife's Sister, and that he had carried her to St Martin's Round-House. - I did not go to the Round-House then, but went about my Business; for I did not think there was any Danger: When I came back, which was about ten o'Clock, my Maid told me she had seen her there about five o'Clock in the Morning. About ten, or a little after, I went, and found her dead in the Hole, - there were two more dead, one lying on the Right-Hand of her, and the other on the Left. - She was lying upon a Bench. - She had a Camblet Gown on, or something like it, of a lightish

There was one Shilling offered for a Pint of Water; we raised among ourselves four Shillings for a Gallon; he said we should not have any; there was one Woman he gave a Blow on her Head. - He struck her because she wanted to get up Stairs to have a drop of Wine or something to comfort her. - He said we should all suffer for her, and might die and be damned. - I cried out Fire and Murder. - Bird shut the Window the last Time. - He said twice that we might die and be damned, and we should stay till let out by the High-Constable; and the last Time he came down he struck a Woman, gave her a Kick, and pushed her away from him. - He did not say, die and be damned, when he shut the Window, it was when he shut the Door.</p>

             . I was confined in St Martin's Round-house July 16. Bushel came down with some Prisoners, I cannot say what Time it was, nor how many he brought down. He went up and left the Door of the Hole open, and desired it might be left open, and the Door on the Top of the Stairs fastened; he spoke this to Bird, but I cannot say what Answer Bird made, but he came down directly, struck

               <p>Q. Did any of you get into the Passage when the Door was open?</p>
               <p>Desborough . We did not go out into the Passage, I believe some might stand just on the outside of the Door. - When Bushel left the Door open, he said it was too close with it shut. There was some Refreshment came into us from the Air, when the Door was open.</p>

I shall endeavour to bring Witnesses of sufficient Credit to be believed: This was occasioned by a Search-Warrant , from Justice De Veil, to bring to our House such Persons as were taken up in the Street, &amp;c. The Warrant was to be returned at eight o'Clock in the Morning, and if the proper Officer had came at the Time, this Misfortune would not have happened. I never went to Bed, I only lay down at the Feet of the Bed at seven o'Clock, and indeed I lay till between nine and ten. I never heard any thing of an Outcry of Murder, or any thing else; and as soon as I knew of the Misfortune, I made Application for Assistance to relieve them. As to the Number of People in the Hole, I did not know; and I had no Occasion to try the Number it could hold, till this unhappy Occasion: I had nothing to get, no Liquor to sell, nor any Opportunity of doing any Thing to make a Property of them; and I do declare this unhappy Affair was without my Knowledge or Inclination.</p>

            . My Lord, I was taken up the 15th of July at Night, among the unhappy Persons that died. During the whole Night I did not see the Prisoner at the Bar use any Cruelty towards them. - I was there from about a Quarter before Eleven at Night, till about Ten the next Morning. I was above Stairs all the while. - I was not put down into the Hole, because the Prisoner was a particular Acquaintance of my Mother's, and knew all my Friends. I went down to the Hole to carry a Candle, which was knocked out by one of the Persons confined . - The Door was open when I went down; this was about four o'Clock in the Morning; one of the Persons was bustling to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174210130014"/> get out, Mr Bird put her in, and then I believe shut the Door. - I did not go into the Hole, I only stood at the Bottom of the Stairs.</p>
               <p>Bird. Pray, Mr Malpas, give an Account to the Court and the Jury, what Part I acted, and who acted that Night.</p>
               <p>Malpas. He sat writing most Part of the Night. - In the Morning, Mr Akins, the Constable of the Night, ordered the House to be cleared two or three Times before he went away.</p>
               <p>Bird. Did I do this of my own Head, or by the Direction of the Constable?</p>
               <p>Malpas. By the Direction of the Constable.</p>
               <p>Bird. Did I do any thing without the Constable's Order?</p>
               <p>Malpas. No.</p>
               <p>Bird. Did I make any Objection to the Discharge of Persons who were brought in by the Watchman for breaking of Windows, and were discharged by the Constable?</p>
               <p>Malpas. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any one that was called by the Name of Wells?</p>
               <p>Malpas. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Bird. Did I put any of them down, or go down, till between four and five, when the Constable went down? I did not go down before that Time.</p>
               <p>Malpas. I did not see him go down.</p>
               <p>Bird. Who knocked the Candle out of my Hand?</p>
               <p>Malpas. One of the Prisoners, her Name was Amey.</p>
               <p>Bird. How did she behave before she was put into the Hole?</p>
               <p>Malpas. She behaved in a very abrupt Manner, and bred Differences. I believe she was ordered down at first by the Constable of the Night.</p>
               <p>Bird. What Time was it in the Morning that I laid down?</p>
               <p>Malpas. It was a little after Six.</p>
               <p>Bird. What Time did you call me again?</p>
               <p>Malpas. About Nine. - He laid down with his Waistcoat on.</p>
               <p>Bird. During the Time I sat up, did you hear any Outcry of Murder, or Water, or that the Women were ready to be delivered of Children.</p>
               <p>Malpas. There was a great Noise from first to last, before they were put down into the Hole, and after.</p>
               <p>Bird. The Place is so accustomed to Noises that one does not know whether there is Danger or no.</p>
               <p>Malpas. I did not hear any Cries of Murder while you were up.</p>
               <p>Bird. Did I shut the Window to do them an Injury, or what was it for?</p>
               <p>Malpas. Bird said to the People who brought Liquor to them, you are not their Friends, how can they defend themselves in the Morning if they are in Liquor? And when they came out, and he found how bad they were, he sent for a Surgeon to bleed them, and took all the Care he could of them.</p>
               <p>Bird. Do you know one

            .</p>
               <p>Malpas. I know her by her being up there; she was sitting in the Room with me; I spoke to her once since, and she said she would do Bird all the Service she could, for he had been very civil to her.</p>
               <p>Bird. Now she tells another Tale; it has been said that I was up and down divers Times with Prisoners, to put them into the Hole; it was impossible I could go down with the Prisoners, when there were near forty of them, and a Constable that could neither read nor write. I was obliged to sit with him to take an Account of their Names.</p>
               <p>Malpas. Several were put down by Watchmen.</p>
               <p>Bird. Pray did I drink with Serjeant Burns the value of two or three Shillings in Liquor?</p>
               <p>Malpas. No, I do not think he did.</p>
               <p>Bird Where did the Liquor come from.</p>
               <p>Malpas. It was sent for out of Doors.</p>
               <p>Bird. I am sure I had none to sell: Pray did I take any Money of Mrs Norton to let her stay up?</p>
               <p>Malpas. I did not see him take any. - There was no Body forced to have any Thing.</p>
               <p>Bird. If I had known any of them had been in Distress, do you think I would not have relieved them?</p>
               <p>Malpas, I believe he would; for he said, if I heard any Noise or Outcry upon any Occasion to call him, or if there was any thing wanting.</p>
               <p>Bird. Did you hear any Expression 'tis said I made use of, of Die and be damned?</p>
               <p>Malpas. I did not hear any such Words.</p>
               <p>Bird. If I did, it was an inadvertent Expression of my Tongue, and did not come from my Heart.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Bird when he called for a Candle?</p>
               <p>Malpas. He was below, I saw him struggling with Amey; she wanted to get out, and the Door was immediately shut up by Mr Bird.</p>
               <p>Bird. I went down to see that all was safe.</p>
               <p>Q. How many Prisoners were there in the Hole when you carried the Candle down?</p>
               <p>Malpas. I do not know, but it seemed to be full.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174210130015"/>Q. Did you find any disagreeable Smell or Stench?</p>
               <p>Malpas. I do not remember that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing of Bushel's coming up, and saying, he could not put any more down?</p>
               <p>Malpas. I heard something said of that, but I cannot tell who said it.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you upon your Oath whether it was not Bushel?</p>
               <p>Malpas. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no Reason assigned why they could not be put in, that they would be stifled , or something like that?</p>
               <p>Malpas. I cannot make any Answer to that.</p>
               <p>Q. When the Door was desired to be left open, did not you hear whether it was for fear the Prisoners should be stifled ?</p>
               <p>Malpas. I did hear it mentioned, but who spoke it I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the Constable, when he went away, desire the Shutter of the Hole to be lest open?</p>
               <p>Malpas. I do not know, it was open when he went; it was shut again between Five and Six by Bird's Son, because they should not have Gin brought them. - I did not see Mr Bird shut it. - The Room above extends over the two Holes and the Passage, and over that Room Mr Bird and his Family lie.</p>

            . I was taken out of my own House, and brought into the Round-house, about half an Hour after eleven at Night, and staid in the Drinking-Room till five in the Morning, and was in another Room above Stairs till nine. I saw no Misbehaviour in Bird, and did not hear any of the Prisoners give him an ill Word; he staid most Part of the Night by the Constable writing. - I do not know that he went down all Night. At five o'Clock in the Morning, the Constable of the Night and the Beadle insisted on the Room being cleared before they went. - I did not hear any Body cry out as if they were in Distress.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any singing?</p>
               <p>Beaumont . Yes, I heard them singing very much. - I heard them singing in the Room where the Women were.</p>
               <p>Court. Sure you are mistaken!</p>
               <p>Beaumont. Indeed I am not.</p>
               <p>Court. - This Singing you speak of, are you sure it was in the Room where the Women were ?</p>
               <p>Beaumont. It was Women's Voices.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure of it?</p>
               <p>Beaumont. There were Men down, as well as Women; it might be the Women, or it might be the Men.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the Reason of your being above Stairs? Did you pay any thing for it?</p>
               <p>Beaumont. I had no Money to pay: I went down, and he said, Damn you, come up, I have more already than I know what to do with: There were five or six more came up with me.</p>
               <p>Coun. You say you saw nothing amiss in his Behaviour, you mean to yourself, for he was very civil to you; how came you to be used so civilly?</p>
               <p>Beaumont. There were several Gentlemen, who were Officers of the Parish; they saw me take on very much, and saw my Condition, that I was with Child, and they desired I might not be put into the Hole; he behaved very well to all for what I know, - if there had been any Complaints, I must have heard them.</p>
               <p>Q. You said there were five or six went up with you: What became of them afterwards ?</p>
               <p>Beaumont. The Constable of the Night and the Beadle went down again with them, and I went up to sit on the Bed-side. - I am a single Woman. - I was not in the same Room with Mr Bird; the Rooms are parted off. - When the Constable of the Night had put them in, he made a Speech, and said, I have put them in, and you could not.</p>
               <p>Court. What Speech did he make?</p>
               <p>Beaumont. The Constable of the Night said, that he had put them in, when Bird could not. - That tall Man (Bushel) was there all the Night, but he was very drunk.</p>
               <p>Court to Bushel. Who was there?</p>
               <p>Bushel. There was the Constable of the Night, Tilton, and I, and another Beadle who came out of Curiosity .</p>
               <p>Akins, the Constable, was called for by the Court.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that Man [pointing to Akins] Constable of the Night?</p>
               <p>Beaumont. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the Man that said, I have put them in, and you could not?</p>
               <p>Beaumont. Yes, that is the Man. - I did not say it was Mr Bushel that made that Speech.</p>
               <p>Court to Akins. Did you go down with any Woman into the Hole?</p>
               <p>

               <p>Court. Did you declare, that what Bird could not do , you did?</p>
               <p>Akins . No, my Lord; Bird knows I did not.</p>
               <p>Court . You hear what that Woman says, did you say so, or did you not?</p>
               <p>Akins . No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who said it?</p>
               <p>Akins . I heard no such Expression: I carried none down all the Year.</p>
               <p>Bushel. Upon my Oath Bird said, I have put them in in a Minute that you could not.</p>
               <p>Bird. This was not from Good will.</p>
               <p>Tilton. Bird said, that Akins never did stir down.</p>
               <p>Bird. Mr. Akins, you swore you were down four or five Steps: I shall catch you by and by. - What Time did you go away?</p>
               <p>Akins. I went away at half an Hour after Four. - I never heard any Cries before I went away. - Yes, I did hear Singing - I cannot tell whether it was from the Mens Hole, or the Womens Hole. - It was between two and three o'Clock. - I gave no Orders whether the Window should be shut or open.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hooper. I am a Surgeon and Apothecary; being informed of what had happened at the Round-House, I went there between eleven and twelve, and saw Mr Colclough bleeding the Women. I thought it best, for Expedition, to cut them down the temporal Artery. I endeavoured to bleed one, but to no Purpose; there was another that expired about an Hour afterwards; I thought it a Duty incumbent on me, to desire Mr Colclough to bleed some of the others, and they did well. Bird and his Wife were both there, he behaved with a great deal of Humanity. There were Drops and Water ready, and we had what we wanted, as often as we called.</p>
               <p>Bird. Did you ever hear in the Neighbourhood of any Complaints of my using People ill?</p>
               <p>Hooper. I never heard any Thing one Way or other. - It is my Opinion, that the Occasion of their Death was from the want of Air, and the Liquor that they had. - Want of Air only might occasion it: This want of Air was the more prejudicial to them, as they had had too much Liquor before. They would have breathed freer without it.</p>

            , one of the Beadles. I came to the Round-House about seven o'Clock in the Morning: I asked Mr Bird how many Prisoners he had, he said, he believed he had about thirty; I staid about five or six Minutes, and went away, and came again about ten o'Clock. One told me there was a particular Acquaintance of his taken up and put in the Hole. I went about ten o'Clock and asked for Bird, they said he was in Bed, and went up and called him, and he came down; I opened the Door, in order to let her out; as soon as the Door was open, the People bounced out directly upon us; the Place was very nauseous, and the smell so strong, that I thought it would have struck me down; they called out for Water, for they were quite stifled : I fetched some Water from the Pump, they drank that up, and I got them some more. - At seven o'Clock there were no Outcries, but at ten there was a great Outcry.</p>
               <p>Bird. If your Lordship will please to observe this was in the Time I went to lay down in my Wastcoat : If they had come at the Return of the Warrant, this Accident might not have happened.</p>

            . On Friday, the 20th of August, Torbett came Home about five o'Clock in the Afternoon; he was for going out, I would have had him stay at Home, but he would go out; I said I would follow him; he said it would be of no Service to me if I did. I supposed he was going to that Woman, the other Prisoner: I followed him in order to prevent it, and went through the Park, as far as Buckingham House; I kept at a reasonable Distance, that he might not observe me. I did not follow him to prevent his committing Murder , for I did not think he would have done such a Thing. Just by a Stable Yard Gate by the Park I lost them; I asked a Man whether any such Persons went that Way, and described them; he said yes, they went by Buckingham-Gate . I saw the two Prisoners, they met a Soldier, and the Soldier turned his Coat; they all three went together from Buckingham-Gate towards the Turnpike, going to Chelsea, (the Clock struck nine as I went by Buckingham-Gate ) I saw the Deceased coming along Chelsea-Fields; I pulled my Cap off, and put it in my Bosom, and put my black Petticoat over my Head, that they might not discover me. Pierce made her Way over to him as fast as she could, ( Torbett and the Soldier stopped in the Road) and then the Deceased stopped, to the best of my thinking. I thought I saw him put his Hand into her Bosom, whether he put it in or no, I cannot say; as soon as she had stopped him, says

             struck the Deceased on the Side of the Head, to the best of my Knowledge; when he struck him, she said, Follow your Blows, for he has got Money about him. The Man was for going along if they would have let him, but the Soldier and Torbett made him stop, and Torbett took something from the Deceased, and gave it into Peirce's Hand; then the Soldier struck him; as soon as the Soldier struck him, one of the Dogs flew at him; (the Deceased had two Dogs with him) says he, Gentlemen, Have you no Mercy? Says Torbett to the Soldier, Take Care, the Dog will bite you; says the Soldier, Damn my Eyes, never mind that. I saw the Soldier clap his Hand to the Deceased's Breast, and he said, Gentlemen, Do not cut me any more. My Lord, as soon as the Gentleman had said Do not cut me any more, he did not walk so far as this Court is in Length before he fell down; then I heard the Soldier say, Tom, he is done for. I then thought it my best way to come away. - I saw the Soldier cross the Road, and leave the two Prisoners. I heard Torbett say, I have got his Watch with a Trifle more, and that is all: I let them pass me, and I went Home to Bed. On Saturday Morning, between eight and nine o'Clock my Husband came Home (as I called him, but I was not married to him, tho' I lived with him) I asked him where he had been all Night, says he, I have been in a great many Places. I told him I would get him his Breakfast, he said he had got Money enough to help himself now: I said I was glad of it, and he pulled out 5 s. and three Six-pences ; he threw me down three Six-pences and a Shilling. I asked him what became of the Man that he struck last Night; he asked me what Man, I told him the Man in Chelsea-Fields. I told him he did not think I followed him, but I did. When he found that I knew of it he could not deny it; says he, he struck me again, and went away, and I saw no more of him; he went out and said he did not know whether he should come Home that Night. About twelve o'Clock I heard that a Man was murdered in Chelsea-Fields, and then it came fresh into my Mind, that was the Man that I saw him strike. I met some of his Friends the same Day, and they said they wondered I should suffer him to pawn my Cloaths to buy him a Watch: they said they saw him with a Silver Watch: Then I thought they had killed the Man, but I was willing to conceal it as long as I could, as I had a Love for him; but hearing some Persons were taken up, and put into the Gatehouse for this Fact, I was under a great deal of Concern, that innocent Persons should suffer for a Crime they were not guilty of. I went to Justice De Veil, and made an Information, and took them both out of their Beds together. - It was a Moon-Light Night. - Mr Bass saw you with the Watch in your Pocket. - I am sure he had the Watch.</p>

               <p>Torbett. I am married to her, and have a Certificate.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever married to this Man?</p>
               <p>Quale. I was a little fuddled one Night, and came to the Fleet. - There were some Words said, but we were not married. I have seen a great many Weddings, and there was a great many Words at them; we had very few Words, hardly any at all. - There was a Man there, - he appeared very little like a Clergyman. - There was no Ring, - the Clergyman had little or no Money. -</p>
               <p>Q. So the Clergyman could not go on without Money? Did the Clergyman come to these Words, Wilt thou have this Man?</p>
               <p>Quale. I do not know, - I never was married to him in my Life, nor never went by his Name. - I never saw the Deceased, either before his Death or after.</p>
