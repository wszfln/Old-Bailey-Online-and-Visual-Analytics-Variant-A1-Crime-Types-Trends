               <p>JAMES PLUCKNETT. I now live in Bartlett's-buildings. On Thursday, the 27th of January, I lived at the house of my brother-in-law, James Helps, No. 21, <placeName id="t18250217-2-crimeloc7">Cummins-street, Pentonville</placeName>

I went to bed on that night about half-past twelve o'clock, and was the last person up - I was in care of the house; only Noe, (the servant,) and myself were in the house: she went to bed before me. I did not particularly notice the back parlour window; but the girl called me about twenty minutes to eight o'clock in the morning: I then found the back parlour window shutter forced off its hinges - the hinge was fresh broken. I had heard a little noise about half-past one or two o'clock in the morning, as if something was moving about below. When I got up I missed the weather-glass, a tea-caddy, a swing dressing-glass, a few volumes of the Quarterly Review, belonging to Mr. Helps - a great coat, an umbrella, a prayer book, and a neck handkerchief, of my own - they were taken from different rooms. The weather-glass and tea-caddy were produced at Bow-street on Saturday, when the prisoners were in custody - also a pair of gloves and a handkerchief of mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner LUCASEY. Q. The weather-glass is not yours? A. No; but I know it by its general appearance - I have no doubt of it. I had put tea and sugar in the caddy that evening - it contains the same quantity, and one of the inside divisions opens very hard. I had often observed the cut glass bason which is in it. They were in my care.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Helps. On the night of the robbery I went to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock - I fastened the house up between five and six; I fastened the back room window. I got up between seven and eight o'clock in the morning - it was light. I found the back parlour door open, the window up, and the right hand bottom shutter broken - every thing was in disorder. I called Mr. Plucknett, and we missed the property as he has stated - it did not appear that the thieves had been up stairs, but into the back and front parlour. I have known the barometer for years.</p>

            . I am servant at Mr. Dales, at the Thistle and Crown, public-house, St. Martin's-lane. The prisoners came into the house to breakfast, about half-past eight o'clock on Friday morning, about three weeks ago; when they came in they gave me the weather-glass and tea-caddy to take care of till the afternoon, when they would call for them; both gave me something, but which each gave me I cannot say. Lucasey came about half-past five o'clock in the afternoon, and asked if Moses was down stairs - I understood him to mean the other prisoner - I said No; Wood came in in about half an hour, and both went up stairs to the parlour, to play at bagatelle; they had been at the house twice before - they went up of their own accord, and had a pint of beer. I went up stairs to stir the fire, and when I came down I told the constable that they were the young men who came in the morning - he apprehended them in half an hour. The tea-caddy and weather-glass were left in my master's care. They did not ask for their things; the officer had been to the house in the afternoon, and seen the things - he told me to let him know when the prisoners came again. I am sure they are the men.</p>

            . I am a constable. In consequence of information I and Lack went to this house, about half-past one o'clock on Friday, the 28th of January, and saw the weather-glass, and tea-caddy. I informed the Magistrate, who told us to wait till they came - I staid there till five o'clock, then went home, and Haffron fetched me - Lack was there; we went up stairs, and found them alone - we said we were officers, and asked them where the things were, not mentioning; what things; Lucasey said they had bought them, and sold them - Wood must have heard him.

            . I am an officer. I went to the public-house with Donaldson - his account is correct. I searched Wood, and found a handkerchief on him, with part of the name cut out, and some money. When I entered the room I asked them what they had done with the weather-glass and tea-caddy, which they had in the morning - Wood said they had sold them; I asked how he came by them: he said he bought them of a man in Princes-street, Drury-lane, and had sold them again. He afterwards turned round and said, "I have left them at this house;" all this was in the hearing of Lucasey - one of them said the man who they bought them of was a stranger. After they were examined I took the barometer to the prosecutor's house, and it fitted to the mark on the wall as complete as possible, in size, length, and breadth, and the mark of the nook behind.</p>
               <p>MR. PLUCKNETT. I have not the slightest doubt of the barometer, and should think it worth 1 l. at least - it exactly fitted the marks on the wall. I am certain of the tea-caddy - I had filled it with tea and sugar about half-past ten o'clock that night, and I find precisely the same quantity in it. The gloves found on Lucasey are mine, and I lost a tin box similar to this. I believe the handkerchief to be mine - I can trace the top of the letter P still on it; the rest is cut out.</p>
               <p>JANE NOE. I know the barometer by the maker's name, and its general appearance - my master had had it four years. I know the tea-caddy, and have cleaned the shell in it for the last nine years.</p>


               <p>The prisoners jointly put in a written Defence, as follows: -</p>
               <p>My Lord, we have been acquainted for many years, and were school-fellows together. On the 27th of January we were drinking together, and got intoxicated - we went home and slept at the house of Mrs. Wood; we got home about half-past ten o'clock, and did not leave the house till half-past seven next morning - we proceeded from home (John Wood being a <rs id="t18250217-2-deflabel8" type="occupation">cooper</rs>

                        targets="t18250217-2-defend79 t18250217-2-deflabel8"/>) for the purpose of buying old casks - we went towards Covent-garden; we called at a public-house at the corner of Princes-street and Wild-street; there was a man sitting in the tap-room with the weather-glass and tea-caddy, who, after we had been sitting a few minutes, asked if we would buy them for ten shillings - we bought them, thinking we might get a shilling or two by them, as well as buying the other things. We found the caddy locked, and asked the man for the key - he said he had lost it. We shook it, and found it sounded as it something was in it - he said it was only the glass. We left the house, and proceeded to leave the things at the Thistle and Crown, a house we had been in the habit of frequenting for the purpose of playing at bagatelle, and asked to leave the things there till evening, as we were going on our business. We returned again about five o'clock, and went up stairs to play at bagatelle as usual; the landlord came up, and we asked him if he had the things safe - he said he had: he had been down but a few minutes when the two officers came up and asked Lucasey how he came by the property; he said he had bought them - they then asked what had become of them - he said he had sold them; the reason for which was, he thought they had no right to ask such a question, not knowing them to be officers, but immediately they said who they were he said they were in the house.</p>

               <p>JOHN SCOTT, ESQ. I live at Islington, in the parish of St. Mary's. I was not at home when this happened.</p>
               <p>MARY ANN JOPSON. I am servant to Mr. Scott. Last Monday week Mrs. Scott and the man servant went out, leaving me at home; I went up about a quarter past eleven o'clock, to look at the parlour fire - I set the scuttle<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170005"/>down, and looked out of window, and saw a boy looking through the iron railing. I put the coals on the fire, looked again, and he was still there, looking towards the kitchen window. I went to the top of the kitchen stairs, for a brush to sweep the hearth - I looked out of window again, and he was gone. I ran down stairs, and found three doors open - two of them were open when I came up, but the other was shut. I ran through the kitchen into the pantry, and on looking over the plate I missed all the large silver table spoons - a person must open the door which was shut to get to the pantry. I missed eight table spoons, which I had seen five minutes before. I ran up the area steps, and found the area gate half open - it was shut before. I saw the boy who had been looking through the railing, and the prisoner, about six yards from the house - I saw the prisoner give a frail basket to the boy who had been looking through the rails. I ran after them, the boy came back, and asked what I wanted with him; I just opened his basket, and could see nothing but oranges and lemons in it. The prisoner ran away, and ran across a place on the left-hand side of the road, where there is some timber - I lost sight of him while he went behind seven new houses. The boy with the basket also ran away. I met a labouring man, and called to him to stop the prisoner, and when he was nearly caught he turned back, and came up to me. - I laid hold of him; he asked what I wanted with him - I said he had been into my master's house; he said he had only been to the door to see if I wanted any oranges or lemons. I took him home, and sat him in the kitchen - he took off his coat, and desired me to search him - nothing was found on him. Rumbold brought the property in. He told me afterwards that he had come in and took the spoons - I asked what he was going to do with them; he said to buy bread - this was before the officer took him.</p>

            . I went to the mother's house, by Lewis's desire - I found the mother in the mews; she took me up to her room - the prisoner stood in one corner of the room, armed with a knife, which I produce, (a small table knife) and a poker - his mother said, "I am afraid of that lad; I wish to have him removed;" I said, "My lad, what are you going to ill-use your mother in this kind of way for?" he said, "Are you an officer?" I said, "I am;" - he immediately up with the poker, and said, "D - n your eyes, stand away," and struck at my head - I held my arm up, which caught the blow, and it almost broke the bone. I then left the room, and sent Lewis to the watch-house for assistance. Sheppard came, and Richardson, another street-keeper. I waited down stairs till they came, then went up with them, and found him still in the room, armed with the poker and knife. Richardson said, "My lad, why do you ill-use a person in this way? do you know the consequence of it? you will be transported if you go on in this kind of way;" "That is what I want," said he - "Oh! you poor foolish boy," said Richardson, "take the advice of a father of children - you don't know the hardships of it" - he made no answer. Richardson pressed him to give up the weapons, and he gave up the poker at last to his sister, but still kept the knife in his hand. Richardson asked him for the knife - he made no answer that I heard - he held it in his right hand; Richardson came very near, made a spring upon him, and caught him by the left hand - then Sheppard ran to his assistance, and as he came to his left side the prisoner made a dart back wards with his hand, and stabbed Sheppard in the side. He had told me before I went for assistance that he would be hung for somebody that day. He did not appear at all in liquor. I know nothing of him myself.</p>

            . I am house-surgeon at Middlesex Hospital. On the 26th of January I saw the prosecutor; he had a wound on the left side of the chest: it appeared a clean cut wound, as if done with a sharp instrument - it was about 1-12th of an inch deep; it struck on a rib, which prevented its going further. I should not call it a grevious bodily wound. If it had not been stopped by the rib, it would, most likely, have penetrated the lungs. I cannot say whether it was done with a pointed instrument. The prosecutor was ill about a fortnight, but never very bad, and in no danger. There is very little flesh about that part of the body.</p>
               <p>MR. WONTNER, (keeper of Newgate.) I have had some little conversation with the prisoner since he has been in my custody, which is since the 6th of January - I have seen him several times, and consider him weak in his intellect.</p>

             is the cook. I lived seven months with Mr. Downes; the prisoner, Michael Holland, was in Mr. Downes's service, as <rs id="t18250217-6-deflabel36" type="occupation">footman</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"

While he was in the service the female prisoner visited him; he called her his sister: she used to go up to his bed-room, which was at the top of the house, and the first time she came we shewed her all over the house - she was in my mistresses bed-room, and staid there a very few minutes. She was up stairs once all the afternoon, and I was in the kitchen - I do not know what room she was in: the footman was with her part of the time, but she was up stairs alone for about two hours; I cannot say when that was. On the Saturday before the robbery the prisoner, Michael Holland, called at master's house - I and the cook where in the kitchen; it was agreed that he should come to tea on the Sunday evening: nothing was said about where master and mistress were going to my recollection. He came about five o'clock on Sunday afternoon; before that I had turned down the beds, and done every thing up stairs, and the lamps were lighted - he came into the kitchen: the cook was there with me. About half an hour or an hour after he came, he went out to get something to drink, and took a bottle with him - he was absent about five minutes, and returned with a violent knocking and ringing at the door - the cook let him in. When he went out he took a candle up stairs with him, and put it in the hall; he brought it down stairs with him when he returned. We sat down to drink the gin and water, and is about a quarter of an hour I heard a noise like the drawing back of the bolt of the street door; I said there was a noise, and I thought the street door was open - the cook took a candle, went up stairs, and called out that the street door was open. I then went up - Holland was in the kitchen; we went to the parlour, drawing-room, and up stairs, and seeing the bed-room doors open we returned down - Holland came to the foot of the kitchen stairs, and asked what was the matter; we said we thought somebody was in the house, for the bed room doors were open - I had found master's bed-room door open; he then took the poker, and went up stairs of his own accord, alone, then came down, and said he did not see any thing or anybody there - he must have seen mistress's bedroom door open; I asked if he had been up higher than mistress's room - he said, No; I asked him to go up - he was going, when a ring came at the bell, and he came down stairs again, and when the door was opened it was the female prisoner; she asked if Holland was there - we said, Yes; she asked what he did there, and if he did not know that he was keeping her waiting. I told her I thought somebody was in the house, for mistress's door was open, which I had shut when I turned down the bed - she said she would go up stairs with us: she went up with me and Holland, and then I found one of the chairs was moved into the middle of the room, (it should have been against the window) I discovered that a drawer was open, and the jewel cases taken out, and put on the top of the drawers - one jewel case was broken open, but the other had no lock to it - the jewels were all taken. I said mistress's jewels were gone, and that she had a great many; Michael Holland said he did not think that she had many. We came down stairs - he went and called the patrol, who searched about the house, but could not discover any thing, and went away; he searched all the rooms. It happened about six o'clock. Holland went away after that - he said he should go home and tell the people he was not coming home that night, as he was to come back and stop till Mr. Downes came home. Master returned at half-past ten o'clock; Holland returned in about an hour, and one of the officers who were there took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Before Holland came back had anybody else been at the house? A. No; but after tea there was a violent knocking and ringing at the door - I went up - there was a man with a blue coat and blue trowsers; he asked if Mr. Taylor lived there: I said, No, it was a few doors further on. Holland was then in the kitchen. The prisoner Walker is like that man, but I do not mean to be positive to him. (Looking at a jewel case,) this is the one which was not locked - nothing valuable was kept in that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had you and the cook often friends coming to see you? A. No; none came to see me but my mother and sister; one old woman used to come to see the cook - my brother came once to see me, when mistress was out - he did not come to see the cook - it was one Sunday, a long time ago, when mistress was in the country - he only came once. I have lived there seven months; the cook came about a month before the robbery. I do not know of any body named Allen visiting her - I never saw any body come to see her but a woman; and there were two young women came; I never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170007"/>saw any man there. The cook was taken up about a week after the robbery; and I saw a man named Stevens in custody at Hatton-garden, charged with this robbery - I never saw him at the house - the cook was ten days in custody. Holland and the cook were very good friends - she did not know that he had a wife; after he was in custody I heard mistress say he had a wife - she was very indignant at it. Mr. Taylor lives about three or four doors from master. Holland came to the house about five o'clock - no other visitor came to see us - the patrol was called in between 6 and 7 o'clock; we told him the particulars in Holland's presence - he went home, after the patrol had been, and returned in an hour's time, and was taken into custody directly.</p>
               <p>FRANCES WHITE. I am cook to Mr. Downes, and was there for a fortnight while Holland was footman there - I was there five weeks before the robbery, no other manservant was in the house while I was there. Master had a tool basket, I never saw it any where but in the prisoner's pantry. Holland called the day before the robbery, and came to tea on Sunday, at a quarter past five o'clock - he came into the kitchen, and after tea went out for some liquor, and returned in six or seven minutes - he took a light with him, and when I went up to let him in I found the light on the slab in the passage - we went into the kitchen, the gin and water was drank; my fellow servant said she thought that somebody had opened a door; I went up, and found the street-door open - I called her up - we went up stairs, searched the parlours, drawing-room, and afterwards the bed-rooms, and finding the doors open, would not go further, but came down. Holland came out of the kitchen, and asked what was the matter; and she told him that she had closed all the doors in the evening, and now they were open, and somebody must have been in the house. I wished to call the watchman, but he said No, I had better not proceed till we saw if anything was missing up stairs, and said there would be no watchman on for two hours to come. I said we must have some one in, for I did not think we were safe in the house. He went to go up stairs with the poker, the house-maid followed him, but she did not like to go, and both ran back, he threw the poker down, and said we had him there to make ridicule of him - he only went to the first landing-place, half-way to the drawing-room. I understand he went up stairs afterwards, but that I do not recollect - he then went to call a watchman - the patrol came - we told him something had happened up stairs; he drew his sword, and went up stairs directly, but I did not go with him. After he came down I went into mistress's bed-room - several drawers were open; the patrol said he had opened them - I saw a chisel in the patrol's hand, after he came down. I saw the jewel-boxes, one was broken open, a few trinkets, of small value, were left in one box, and on the drawers, I had not been into mistress's room that evening before: Holland had called about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, and I told him I did not think master and mistress would dine at home, but I was not sure. I do not recollect whether he asked me about it, or whether I told him without being asked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Holland and you were good friends, and he came to drink tea with you? A. Yes; he had drank tea there two or three times before - mistress does not allow people to come of an afternoon - if they had dined at home he could not have come without their knowledge. I have no other acquaintance - an old woman called on me one evening; we were not forbidden to have followers - I only had this old woman to drink tea with me - I have no acquaintance named Allen, nor Stevens - I never saw the housemaid's brother - I never saw the cook, who lived there before me, visiting the house. Master and mistress knew that Holland and I were good friends, but we were forbidden to let him come - I did not know that he was married. There was no light in the hall, it was not unnatural for him to take a candle, as the staircase was dark - there is no key-hole outside the door. When my fellow-servant heard the noise, I went up, and called her - we went up, and saw the doors open, came down and told Holland - he and she went up, she ran back, and he threw down the poker.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you let Holland in did you shut the door? A. Yes, my Lord; and found it open a quarter of an hour afterward. Holland went for the patrol nearly an hour after - the patrol looked over the house, and went away, leaving Holland there - he afterward went away, and when he returned was apprehended. I was taken into custody - I never was charged with any thing else. A young woman owed me money, I had a shawl of her's, which I pawned, and when she came to pay me I gave her the shawl, it was taken out of pawn a fortnight before the robbery.</p>

I was called into the prosecutor's house about a quarter past seven o'clock, and searched it minutely from top to bottom, but found nobody; I searched the lady's bed-room, found the chest of drawers broken open, and some cases on the top, and by the side of the cases I found a chisel, with a piece broken aslant at the corner. Lee has the chisel, I locked it up at the watch-house, and next day found it in Read's hands at Hatton-garden. I pulled two or three drawers open, which were not locked, and found the clothes undisturbed - nothing was disturbed but one drawer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You searched the house minutely? A. Yes; I might he a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes about it - Holland was with me, and Elizabeth the servant - I left Holland in the house - the chisel was on the top of the drawers, by the jewel-case, I put it into my pocket, and delivered it to Hatton, the watch-house keeper to lock up - I put no mark on it. I came on duty about five o'clock - I rather think that I found the prosecutor's door ajar once before, it might be about four weeks before the robbery, but never more than once. I rang the bell, somebody came and said somebody was gone to fetch something. The chisel produced is the one I found.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden. On the night in question I was sent for to Mr. Downes's - I got there about half-past nine o'clock, and about twenty minutes past ten Holland came in - I took him into custody; he stated that he had been to his lodgings, in Hackney-road, to inform his landlord that it was not likely he should be home that night, as Mr. Downes's house had been robbed, he thought that Mr. Downes would like to have him in the house all night to protect it - he said he lodged at Ivy's, No. 25, Hackney-road. I went there next morning, and found Ivy and Ivy's wife - Holland told me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170008"/>his sister Jemima was there, but I found she was his wife - I found her there. I searched the house, but found nothing. I went there again on the Wednesday following, and apprehended Jemima. While we were there she went down stairs - I went to see where she was gone, and a man, named Stevens, whom I knew very well, came in, he also went by the name of Allen - I secured him, and found some sovereigns on him. Holland was discharged in eight or ten days, and afterwards apprehended.</p>

            . I am an officer of Whitechapel. On the 26th Jan., about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, I went with Fortune to New-court, George-yard, Whitechapel, and found the prisoner Walker there; he had his hat on, and said he was just going out; I apprehended him on another charge, he had a flannel jacket on and blue trowsers, and inside his trowsers I found a blue bag, and a smaller bag in the blue one, containing nine skeleton and one picklock key. He said, "Recollect you find them on my person in my room, and not abroad!" I saw one of these skeleton keys applied to a drawer in Mr. Downes's room, five or six days ago, it opened the drawer from which the jewel-cases were taken. I found in his room a dark lantern, with a candle in it, which had been lighted, a vice and file, which would be useful in altering keys. After taking him into custody, I returned in half an hour to search his lodging again, and found the duplicate of a diamond ring, pawned, on the 3d Jan. 1825, at Anderton's, No. 15, Commercial-road, for 6 l. in the name of William Walker, Commercial-road; the duplicate was in a small hole in a cupboard where coals are kept, wrapped in a piece of paper; he wore blue trowsers, and there was a blue coat in his room, which he has on now. On the Friday after I found the duplicate I went to the pawnbroker's and saw the ring; I looked over a number of bills which we have at our Office, and traced the ring to Mr. Downes. I afterwards went to the pawnbroker's with Mr. and Mrs. Downes, and Mrs. Downes immediately claimed it. On the 29th of January I went to No. 25, Hackney-road, and apprehended Holland and his wife: I said I had come to apprehend him about Mr. Downes's robbery. He said he supposed Mr. Downes never meant to let him rest, but give him all the trouble he could.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You took him on the 29th of January, at the same lodging as had been visited at the time of the robbery? A. Yes. The skeleton key would open a good many locks. I understand that Walker has been a pawnbroker. A reward of 50 l. had been offered for the discovery of this robbery, but I did not particularly notice the bill till I found the ring - it might have been at our office for a fortnight.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in the Commercial-road. I have a diamond ring, and the counterpart of the duplicate - it was pawned on the 3d of January; I took it in myself. I am not prepared to speak positively to the man who pawned it, but I have a strong belief that Walker is the man; I believe him to be the man - he told me his name was Walker - that the ring belonged to his father, who had occasion for 6 l., and had sent him with it - that his father had bought it six months ago, and had given twelve guineas for it, and that his father was a dyer, living in the Commercial-road. I knew there was a dyer of that name there, which induced me to take it in. He wore a blue coat, blue trowsers, and a waistcoat, which is here - (looking at it) - I am sure the man who pawned the ring wore that waistcoat, or one of that pattern. The duplicate is written by me.</p>
               <p>JAMES LEA. I found that waistcoat in the prisoner's room.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PERRY. I am servant to Mr. Anderton, and was present on the 3d of January, when this ring was pawned, and am certain that Walker is the man who pawned it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know him before? A. No. I had not seen a bill offering a reward before I swore to him, nor had I heard of it till Lea brought the duplicate - I did not see Lea myself. I did not see Walker in custody till last Friday; I heard of the reward when Lea brought the ticket, but never saw the bill. A great many people come to our shop.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have you any expectation of a reward? A. No. The moment I saw him I was certain of him. I should have known him among other people.</p>
               <p>MOSES FORTUNE. I saw that waistcoat found in the prisoner's room - Lea was with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did other people lodge in the room? A. I enquired, and understood that only him and a woman lived there. I believe a list of articles bought at a sale were found on him by Lea. Walker said nothing about that.</p>

            . I am the wife of Mr. Thomas Downes - we live at No. 31, Great James-street, Bedford-row, in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn. On the 1st of January I was in possession of the jewels which these caskets contained - the ring produced is one of the rings stolen from this one, which was broken open; and four days after the robbery I found part of the broken chisel in that box. The ring had been in my possession nine years - I wore it on the 1st of January, and put it into that box on the morning of the 2d. I found this piece of the chisel in the jewel-case four days after (producing it.) The chisel was shewn to me on the evening of the robbery, when I returned home; I knew it to be one used by the servants, to take up the carpets. I have often seen it in the housemaid's hands, for that purpose, when I have been on the stairs, and seen her taking up the carpets.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you find the piece of chisel? A. Between the edge of the box and the lock. I happened to take the box up to shew a friend - I had not opened it before. Sarah Rouse was the last cook I had - I never knew her to have followers. I know the ring by the pattern and workmanship, and it fits me; I am convinced that it is mine: I swear to it. I never saw another of the same pattern; I have no mark on it.</p>

Holland came into my service on the 10th of October; I discharged him on the 7th of December - he did not come afterwards by my permission. On Sunday, the 2d of January. I and Mrs. Downes went out - we returned about half-past ten o'clock at night, and soon afterwards went into the bed-room, having received information of what had happened - I found Mrs. Downes's jewel cases on a chest of drawers; they were kept in one of the drawers of that chest - one box laid open, and the contents were gone, except a few beads - a tray belonging<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170009"/>to it laid near the window; I had seen the case the evening before, but not the contents; I had seen them about a week before. I have no doubt of the ring produced being hers; I gave twelve guineas for it. I had a tool basket when Holland was in my service - the chisel produced was in that basket; I saw it on the drawers on the night of the robbery - it was not there in the morning. The basket was kept in the footman's pantry, on the basement story. Whoever got the chisel must have gone into the pantry for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was occasionally used by the housemaid - have you ever seen it used by the cook? A. Never. Holland came to me from Bath, with a good character; he did not give me warning: I discharged him on the 7th of December. He might have expressed a wish to leave - his conduct was good for the first month. I do not know that my former cook had followers. I always said I had no doubt about the ring.</p>

               <p>Newgate Prison.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Humphries, Broadway, Blackfriars.</p>
               <p>M'INTIRE (in continuation.) I received the letter, No. 2, from him in Newgate, and waited while he wrote it. I merely wanted it as a document to shew to a supposed person, who was to come forward with me to prove an alibi. After I was discharged from the charge against me I went to Mr. Downes, to tell him what I knew - I thought it my duty so to do, and it was arranged that I should go on, and have interviews with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you and Walker when you were in the New Prison? A. Walker said he was confined on suspicion of robbery, and that he had acted a foolish part in one respect, by detaining the duplicate of a ring, which he had pawned for six guineas - that he thought it was made away with, but, still it was all right, for he having been in a pawnbroker's employ for above five years, must be supposed to know how to act differently, and consequently had the ring come wrong to his hands he would not have put it in his own name; that he should represent himself as a general dealer, and having been apprehended with a catalogue in his pocket it would carry great weight - therefore all he wanted was to prove an alibi, and as I was sure of being discharged if I would procure another friend with myself to prove an alibi, they would find a third person, and then there was no doubt of they being turned up - this was on the Saturday. On Monday, the 8th of February, I felt it my duty to go to Mr. Downes, and acquaint him of what Walker had said to me - he desired me to carry the business on, and he found a second person, named Carter, who came to me on Tuesday, and I introduced him to Walker, through the bars of the prison; he said, "I hope you are well?" Walker said, "Stop a minute;" he went to a room, and came out with 5 s. in a piece of paper, with, "You and your friend will accept this for a bottle of wine," written in pencil. I said to him, "I cannot be introduced to your friend without a letter;" he said, "Be quiet - drink your wine and return to me, and I will have the letter ready for you." Carter and I went to the nearest house to the prison; returned, and received the letter marked No. 1, from his own hand - I took it to Mr. Downes, without breaking the seal, and after that went to enquire after Haydon, as the note was addressed to him - I went to him that night (Tuesday,) at New-court, George yard, Wentworth-street, but did not find him; I went home. I saw Walker next day, and told him I could not find Haydon - I had seen a woman, who gave me a note for Walker; I delivered it to him, and Walker gave me an answer; it was not sealed: I read it, and delivered the reply to Haydon himself, that night, Wednesday, as I found him then; he read it, but not loud, and burnt it in my presence. It was from Walker to Haydon, complaining of their not giving him the necessary support to bring him through this trial, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170010"/>observing that when they were placed in a similar condition he had not been wanting in doing the same for them. I afterwards saw Walker again, and told him I thought his friends were not acting so faithful to him as he might expect - he said that under similar circumstances he had supplied them, even with bread. and desired me to go to them again - I went, and an appointment was made, but they did not attend.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Walker say how this robbery was done? mention no names if you can avoid it? A. While I was in prison with him he told me, among other things that he had been a depredator for a considerable time, and had been very successful, and had gained more than 2000 l. in two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Confine yourself to this charge? A. He said he knew of this robbery, and it was a put up thing for some time before - that a certain person told him how it was to be done; that they could know nothing of the crib (by which I understood the house) without that person's assistance, and two or three days before the robbery they were warned by that person, that on a certain day they would be there, and would take an opportunity at the appointed time to give them admittance. Walker further observed that they, one or other, were continually to walk before the house, and whoever should be nearest to the door when it was opened (by that certain person) he was to go in - that the case occured, and the lot fell upon Jonah; I understood him to mean himself, for his next expression was, "It being a put up job, I knew where to go to - it was all right, and it was done in a few minutes. I went out, and the produce was all done away with on the morrow;" he particularly lamented about a set of pearls - he said he had been five years with a pawnbroker, and knew a little about those things, and said, "If I had had to pledge them on the square, I could have got 80 l. on them" - he explained that if he was honestly authorized to sell them he could have got that, and very much lamented being obliged to break them up, and sell them under 20 l. He said nothing further then, but a prisoner, named John Haydon, came in, who I believe was implicated with him; I was introduced to him. Haydon said to Walker, "If I am discharged you will be all right." Walker had various conversations with me; he said it was a very clever job, very easily done - that when he got into the house he merely went to work, and was but a few minutes in the house; he said that the person who planned the robbery, naming him, was the person who opened the door to him. He said, "We were directed by that person to walk up and down, and whoever was nearest to the door when it was opened, by that person, was to go in, and the lot fell upon Jonah," and that the person shut the door with great violence, to prevent the servants from supposing that it was not closed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What countryman are you? A. A Londoner. I was never in a Court of Justice before, either as principal, accessory, or defendant. I have been a printer from my childhood.</p>
               <p>Q. When he spoke of an alibi did you say to him, how can you think of such a thing when it is not true? A. No; I was incarcerated in a place full of rogues, and found that a man who was not as big a rogue as themselves was treated shamefully, and they knew I had been to Botany Bay - I went in the Royal Admiral, which took out convicts and Missionaries; I was only there six weeks. I returned with the vessel. I was an officer of the ship, not a convict. I was afraid of being ill used in the prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your fear take you to Mr. Downes? A. No; common Justice. I had never heard of a reward till within the last two days - I swear that. I went to Mr. Downes on Monday, the 8th - I had been liberated on the preceeding Saturday. Mr. Downes, at my request, found a man who was to prove the alibi with me - the prisoner having desired me to procure a person. Mr. Downes said if I went forward I should do justice to the public, and bring a set of villians to justice. Carter is not here. It was at my suggestion that Walker wrote a letter to his friend, to introduce us to him, and I believe the second letter was written by my desiring him to give me a confirmation, in writing, of his former proposals.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it at your suggestion that you went to the prisoner's attorney, and stated all this, that you might be examined in Court? A. I went to his solicitor, and saw my evidence in your brief. Carter did not do so. I saw Carter yesterday week.</p>
               <p>Q. Was anybody present when Walker made a communication to you about the alibi? A. Plenty; but none of them attended to our conversation - nobody was with me. I made no communication to the gaoler about what was going on.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. You went to Botany Bay, as an officer of the ship? A. Yes - I was not a transport. I did not tell Walker why I wanted his letters. I said it was for my own satisfaction, but did not tell him the use I put them to. I desired Mr. Downes to get some person, as I did not wish to be considered as acting in collusion.</p>
               <p>MRS. DOWNES re-examined. I lost a complete set of pearls, three rows for the neck, drop ear-rings, a brooch, a handsome head ornament, and other things - they were very valueable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HOLLAND. Q. Had I an opportunity of knowing where your trinkets were? A. I cannot say - you once went into my bed-room with the plate: I desired the servant not to let you go in again.</p>
               <p>WALKER'S Defence. I am altogether innocent. Mrs. Downes cannot swear to the ring; I could go round the City and get four hundred of the same description - I will find several in every jeweller's shop, and cannot think you will allow such a ring to be sworn to. As to that man - he makes himself out a complete villian: I gave him no letter, He has done this to get the reward.</p>
               <p>HOLLAND, in his Defence, denied the charge, and complained of being uncomfortable in the prosecutor's service.</p>

I concealed myself, and saw him take a bag with flour in it, and secrete it under the flour bin. I said nothing; but about twenty minutes past eight o'clock next morning, when he left to go to breakfast, I got an officer, who took him; 3 1/2 lbs. of flour were found in a paper bag in his hat, with my name on it, and two rolls in his pocket. I allowed him 23 s. a week, and bread and beer to eat in the house, and three 2 lb. loaves for his wife - he had no authority to take flour or rolls off the premises without my knowledge.</p>

No. I never told Shepherd that I permitted the prisoner to take what bread he liked - I said what I allowed him, and that if he asked for more I should have given it to him; I always gave it to him, and did not permit him to take it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How did he secrete the flour under the bin? A. He took it from the shop into the bake-house, and put it under the bin, so that nobody could see it without going on their knees, and looking right under.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 15th of January, between one and two o'clock, I was aroused from my sleep by the bell ringing violently; I got up, went down stairs, and found three watchmen at the door - they gave me information - I went to the watch-house, and there found the constable of the night and watchmen; they shewed me the property stated in the indictment, which is mine - the prisoners were in custody, (examining the property,) it is all mine, and was kept on a side-board in my dining-room, and was in common use, I saw it all the evening before. Here are two 1 l. notes, which were in my iron chest in the front office; Ferguson had been in the habit of going to that chest, and knew where the key was: here is a ring, which was in my own desk, which I found locked, but missed the ring - his own desk was broken open. I saw the notes in the chest the night preceding; I had not fastened the door the night before myself - I had let the back office, where they got in, to Mr. Brocklebank, he had no occasion for it, and they informed me they had locked it up; I do not know what state it was in the night before, I know it was locked up because I have access to it from a door in the passage, and had seen it the day before (the 14th,) it was then fastened; I know of nobody going in after me - the robbery was on Saturday morning, the 15th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Have you any partner? A. My son has been in partnership with me many years, he is insane, and therefore I cannot dissolve the partnership - I rent the house alone - the business is carried on in the front office; most of the property was in my dining-room: my son is in the house, attended by a nurse. The rent and taxes were never paid out of the partnership concern. I let the back office last June; Mr. Brocklebank has returned the key to me since the robbery - he is in occupation now, but does not use the office. I do not think that there was any agreement with him in the name of myself and son; the lease of the house is in my name; I only charge the partnership with a certain sum as rent of the office. I have known Ferguson ten years, he was in my service up to that very night, and bore an excellent character among most respectable individuals. He had a key of his own desk, it was broken open, and mine locked. The door leading from Mr. Brocklebank's office to the passage is merely fastened with a drop latch, and can be opened at any time. My daughter had fastened up the premises, she is not here: I heard the bar of the front door put up that night.</p>

            . I am a watchman. Mr. Gilson's house is in the parish of St. Dunstan in the East. On the 14th of January I came on my beat at nine o'clock and stopped till eleven, when a man relieved me; I went to the watch-house, and relieved him about one, and in consequence of what he told me, I looked at Mr. Gilson's house, and saw a light through the fan-light over the door - I had never seen that before. I went up to the door, and the light instantly disappeared. I crossed over the road, and stood against a door directly opposite, and the light appeared again. M'Carty, another watchman, joined me, he called one o'clock, and the light again disappeared. He went round his beat, I stood at my post, and when he came back I saw the light again - he came towards me, and the light disappeared. I went to the corner post, keeping my eye on the fan-light, and the street door opened; the prisoner Jones looked out first, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170012"/>am certain he is the man; he put his head in, and in a minute or two Ferguson looked out over his shoulder; I placed M'Carty there while I fetched Caffyn, placed them both there, pulled the street door bell, and the door immediately came open. Ferguson came out first, with his two fists doubled, striking before him; he struck Caffyn, who fell against the other watchman: Jones came out after him, I followed and came up to him, with the other watchman, and caught hold of him. He said, "Don't ill use me, nor pull me about, I will go quietly, for this will be a finish." I took him to the watch-house, and saw one parcel of the plate produced found on him by Davis, the constable of the night: he was put into the strong room, and soon after Ferguson was brought in by Brown, a watchman: he told Davis that as he knew him, he would not deceive him, but give him up the articles. He put his hand into his pocket, and took out a crow bar, laid it on the table, and then some skeleton keys, and a phosphorus box - the remainder of the silver plate and the mourning ring. I am sure Jones is the man who came out of the house, I never lost sight of him.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 15th of January, I was on the next beat to Kayle: he called, and desired me to look after Mr. Gilson's door - he rang the bell - I was going up to the door when Ferguson ran out and knocked Caffyn down. I nearly fell over in attempting to catch Ferguson, but missed him. I had seen him put his head out before, and then shut the door; there was light enough for me to know him; I missed my hold and sprang my rattle, and called Stop thief! followed him down Mark-lane into Seething-lane; Brown stopped him, but not in my sight - I came up and took him from Brown.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was by Mr. Gilson's house; Ferguson came out with his fists doubled, as if to resist any one who opposed him. I do not know that he struck me purposely, but by his forcing his way to escape he knocked me down: I struck at him, but missed him. I followed him down Mark-lane, saw somebody turn into Seething-lane, and heard Brown sing out "I have got him;" and when I came up found him in Brown's charge. I had not lost sight of him above a minute - I did not know him before - I had a good view of him when he came out, and am positive he is the man who came out.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. On the 15th of January, between one and two o'clock. Kayle brought Jones to the watch-house; I searched him, and found a parcel of silver plate on him, and a handle, which was broken off a ladle, which ladle was found on Ferguson, who was brought in in a few minutes, which I was surprised at, having known him so long. I told him I was sorry to see him, but I must search him. He said, "Mr. Davis, you must do your duty; I will give every thing up to you." He pulled these articles out. I searched him afterwards, and found a ring on him. I sent for Mr. Gilson, who claimed them: I went to Mr. Gilson's, and applied this key to the counting-house door, and found it opened it outside and inside. Ferguson's desk was broken open: I applied a skeleton key to Mr. Gilson's desk, and it opened it; and another key opened the side desks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Some plate was produced from the pockets of both prisoners? A. Yes - I locked it up immediately; it has been in my possession ever since; I have had the key of the drawer. I took it to the Mansion House; it was in my custody all the time: it was in the hands of Mr. Cope, the City marshal, for seven or eight minutes - it was in his own office; I gave it into his care. I examined it to see if it was correct; I made no mark on it. The ring has Mr. Gilson's name on it.</p>

On the 12th of January I missed a lamp from the stock - it had been at the top of a wardrobe on the back of the front shop; I cannot say when I had seen it last; but having an order for six lamps which were generally kept there, I missed one of them. I made enquiries about, and accused the prisoner, who lodged with me, of having taken it; I said, "John, what have you done with the brass bracket lamp?" - he fell into tears, and produced a duplicate of it.</p>

There were other lodgers in the house. I asked where they had got the fowls; they said they had bought them down the lane, but did not say of whom. I took them into custody. I do not know whether the two men lived there or not.</p>

I am quite sure that when I went with her I had a purse in my pocket, containing a guinea and sixteen shillings; I had been taking a friendly glass, but was perfectly collected. I missed the purse while I was on the bed with the prisoner - I charged her with having taken it, and said I would not leave her till she gave it to me. She got off the bed, and opened the door - two other women made their appearance; I still kept hold of her, and would not let her go. All the women then made use of very bad language to me; I told them I would not let her go, but they got her from me. I pursued her - she fell at the bottom of the stairs, and I took hold of her again, and said if she would return my purse I would give her 5 s., but if she did not I would call an officer. I had given her 1 s. 6 d. before. She did not return the purse, and I gave charge of her to the beadle, who was passing. I have not seen the purse since. I am certain it was in my right hand trowsers pocket.</p>

On the evening of the 29th of January, about ten o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop, and offered to pawn a silver gilt vinegarette.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170015"/>for 1 l. - I asked who it belonged to; he said to himself - that he was a captain's boy, and it had been left in the cabin, he supposed, by some passengers. I asked if he had informed the captain of it - he said No, it had happened twelve months ago, and no enquiries having been made he thought he had a right to convert it to his own use. I then opened the case, and found the vinegar was very strong, which convinced me he had lately stolen, or found it. On the following Monday I had to attend a sale, and before I left that sale, the officer and the prosecutor came to my shop about the business.</p>

On Saturday night, the 4th of December last, I went to bed between ten and eleven o'clock; I was awoke at half-past two, on the Sunday morning, by a noise over head, as of some person jumping. I slept in a room opposite a passage leading into Saville-row: I saw a light, and heard something knocked down; I heard a voice say "D - n it, it is only the mens' beer!" I heard something like silver being<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170016"/>tossed up, and falling to the ground; I heard the fuse of a match taking fire. I then heard some one say, "Look to the door." I got out of bed, and went through the kitchen, which leads towards Burlington-street; I went and called my master; he, his brother, and myself went on the leads over the shop; there are two sky-lights there: one pane of glass was broken in one of them. My master showed me some blood on it next morning. The shop is near the room where I sleep; there are two doors to that room - one leads from the shop into a passage, which leads to Saville-row. I heard a door move while I was in bed - the door which leads into Saville-row was fastened with the spring lock after master got up, but it had been fastened with two bolts before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is your masters' house in Burlington-street? A. Yes; the warehouse is in Saville-row: there is a communication between them without going into the street; my master goes that way from time to time, to give orders, and do business. I heard a person jump, and a person speak, but I heard no answer. I do not know that there was more than one person there. By the fuse of a match, I mean the match taking light from the box; I have seen such things in the street; and heard the noise - it is the breathing of a flame. I did not see the pane of glass with the blood on it till the next morning. My master got up when I called him. I do not know that any other person was up at the time.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. You have been asked whether there were more than one person, and you say you heard a voice more than once - did they appear to be different voices? A. Yes. I distinctly heard the lighting of the fuse. There is a trap door from the room where the thieves were to my room - that door was open. I went out upon the leads - it did not rain then, but when I got up in the morning it appeared as if it had rained in the night. When I saw the blood it was on the inside.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How lately had you seen the window before? A. I do not know. The blood was a small smear - it might have been there a month before. I had not been on the leads for some time; I know that the skylight was whole in the course of the day before. When the glass was broken any person could have cut the string which fastened the sky-light.</p>

            . I am an attorney, and am the prosecutor's brother; his name is James Lane: the house is in the parish of St. James, Westminster; my brother is the sole owner of it. On the 4th of December I was sleeping there, and was awoke by my brother and Jones. The room in which I sleep joins the work-shop, and communicates with the leads, by means of a passage. I got out of bed - I went into my dressing-room, and got a pistol. We got on the leads - as I passed the sky-light I thought I saw a person, and discharged the pistol at him; when we got to the end of the leads, leading to Saville-row, we saw a man within two yards of our door; that was Durham, who was tried last Session; I searched the premises, and found behind the door leading to Saville-row, a dark lantern, with a small wax candle in it. I examined the post of the door next morning, and saw some smears of blood on the right hand door post, in going out, about a yard from the bottom. On the night in question I went to the watch-house, and while I was giving charge of Durham the prisoner was brought in, and searched in my presence - I saw two whole wax candles and a piece of one taken from his person; I think from his breeches pocket. I went home immediately, and fetched the lantern which I had found on the premises; I compared the candle in the lantern with those found on they prisoner; they corresponded exactly. He said he lived somewhere in Whitechapel; I did not observe his hand. I think he said he was a commission broker, but had only been a short time in town. I attended at Marlborough-street the following morning. I examined the sky-light about nine or ten o'clock; I observed part of one of the panes had been cut out, and a part of it was lying by the side; we then went into the shop, into which that sky-light looks - I saw several marks of blood, which had run down on the inside of the sky-light; they appeared to be fresh - they were hardly dry.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. That blood is the same as the boy saw? A. Yes. I think there were five marks.</p>
               <p>Q. There are many tailors there at work, and some awkward fellow might have cut his finger? A. Yes. The blood on the door post was outside, and could have been made by a person going by the house. Durham was near that very door, and he was the only man I saw near the house. He had on a black coat. I saw Durham's hands at the watch-house, and there was no appearance of any blood on them.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did the candles appear to be cut, or where they whole short candles? A. They were whole candles.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. George, Hanover-square. On the morning of the 5th of December I saw the prisoner while I was calling half-past two o'clock - he was coming from Mr. Lane's back premises, into Clifford-street, opposite Saville-row; I pursued him, but did not take him. When he was taken I saw some blood on one of his hands, but I cannot say which - it was more particularly examined by another person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far from Saville-row was he when you first saw him? A. He might have turned the corner, about one hundred yards towards Bond-street; he was upon the run. I crossed over, and cried Stop thief! I had seen Durham at the watch-house before, and knew of the robbery. I went to the watch-house, and stopped there till another watchman brought the prisoner in.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Was there any alarm given to the watchmen about the robbery? A. Yes, and we had directions to look out.</p>

            . I am a watchman - my beat is in Berkley-square. I was induced to follow the prisoner on the morning of the 5th of December - at the corner of Hay-hill I heard the footsteps of two persons running; I saw the prisoner, and the last witness running after him; the prisoner thought to get into Landsdown-passage, but I stopped him there, and he turned back into Bruton-mews; I followed after him, and desired him to stop several times, but he made no answer. I made a prisoner of him just as he got to Bruton-street; I thought he would faint every minute, as he was blowing so - he asked me to let him rest a minute; he appeared very warm, like a person who had just been running. I let him stop some time, and he put his hand into his pocket to take his handkerchief to wipe some blood off his hand; another<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170017"/>watchman came to my assistance a few minutes before; while the prisoner was taking out his handkerchief something fell out of his pocket, which sounded like a key, or a piece of iron; I said, "Something dropped from you" - he said, "It must be from yourself, not from me." I told my companion to take notice of the place. I did not hurt his hand so as to make the blood come, nor did Wilkinson. There was no scuffle between us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What parish do you belong to? A. St. George's; Addison and Wilkinson belong to the same parish. There was no watchmen of St. James's there. The prisoner was taken to St. James's watch-house - he had a cut on his hand - I did not notice it particularly, but I think it was cut with glass; I think it was cut with the glass of a sky-light. I do not know which hand was cut, but I think the left - it was a small cut.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. George's, Hanover-square. I took the prisoner on the morning of the 5th of December. I heard something fall from him, which sounded like a key. We took him to Berkley-square, and delivered him to some watchmen of St. James's. I went back to the spot where I had heard something fall, and found two centre bits, which I delivered to Skinner, the patrol.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not know whether they laid upon the ground before, or fell from the prisoner? A. No. I was on his right side, and had hold of his right arm, I am not sure that he could not put that hand into his pocket. I saw the prisoner pull out his handkerchief, but I cannot tell whether it was at that time I heard the iron fall; I believe he had his hand in his pocket two or three times in going down the mews. I do not think what I heard drop was when he pulled out his handkerchief; it might be about ten minutes afterwards before I picked up the centre bits. I had not seen any persons walking there shortly before they fell.</p>

            . I was night constable. On the morning of the 5th of December the prisoner was brought to St. James's watch-house, and given in charge for attempting to commit a burglary in the house of Mr. Lane. When I requested him to account for his running, he could give no distinct reason, but said he was on his way home, and the watchmen had pursued him, and used him in a very rough manner; but he denied any knowledge of the transaction of which he was accused. I asked where he had been - I think he said he had been spending the evening near Knightsbridge; I then asked his name, and where he lived - he said he would reserve that for a future opportunity. On pressing him further on the point, he said he lived in the neighbourhood of Whitechapel - that he had lately come from Manchester, and his name was John Thompson. He was then searched, and a purse, with 3 s. or 4 s. was found on him. I kept the purse, and gave him the silver for his own use. I found a small knife, a glass, and three pieces of wax candles on his person. His hands were very dirty, and the right one bleeding very much - I desired him to shew it to me, which he did with great reluctance, and said it was in consequence of the struggle with the watchmen who took him captive - that it had been bruised against a wall - I looked at it, and though not a judge of wounds I am certain it could not have been from a bruise against a wall - it appeared to be cut with something sharp. The dark lantern was brought afterwards, by some of Mr. Lane's people; here is the lantern and the candle that was in it. The candle in his pocket exactly corresponds with that in the lantern. Durham was brought up the same evening, on the same charge - they did not appear to know each other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. On what part of the hand was the wound? A. It was about the middle of the back of the hand. I cannot undertake to say it might not have been made by some sharp nail in a wall, but I think not. I do not know whether the candles were particular ones or no.</p>

I am a watchman of St. James's. - On the 5th of December I apprehended Durham, near Burligton Arcade, in Cork-street; he dropped a chisel, which I delivered to the constable of the night. Durham was running towards me, and crying Stop thief; but there was no one in the street but himself. I took him back to the other watchmen, who said that was the man; I saw nothing of the prisoner till he was at the watch-house.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Stoker - he is a partner with Mr. Lane. I was at work at Mr. Lane's on the 4th of December - I shut the sky-light myself, and no pane of glass was broken then - the light is fastened by a cord which was cut the next morning. Cutting that cord would not enable a person to raise the sky-light higher - I think those who cut it did not understand it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When the sky-light was shut as you left it, does it want any thing more than for a man to put his hand in to pull it up? A. No. It was not fastened by a bolt or latch, or any other fastening whatever. I had seen it on the Saturday evening, about six o'clock; it could not have been left a little way open - its own weight would have shut it.</p>
               <p>MR. JAMES LANE. On the morning after the burglary I observed the sky-light open; it was propped up by this chisel, which I marked at the top - no person could have got in by any other means, but at this sky-light. My father, Mr. Richard Lane, and Mr. Peter Stoker are in partnership with me. At the time the alarm was given I went to that part of the premises leading to Saville-row; I found the door only on the spring, which had been double bolted and locked. Whoever opened that door must have done it to get out, not to get in.</p>

            . I was landlord of the Fox and Goose, public-house, on the 5th of December. Durham had lodged with me for a week or ten days; he left a box behind him in my room - some person, who was a stranger, called afterwards for a shirt belonging to him; I gave him a shirt and a pair of stockings. I have seen the prisoner in my house two or three times, but I never recollect seeing him in conversation with Durham. I delivered three keys to Cousins, and one of them fitted the box.</p>

            . I live at No. 11, Black Horse-court, Fleet-street. About the 5th of December the prisoner lodged at my house, by the name of Lintott - he had a two pair of stairs room; he lived there five months, till he was taken up. Cousins, the officer, came and searched<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170018"/>his apartment - I believe he took something out of his room. I saw a bundle, but I do not know what was in it.

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I went to the Fox and Goose on the 10th of December - I enquired if a person of the name of Durham lived there; the landlord said he had, and showed me his room. I took two large skeleton keys from a drawer that day, and Mr. Newman gave me three keys - one of which opened a box, and I found some duplicates in it; I took them, and gave the keys back to Mr. Newman. I went again next day, and took a pair of worsted stockings and a shirt from the box: they were marked H. D. I afterwards went to Catherine Winwood's, No. 11, Black Horse-court, Fleet-street; I went to Lintott's room, on the second pair of stairs; I found in a drawer three files, a picklock key, and a phosphorus box, with no phosphorus in it - there were some matches in a piece of paper, and two small bits of wax candle, one of them appears to be cut at the end, to fit some small nozzle - in a second drawer I found a shirt, marked H. D., and a pair of speckled stockings, marked H. D., with ink: they appear to be marked in the same manner, and I think by the same hand as those found at Newman's. The shirt at Lintott's was marked H. D., and the shirt at Newmen's was marked H. D., No. 5 - they appear to be marked with the same sort of marking thread. On a chair in the room I found a dirty shirt, marked J. L. I then went into the cellar, and in a hole, behind some bricks, I found two bundles of skeleton keys. I have been in the habit of comparing property of different kinds, and I believe the shirts are made of the same sort of cloth; the stockings appear to be the same. I have seen the prisoner before he was in custody; I received a chisel from the night constable, which I marked, and gave to him again. I took the chisel, and compared it with the marks on the sky-light; it corresponded with them exactly; the other chisel was supporting the sky-light, but that did not correspond with the marks at all. I received the stock of a centre bit from a person of the name of Carter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How did the sky-light shut? A. It appeared to require something to hold it up, but when down it did not appear to have any fastening but its own weight; one of the chisels was used to keep it up. A man could have got in when it was raised up. I am not a linen-draper. I have not marked much linen, but my own linen is marked. The prisoner had been in custody some days before I went to his lodgings - he could have sent to his lodgings if he had been so disposed. I knew where he had lived for some time before he was taken.</p>
               <p>MR. WM. LANE re-examined. I saw Cousins compare the chisel with the marks on the sky-light - they appeared to fit it exactly.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 28th of November I saw the prisoner and Durham together in company with Abrahams; it was about half-past eleven, or a little before twelve o'clock at night; they appeared to me to be in company together; there were other persons there. I have known the prisoner five or six months.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long were you in the room? A. They might be together five or six, or seven minutes, and then Linlott went out. It is not uncommon for persons sitting in such a room as that to talk together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentleman of the Jury, considering the situation in which I stand, I find it a most arduous task to address you - in a case like this, involving my life and liberty, but, relying on my innocence, I shall await your judgment with confidence. I had been to supper at the West end of the town - in returning I heard an alarm of Stop thief! a man ran past me - I pursued him: he turned up a mews; I stood still, and the watchman came and laid hold of me; I told them I was not the person - they said I was, and took me down the mews. I heard something strike against the stones, but I dropped nothing. They looked some time, and then went on to the bottom of the mews, where several watchmen were; it was two watchmen belonging to St. George's, who had me in custody - there were several watchmen, and they were contending about where I should he taken. I complained of my hand being hurt when I was up at Marlborough-street; the Magistrate desired one of the officers to look at my hand, and the officers gave it as their opinion that it was not a cut, but torn or rent. There is no evidence that I had been on the premises, and it must strike you as evident that if the sky-light would not lift up more than nine inches, it would not be possible for me to get through so small a crevice as that. The witnesses state there was blood on the sky-light, and on the door - but there is no evidence to prove I was near either. They state they came and looked over the leads, and saw the young man not included in the indictment, near the door. The nearest that any of them states I was, is one hundred yards at least, and it must have been very difficult for him to identify me; if any one had seen me near the premises it would have been evidence on the subject. The watchmen admit each of them having hold of an arm in the mews, and therefore it was not possible for me to let the bits fall from my person. You will, Gentlemen, have the goodness to look at these articles, and in a mews, which has always rough stones, it would be very easy for any person walking to have kicked them against the stones. As to the things which are stated to have been found at my lodgings, there is no proof that they were ever there, but an attempt has been made to crimluate me, and it is entirely out of malice that these things are brought here. The young man tried with me last Session was an entire stranger to me. I have now been nearly three months in custody; I was brought up last Session, but through some mistake in the indictment I was then sent back, and have had the greatest difficulty in providing myself with evidence to clear myself; while my prosecutors have had every advantage. I beg, Gentleman, you will consider the nature of the evidence is entirely circumstantial, and the very deceptive nature of such evidence, and I conjure you to divest your minds of every prejudice that may have arisen during this examinaation. One of the witnesses, of the name of Purton, who has this day come forward against me, was wanted as much at Marlborough-street, but then he was not brought forward.</p>

On the 8th of February the prisoners came to my shop, about six o'clock in the evening - we had one or two lamps lighted; they came in arm-in-arm, and said they wanted to look at some gold seals. Cumber first addressed me, and said "The reason of my not coming back," (for an article which he named, but I forget what,) "was, the lady suited herself before she got home." They then asked to look at the seals, and I shewed them a tray of seals. Reeves looked at them, while Cumber stood at some little distance staring me in the face; he came once or twice to the counter and asked some questions about the price, and other things. I saw Reeves conceal a seal in his hand: I immediately removed the tray. Cumber then came up to his companion and pushed him on the elbow, and muttered something to him. Reeves then opened his hand, with the seal in it, and enquired the price of it. I took it out of his hand and put it out of the way. Two seals which he had before looked at, then laid close to my body, at a distance from them. Reeves then desired me to send those two to No. 15, Lincoln's-Inn-fields to his father, who kept a druggist's shop. They were then retiring from the counter. I then told them they did not wish to buy seals, but came to steal them. I immediately told my young man to go round and shut the door. Reeves then came close up to the counter, and leaned over it for a minute or two; he then turned round, and dropped three seals on the counter where he had been leaning. I am quite sure there were no seals on the counter just before, as I had removed them, suspecting their design. The officer took them into custody. I went to No. 15, Lincoln's-Inn-fields, and found there was no such person. The seals cost me 11 l. odd.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are you sure Reeves did not mention the name of any street near Lincoln's-Inn-fields? A. No; I wrote it down immediately, and am sure I am right. There was no handkerchief or cloth on the counter when I saw the three seals there: there were two seals near me on the counter. There were perhaps two or three hundred seals in the box - he had asked the price of several, and of one of the three which were laid on the counter.</p>

            . I am a shopman to Mr. Gass. I was not present when the prisoners came into the shop, but was afterwards; my master desired me to shut the the door, for the purpose of detaining them. I am certain the counter was clear of seals at the time I went round to shut the door; the prisoners were then at a short distance from the counter. I saw the three seals on the counter as soon as I turned round from shutting the door - there was a pocket handkerchief lying on the counter at some distance, belonging to one of them - the seals could not have been shaken from that handkerchief on the glass, without our hearing them.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer. I was in Kingsland-road on the 12th of October, between seven and eight o'clock at night, and saw the waggon there, and the prisoner in it - he had three more with him, who were standing against a stay shop; the prisoner got into the waggon twice, and came out again without bringing any thing - he went in a third time, and came out with a little bundle under his arm, which he gave to one of the others. I followed them into Hare-walk - they all went together, when they got to the bottom of Hare-walk I lost sight of them. I presently saw three of them come up again with the things in a basket, a bundle, and a bag - the prisoner had the bundle, it seemed to me to be the same. I followed them to the corner of Turner-square - one of them went up Hoxton, the prisoner and another went down the square - I did not see him again till he was in custody - I knew him before quite well. I went home and told my father, he told the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where do you live? A. At the side of the Dutchess of York, public-house, Kingsland-road - the prisoner lived with his father. I have never been to his father to enquire about him. I saw the prisoner take this bundle from the waggon; it was after I had been here.</p>
               <p>Q. How long afterwards? A. No, it was about a week after I had seen the waggon robbed; my father told me it was on the 12th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you on the 9th of October? A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. What day is this? A. I do not know, nor what month. I can swear this was on the 12th of October, because my father told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been at a fire to-day? A. Yes, on Ludgate-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. And was you charged there with picking a pocket? A. Yes, but I never picked a pocket in my life. I am a bricklayer. I live in Union-buildings, Kingsland-road, but at the time of the robbery I lived in Wellington-street.</p>
               <p>Q. The persons you appeared against before were Briggs and Carter? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always given the same account of it? A. Wells and Archer were with me, and saw what I did.</p>

One of them said, "Here shipmate, I want to speak to you." I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170021"/>turned back, and when I got near the door they went back into the house; I went inside, and they immediately shut the door - the shop was then all dark. They said, "Go in there." I was all in the dark, and asked what for: they said nothing, but the prisoner shoved me into a back room at the further end of the shop, and while he was doing that I heard the other baring the street door. They both came into the room, and told me to strip - I asked what for; the answer was, I must strip: I said I would not; they said they would make me. Both laid hold of me, and pulled my jacket and waistcoat off; I did all I could to get from them, and called out, "They are robbing me." They hove me down on my back, and took off my trowsers. The prisoner then went into the shop, and brought in a frock, waistcoat, and trowsers, and told me to put them on, which I did. The frock and trowsers were new, and the waistcoat old, but mine were a complete new suit of sailor's clothes. When they had dressed me, they pointed to some steps, and told me to go down there, which I did, because I was afraid of my life. The street door was shut all the time. I went down the steps into the cellar, which was quite dark; they shut the flap door upon me. I remained there from about twelve o'clock till dark - the same men then came and opened the flap: they had no candle, but I could see them by a light from the back parlour fire. They said, "Come up," which I did - they told me to go out - I was going, but turned back, and asked if they would be kind enough to give me my clothes; they said they would not. I go out into the street - I do not know the time - I was afraid to go back to my vessel, as the captain would hide me for losing my clothes. I walked about the streets all night, and went on board a West Indiaman next morning. I saw the master of the Aurora three weeks after - I had told the mate of the West Indiaman of it. I had paid 2 l. 3 s. 11 d. for my clothes, and only wore them five times - those the prisoner gave me were worth about 7 s. altogether. On the 14th of January I went with Blythe to Rosemary-lane, and saw the prisoner standing at the door of a clothes shop - I do not know whether it was the same shop - it was on the same side of the way; I pointed him out, and knew him to be the man. I told the officer he was the very man who took my clothes off - he asked him if he belonged to the shop - he said he did.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How long have you been at sea? A. Two years and nine months, under the same captain. I was never flogged for making away with my clothes. I should know the other man if I saw him. I do not know at what time they let me out - I saw the watchman, but did not tell him. I told nobody of it but the mate. I went down to Northfleet in the Indiaman, and told some persons of it there; they said I should write to my uncle, which I did, and told him I had lost my clothes; he came down with my indentures next day, and took me to the ship, and then took me to Blythe, the officer. I swear he is the man. I had no money about me. I had leave to go and see an old school-fellow. I was afraid to return to my ship.</p>

I afterwards heard a loud talking, as if a man and woman were at words - I afterwards heard a voice calling out, "Mary, the man is bleeding." (Mary Moore lives opposite.) I had a young child to attend to, and did not go down. I heard people coming into the house: I went down in a quarter of an hour, to the door of the prisoner's room, and found several watchmen and neighbours there. The prisoner was on her knees, clasping her hands together, and calling out that she had murdered her husband - she was kneeling on his body, and kissing him; he laid on the flat of his back.

About twelve o'clock on this night, the prisoner came into my room, fell on her knees, and said, " For God's sake, go over and pacify between me and my husband!" She said words had happened between them. I went over, leaving her in the room; on tapping at their room door, no answer was given: I opened it slowly, put my head in, and saw nobody there; a candle and two pots of beer stood on the table. I returned to my room, and told the prisoner I could see no one in her room. She said "He must he looking for me!" and said to my wife "For God's sake, go over, and see if my husband is there." My wife went, returned immediately, and told her the man was there stretched on his hands and knees by the fire, bleeding. I ran over and picked him up - he laid with his head towards the cupboard, but I cannot say whether it was on the ground, he was between a chair and the jam of the fire-place - there were some coals near him - I think the chair supported the body a little from falling - he drew his breath when I lifted him up, and blood came from the back part of his head. I called across to my wife "Mary, the man is murdered!" The prisoner and my wife came over. The prisoner took the deceased out of my hands, and told me for God's sake to fetch a doctor. I went to two, but could not get them. I returned and got the watchmen, who came - I believe the man was then dead: the prisoner was hanging over his body, crying and kissing him, and saying</p>
               <p>"Joseph! Joseph! my dear I have killed you!" I waited till the doctor came, and saw him pick up a large handled hair broom, three feet long - the handle was broken in two.</p>

            . I am conductor of the patrol. I heard a rattle spring, and went to No. 5, Lascelles-court with Harrington - several people were round the door, and the room was crowded. The prisoner was leaning on the deceased, crying out "I have killed my husband!" he laid on his back, with his clothes on, and his face all over blood - he appeared to be dead. I saw two wounds, there was a deal of blood on the left of his head, near the coal place. There was a wound at the back, and one on the side of his head - they were some distance apart. I asked the prisoner what she had killed her husband with? she said with a brush. I saw this long-handled broom laying on his right hand, (producing it,) it was broken as it is now, and the brush part of it loose - I did not examine it to see if there was any mark on it - the shovel and poker laid by the broom. I believe there was a little hair on the point of the poker, and on the corner of the shovel, but no blood, except on the handles of them. I sent for a medical man, and took her to the round-house.</p>

            . I am keeper of the round-house. The prisoner was brought in about twenty minutes before one o'clock. Before I said any thing to her, I went to the house, and found the man dead. I returned - she was then crying bitterly, and said "Mr. Furzman, how is he?" bursting into a flood of tears, (I knew them both before, they were decent people.) I said he was a little better; not liking to tell her he was dead. I then asked her how they came to quarrel? she said, "Oh, good God! Mr. Furzman, you know us well, and I will tell you:" she said they went down Drury-lane to buy some meat for supper; and I think she said she paid 1 s. 6 d. or 1 s. 9 d. for it; and, on the way home, he requested to have a pot of porter. She said, "We have one pot at home, which is quite sufficient:" but he insisted on having another - they had one - they went home, she cooked the supper, and as they sat at table, he began to be playful, which she did not like - and he said "D - n your eyes! you have got three halfpence of mine! give them to me." Words occurred, and he struck her a blow across the nose with his hand or fist, and made it bleed - that she instantly jumped up, and laid hold of the first thing she could, which was the hair broom, and struck him a violent blow, as he sat on the chair - he fell off the chair, and she instantly ran to her opposite neighbour, and begged Moore to go in, for she was sure she had done something wrong. He went over, returned and said he could not see him; and she said "For God's sake, run for the doctor!" - that is all she said. She appeared very sorry for what she had done, and told me every thing without hesitation. She appeared to have been in liquor, but knew what she was about. On Monday morning she begged me to tell her how he was.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170023"/>I said he was no more. She fell on her knees, clasped her hands together, and said, "Good God!

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Great Russell-street. On Tuesday the 8th February I was called in to view the deceased's body. I found two large wounds on the head; one of which communicated with an extensive fracture of the skull near the top of the head; the other was merely a wound of the scalp. I should think the wound on the top of the head was done by some obtuse instrument powerfully struck on the head. The broom head I think would have done it, it being angular as well as obtuse. There was a large portion of bone broken off and pressed on the brain. I have no doubt of his death happening from the bleeding, caused by that wound. The second wound had fractured the inner table of the skull. His skull-bone was exceedingly thin, and scarcely to be called a sound bone. The same blow on an ordinary skull would not produce such consequences. Some part of his skull was not much thicker than an egg shell.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating the particulars the case, in precisely the same manner as her account given to the witness Furzeman.</p>

The prisoner must have used much exertion to have stopped so short. I went up, and in answer to a question how he came to run over the man, he said he had used every exertion in his power to avoid it. The deceased was taken to the watchhouse, and the prisoner taken into custody. He did not attempt to go on. The deceased appeared in the act of crossing from the Minories to the watchhouse, which is opposite.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK - Q. This was a two horse coach? A. Yes; two Blackwall stages. It is not a time when many people cross the street. I saw a lad there, but did not hear him hail the coach.</p>

            . I am inspector of the watch. I was at the watchhouse door, and heard the rattling of stages. Two passed rapidly by the watchhouse. I saw the deceased fall before the coach nearest to the curb. The hind wheel went over him. I ran to the spot and found it was one of our watchmen, named John Coe. I had him taken to the watchhouse, and took the prisoner in charge. He stopped as soon as he possibly could. Mr. Wiskard, the surgeon, was sent for; he came directly. Coe was sent home in a coach, and died on the Monday following. He fell about five feet from the curb. Both stages were going at a rapid rate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. - Q. He pulled up directly? A. Yes. I did not see the horse galloping - they were going fast. It was certainly not done wilfully. The deceased was above seventy years old. The prisoner offered to take him home, and expressed his sorrow.</p>

            . I was coming up the Minories close behind the deceased - when I came to the top of the Minories I saw two coaches driving very fast, and the deceased crossing the road within a few yards of the curb, the pole of the prisoner's coach knocked him down, and ran over him. I ran across. The coach immediately stopped. I fetched an officer from the watchhouse, which is close by. Taylor took the prisoner. He said he understood he had driven over the man, and was sorry for it.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I saw the deceased at the watchhouse about 9 o'clock. His scalp was wounded, and he complained of being bruised about the body. I had him taken home, examined him, and found his ribs and his collar bone fractured. He died on the Monday following. I opened his body, the ribs were fractured, and some of them perforated his left lung. He died from that injury I have no doubt.</p>

I was disturbed by a noise; I set up in bed, looked at my watch, and it was a quarter past twelve. I supposed it to be the noise of a gate swinging, and did not get up. The prisoner Brown had visited a servant of mine, and knew perfectly well the ways of the house.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutrix. I saw the house all fastened up the night before the robbery. - I came down about half-past seven o'clock in the morning - it was hardly light then. I found the back door wide open. I went to the parlour, saw the door ajar, and saw a light shining through the door - I screamed out, and Brown came out of the parlour, and opened the door - I am sure he is the man; he came with a candle stuck in a bottle, and a carving knife in his hand - he said if I made any more noise he would murder me; I ran directly to the back door, and ran round over to a neighbour's cottage, and when I returned he had got out by the dust-hole. I examined the house, and found the kitchen window open - two panes of glass were broken; they could then open the sash and get in. I opened the parlour window, and missed two silver table spoons from the celeret - they belonged to Miss Susannah Walker, I believe. I found eggs and butter had been used by the persons who had been in the house. I missed a basket of linen which had come from the mangle; the basket itself was not moved. The property belonged to both Miss Walkers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you examine the things after they came from the mangle? A. No. Brown was very tipsy - he did not do me any mischief. It was just light enough for me to see him. They had been drinking liquor in the house.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 15th of January, about seven o'clock, I was in Ponders End field, three or four hundred yards from the prosecutrixs', and saw a man crossing the field; he seemed very much in liquor - I watched him; he got into the hedge - I went up to assist him; it was Brown; he crawled up the bank, and went right across - he had a bundle under his arm when he passed me. I left him there, and when I went to breakfast I heard of this robbery. A boy, named Withers, gave me a little work box, and the top of a wicker basket.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 15th of January, I apprehended the prisoners - I found Alligan near the Angel Inn at Edmonton, took him to Lower Edmonton, and found Brown, at the Jolly Farmers, public-house, quite tipsy. Alligan had been drinking; they were put into the same watch-house, but in the evening I separated them. On the Sunday afternoon I went with Wallis to a field near the Cock, and found a basket, containing several pieces of lump sugar, and a pair of white stockings - it was concealed in a ditch, two or three fields from the prosecutrixs' house. I have some table-cloths, a spoon, and other goods, which were brought to me - one lot by three boys, on the 18th, and the other by a man who is in Whitecross-street prison. A toast rack was brought to me by a boy named Soley.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Edmonton. - On the 14th of January, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoners near the door of the Three Tuns, public-house, and saw them again at twenty minutes past ten, going towards Ponders End - I had been watching them from six o'clock till then. I was present when they were examined before Mr. Mores; (looking at the examinations) - the signatures to these are Mr. Mores's writing; I saw the prisoners make their marks to the papers - they were read over to them by the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you there all the time they were under examination? A. I went out once or twice while they were in the office - what the Magistrate said to them while I was absent I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you there when it was read over to them? A. Yes: Alligan could not write, but Brown signed his name. The Magistrate asked what they had to say, and what they said was written down and read over (read.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner, J. Brown, being asked what he had to say in defence of the charge made against him by Jane Cooper, says, "I am guilty of the charge brought against me. I, in company with John Alligan was drinking at the Three Tuns, at Edmonton, about ten o'clock on Friday night, the 14th inst.; I left the house, and John Alligan followed me; we agreed as we went along to break into Mrs. Walker's house, at Ponder's End, which we did by forcing the outside shutter of the kitchen window, breaking the window and unfastening the catch. I then lighted the fire in the parlour to cook some eggs which John Alligan was obtaining from some part of the premises. By the time I had lighted the fire Alligan brought four eggs and boiled them, I eat one, and Alligan two - one was rotten; we also eat bread and butter taken out of the pantry. Alligan broke the lock of a cupboard in the hall and brought in several sorts of liquor and wine, which we both drank of freely, tasting several sorts. After we had eat and drank as much as we liked, I fell asleep in the parlour. About one or two o'clock I heard the table clock strike which was on the table. I was very tipsy. I don't recollect any circumstance, till I awoke and found myself in a ploughed field close to the house, and the dust hole of which there was a board broken down which made the hole that John Alligan and myself crept through when we first went to the premises in order to break into the house. The parcels now produced, viz. a basket, containing several lumps of sugar, and a pair of white cotton stockings, as also a large piece of sugar about 7 lbs. in a blue paper and string round it, I found by my side. When I awoke I got up and took with me the basket containing the lumps of sugar as also the large piece of sugar, and hid them in a ditch in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170025"/>in the adjoining field. I then went to the Jolly Farmers, in Church-street, Edmonton, where I was apprehended by the constable, Wilson.</p>

               <p>John Alligan being asked what he had to say in his defence, or whether the account given of him by John Brown was true, says, "I was with John Brown when we broke into Mrs. Walker's house. I partook of the eggs and the liquor, but don't recollect any thing else.</p>

He said to the landlord, "How do you do?" that is all I heard - he looked very wild. I saw the prisoner at the house - I did not hear him speak to Mr. Parry. Mr. Parry went away directly, and in four or five minutes I went out, and saw Mr. Parry, and the prisoner standing opposite to him - I heard the prisoner say "Stand up, like a man!" Parry was standing up like a statue, not in a fighting position - the prisoner instantly gave him a blow, which knocked him down, I said, "Why do you strike that man; who is incapable of resisting?" He said he had been very badly used by him. Mr. Parry did not get up again - he fell on his left side almost double, his head laid against the gutter, which is made of small stones, his head was on the stones. I gave notice to the landlord. I did not see the prisoner render him any assistance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you see the prisoner bring a piece of paper to the bar, and ask for change? A. No. There might be half a dozen persons about when I got outside the house. I never saw the deceased before - he was a tall, good-looking man, not very stout.</p>

            . I am a labourer. On the 5th of February I was near the Prince of Wales, public-house, coming from Collyer-street, and saw Mr. Parry, the prisoner, and another man, coming from the public-house, which lays backward. The prisoner said, "If you are a man, stand up and fight." A man behind said, "Don't strike him, let him have fair play." Mr. Parry stood with his back towards me - I could not see in what situation his hands were. The prisoner struck him about the nose, and he fell with his head against the stones. Parry appeared to be very much in liquor - I do not think the prisoner was quite sober, but he was not drunk. Parry rolled into the kennel against my feet, and never spoke afterwards. I said the man was dead. The prisoner said he was not dead, but drunk; that he had struck him, and broken a pipe in his mouth. I saw no broken pipe. I said I was sure the man's skull was fractured, and he should go for a doctor. The prisoner said it was of no use, for the doctor would not attend to him. I said he was a respectable man, and the doctor was bound to attend to him. I and some others took him up to the front of the public-house, but he was so heavy we were obliged to rest several times. The prisoner said he supposed his hat was knocked over the railing in front of the house, and fetched it for him - it all happened three or four yards from the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Mr. Parry was much in liquor? A. Yes. I had never seen him before. There is a step to the public-house - there is no pavement but small stones, and the gutter goes down aslant - I think a trifle would have knocked him down.</p>

            . I am servant at No. 25, Pleasant-row. I was passing the Prince of Wales, public house - the deceased was two or three yards from the door. The first I heard, was somebody saying "D - n your eyes, if you want any thing come on!" The person who spoke was nearer to the public-house than the deceased. I only saw the deceased and the man who said these words - he had no pipe in his mouth - I was close to him - Mr. Parry made no answer, nor did he raise his hand to strike the person - he seemed to be very much intoxicated, and the man appeared quite sober - he struck Mr. Parry a tremendous blow in the mouth, and then struck him a tremendous blow on his side, which knocked him down - he fell with the back of his head against the curb-stone - I walked away immediately, and next morning I heard he was dead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons besides you saw these blows? A. I saw nobody there. I did not wait to see him carried away - I had not seen either of them come out of the house.</p>
               <p>HARRIET OLIVER. I live next door to the Prince of Wales, public-house, in the kitchen. I was standing against my steps and saw the gentleman. I heard the prisoner say, "D - n you, will you insult me?" The gentleman made no answer to him. I went up my steps, and saw the prisoner go and tap two or three times at the tap-room window - he called some one by his Christian name to come out and assist him, but nobody came. He then went up to the gentleman, who stood off the curb-stone. I was at my own gate, which is about thirty yards from them. I cannot say whether the gentleman was intoxicated or not - he saw the prisoner coming, and put up his hand to prevent a blow from coming, and said "Don't hit me, for I won't fight;" or something of that sort. The prisoner struck him, and he fell back - I only saw one blow - I was frightened, and went in doors.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How could you see thirty yards off? A. I heard the words, and after the gentleman was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170026"/>knocked down I went close to him, and put my ear down to hear if he breathed, and the first witness came up. I did not see the prisoner when he first came out of the house - they might have been quarrelling before.</p>
               <p>MR. SYMES. I am a surgeon, and live in Judd-street. I have known Mr. John Humphries Parry for some years. I was called in, about half-past nine o'clock on the 5th of February, and found him on a bed at the Prince of Wales public-house - he had been dead some time. I afterwards examined his body, and have no doubt his death was caused by apoplexy, occasioned by a blow, and very likely by concussion. A blow which knocked him down, and knocked his head against the pavement, was very likely to produce that effect, and, supposing him to be intoxicated at the time, it is more likely.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If a drunken man fell, from reeling, without a blow, the same effect might be produced? A. It is possible. He was thirty-eight years old, and about five feet ten in height - he was not so strongly built as the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have witnesses who saw him strike me, and saw the pipe in my mouth.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer, and work for the prisoner. I went to this public-house to receive my wages - he usually pays his men there: I went there about three o'clock in the afternoon; I had not seen Mr. Parry in the house, but about a quarter to nine I heard a rapping at the window, went out, and saw my master and the gentleman standing together - another man was there, who had gone out before me; my master and Mr. Parry were both in a fighting attitude, and as soon as I stepped forward Mr. Parry made a hit at my master; the blow caught on his elbow; the prisoner then hit him; I could not see where; he staggered back, and fell, with his head against the curb stone - Mr. Bennett stepped forward, and lifted him up; two or three more gentlemen assisted, and got him to the door. I did not see the French gentleman there. They put him down at the door, for they would not let him in for some time; I went in and said, there was a man very ill - three or four persons came out and brought him in. My master went into the tap-room. He had had a pipe inside the house, but I did not see it outside.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where did your master live? A. In Exeter-street, Lisson-grove. We were working by this public-house. I saw my master next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on Monday and Tuesday about his work as usual? A. No; he was taken up on Tuesday afternoon; I had seen him at the Hope, public-house, at the bottom of the City-road, about a quarter of a mile from the Prince of Wales. I was at the Prince of Wales when the Inquest sat, but was not examined. I told a friend of the gentleman's what I had seen while the inquest were sitting. I saw Johnson there when it happened; he came up after I did: I was at the public-house door, about four yards from them. I did not hear Mr. Parry speak, nor did I hear master d - n him - he carried him to the door, and then went in: somebody said, "Take him to where he has been getting drunk."</p>

            . I am a sawyer, and was working where Bennett was. I was at this public-house. I saw the prisoner drinking and smoking there; he went out with his pipe, and in about a minute he pushed the door open, and hallooed for assistance; he said, Bill or Will - I went out, and directly I got to the door I saw him and the deceased, in a fighting attitude, seven or eight yards from the door; Bennett struck him - he reeled, and fell; I went to assist him up, and Bennett also went for the same purpose - he had no pipe then. Before he struck the blow he said the man had struck him. I do not think the blow would have hurt the man if he had not been in liquor. We sat him against the door, thinking he would come round, as he breathed - I thought he was only stunned. Bennett went into the house; I left at twelve o'clock - Bennett did not stay so long.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he stay long enough to hear that the man was dead? A. I believe he did. I was at the house when the Inquest sat, but was not called in. The beadle knew I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call out, "Don't hit the man?" A. No. I did not hear a word spoken, except that Bennett said,</p>

               <p>"This man has struck me," and then he struck him. - The prisoner had not paid his men; he had not got the money.</p>

            . I keep the Prince of Wales, public-house, and have done so for twelve months. The prisoner paid his men there; he wanted me to cash a bill on this night, which I refused. Mr. Parry had not been drinking at my house - he came to the bar door soon after eight o'clock; he was intoxicated. Bennett was drinking and smoking there. When I let Mr. Parry out Bennett followed him with his pipe in his mouth; he went for a necessary purpose: there is a place outside. When Mr. Parry was brought back we thought he was only stunned - I had no idea of his being dead.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long had Mr. Parry been in your house? A. About two minutes; he only came in and asked how my wife was; he appeared very much in liquor. He could not open the door, and said, "Cannot I get out:" I let him out. He said, "I don't want to mix with your tap-room company;" the prisoner replied that tap-room company was a good as him, and followed him out. I saw the sawyer go out in two or three minutes, and in about five minutes the body was brought in. I heard nothing about a pipe being broken. Bennett stopped there about half an hour after. I saw the prisoner at the Inquest on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. He was in custody then? A. I suppose he was; he did not desire that Williams or Lines should be examined.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did he come before the Coroner of his own will? A. A warrant was issued against him; his brother went to fetch him, but the officer went after him.</p>

I told him I had never done anything, and never saw him to my knowledge, He said, "You have touched my p-v-t-s," and he would follow me home if I did not give him some money, for there were two men behind who could swear the same. I was frightened, and did not know what to do. I was so frightened at being charged with such a thing, I said, "What must you have?" he said' "How much have you got?" I said would 5 s. do for him - he said No; I asked if 10 s. would do: he said, No, he must have 15 s., "For" said he "that is a trifle - I had 10 l. the other night, from a gentleman, for the same thing;" I gave him 15 s., and he ran away. On the 18th he came to my house with Adams - (I suppose he must have followed me home) - they had a pint of beer, my man waited upon them; they went out, and as Adams went out he left a note on the bar, saying,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Jones, there is a letter for you;" this is it (looking at it) - I saw Adams put it down there; he went out directly. Dovey was just before him, and must have heard what he said - they were going out close together. I read the letter -(read.)</p>
               <p>"SIR, - I write these few lines to you, to inform you that the money as you gave me on Wednesday night I bought some clothes with - and yesterday my landlord came to me for rent, after I had spent what you gave me. I shall be obliged to you if you will send me 2 l. 16 s. 6 d., to pay the rent I owe; and then I say and swear I never will send, nor come to you any more. This person that has brought this letter, is the person that saw you feel my privates that night, at Fairburn's, but if you send the money he will not mention it. If you cannot send that sum, send as much as you can to pay my rent, and I will never trouble you no more, so help my God."</p>
               <p>Mr. Jones, Welch Harp, St. Paul's.</p>
               <p>HUGH JONES (in continuation.) I went to the door on reading the letter, and saw both the prisoners lurking about outside the door - on my coming out I asked Dovey what he wanted here (Adams was walking about on the other side - I cannot say whether he heard;) Dovey said he must have some more money, for what I had given him was nothing - that he had 10 l. from a gentleman before, for the same thing. He said he must have what he mentioned in the letter; I said I had not got so much with me, neither would I do it; he said then he must have a sovereign, or else there was an officer a little way off, who would come and take me up directly - Adams was at that time perhaps ten yards off, walking about. I did not know what to do - I was frightened, and had not an opportunity of getting an officer, and I gave him a sovereign; Adams was still walking backwards and forwards, and passed us once or twice. When I gave Dovey the sovereign they went away together. On the 20th Dovey came into my house; I was out - I came in and found him there, and in the evening, after I lighted the glass, he went out, and called to me; I went out to him; he said he wanted some more money - I said I would have no more of his nonsense - he went away. I went to St. Paul's church-yard for an officer, but he was gone before I returned. I had not said I was going for an officer; I only said I would stand no more of his nonsense, and would give him no more. He came to my house next day - I went out privately for an officer, who took him in my house, and took him to Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long have you kept a public-house? A. I have been in that house five years all but three months. I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170028"/>been a publican seven years. I kept a house at Billingsgate, and before that I lived with Mr. Price, at a wholesale linen warehouse, in Old Change, for six years. I have been fifteen years in London, and was never in a court of justice, except being summoned here as a juryman. My house is not far from the Broadway. I never saw Dovey before in my life. He ran away towards St. Paul's when I gave him the 15 s. he ran a few yards. I did not look after him, but suppose he must have turned and followed me home. This was about eight o'clock. There were people about, and shops open, and I believe the watch was set.</p>
               <p>Q. And you said nothing to any one while this man was threatening you with this charge? A. I was not in a public place then, for I went down over the bridge to avoid his seeing me home. He spoke to me several times. The first time was as I was going down the Broadway. I went down St. Andrew's-hill, and Earl-street, and over the bridge. He followed close to me all the way repeating his demand; and there were two more men behind, as he said; a good many people were walking about; but I cannot say whether I saw the two men or not, as I did not know them. I went as far as the Obelisk and Union-street, Borough. I gave him the money in Union-street, and came home over Blackfriars-bridge. He ran away as soon as I gave him the money.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you gave him the money in the Broadway, and he ran towards St. Paul's? A. He ran towards St. Paul's from Union-street. He attacked me in the Broadway.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a crowd was there at Fairburn's? A. I saw a good many people there, but did not see Dovey there to my knowledge. I had got to the corner of Shoemaker-row, when he spoke to me - I did not know what to do at the time. I told my wife and the officer of it. I told my wife of it on the night of the 20th, when I went for the officer - I did not tell her before, for she was in trouble, having just buried our little boy. I went to Peter's-hill for the officer - he is a patrol. I never told any body of it before that. The letter, which Adams left on the bar, was wafered. Dovey said, at Guildhall, that Adams wrote it. There were several people in my taproom when I received the letter. I did not ask them to go out with me. I parted with my money through fear of their bringing an officer to take me up - if they charged me with this, I could not prove my innocence.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know they were to be there again on the second day? A. I did not know when he was coming; but he said he would come again, for that was not enough for him - There was no appointment for me to meet him.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Were you not in a state of agitation at the time? A. Yes: I told my wife of it two days after, we had lost our child more than a month before.</p>

            . I am chief clerk at Guildhall. The prisoners were brought before the Alderman on the 21st of January. I took down what passed - neither threat or promise was held out to them. (Reads.)</p>
               <p>Friday, 21st January, before Mr. Alderman Ansley. Dovey stated, that he lived at No. 2, New Pye-street, Westminster, and has worked for Deakin &amp; Co., of Ludgate-hill, ironmongers, seven months ago - is now out of work - has no employment at present. Adams has worked with him there. "A stranger told me, this person was addicted to putting his hands to person's p - v - ts. I never received a farthing from him but 15 s." (He was remanded till next day, 22d, when Adams appeared at the Justice-room, and was identified by Jones. He came forward, and gave this statement.) (Reads,) "I went into the Broadway, and met Jones with a basket - he is in the habit of going out with a basket, and touching people's p - v - ts. He has served me so. I was a light porter at Deakin &amp; Co.'s, seven or eight months ago, at the time Dovey was there. Dovey gave me 1 s. 6 d. out of the first money, and 5 s. out of the second. He said he would write Jones a note - I saw him write it - and he gave it to me to deliver. I was with him at Jones's, and I gave him the note. I knew he wanted to borrow money of him."</p>
               <p>MR. BERESFORD, (in continuation.) Dovey was present, and heard Adams's statement, and said nothing to it. I think something was said about Dovey having sent for him. Jones seemed very much agitated and alarmed. Read and Herdsfield were present. Read took Adams into custody, by the Alderman's direction.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many examinations had taken place before you saw Adams? A. Only one, which was the day before, he was in the Justice-room. Jones had described such a person, and said he should know him. He only talked of Dovey and another man, who, he said, he should know; and when he came into the room, next day, he said he did know him.</p>
               <p>Q. When Adams said Dovey wrote the letter, did not Adams say he could neither read nor write? A. No: I heard nothing of the sort. He did not deny any part of the statement. Dovey had an attorney at the second examination, who cautioned him, and he kept himself quiet.</p>

            . I am patrol of Castle Baynard Ward. On Thursday, the 20th of January, soon after five o'clock in the evening, Jones came to me. He seemed very much agitated, and did not know how to act. I went with him to his house, and Dovey was then gone. Next day, about twelve o'clock, Jones fetched me again. I went to his house, and apprehended Dovey. Jones came into the parlour, and gave him into my charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had you known Jones? A. Four or five years. He did not know where I lived. I left him my address on Thursday evening. He had fetched me from duty in St. Paul's Church-yard.</p>
               <p>DOVEY'S Defence. I am quite innocent. I could have had a character from Messrs. Eve and Deakin, where I left seven months ago, and since that have worked at the Surrey Theatre, but it being so disgraceful a charge I did not let my friends know of it. The prosecutor made me nearly tipsy when I met him by Fairburn's - he took me into a public-house, and gave me liquor, told me to say nothing to any one, and gave me 15 s. I gave Adams what money I owed him.</p>


               <p>ADAMS'S Defence. I was in distress. Dovey owed me the money which he gave me. I can neither read nor write, and do not know what was in the letter. He asked me to take it to Jones, and I did.</p>

On the 30th of September I lost a coat and a pelisse from my room, which is on the ground floor - I had brushed them a very few minutes before they were taken, which was about eight o'clock in the evening - the house is let out to lodgers, and the street door is sometimes open. The prisoner came in, and set down as a friend; we had a pint of beer, and he staid about a quarter of an hour: he got up from the table, and went towards the fire - he then returned, and took my coat and a pelisse from a nail in the room, and got out of the door before I could get to it. I and my wife met him again on the 12th of January - she took hold of his arm, but he got from her - and was stopped by some other person.</p>

I saw the prisoner come into our room; I went for a pot of porter by his desire, and before I returned he was gone - my husband cried out, "That man has robbed me:" he was not then out of sight; some persons followed him, but he got away - we met him again on the 12th of January, in Broad-street, St. Giles's; he was secured.

I overtook him before I lost sight of him, with the boots under his arm; there were a number of persons about, and I pushed him down the area of No. 5, Harley-street, and left him in the care of a servant while I got an officer.</p>

He was taken in five or ten minutes; he dropped two fowls at the top of the passage. I picked them up. He dropped two others, but not in my sight.

On the 22d of January I lost my till, and some money, from my shop - I cannot tell what money there was in it - I had seen it safe about half-past ten o'clock at night. My shop is generally open till about eleven. I was in the back parlour, and no one was in the shop. I was putting up my shutters, about eleven o'clock, when some persons passed my shop, and I heard that they had taken some thieves. I called my man to mind the shop while I went to Mr. Cooper's, at the corner of Hereford-street, and saw my till, and some copper, on the counter there. The prisoners were then in custody. I then went back to my shop, and missed the till and money.</p>

            . I live in Stafford-street, near Mr. Gillett's, and am a milk-man. I was passing Hereford-street on the 22d of January, and saw the two prisoners running towards me about the middle of the street. I heard one of them say to the other, "Let us go in here," meaning into the carcass of a house. I immediately hallooed over to them, "What have you got there?" and they ran off. I pursued them a short distance, and called to a watchman. He went out near them. They threw down the till, turned round and ran towards me again. I heard the money drop. They jumped down into a foundation, which is dug for some more houses. I immediately went after them, and in a few minutes a light was brought, and I took them both, concealed in two separate vaults. Robinson asked me to let him go, as he had neither father or mother. Smith asked me to let him wash his hands, which he did. I asked him why he did not apply for relief to the parish? he said it was no use.</p>

I asked him where he got them; he said from Mr. Chard's stack in the grove. Mr. Chard lives about a mile and a half from there. I asked where he was going to take them? He said to Braid-street. I then told him I should go and see where he took them; he took them to Conduit-place, near Bayswater, where I found a bricklayer setting a copper; he had used some bricks but different ones to those. I asked the bricklayer who he was at work for, and he told me quite a different name to what the prisoner had said. I asked him where the labourer was to go for the bricks; he said to the wharf, and that he had the money given him to buy them. I then went to Mr. Chard, who knew nothing about the business. I took the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a milkman, and live in George-street, Chelsea. I was coming from Turk's-row on the evening of the 1st of February, between six and seven o'clock, and saw Solder and Hornsby, who is not in custody, standing by Mr. Ridge's shop - one stood on one side of the shop, and the other on the other. Solder moved one chest from the rails to the next house. I then gave information to Maybank, the officer, who came down with me, and we saw Hornsby running, with a tea chest under his arm. I said,</p>
               <p>"That is one of them," we followed him to Reynolds's house, in Turk's-row - there is a board over the door, and "Elizabeth Reynolds, dealer in marine stores," written on it - she is, I believe, the prisoner's mother, but she is now ill in bed. We found two tea chests in the back room, and the one which was just carried in in the front shop - there were several other persons in the shop, but Reynolds appeared to be managing the business. The officer left me in charge of Solder, who was there, and left Hornsby in charge of a green grocer, but he let him go again.</p>

I went in for some shoes I was to mend. I had seen Hornsby before, the prisoner Reynolds was in the kitchen with Hornsby, but I did not hear what they said to each other. I saw the tea chest carried into the back room - Reynolds's brother was not there at that time. I saw Solder in the shop, but I did not see anything with him. I saw three tea chests in the house.

I found the three tea chests<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170032"/>in the house - it is a marine at the shop, and the name of " Elizabeth Reynolds" is over the door - she has been confined for some months. Reynolds's brother was not in the shop when I went in, but he came down stairs some time afterwards - I took him into custody, and left Hornsby in custody of a man, but he got away. I told the man to shut the door while I searched the house. The prisoner Reynolds was not taken into custody that night, became I did not know which of them had the charge of the business - but he was taken four or five days afterwards - and committed - there were several other persons in the shop, who were known thieves - I knew them to be persons of bad character, but there was no charge against them then. I know Solder to be a bad character.</p>

               <p>SOLDER's Defence. I was coming down the street when Hornsby met me, and said he was going to that shop to buy a pair of second-hand stockings. While we were there Maybank came and said, "Now I have got you all,"</p>
               <p>REYNOLDS's Defence. Two men came in and asked would I buy three tea chests - they said they had been bought to make a box of, but they were too slight. I asked my mother if I should buy them - she said Yes, if they had no marks on them. I told them I would - they then went to fetch them. I went out, and when I came back two of the tea chests were left in the shop, an another was brought in immediately - the officer then came in and took them.</p>

I saw her again the next night at the watch-house - I said to her, "You are the person who gave me the two shawls to pledge." She said, she had been but a short time out of the House of correction, and I believe she is now in prison.</p>

There was a great crowd; and Mr. Hart, who was with me, desired me to be cautions of my pockets. I put my hand to my pocket to pay, and found it turned inside out. I told Mr. Hart of it, who seized the prisoner, and said he was the man. He was close to me - he was taken to the watch-house. I turned round - I found the 10 s. 6 d. and the knife and key lying at my feet - I do not know how they came there.</p>

            . I am a teacher of music, and live in Old Bond-street. I went to the theatre with Mr. Coxhead. I found a hand moving all about me. I looked round, and saw the prisoner next to me on the left hand, and Mr. Coxhead directly before him. I said, "James, take care of your pocket - I do not like the appearance of this little man - he has put his knuckles into my side." Mr. Coxhead soon after went to pay, and said he had lost his money. I immediately collared the prisoner, and seized his right hand; but the mob still pressing on, I let go his hand, but still held him till the officer came - in the mean time, the money fell at my feet. There was no other person between the wall and myself, on the left hand, but the prisoner. On my right hand was an elderly gentleman, and before him two ladies. When I seized him, he said, "I am a perfect gentleman - you are mistaken in the person - I will give you my card - I am known to the officers."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. Were there not many persons about you? A. Yes; there were. He did not conduct himself with any impropriety.</p>

            . I am an officer of Covent-Garden theatre. I was standing about four yards from the place where the money is taken. I heard Mr. Hart call for an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170033"/>officer. I advanced, and got to his assistance. He said, "This is the man who has picked Mr. Coxhead's pocket." I took hold of his hand, and felt a knife and some silver in it. I then took him to the Grapes public-house, and searched him. He told me he had got one sovereign and eight shillings in silver, which I found to be the truth - he had no cards about him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In going into the theatre, about half-past six, there was a great crowd - that is all I know about the business.</p>

            . I am superintendant of the labourers in the Dock. The prisoner has worked there since June, 1821. On the 24th of January, he was employed in delivering cotton from the ship Cambridge. She was loaded with pepper, cotton, gum, and other things - the pepper, on board the ship, was Bombay black pepper; and that found on him appeared to me to be the same. There were 16 or 1700 bags of pepper in that vessel.</p>

She then came and put her hands round my waist, and picked my pocket of the money - I felt and missed the money; I took hold of her, and tried to catch her hand to get it, but she put it into her mouth. I put my hand to her mouth to try to get my money; she caught hold of my finger; she then threw herself down on the flags, and called out Murder! Two watchmen came up and took 13 s. out of her hand.

She had 13 s. in her hand. I saw no marks of violence upon her. The were both taken to the watch-house. I went before the Magistrate the next day; she did not then make any complaint of being ill used. As we were going to the watch-house, she said to me, "You fool, put 5 s. or 6 s. in your pocket." I said, that would not do.</p>

I spoke rather thick, and he said what is the matter? I said, I had money in my mouth - he stood considering a few minutes, and then put his hand to my mouth to try to get it, and as I would not let him have it he struck me in the left eye.</p>

I told my father he was the boy; but I did not then know his name. I saw him again on the day afterwards; I went home and told my father, but he was at work, and could not go; I told my father again the next day, and he went and took him.</p>

Next day he came to me again, and said the boy was in Strutton-ground; I went, saw the prisoner, and took him. I told him if he would give me the hat he might go about his business; he cried, but denied all knowledge about it.</p>

About the 11th of December I took the prisoner to help me in the stable - I kept him till the 1st of January; I had been ill, and my master told me to get some person to help me. When I got better I told him I should not want him any more, but he still slept with me. On the 1st of January he awoke me by unlocking the door; I asked where he was going; he said to Mr. Simpson's. I got out of bed to see what time it was, and my watch was gone from the chimney-piece, where I had hung it the night before - I went down stairs, but could not see him: I went back and put my clothes on, and gave information at the office - he was taken that afternoon. After I had been to the Police Office I returned, and missed a coat, two waistcoats, a pair of spurs, and the other articles stated in the indictment.</p>

            . I live in Tavistock-square. I was going to the prosecutor's house, on the 17th of January, between one and two o'clock, and I saw Munt take a pair of boots off the nail at the door - he put them under his coat, and walked away with them - he gave them to Edmunds when he got round the corner. Edmunds wrapped them up in a handkerchief, and I suppose was going to take them away. I took hold of Munt, and stopped Edmunds.</p>

I followed them nearly half a mile - they turned into Bagnigge Wells, and I lost sight of them; but I saw them again, and knew them to be the same. Almond, who was with me, pursued them, and brought Evans back in a few minutes.</p>

On the evening of the 18th of January Shea came to my shop with another person, and asked for a pair of trowsers - I shewed them several pairs, which they did not like. I took down several better pairs - he said, "I think these will do - where can I try them on?" I said "Behind the counter." He went and put them on over his own, and then he came back and said "These will not do - have you not got a new pair?" He said he would give 24 s. I shewed him a new pair, which he went behind the counter and tried on. He then asked me to pull down his old trowsers: after I had done so, he came back again and said "They won't do - they are too long." I said it was a good fault; he then said, "They have got a broad flap." I said, "Your waistcoat will cover that." He said, "No; they won't do." They then said they would call again to-morrow. He went behind the counter and pulled them off, while his friend walked out of the shop. While Shea was pulling off the trowsers, two officers brought back the other man, and said to Shea "Give us your hand, Sir." He did so - and they put the handcuffs on him. I called my wife and said, "I suppose these men have stolen something." She said, "They have robbed you!" I then missed a child's dress, which the officer showed me, it had been on the shelves close to the door before they came into the shop. I described my shop mark which would be on it if it was mine - they found the mark I described. I then told the officer to take off Shea's hat - they took it off, and found a black waistcoat of mine in it, which had my shop mark on it. I know nothing of Jones.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not some person go out, and Shea said they had taken his hat? A. Yes: I did not see the prisoner Jones till he was brought in by the officer; I am certain he was not the one who went out of the shop. Shea complained that some one had taken his hat, and it was in the hat which the other had left him the waistcoat was found. I did not see Shea take off his hat while he was in the shop, but when I stooped down to pull down his trowsers he had it on. I might have been stooping down about a minute or two - he was at that time close to the shelf where the waistcoat was.</p>

            . I was in Ratcliff-highway on the evening of the 18th of January - I saw the two prisoners in company with another person; Shea and the other, who is not here, went into a tailor's shop, and then into Mr. Harris's; Jones stood on the other side of the way; I passed by several times, and saw Shea trying some clothes on - at first Jones had nothing in his hand, but when I returned he had a bundle. I then took him over to Harris's shop, and asked if they were his clothes; he said they were. I handcuffed the prisoners, and took them into custody; they denied knowing any thing of each other. The third man got away while we were crossing to the shop; he did not seem to have any thing in his hand. When Shields, my brother officer, went into the shop, and took the hat off Shea's head, he said "This is not my hat." There was some mud on the child's dress - it appeared to have been thrown over the hatch-door.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was with Fogg, and saw the three persons together - I saw Shea and the other in the shop, and Jones standing on the other side of the way - Fogg took hold of Jones; I went into the shop, and took Shea; I found in the hat on his head a black waistcoat. There had been another young man in the shop, who ran away. Jones was not in the shop to my knowledge.</p>

I sat in the back parlour about half-past six o'clock on the 1st of February. I heard the lock of the door slip back, the door opened, and I saw the prisoner enter, lean over the chair, and take them. He ran out - I called Stop thief! - ran after him, and about twenty yards from the door, when I was close behind him, I saw him drop them - he was taken directly, but not in my sight. A man picked them up, and gave them to me - one belongs to Thomas Sambrook, one to George Robinson, and the other to Charles Vivash. There were three lamps in the shop, I saw him plainly.</p>

On the the 24th of January, at half-past seven o'clock, I was in the shop; it was quite dark; my goods were exposed for sale in the window. A young man was at work at the window with me. I heard a noise as if somebody had knocked against the window as they passed, but did not break it, but immediately afterward the window was burst through. I saw a large glass in the center crashed; it is twice as large as the others. Supposing something was gone I immediately ran round to the door, and could not get it open, it was tied. I forced it open and found this handkerchief (producing it) tied to the handle and the rail. I was not many seconds getting it open. My house is at the corner of a court leading into Hart-street. I was directed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170039"/>down the court; saw somebody running; pursued him up Bird-in-hand court and along Hart-street, but lost sight of him at the corner of James-street. I returned to the shop, a mob had collected round the window; the pane was broken quite out. I looked at the window outside, and found several seals on the window and the mob picked up about twenty off the pavement, and brought them in. I examined to see what was gone, and missed more than five gold seals, six gold rings, a gold key, and a gold pin. I have not recoverd them. I am sure I saw them in the window before. The witness, Blackman came into the shop with others, and gave me information. The light falls only on the bottom of the window; a person of the prisoner's height could not be seen in the face so as to know him again, unless he was stooping down. I did not see him.</p>

            . I am fifteen years old. On Monday the 24th of January, about half-past seven o'clock, I was in Long-acre, by Mr. Crouch's shop. I was going after a situation to Newport Market. I saw the prisoner and his companion looking about the prosecutor's window. I went on a little way, and crossed over by Long-acre chapel, and saw the prisoner's companion tying the prosecutor's door with a handkerchief; the prisoner stood close by the window at the time, and I saw him shove his hand through the pane of glass - break it, and snatch at the seals; and I think he took some out, but I was too far off to be sure of that; they both ran up Bird-in-hand-court. I immediately called Stop thief, and followed them. I lost sight of them at the corner of Hart-street. I ran back to Crouch's and described the prisoner to him. I was sent to the officer in Phoenix-alley and described him; he is not here. On the Friday after the robbery, I was sent for by Mr. Crouch and taken to Bow-street; the prisoner was in custody. I saw him taken out of Covent Garden watch-house, and said directly that he was the man; nobody was with him. I am perfectly sure of him. I have not a doubt.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not come into a public-house with the officer where I was sitting, and say you did not know me? A. I went to a public-house with the officer, but he had another dress on; if it was him he had a Scotch cap on. I said I did not think it was him. I did not see his dress then except his cap; this was before the Friday, but when I saw him in Covent Garden watch-house, I was sure of him, as I saw his dress then. I think the person I saw in the public-house was not him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You said at the office you were sixteen years old? A. No; I said I was fifteen; the Magistrate did not object to swear me.</p>
               <p>MR. CROUCH. Blackman had described the prisoner's person and dress to me. When the prisoner was taken, his left hand was cut at the knuckles. When Blackman saw him he immediately recollected him, and his dress corresponded with the description he had given. He said at the office that he was fifteen or sixteen years old, I do not know which.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at the play at the time with two young men, who will be here at two o'clock.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BLACKMAN re-examined. There was a good light in the street, I do not think it was gas. I could see his face. I saw him on the same side of the way, and then crossed over. I was about a quarter of an hour observing him.</p>

On the 19th of January, about seven o'clock in the morning, when I opened the shop window, I missed a liquor frame, worth 30 s., and two decanters, worth 1 l. I know nothing of the prisoners. I missed several more things; they must have been taken by the inside sash being drawn aside - I saw them safe at four o'clock the day before. I went round to the pawnbrokers, and on returning, about twelve o'clock, I found the officer in my shop, with them. I had cut one of the liquor bottles myself. I know them all by the workmanship, and have others to match them. I have had the frame eight or nine years. I made it for a gentleman who is gone to Yorkshire.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Would they sell for more than 1 l.? A. Yes. The frame is plated with silver; it ought to fetch me the interest of my money. I have two quart and four pint decanters of the same pattern. I was out after eight o'clock in the evening.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Harrison, pawnbroker, Tottenham-court-road. On the 19th of January the prisoners came to my shop, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning. Brodie produced a pair of decanters to pawn for 12 s. I turned round to put them on our back counter, and while my back was turned, one of them produced the liquor-frame and three bottles, upon which Brodie asked 14 s. I asked Brodie her name, but the other prisoner answered and said her (Brodie's) name was Clarke. I asked Brodie where she lived? Clarke answered at No. 10, Crown-street, Soho. I asked Brodie whose the property was? Clarke said they were things she had had by her a long time, and was going to sell them off. Having seen the prosecutor about half an hour before, I got an officer and gave them in charge.</p>

            . I am a constable, and took the prisoners into custody at Harrison's shop. I went in rather quick - Brodie told me not to be in a hurry, for they would go quietly. As we went to the office, one of them asked if I knew who stole the things? I said No. She then said that a tall man, in a blue coat, with red hair and whiskers, met her in Crown-street, and asked her to pawn them. I think it was Brodie.</p>

My wife sent him to the stable. I was there. He asked me the particulars about the mare, and the price of it, with bridle and saddle. I asked 25 guineas for the whole. He saw the mare in the stable and out in the yard; he said he wanted it for an elderly gentleman - that he had not time then to try the pace of the mare, but would call next day, and, with my permission, would ride it; but he knew his friend would not give above 20 guineas. He did not mention his friend's name or address. He called on Friday the 17th, about twelve o'clock but I did not see him. He came again about three, when the boy fetched me to the stable to him. He asked if the mare was sold - I said No. He asked if she was quiet - I said Yes. He said, if I knew of any imperfection in it I must mention it; for it would be useless for him to show it to his uncle (as he then called his friend) if it was imperfect; and said, with my permission, he would ride it a few paces, and should then be able to judge whether it would suit his uncle or not; if it was not calculated to suit his uncle, he would return in a few minutes; but if it was he would ride it and show it to his uncle. I asked his address, he said No. 36, Davis-street, Berkley-square, and mentioned a name which I cannot recollect; he said, he and his uncle both lived there. I asked, if he said Davis or David-street. He said, Davis-street, Berkley-square; and said, "You know the neighbourhood of Davis-street, I presume?" I said, Yes, perfectly well; for I married my wife from there. He asked, what part of the street. I said, my father-in-law lived at No. 8, Davis-street, at the corner of a yard, and was a lock-smith and bell-hanger. He said, he knew the shop perfectly well, but did not personally know my father-in-law. The saddle and bridle were on the mare; he got on her, and rode away; but, before that, said, if the mare was likely to suit his uncle, he would take it to him, and I should have an answer; about half-past six o'clock that evening, he would send his servant to order me to come to his uncle's for the money for the mare, saddle, and bridle. He then rode away. I waited till rather later than half-past six o'clock - he did not come then or at any other time, nor did his uncle or any body else. No bargain was made for the mare; he said, he knew his uncle would not give more than 20 guineas; and, if his uncle did not approve of it, he would send it back; but, if he liked it, he would send to me to come for the money. I enquired the same evening at No. 36, Davis-street, Berkley-square, and was informed, no person of his description lived there. Mr. Hopkins, a coachmaker, lived there. I could not hear of any old gentleman living there, or any person answering the prisoner's description. I went to the office next morning, and had hand-bills printed, but have never found the mare, bridle, or saddle. I met the prisoner in Hyde-park on the 17th of January, and had him secured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. If the person who took the mare had returned the money, you would be satisfied? A. Certainly. I had not sold it. If the money had been sent back, I should have thought the bargain concluded, but not till then. If it was approved of by his uncle, the money was to be returned. If the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170041"/>mare or money had been sent at half-past six o'clock, I should have been satisfied. I let him have it to shew to his uncle. I expected either the mare or the money back. I bought it at the Bazaar. I never said it had come from my uncle, in Gloucestershire, who had sprained his uncle. I bought her on the 11th, but she would not go in harness, and I had no use for her. He did not offer to leave the money, or I should have been glad to receive it. I have not sent to him in prison for the money. I know Mr. Manley - I desired him to go and ask the prisoner where the mare was gone as I thought he was made the tool of others to get it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that Manley said, if 20 guineas could be produced, you did not care? A. I understood Manley to say, that the prisoner would produce 20 guineas, if I should be satisfied: but I never sent him to say a word about money. Nothing was said about depositing the money, when he was at the stables. We were a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes bargaining about it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you see him again? A. On the 17th of January, in Hyde-park, with another man - he was about 150 yards off, walking towards me. He turned round, and ran away from me very fast: he left his companion. I have no doubt but he saw me. I passed his companion, and followed him. He ran out into Park-lane, and was overtaken by a groom. I came up to him in Pitt's-head-mews, collared him, and said, "You villain, I have got you at last." He said, yes; I had got him. Some person in the crowd asked what he had done. I said, he had stolen my mare. He said, I could only make a debt of it, for he had bought it. I gave him in charge. The Magistrate asked where he lived. He would not give his address.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. When he rode away with the mare, did you not expect the money to be sent? A. I expected the mare or money back at half-past eight o'clock. He had not rode on it till he rode it away. My boy has left my service now. The Magistrate said, I need not bring him. The horse was bought for my own use: nobody else had a share in it.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 17th of January, I saw a crowd in Pitt's-head-mews, and found the prosecutor holding the prisoner; he charged him with stealing his mare.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor's servant was in the stable at the two interviews, and heard me offer to leave 25 guineas, as security for the mare. I declare, I never mentioned my uncle. He said, it came from his uncle, in Gloucestershire, who had sprained his anckle, and could not ride again. I took it away by his consent. He asked, if I was going to take it into the country. I said, no: I was going to a friend, in Davis-street, Berkley-square, and was going to Mr. Grinwood's, whom I once lodged with. I have been abroad six years, and have no friends in London.</p>

Upon missing them, I went to the officer, who took him over at the public-house opposite. He was searched, but nothing found on him. While we were taking him, the pot-boy at the public-house said, he had bought a handkerchief of him, and produced it to my father-in-law: my sister afterwards claimed it.

            . I am an officer. On the 2d of February, about 20 minutes to eleven o'clock, I was applied to by the prosecutor, who said, he had lost seven sovereigns out of his box. I accompanied him to the Portland Arms public-house, Portland-town. The prisoner was there asleep, in company with two more men. I tapped him on the shoulder, and his companion said, "Bill, here is your master wants you." I said, "I want to speak to you, my good lad." He was unwilling to come. I sat down by him, and said, I had a charge of felony against him; he said, he would not go, and resisted. I handcuffed him: he struck me a violent blow. I took him over to Dodsworth, and Mr. Dodsworth came over with a handkerchief, which he gave me. Eliza Brown searched her box, and said, she had lost one: she described it before she saw it. I think he was intoxicated.</p>

He came to me in prison, and said, he had strong suspicions of another person. I can prove, I had liberty to go to Eliza's room whenever I pleased, whether she was in bed or not. She lent me a handkerchief, but this is my own.</p>
               <p>PROSECUTOR. I did not then know the house had been left, but find it had. I did not suspect any other person. I told him. I did not wish to prosecute; he said, the way I could get off was, by saying I had strong suspicion of other people.</p>

On the morning of the 2d of February, I was in the cellar, and heard footsteps in the shop - I went up, and missed a roll of floor cloth, which stood seven yards from the door, packed up in a mat. I ran out one way, and the man another - I found the prisoner in about five minutes, in Catherine Wheel-alley, nearly two hundred yards off, with it on his shoulder. - he was alone, knocking at a door there: he saw me, threw it down, and ran towards Petticoat-lane - I pursued, and took him without losing sight of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you see a man outside the door when you came out? A. Yes; and he was going to send me the wrong way, but a milk-woman directed me down the alley.

I said "Perhaps you have given it to somebody?" He said he had not. I took him back, and found it in the gutter, close to where I felt the tug. There was nobody near me but him.</p>

I looked at him and said, "You know she does not live here, you are a thief," and at that moment I saw the spoons in his hand - he struck me and ran down stairs. I hallooed out, and in a short time I heard he was taken. I went into the shop and saw him, and said, "You should not have struck me," he said he did not strike me. I heard him drop one spoon on the stairs. I am sure he is the man - the light of the kitchen fire shone in his face.</p>

Reid asked if my name was Robson, and if I had a brother in the East Indies - I said yes, and expected him home every day - he said he had brought a quantity of India crape and silk handkerchiefs for me, and my mother, and sister, that they were at his lodgings, and he got them safe ashore. I asked them to sit down - the bell rang - I had to attend dinner, and left them in the kitchen - I came down, they said they wished to see my mother and sister - I gave them her direction, and they gave me a direction where to come for what they had brought me, they said they were going into the city and would call on me another time - my shoes hung over where they sat - they came again in the evening, and said they had called to state all the particulars about my brother, as they did not wish to say so much before the young man who was there in the afternoon - they said about half an hour, and about ten minutes after they were gone. I missed my shoes and tea-spoon - before they went Mr. Skipper, (who lives in the house) called for his tea, and I left them in the kitchen while I took it up - Reid introduced Ivery as his brother - they said they wanted to go to the theatre - they went out - I missed the tea-spoon and shoes soon after; the tea-spoon belonged to Mr. Skipper, and was taken from the drawer.</p>

I went round the Dock in company with Jury, a fireman, between eight and nine o'clock. I crossed the spirit quay, and saw the prisoner standing by a cask of brandy, with his small clothes unbuttoned - it was dark, but I had a light. I went up to him, and smelt a strong smell of brandy. I observed that the ground where he stood was very wet. I said "Mitchell, what are you about?" I afterwards saw a common glass bottle, stopped with a piece of hemp, laying by the cask - I took it up, and found it full of brandy. I saw the neck of another bottle sticking out of the inside pocket of his great coat. I took that out, and searched his under coat pocket, and found a brass tube, a gimblet, and a piece of wood, which would serve to stop up a hole made by a gimblet. I asked him how he came to have these things? He said he had had them seven or eight months about him, but had never used them in his life. He afterwards said he had hung his great coat up in the watch-box, and some person had put them into his pocket, and given me information - but I found them in the pocket of his under coat: he said he knew nothing of the bottle on the ground, but of the bottle in his pocket, he said some sailor had given him some liquor in it to drink. While I was searching his under coat I saw him throw this bag from him, with a bladder in it, which is surrounded by a wire, which would compress the bladder, so as to make it lay flat - there was about a gill of brandy in it - there was no stopper in the bladder, it was quite wet. The bottle in his pocket had got a little wine in it. I then gave him into the custody of a watchman and the fireman, while I put the things away. I afterwards examined the cask in his, and M'Donald's presence, and a few inches from the bung hole, I found a hole bored,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170047"/>exactly of the size of the gimblet. We stopped it up, and he was taken to the Office. I tasted the brandy in the bottle, in the bladder, and in the cask, the next morning, and the appeared to me to be the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROBERTS. Q. Might not some empty casks contain a little brandy in them, and if so, might not the ground be wet? A. It might be so.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not common for watchmen to have a little brandy about them to keep out the cold? A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. What was the wet on the ground? A. It was brandy. The cask seemed to be perfectly sound, and the wet was at a distance from it: if it had leaked it would have been more under the cask - the wet was just at the place to which liquor would have spirted from the cask through a spill-hole.</p>

            . I am a fireman, in the employ of the London Docks. On the night of the 20th of January, about twenty minutes past eight o'clock, I was on duty, and went round to see that all fires and lights were out. I went with Slater across the spirit quay. I saw the prisoner standing near the head of the cask, upright, and with his face to wards it. I went within about three yards of the cask, and saw some wet, and smelt a strong smell of brandy. The officer said, "Mitchell, what have you been about?" He said, "Nothing." I saw a bottle under the bulge of the cask, which the officer took up, it was stopped with hemp, and was full of brandy. I tasted it some time afterwards. The officer searched him in my presence, and took a bottle from his great coat pocket, and in his body coat pocket he found a brass tube, a gimblet, and a piece of wood, in the form of a spill. Slater then left him in the custody of myself and a watchman. In about half an hour he came back with M'Donald - I saw them examine the cask, and saw a hole in it, a few inches from the bung - it was just such a hole as this gimblet would have made - it was open then. Before Slater went away, I saw him pick up a bag, with a bladder, which had a little brandy in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you came up, was the cask running? A. No. There were no empty casks on the quay that I know of. The bottle was not out of my sight till I tasted it.</p>

I had the charge of some brandy in London Docks, on the 20th of January, from seven o'clock in the morning till five in the evening: I then gave it up to the prisoner. There were fifteen or sixteen casks lying on the brandy-quay, on the south side: they were all safe when I left them, and no appearance of say wet on the ground.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had fifteen or sixteen casks in charge. They were racking off some casks, and had left a racking-off cask there. I took and rolled it out of the way, which made wet on the ground. Slater came up, and asked me what I was doing: I said, my duty. I had been moving a racking-off cask, and had made a wet. He then took a bottle out of my pocket, which had a little wine in it. He took me to the guard-house. In the morning, he took me to the Magistrate; and there he said, the cask had been guaged and re-guaged, and nothing was found missing. I have a wife and seven children.</p>

            . I am employed particularly at the spirit-quay. There had been no brandy racked off on the 20th of January. The casks, of which the prisoner had charge, had not been racked; nor had there been any racking cask for several days there. When there has been any racking, we empty them completely. If there had been any spilled, it would have been dry in an hour or two.</p>

I repeatedly asked, if he had received her money, he said, she would settle it, from time to time; but he never accounted to me for the money he received from her. He came into my service in April: he was always to pay when he received it. Walker came to my house one day, and the prisoner went away immediately, without giving me notice. He was apprehended on the Thursday following.</p>

            . I live in Cross-lane, Long-acre. I have beer from Langston. The prisoner generally brought the beer to my house. I do not owe Mr. Langston any money: I always paid it regularly to the prisoner once a week. The last time I paid him was at the end of January. There never was more than 4 s. a week due. My general way of paying it was a sixpence, a shilling, and a half-a-crown, to make the parcel as small as possible, which I generally wrapped up in paper. I think the last time I paid him was in that way.</p>

I was afraid of telling my master; and, on the Monday following, I meant to ask him for my wages, to replace the money which I had lost.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 5th of February. I missed a bag from a desk, which had been locked. I had seen it two or three days before; it contained a sovereign, five shillings, and twelve sixpences. I made no enquiries about it, but discharged him on Saturday evening, and had a man waiting at the gate to apprehend him; he brought him back to the counting-house. I desired him to empty his pockets: he then brought out a few shillings; I asked him to let me see if I could find the money; I found the bag in his left-hand pocket, with the sovereign in it: it is a farmer's sample bag, with a P marked on it. I have no doubt of it being mine. I then said, "My lad, this is not all." He then pulled from his pocket seven shillings, twelve sixpences, and two half-crowns; the two half-crowns and two shillings my brother had paid him as his wages.</p>

The lead was stolen from a shed adjoining the house - I locked up the premises between four and five o'clock on the evening of the 20th of December - it was all safe then. A little before six o'clock that evening I heard a noise on the tiles - I went out backwards, and saw two persons on the top of the gutter of the shed, which is covered with lead; I went into the shed; they were still outside, and as I went in a piece of lead fell nearly on me - one of them then came down, and made towards the gate of the yard. I went into the street, and just as I got to the gate I met the prisoner going out: he dropped the lead and his hat: I took him into custody. The lead he had with him weighed about 28 lbs.; it was the same piece as had nearly fallen on me. I put him into William Smith's hands while I fastened the gate - we then went to Hatton-garden. When I came back the gate was opened again, and we suppose the other had escaped. I had seen him some time before, lurking about the premises.</p>

The prisoner asked me to let him go and get his hat - I took him to a constable, then went back, and found the lead and the bat close by the gate. I went and found a knife on the top of the building; it appeared to have been cutting lead. The lead appeared as if fresh cut. Next morning I went with the officer to compare it with that on the roof; it appeared exactly to correspond. I took a piece off the top of the building, and carried it to the office.</p>

The premises were perfectly safe at eleven o'clock at night. The men came to work next morning at day-light. I heard, about eight o'clock, that the glasses were gone. There was no violence used to the premises; I suppose the lock must have been picked. Some of the glasses were taken from carriages, and the glass-strings cut off; some were without frames. The prisoner was a perfect stranger to me. I saw them again next morning at the watch-house, where he was in custody - some of them were broken. I knew them to be mine - we could not replace them for 50 l. About a half of them were taken from carriages.</p>

            . I am a wire-weaver, and live in Dog-row, Bethnal Green. On Saturday morning, the 15th of January, between five and six o'clock, I met the prisoner and two other men, with an ass and some hampers; as they went on a little way, something fell from the hampers, and made a crash; a decent young man took it up, and laid it on the hampers. They went on towards Whitechapel Church. Two of the men seemed very genteelly dressed, and the other more shabby. The watchman came up to them near Whitechapel Church, and took hold of the ass; - two of them ran down Osborne-street, and the prisoner turned back down the road the same way as he had come. I minded the ass, while the watchman followed, and brought him back within two minutes. I am quite sure he is the man who was with the others, and turned back down the road. He was taken to the watch-house; I went with him, and saw twenty-one whole glasses in the hampers, and some broken pieces. He said he had been out late spending the evening, and had taken a walk: that is all I heard him say. The three men were all in company; sometimes one of them went to drive the ass, and sometimes another. The prisoner was well dressed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where were you going? A. To my work. I was on the other side of the way: it was dark, but the road is lighted with gas; I was going the same way as them; - their backs were towards me till I came abreast of them. When I took hold of the ass, I lost sight of them. The prisoner said he had been shut out of his lodgings, and had taken a walk; - he had nothing to drive the ass with, - one of them had a stick. I know the prisoner again by his clothes - he had a black coat on.</p>

            . I am a watchman. My beat is by Whitechapel Church, down the road-side. I saw three men driving an ass out of Great Garden Street towards Whitechapel Church, about half-past five o'clock; they seemed all in company. I went abreast of them as far as the church, and noticed one man who had more command over the ass than the others; he had a light coat on; the other two seemed to be better dressed. I stepped off the pavement to stop the ass, and as soon as I got into the road, one of the better dressed men made a cough, and at that instant one of them ran down Osborne Street with the man who was with the ass; the prisoner ran down Whitechapel Road. I cannot say which coughed. The prisoner ran twenty or thirty yards, and then made a stop, and walked back to meet me. I had not said any thing to either of them. I took hold of him; he said, "Watchman, what do you want with me? I know nothing about it." I asked him what he ran back for? He said, to make water; I had not seen any thing of that sort. When I took hold of the ass, Marrion came up; I gave him the care of it, while I went after the prisoner. I took him to the watch-house. We found twenty-one whole glasses and some pieces which were claimed by Mr. Hancock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You went with him to the watch-house?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170050"/>A. Yes: Marrion went away before I did. I heard the prisoner say he had been to the play, could not get in at his lodging, and had taken a walk. I pursued him: he turned back - there were other watchman about; it was rather dark. The man in the white coat, who seemed to have more command of the ass than the others, had a stick in his hand.</p>

            . I was officer of the night. I was at the watch-house soon after the prisoner came in. There were twenty-one whole glasses and two broken ones in the hamper. I asked what he did out, at that time in the morning. He said, he had been out late at night, and got locked out; hat he lived in St. Helen's, and had been walking the whole of the night.

On Monday, the 17th of January, I missed one skein of silk, from a nail in the dye-house, where I had put it a few days before. I had all the workmen searched that night. Mr. Newton took two skiens of silk from him: they fell from his small-clothes as he was searching him. The prisoner said at first, it was not him. I then sent Thomas for an officer. He desired to speak to me alone: I told him to speak before all the people; he then said, it was the first time, and it was a d - d b - h of a woman who persuaded him to do it. The watchman afterwards found some silk in the street, and the officer found more in his coat pocket.</p>

I saw some gentlemen coming out of Lincoln's-Inn-fields; the two prisoners followed them; they then went into Hand-court and into Fetter-lane. I saw Phillips take this handkerchief from a gentleman's pocket. I crossed over to him, he put it under his coat. I said, "Give me the handkerchief." He took his hand away and it fell down. Dixie was then between two and three yards from him. While I was taking the handcaffs, and securing the prisoners, the gentleman got away. I ran after him down to Fleet-street, but could not find him.</p>

I cannot tell whether it was the prisoner's or not. They laughed at me. I think they were drunk, and I was not sober.</p>

There were many girls near him. I took one into custody, whom he gave charge of, after some time: he said at first, he did not know which was the girl.</p>

I went up to him on Knightsbridge-green, between one and two o'clock, on the 15th of January: Chard was with him. I asked him, if he had got rabbits to sell: he said, no. I asked, if he had sold them: he said, he never had any to sell - he did not keep rabbits. I said, "You had some to sell this morning." He said, he was sure he had not. I questioned him a good deal, and he at last said, he was the only one who had stolen them. I told him, the constable was after him, and he would be taken. He said, "Let me put my coat on;" which he did. He then went with me to Mrs. Stole's, and showed her where the rabbits were.</p>

On the 12th of February, I missed a coat, a waistcoat, a handkerchief, and a hat. John Spinks also lodged in the room. Some of the things were in a trunk, and some hanging over the bed, I saw them safe when I went out, between eight and nine o'clock at night. I went to the Hand-and-Flower public-house: I returned a little after eleven. The prisoner had <rs id="t18250217-116-deflabel672" type="occupation">worked in the garden</rs>

When I went to the public-house, he was there, and went out about nine o'clock, and returned in about an hour, and said, "I have been out, and got my Sunday hat on: it will fit you Duncan." I then took notice of the hat - it was different to the one he had on before. When I went home, I lighted a candle, and missed my things directly. I called a young man, named Foster; we went into the room again, and found two hats there: one of them was mine, the other was the prisoner's, and one of mine was gone. We then went down to see if the prisoner was in his lodging, at the Hand and Flower public-house - he was not; we then went further, and found him concealed in some straw; we asked him, what he did there; he said, as it was late, he did not like to disturb the people at the public-house. Foster brought the hat down, and asked him if it was his - he said, it was, and a handkerchief, which was in it. He denied having been in the room. I did not lock the door when I went out. He said, he knew nothing about the property - we found it concealed in the nursery the next morning. I cannot say whether he was drunk or not. We took him to the watch-house, and he said, we might do our best.</p>
               <p>JOHN SPINKS. I lodge with Duncan. I left the room about eight o'clock, and left my property all safe. I went to town, and returned a little after twelve. I met Duncan and Foster at the gate, who told me of the robbery. I found all my property concealed in some straw, about seven o'clock the next morning.</p>

On the 2d of February, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening. I was behind the counter, and saw the prisoner enter the shop, and go out with a piece of flannel. which stood about nine feet within the shop - I pursued, and caught him a few yards off, walking away with it under his arm - another person was standing within a few yards off the house - he dropped the flannel, got away, and ran about one hundred yards, and was stopped by a gentleman, without my losing sight of him. It measures thirty-five yards, and cost us 3 l. 10 s.</p>

On the 8th of February my house was fastened up - I went to bed at eleven o'clock at night, with my family. - I got up first in the morning, at seven - it had been light for three quarters of an hour. I found the back door broken open, and missed from the shop 14 lbs of tobacco, 8 lbs. of tea, a pair of shoes, and a pillow case. The till was broken open, and about 4 s. worth of copper taken out. The value of all the property lost is 7 l. or 8 l. I cannot swear to tea or tobacco, but I have brought samples, which match with what was found. I think I have seen the prisoner about New Gravel-lane. I was present when a neighbour found a pair of laced half boots in an unoccupied house at the back of mine, and traced<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170055"/>footsteps from my house through that house; they appeared fresh.

            . I am an officer of the Thames Police. On the 9th of February, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, Warner stated what had happened. I had apprehended the prisoner before eight, in bed, at a bad house, in Mordan's-court. I asked how he got his living - he would give no answer, and under the bed on which he lay I found these parcels of tobacco, and in the window place of the room I found a pillow-case, with tea in it - he said he knew nothing at all about them. I saw Jeffery find behind the fire place a crow-bar, a phosphorus box, and matches. I found more tea in two canisters, and some in a mug - nobody but him was in the room. The tea things were laid for two persons. I received a pair of boots from Warner, which I put on the prisoner's feet at the office - they exactly fitted him - he had a pair of old shoes on, but the boots were very muddy, and his trowsers which he put on were very muddy. They must go over a very muddy place to get to this back door. The mud on his boots and trowsers correspond.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Thames Police. In consequence of information, I went with my brother officer, and found the prisoner in bed, and found what he has stated. I found in the cupboard a bundle of phosphorus matches, and on the mantle piece a phosphorus bottle, and what appears to me to be a skeleton key, and behind the fire place, behind some bricks, a crow-bar, the broad part of which exactly tallied with the marks on the prosecutor's door, where it was broken.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WARNER. I saw the crow-bar fitted to the marks on the door - they corresponded exactly. I lost more tea than is here, but this is of the same quality. The tobacco exactly matches with some, which I had in two days before: it was in two jars - here is only 9 lbs. I have no doubt of it being the same quality, and the tea also.</p>

            , a butcher, of Kingsland-road. On the 6th of January, in the evening, after candles were lighted, I saw the prisoner at Mr. Broker's shop door - he asked for master, who I called forward, and he said he had come to enquire whether he could kill twenty sheep - master said he could kill twenty or a hundred. On the 7th I saw twenty sheep there; I was not present when they came - the prisoner called the same day while they were there, and saw master; I was present: he went to the back premises, where the sheep were; he saw them, and asked why we had not began to kill them; master said he heard there was some thing wrong respecting them; the prisoner offered to give him a note of hand, to indemnify him that they were his; he went away; and on the 8th, in the evening, after candle light he came again (it was Saturday;) he asked me if I had got the key of the shed: I asked if he wanted to take the sheep away - he said Yes; I said I had not got the key, and if I had I could not let him take them: he then left the premises. I did not see him again till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was he known to you before? A. I had not spoken to him before the Thursday, but had seen him before. I think it was about five or six o'clock on Thursday when he came; it was soon after candles were lighted. I saw him again on Friday, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, and again on Saturday. Master lives near the first turnpike in the Kingsland-road.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. You saw him with the sheep when he was speaking about them? A. Yes; he was in the shed with them, when he asked why we had not began to kill them.</p>

            . I am son-in-law to Mr. Broker, of Kingsland-road. On Thursday night, the 6th of January, the prisoner came and asked my father if he could kill him twenty sheep; my father said, Yes, a hundred if he liked. The prisoner agreed to give him 1 s. a head, to kill, and send them to market, and book them in his (the prisoner's) name; he said his name was Bishop. They were to come on Friday; some man brought them about half-past eight o'clock on Friday morning; the prisoner did not bring them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time did he come? A. About seven o'clock, I think - we light candles soon after dark, and it was soon after they were lighted. I let the sheep in at a quarter or half-past eight o'clock in the morning.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. I produce two sheep skins, which I got from a shed at the back of Broker's house, in the presence of the last witness on the 14th; I brought away eighteen live sheep also.</p>
               <p>JOHN BURKITT re-examined. These are the skins of two of the sheep which I let in: the eighteen which Waters took away were the rest of the twenty.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROKER. I am a butcher, and live in Kingsland-road. On the 6th of January, about six or seven o'clock in the evening, my man called me out - I saw the prisoner - he asked if I could kill him twenty sheep - I said yes, a hundred - he asked what I should charge - I said twenty shillings to kill and take them to market, with my horse and cart - he said he would send them in, and perhaps he should buy twenty more to-morrow - he asked me to take something to drink - we each had 3 d. worth of brandy - I asked him when they would come - he said between 8 and 9 o'clock next morning - a short stiff man knocked me up about half-past six o'clock, but I did not see the sheep - he said they were round at the back door. I went out to market, and when I came home found twenty sheep in my shed - the back door is the way my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170056"/>sheep always came in - two of them were afterward killed - I hung the skins up and the officer took them away - no other skins hung in the shed. The prisoner called on me about ten or half-past ten o'clock on Friday morning, and asked me the reason I had not began to kill them - I said I had heard they had not been properly come by, and there had been an officer to stop them. He said he would give me a note of band to indemnify me that they were his, and if I did not like to kill them he would get somebody else. I said I would set two men to kill them in the afternoon - he said very well, and asked me to go and take a pint of ale with him, which I did. I lent him 1 s. to pay for it, and never saw him again till he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure about his person? A. Yes; I went to his house on Sunday with the officer. The last time I saw him was between ten and eleven o'clock on Friday night. I was not at home on Saturday till nine or ten at night. I did not go to make any communication to him either on Friday or Saturday. The first officer I told of it was on Friday. I told the prisoner on Friday that an officer had been about them. I sometimes kill twenty or thirty sheep a week - I killed the two on Monday afternoon by desire of the officer, as they were not likely to live an hour, being ill. I am positive of his person.</p>

I lost twenty (looking at the skins) - I know these positively to be the skins of two of my master's sheep - I saw eighteen live ones at Broker's, on the 13th of January - they were the rest of a score which I brought from Tottenham on the 31st of December. I had not seen them since - they were brought from Tottenham and turned out into the field at Islington - I came part of the way from Tottenham with them, with the servant who took them to Islington - I had seen them at Tottenham at different times, from the 13th of November, and know them very well - they were in my care at Tottenham.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many had you at Tottenham? A. Seventy-five or seventy-six. I know the skins by the ochre-mark, and by the face of the sheep - I swear to the live ones by their faces, and to the skins by the marks - all that flock had the same mark.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. You have been long acquainted with sheep? A. Yes, ever since I was eight years old - I speak with certainly to them.</p>
               <p>MR. JAMES RHODES. I had a quantity of sheep at Islington - the last time I saw these was on the 5th of January, about twelve o'clock in the day, in my field at Islington - I knew the eighteen when they came back, but cannot swear to these skins - I did not miss them till I saw them advertised on the 13th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not know these skins? A. I cannot say whether I should know them by the skins or not. I had sent Frith to pick them out at Tottenham - I should know all the seventy-five. I have no partner - my premises are about two miles from Kingsland-road - I do not see the sheep daily, and cannot say when they were stolen. My fields are at the back of York-place - there was plenty of grass for them.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. When you saw the advertisement you missed them? A. Yes - I know them well - I bought them at Kingston fair on the 13th of November.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROKER re-examined. The prisoner said he had got more money, and perhaps he might buy twenty more to-morrow - he did not say how he came by these - I did not know him before - he did not tell me his name; but on Friday morning he told me to book them in his name (Bishop) - that was after I told him there was something wrong in it. The bargain about killing them was made on Thursday evening.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. I knew the prisoner before this occurred - he lodged at the Basinghouse public-house. Kingsland-road. In conquence of information from Broker I went there to apprehend him on the evening of the 8th, after eight o'clock - I went again on the evening of the 9th and 10th, but could not find him. I had a communication from him afterwards, that he would surrender - I went to Cheltenham and there found him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He surrendered himself? A. Yes. He has been a publican, and has lived at an eating-house. The Basinghouse is a mile and a half or two miles from Islington.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police officer. On Saturday, the 27th of November, between seven and eight o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoners in Beck's-rents, Rosemary-lane, sitting on a quantity of grass mats - they appeared bulky about the body. I went up to them, and asked Tyler where he got them from - he said they belonged to a boy - I searched Tyler, and found in his hat a gown, and in his pocket a handkerchief - he said they were his own. Carter, who was with me, found a shawl, and a pair of new blue trowsers on Clements. Tyler said he picked his things up on Ruthem-hill, which is on the Maidstone road, about nineteen miles from town - he said they had been down there looking for work, as brick-makers, and had made the mats on the road - that they lived at Uxbridge. I took them before the Magistrate - they were remanded, but I could not find the owner - they were committed for a month as vagrants, and were afterwards apprehended on this charge, I have had the property ever since.</p>

I read him my warrant - he said, "Oh! I have got no money now" - I said if he would go and get it I would wait a little. - He said, "Oh! No, I shan't go out after it;" I said if he would, it would save the expences: he said he should not. I said if he did not I must distrain. I walked to the back of the room, put my hand on a work bench, and said, "I seize and distrain on this for, and towards 2 l. 10 s. due to Mr. Mason, your landlord, for rent - he then walked deliberately from the door towards me, and came up right behind me; I thought he was going to put his coat on to go out for the money, but as I put my hand in my pocket to take out my inventory he came behind me, took hold of my collar behind, kicked my feet up under me, seized an axe off the bench, and began chopping at my legs, and as I was down he continued chopping - I kept the blows off as well as I could, but finding I could not keep them off, I said, "Well, let me get up, and go out" - he said he would be d - d if he would, for I should never go out of the room again alive; he struck at my head with the blunt end of the axe - I caught the blow on my arm, and in struggling he thought that my hat saved the blows, and said, "That d - d hat is in the way:" he made a kick to kick my hat off, and in so doing lowered his body, which enabled me to catch hold of the handle of the axe; I got up - we struggled: my man came in, and one Munroe followed him, and we three, as well as we could, got him half way down stairs. The constable came, and we got the axe from him. My legs are cut in two or three places; it was done when he first began to chop at me, not in the struggle: if it had not been for my own activity I must have been cut in pieces. Mr. Dodd, a surgeon, attended me ever since; my leg is chopped direct across the shin bone. As I walked to the surgeon small bits of the bone worked out with the blood, through my stocking. There is only one wound on the bone - the other is lower down. I never touched him till he threw me down. There was no other goods there to seize.</p>

               <p>RICHARD SKINNER re-examined. I have known the prisoner five years: he lives next door to me - I always considered him to be in an unsound state of mind. Four or five years ago he came and asked if I would let him go up stairs, for there was somebody talking to him through our wall - my wife went up with him. He opened the cupboard door, and said there was something very bad going on, for there was always an evil spirit talking to him through the wall. I have heard him, through the wall, on Sundays preaching to himself; he has come into the yard, and said he was like our Saviour, and had fasted forty days and nights. He used to hold up a gingerbread twist in his hand, and say so. I always observed the same state of conduct; he has a wife and child, and is a very industrious man; he was called Bogie by the neighbours. I believe him to be insane. I have heard that he was confined in a mad-house. I saw his wife a day or two after he was taken; she said she had not been to him; they do not live together.</p>

            . On the 26th of January, a little after eight o'clock in the morning, I placed this print in the middle of the prosecutor's shop - I am his servant. I closed the street door, and went into the back room, returned in five minutes, found the door open, and the print gone. On the 29th, master directed me to go to the Bull Inn, Bishopsgate-street, and ask for Patmore - I went; the prisoner Patmore came in immediately - I told him I had come for the print: he said he had not got it, but knew where it was; he said he could not tell who took it, and asked if he had better go back with me to Mr. Fremont's about it - I said that would be the best way. He came back, and on the road said it was at a pawnbroker's - I asked where - he said very near, and he believed it was pawned for 15 s. - that he knew it was the one we had lost, because he was coming by at the time, and saw it come out of the shop. I asked why he did not stop the man; he said he followed him to the pawnbroker's, and went in with an excuse. When he got to master's he was taken into custody.</p>

            . I am a street-keeper. I was at Mr. Fremont's when Patmore came in with Jarmen. He seemed agitated at seeing me, and stepped back. I thought he was going to run out, and shut the door. I asked what he knew about the print. He said, he saw a person go into the shop and take it, and he happened to be at the pawnbroker's when it was pawned. I said, it was very strange that he should see a person robbed, and make no alarm; and still more strange, that he should be at the pawnbroker's shop when it was pawned. He said it was true, and he would show me the pawnbroker's. I said, I thought he had better go with me to the watch-house, and I would endeavour to find the pawnbroker's myself. I took him there; he then said, he would tell the whole truth. I neither threatened or promised him. He said, another person, whom he mentioned, had committed the robbery, and told me where to find him, which I did. He said, that person gave him 1 s. for pawning it; that he had been out two or three times with him, but had never done any thing.</p>
               <p>MR. FREMONT. Patmore had called at my shop to say he could recover my print, if I sent my lad to the Bull public-house. I sent him, he brought Patmore back. I called Adams out of the parlour; his account is correct.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Cameron, a pawnbroker. On the 26th of January, Patmore brought this print to pawn for one guinea. I offered him 10 s. He said, that was too little; he thought my employer would lend him more. I said, he would be in in an hour, if he would call again. He said he would, if I would give him 10 s. then, which I did. He said, it was his own; that his name was Patmore; but he would not take a duplicate till he saw whether Mr. Cameron would lend him more. He did not call again; but within an hour, Thomas came, and asked if I had taken such a thing in, and what the person had on it. I said, 10 s. He said, "Give me the ticket of it." Whether he said it was his, or he was going to buy it, I cannot be certain. I hesitated about giving him a ticket, till he said the person's name, who brought it, was Patmore, I then gave him a duplicate.</p>

            . I am an officer. I asked Patmore, how he came to know the print belonged to Fremont. He said, he saw a man take it out of the shop. I said, if he had been honest, he could have stopped the man. He said, at the watch-house, that the man who stole the print had got him out of his place, as porter, at the Green Dragon public-house; and he had been a few days about the street, but had not done any thing.</p>
               <p>PATMORE'S Defence, (written.) On the 26th of January, I was walking by the prosecutor's house, and saw a boy come out with a picture. I walked on: he came up, and asked me to pawn it for him, and he would give me 1 s. Is it seasible that I should go into the first shop I came to, if I had known it to be stolen. He waited at the door till I came out; I gave him the money, and he gave me 1 s. In the course of the afternoon, I saw Thomas, and told him what I had been doing; telling him, the ticket was at the pawnbroker's, if he liked to fetch it. I did not take the ticket, because they did not give me the money the boy told me to ask for. A few days after, I was uneasy about it, thinking it was stolen; I mentioned it to two or three people, who advised me to inform the parties,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170059"/>and recollecting seeing a boy come out of this shop, I enquired if the prosecutor had lost such a thing.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 23d of January, I apprehended the prisoner at his house, in Arbour-square, Commercial-road, and found four horses in his stable, where he was cleaning harness. I said nothing to him about them, as I did not take him about horses. I took them all four to the stables of Bishop, my brother officer, in Queen-street, Lincoln's-Inn-fields, on the evening of the 23d, for safety. They were advertised. Morris saw one of them at Bow-street, and claimed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You had not particularly noticed this horse? A. I rode it to the stable.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MORRIS. I saw it at Bow-street, in possession of Ellis, who had taken me to the stable: he is not here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not the fence rather old? A. It was sufficient to keep the horse in; two others, which were in the field, remained there: it was old, and had done work.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 17th of December, I bought this horse at Woodstock fair, and left it at the Blandford Arms public-house for five weeks, as it was lame.</p>

            . I am hostler at the Blandford Arms, at Woodstock. On the 17th of December, I remember the prisoner buying a horse, in my master's yard, of a tall thin man: he paid for it at our bar: it was lame, and remained five weeks in our stables, when he fetched it away.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who is the tall thin man? A. I never saw him before nor since. It was a brown horse, with two white hind legs, and had a little white on the fore leg. I showed it out for the man. I do not know what was paid for it. I have seen it since in Morris's possession, and am sure it is the same. The tall thin man slept at our house that night, and left in the morning. I have lived there six years.</p>

On the 10th of February, I left the shop, and bolted the front door inside, and fastened the back door outside by a secret way. I went to master's house, in Leadenhall-street, returned about eight o'clock in the morning, and found every thing gone. The front door was partly open, and the pannel broken. I missed the provisions stated in the indictment, which were all safe in the shop the night before they were worth 10 l. or 12 l. A shirt, which hung behind the door, was taken. I have since seen some hams, two tongues, and two skewers: one skewer had been in a round, and the other in a brisket of beef; I knew the skewers.</p>

Burt came again at night, and I think the others. On Monday, a little after twelve o'clock, in consequence of what my pot-boy said, I called Taylor out of the taproom, and showed him some ham which was left in the kitchen chair on Sunday night, and asked if he knew any thing of it (I had just then heard of this robbery) - he said it did not belong to him, but he knew to whom it did belong; I desired him to take it off my premises, as I suspected something wrong about it; he said he expected the young man there about dinner time.

When the officer came in the morning my mother said I was not at home, she thought; but she called out, John, and I answered. The officer came and took the things off the table; I said there was more in the cupboard.</p>
               <p>TAYLOR'S Defence. He left a ham in my care, and, as he did not come at night, I left it with the servant.</p>
               <p>Six witnesses gave Burt a good character.</p>

On the 22d of January I stopped the prisoner in Aldgate High-street, with a box of figs - he said he brought it from the other end of the town; I said where? he said from Rood-lane, and was taking it to Mr. Johnson's, near the Three Jolly Butchers public-house, Mile End. He said at the watch-house that a man gave it him to carry.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you go to find the place where he said he was taking them? A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You showed him all over your house, except one room? A. Yes; that room belonged to the prisoner. The officer opened it with a key, and found some hats, which were not there when I let him the room. I saw him there the day before, and on that day, (Wednesday.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you know of any body being in treaty for a house near you? A. I had two to let; the prisoner had been in treaty for one of them some days; I did not let it to him, because it was not finished. I was apprehended on this charge, and detained from Wednesday night till Monday.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you know any thing of him? A. Only from seeing him at the public-house next door. I was bound over to prosecute, and subpoened before I attended the Grand Jury.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Wednesday evening, the 9th of February, I went to the Ship and Star public-house, Rosemary-lane: it is frequented by persons who deal in wearing apparel and other things. I saw the prisoner there: he passed by the bar. I observed him go and lock the kitchen door: I had no opportunity of getting to the door. I waited a few minutes: he returned and unlocked the door. I followed him, and saw him take hold of a black bag, behind the kitchen door - he lifted it up. I said, I must take him and the bag. He said, he knew nothing of what was in it, and begged to be let go, which I refused. I left the bag, sealed up, at the house, and took him to the watch-house, and then to the Compter, and gave information to Mr. Oakey, having had previous information of the robbery. I found eleven hats in the bag, some with paper round them. I went to No. 30, Hosier-lane, in consequence of information; I opened the door of the first-floor front room with a key which I found in the prisoner's pocket, and found five dozen hats, and a basket, with T. O. C. on it - the hats are unfinished. The prisoner denied all knowledge of the hats found at the public-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you went to the kitchen, did you tell him why you apprehended him? A. I said, he must go with me, in consequence of the property there, and in consequence of information which I had received. This was about twenty minutes past seven o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>JOHN OAKEY, JUN. re-examined. I saw the hats found in the bag - they were our manufacture - part are finished and part not. We have a few customers who buy them partly unfinished; but some are in a state in which we never sell them: those were in the basket. I went with Stone to Hosier-lane. The basket is my father's - it is marked T. O. I saw our man mark it two years ago: we had never parted with it. I went to the warehouse on the morning of Saturday, the 5th, and observed about four dozen unfinished hats laying in the premises. No violence<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170063"/>had been used to the door. The stock was not kept there; it is where the men work.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You know nothing of the state of the premises, on the previous night? A. No: I will not swear that there are above three of the bats in a state in which we never sell them. I think I might safely swear, that there are three; they are in a particular state of finishing, in which they never are sold by any house in the trade that I know. They are branded with the letters T. O., my father's initials.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Oakey. On the morning of Friday, the 4th of February, when I came to the warehouse, I found the warehouse door, and the outer door which encloses the yard, open, and supported by an iron to keep it open. I missed about one hundred hats; several were in an unfinished state; we call them hoods: they are only dyed; about twenty of the hundred were hoods; we sometimes sell hoods to people, who finish them to particular sizes, but had sent none out for a month before. I afterwards saw some in a basket, at Guildhall, sealed up, and they are sealed now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you miss them on Friday morning or Saturday? A. Saturday morning I missed the new work, which had been brought in a basket. I was there at half-past eight o'clock in the morning. The men left work at eight or nine the night before - I was not there then. One or two hoods may occasionally be sold. I was not the first person at the warehouse on Saturday morning.</p>
               <p>MR. OAKEY. I went to the warehouse about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, being informed by my brother of the robbery. The iron had then been moved from the door.</p>

            . I am a porter. I saw the prisoner, last Wednesday week, about three o'clock in the afternoon, at the Ship and Star public-house, Sparrow-corner. He said, he had a job for me, and asked if I had a case: I said, no. He asked if I could get one: I said, no. He went out himself, came in, and said he had got one, and gave me 5 s. to leave, as security for it. He took me to a house in Hosier-lane, with it, to the first floor - he sent me down, I went to the public-house next door - he brought the case down himself to me; it was an egg chest, about a foot and a half deep. He called me out of the public-house; I helped him into a truck with the case - I took it to the Ship and Star public-house, and do not know what was in it. I saw forty or fifty hats in his lodging; some in front of the room, and some on the other side - it was about half-past four o'clock when I was at his lodging. He sent me down stairs - I did not see what he put in the case - I put it into the back kitchen, at the Ship and Star.</p>

            . I am errand-boy to Mr. Oakey. On Saturday morning, the 5th of February, about a quarter past seven o'clock, I went to the warehouse - I was the first person there and had the keys - I was sliding opposite the yard - another boy ran by and shoved the door open - I found the warehouse door open - I had left the night before when the shop was shut, and fastened the door myself - about six dozen hats were gone - I went in with Mr. Tomlinson, and missed them: they were safe the night before. The doors had an iron against them, to keep them open. I believe some of the hats were unfinished.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How many? A. I cannot say - there might be a dozen and a half, or more - they were black hats. I had the keys in my hand, and met the other errand-boy; he scolded me for leaving the doors open, but I had not been there.</p>

            . These are called finished bats by the manufacturers, but not by the retailers. There are no hoods in the basket - they have Mr. Oakey's mark. Here is one in the first process: after the hood; we never sell them in that state.</p>

            . I have been a clerk in the East India House, and know the prisoner, and was with him in the parlour of a public-house in Hosier-lane; I think it was about a fortnight ago. Two men came in and asked for him; I saw them whispering a few questions to him, about raising some money for a bill, and heard him say, "Well, bring a sample." I did not hear what, but in half or three quarters of an hour, they brought in a hat; it seemed to be unlined. I heard no conversation after that. The man who brought the hat went away with it; he did not leave it with the prisoner. I stopped there for an hour or two; nothing passed till between three and four o'clock, when the man came in again; I saw him whispering to Mr. Dyer, and saw Dyer pay some money.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it one of the same men? A. I believe it was. I saw Dyer pay him some sovereigns - I should think about forty, or more, for what I know - but I went home to tea immediately after.</p>
               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. What department of the East India-house are you in? A. I was a clerk - I have an independence arising from my wife's money - I was in the naval department, as clerk, with Captain Thomas, in 1814.</p>
               <p>Q. You were Captain's clerk in an East India ship? A. Yes. I have married since that, and have an independence - I have no employment - I live at No. 15, Thomas-street, Stamford-street, Blackfriar's-road. This happened about a fortnight ago - I think it was on a Tuesday, and I think on the 8th of February - I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What, that the sample was produced to the prisoner on Tuesday, the 8th of February? A. Yes. I think I should know the persons who brought it. I heard the prisoner was in custody a few days after - I read it in the newspaper, and heard it mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner go away after the sample was produced? A. No - he went into the passage, but did not leave the house to my knowledge. There were four or five persons in the room; it was at the Horse and Groom public-house. - I have seen one person here to-night who was there - I cannot tell his name rightly, for I do not know him intimately, and have not asked his name - I have talked to him here, but not a word on this subject. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170064"/>asked him how business goes on, and about the weather, and a hundred things; and if this trial was likely to come on to-night, as I did not like to wait; nothing more passed between us. I do not know how the people who brought the hats were dressed. I should think them from thirty to thirty-six years old; they wore black hats; I do not know the colour of their coats - one was rather stout, and the other about my size. The prisoner drank some porter with me - the other person who is here did not drink with us; he was not in the room at first. I went there about twelve o'clock with the prisoner - I had met him in Black-friar's-road; the other man came in in three or four hours. I left between four and five o'clock - the two men came in about two. The person who is here was not there then; he could see nothing but paying the money. The landlord and landlady came in and out - we had two or three pints of beer, and a glass of brandy and water - I had some bread and cheese there with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Were you in the habit of going to that house? A. No - I had been there once or twice.</p>

            . I live in Surrey-place, Kent-road, and am not in any business: my father was a lottery-office-keeper, in Cornhill. I was at the Horse and Groom public-house, Hosier-lane; I think it will be a fortnight ago to-morrow - it was on a Tuesday. I got there, I think, between three and four o'clock. I have known Dyer some time - he was there when I went in - I went to ask for Mr. Coleman, a builder. I had a glass of wine and water, and was there about an hour, or thirty-five minutes. I saw Mr. Dyer in conversation with a man - what attracted my notice was hearing money pass on the table; I looked towards them. I saw money being transferred from Dyer to the man - I heard him say, "Here is forty," and saw sovereigns on the table: there were three or four men round the table - I cannot say which he was paying it to.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you see that gentleman there? (Campbell?) A. He was sitting at the opposite table to me; I think he was nearer to Dyer than me. I heard somebody say, "Here is 40 l." I heard no more, for I went away almost directly. I saw no hat there; there were three or four men round the table. I got there at a quarter past three o'clock, and left at four, to go to Charing-cross. I am sure I heard the words, "Here is forty pounds."</p>
               <p>Q. When was your recollection called to this circumstance? A. When I returned from Tunbridge Wells, four or five days ago - I happened to read it in the paper. I went to Mr. Prentice's office, on business, and asked Mr. Lee if it was the Mr. Dyer whom I knew. I have known him seven or eight years, or more. I have been a coach proprietor; I drove on the Brighton road four years ago; I was a coach driver for three or four months. I now live on what my father left me; it was about 7000 l. - he died in 1816. I was a bankrupt in 1812.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Where did Dyer live? A. By the Elephant and Castle. I always knew him to be a respectable man.</p>

I was at the Rockingham Arms, public-house, by the Elephant and Castle, last Friday week, from half-past six o'clock, till half-past eleven at night. The prisoner came in about half-past eight o'clock, or later - I merely knew him by sight; I was not acquainted with him; he was there all the evening, till half-past eleven, when the house was shut up; he went out just before me.

            . I am a carpenter, and live in Chapel-street, Stockwell. I have seen the prisoner and the last witness at the Rockingham Arms - I saw them both there on the same night - as near as I can recollect it was last Friday fortnight; I am almost positive it was on a Friday - I went there at half-past six o'clock, or seven; the prisoner was then there, or came in soon after. I staid till about eleven, and believe he was there all the time; I did not miss him: I was smoking my pipe.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How do you remember that it was on Friday? A. Because on Friday I came to town, and called at the Rockingham Arms; I sat there with Mr. Peake. Mr. Dyer, and two or three more were there, and there was a countryman there, who came to see one Allen, about some business, and he had a little bottle of Hollands, and gave it to Peake, who tasted it, and I tasted it, and gave it to Dyer to taste, but he swallowed it - I said if I had known what he was going about I should have taken a little more myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure this was no Friday fortnight? A. As near as I can positively say. I do not swear that it was on that night. I am almost certain that it was on Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Who sent for you to come here? A. I called at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170065"/>the Rockingham Arms a week ago, or more, and they were talking about the countryman's Hollands, and I said I gave Dyer some of it. I think the landlord's name is Magnus - I do not know whether he is here. I slept at a friend's, in Thomas-street, about half a mile from the Rockingham Arms, that night.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had you come from Stockwell on any other night that week? A. No. I returned next morning, Saturday. I am almost positive it was Saturday.</p>

            . I am a master bricklayer, and live in Meadow-row, New Kent-road, and frequent the Rockingham Arms. I know Dyer - I heard of his being in custody six or seven days ago. I have been in his company nearly every evening for the last six months. I heard that what he was charged with happened on Friday evening, the 4th of February; and about seven o'clock, or half-past six that night, he came into the Rockingham Arms, and stopped in the parlour till half-past ten; I left him there; Smith was there, and sat by my side - he lives somewhere close by: Bakewell, and Dixon, a corn-chandler, of Camberwell, were there. A countryman came in with one Allen, who belongs to the Court of Request; he wrote a letter for the countryman to take to Waterloo-road; the countryman sat by me, and said he had a drop of good stuff, and produced one of Daffy's Elixer bottles; he asked me to taste it, which I did, and it was Hollands: I handed it to Smith, who tasted, and handed it to Dyer, who poured some into his hand, tried it, and said it was very good, and drank the rest.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You go there every night - what fixes your memory to Friday night? A. I reckon it was Friday night more than any other, because it was the 4th of February, and I have not seen Dyer since - he came there four nights out of the six, at least - I went as usual, but did not see him. Smith lives somewhere close by me, I understand; I live in Newington parish; I understood so from him. I employed him one day to do a job for me; he went out for his tools, and was gone a very short time. Several people were there on the Thursday, the night before: that young man was there (Bakewell,) I think, but am not positive. Smith was there on Thursday. What makes Friday so remarkable was the gin bottle. Allen left as soon as he wrote the letter.</p>

            . I am a corn-chandler, and live at Walworth. I was in the prisoner's company last Friday fortnight, at the Rockingham Arms; Peak and Smith were there. I went in at three o'clock in the afternoon, and remained till the house was shut up. Dyer was there; I remember his passing me: I struck him as he passed, in a jocular way; but he sat down, and felt much hurt - that was between eight and nine o'clock; he remained there till the house was shut up: I did not go out with him, but I went straight to Mr. Purcel's, the Surry chop-house, and met Dyer there - I wondered to see him there, as he did not go with me; it was between twelve and half-past - he was very tipsy indeed. I staid there till between two and three o'clock, and left him there - I did not speak to him, as he felt rather offended at me. I saw him sitting in the corner when I went out. I did not see the countryman at the Rockingham Arms - I was out occasionally.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What was the longest time you were out? A. Never more than a quarter of an hour. He felt offended at me, and mentioned it to Bakewell, and to Smith as well. I saw the man from the Court of Request, but did not see him write a letter. I saw no gin bottle handed round. I am sure it was Friday night.</p>

            . I am constable of the Surry New-road watch-house. I go to the Surry chop-house every morning, about one o'clock, to turn the company out; it is opposite to the Surry Theatre. I went there on the morning of the 5th of February, about two o'clock, and saw the prisoner there - I turned him, and all the rest out of the house. Shergold was there. I came out of the house in about ten minutes, and saw the prisoner walking away towards the London-road, with two persons.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. That road would be very handy to go over the iron bridge into the City? A. I think not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How are you able to say it was the 5th of February? A. Because I went out later than usual that morning - I altered the time that morning, which made my patrols come later to the watch-house; it was only on that morning that I altered the time. I heard of the prisoner being in custody on the Sunday or Monday following, I think, and recollected seeing him there; it was the Sunday or Monday after the Saturday morning, not the Sunday week. It was mentioned to me the very next day, or the day after, that Dyer was in trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you call to mind whether it was the day before you heard he was in custody; or that day week? A. It came to my recollection that I had turned him out of the chop-house the day before, for I said at the watch-house, "Why, it was only yesterday morning that we turned him out" - I said so at the time; and another circumstance which makes me more certain, is, there was a black horse at the door, and a man went away with a woman on that horse, and the turnpike-man on duty that night was Lloyd - that happened on the night I turned them out of the chop-house. I have no doubt of having turned him out of the chop-house, and the day before I heard of his being in trouble.</p>

            . I keep the Surry chop-house, opposite the Circus. I heard on the 6th of February, of the prisoner being in custody; I know it was on the 6th, on Sunday. Keys comes into my house every night; Dyer was there several nights; I heard he was charged with having committed an offence on Friday, the 4th of February, and that night Keys was at my house, about two o'clock, and turned Dyer out, who was very much intoxicated. - Shergold, the officer, was there - he is not here. I went out with Dyer, to a street behind the Fishmongers' alms-houses, to see him home - I saw him into a house there, on the right hand side as you turn down.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. At what time did Keys come to your house? A. It was past two o'clock - it was not three.</p>
               <p>Q. The very next day but one after that, you heard of his being in trouble? A. Yes, on the next day, Sunday - I am certain of that.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How far is your parlour from the window? A. About the length of this Court. My shop is lighted with gas.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I took the prisoner on the evening of the 19th of January, at the bottom of Chigwell-hill - he was running, and calling Stop thief! he came out of Ratcliff-highway, in a direction from Cannon-street. Parrott came up in a minute, and said, "I will swear that is the man."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you run after him? A. No; he came to meet me; some person pointed him out to me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a very good character.</p>

            . I am a constable of Islington. On the 3rd of February, about half-past six o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Chancery Lane, with a person whom I knew. I watched them, and saw Mr. Cresswell and a lady pass the end of the Lane, in the direction of the Strand. The prisoner and his companion crossed over to a print-shop, near which Mr. Cresswell was passing, and they followed him. I had met Reardon just before, and asked him to go with me. I kept up with them on the opposite side of the way, and continued to watch them. I saw the prisoner's companion take a handkerchief from Mr. Cresswell's right hand pocket; the prisoner was close by at the time, and his companion gave it to him; I crossed the road, but they saw me coming. The prisoner seemed not to know what to do with it. I made a catch at him, but they both got away; I pursued the prisoner, who ran by the side of the coaches, and saw him stopped at the corner of Beaufort Buildings. I could not find the handkerchief.

            . I live at No. 22, Grenville Street, Somers-town, and am a plasterer. I was coming down Chancery Lane, towards Fleet Street, when I saw Colton. I saw the prisoner in company with another person taller than himself. I watched them for perhaps twenty-five minutes; - I did not part from Colton from the time I began to watch the prisoner; - he remained in company with his companion all the time. I saw Mr. Cresswell on the opposite side of the way. I went to the coaches, and looked through the wheel; - I saw the prisoner, or his companion, who were both quite close to Mr. Cresswell, take a reddish coloured handkerchief from his coat pocket; before I could get across the road, Colton cried out, "Stop thief!" I saw the other running, and I ran after him towards the City; I believe the prisoner ran towards Charing Cross. I could not see what became of the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was taking a walk, and saw the man who was with me - he asked me where I was going. I said, merely walking about to get myself round, having been ill. I know nothing of the robbery - it might be so, that he picked the pocket, but I did not.</p>

When the prisoner returned in the evening, he added up the list, and afterwards it was checked by the clerk. He was to pay the money he received in the evening. He remained in their service till the 21st of January, 1824, when he absconded. Eight shillings and sixpence was due to him for wages, and, I think, five shillings would have been the utmost that was due to him for perquisites - he was a weekly servant. We saw nothing of him till he was taken into custody this month.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did it not often happen in the accounts, that there was sometimes too much money paid, and sometimes too little? A. It has been the case, but it was a very rare occurrence; I cannot say that it ever happened in his account; it has happened sometimes, that a drayman has given too little, and then he has had the list returned, and told, "You ought to have paid more money," which he has done.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any question asked him about this money before he went away? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the accounts and the money laid on the desk that evening? A. I have no doubt but it was, and balanced in the usual way. I think, about a week after the prisoner left us, we heard of the 30 s. being received from Mr. Taylor.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Has he accounted on the list for all the beer delivered that day? A. Yes; the casks are always counted.</p>

I have a book, in which I made an entry of the money received on the 24th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170068"/>of December, 1823.

               <p>Q. His list corresponds with the entry in the book? A. Yes, exactly.</p>
               <p>THOMAS NICHOLS. The prisoner was in our service, and quitted it, without notice, on the 21st of January, 1824.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How soon, after you had received the information, did you go to Bow-street? A. I think, it was within a month.

I saw the parcel in my master's house, but did not see the contents till after it was found in the prisoner's box. It was delivered on the 25th of January, and, I think, on the 27th or 28th, an enquiry was made about it in the hearing of the prisoner. I heard him deny all knowledge of it several times. I think it was on the 9th of February that the things were found in his portmanteau - it was not locked - there were two black half handkerchiefs and one stiffner. The valet and I searched the box; we told Mr. Trotter of it, and he sent for an officer. The prisoner was out, but returned, and went into his own room before the officer came. Mr. Trotter called him down, and said there were some things missing, and he should search all the servants' boxes, and begin with his, as he was just come to the house. He and Mr. Trotter and I then went to his room: the box was searched, but the things were not there then. The officer came soon after, and Mr. Trotter desired him to search the prisoner, which he did, but nothing was found on him. The articles were found under the mattress of the prisoner's bed, in his own room, to which no one went, except the female servant to make the bed. I said, these are the two handkerchiefs; they came from Mr. Nicholl's: the prisoner said, "Yes; I acknowledge, Sir, they are your property - you may hang me if you like." He had been in the service about seven weeks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you said, you would hang him, if you could? A. I said, if it was my own brother I would hang him, if he were a thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say, on Saturday, you would hang the prisoner, if you could? A. No; I did not. I know Holt: I did not say so to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, that Counsel had better not cross-examine you, for you would hang him, if you could? A. I told him, that counsel had better not push me, for, if they did, I should state other things. Mr. Trotter is not here, nor the valet. The parcel was delivered on the Tuesday evening, and enquired for about the Thursday or Friday - the box was not locked; they were put in again in the same manner.</p>
               <p>Q. This was on the 9th of February - are you quite sure you did not put them into the bed? A. Yes. He said he had seen that some one had been at his box, and he removed them to the bed.</p>

I found the articles under the mattress, while the prisoner was standing by; he said, "I did take them, you may hang me if you like;" he repeated it again, and said, "I acknowledge I did take them." I told him they had been seen in his box, and asked him why he had removed them; he said he found his box had been interrupted, and he was afraid some one had been looking into it, and he removed them under the bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What had been said to him in the interval, you do not know? A. He said they had been laying behind the table in the hall, and he had taken them up stairs for his own use, and after enquiries had been made about them he did not like to produce them.</p>

I had forgotten I had left the desk in the coach. There were no persons about the coach door that I saw. I did not recollect that I had left it in the coach till the following morning; I then went down to the coach office in Essex-street, and stated my loss. I am quite sure the prisoner was the driver. I saw the desk again at a house in Westminster, on the 19th of January - the prisoner was not then in custody. I am certain of the property; the sovereigns were gone - the lock had been picked. I had advertised it on the 15th, and offered three guineas reward, as the papers in it were of great consequence; they were still in it, but the money was gone. The prisoner came to me, and said he believed he was the man who had driven me from Castle-street, to Holling's-street, and said by paying the three guineas reward, and 6 s. to the person at whose house it was, I might have it again; he represented the place where it was as his lodging; I went and examined the desk, and finding the two sovereigns were gone I did not give him the reward. The person of the house detained him while I got a Police officer. When I applied at Essex-street they knew nothing about it, but told me to call again in about four days - I went again on the 15th, and they said they had not seen it, and advised me to advertise.

On Wednesday, the 19th, the prisoner came to my house in the evening; he said there was an advertisement respecting the desk, and he wanted to take it away; I asked him where he wanted to take it to; he said to Holling's-street, Wardour-street, and if one of my boys went with him, he would satisfy them for what he owed me - he owed then 5 s. for rent, and 1 s. for a latch key. I said I would go with him to see that it was all right, before I delivered it - I went with him, and saw Mr. Fisher; I told him I had the desk in my possession, and desired him to come to my house with the prisoner. I brought the desk to the door of my room, and said, "Is this it;" he said, "I dare say it is all right, and if you will go with me, I will settle with you;" I then stated that there was 6 s. due to me.

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner on the 19th of January, between nine and ten o'clock at night, at Mr. Fisher's lodgings. I asked him how he came not to take the desk to the coach-office, which he knew was a general thing - he said it was very wrong, but he took it down to the Punch Bowl, near Temple-bar, and gave it to another coachman, named Yorkshire Jemmy. I have apprehended Jemmy since then - he was discharged on his own recognizance, but he has not been heard of since.</p>

I called at the Punch Bowl for it, but they would not give it to me. I have not seen Jemmy since. I heard no more of it till I saw the bill up in a public-house - I said, "That must be the desk I left at the Punch Bowl." I then went and told the gentleman of it.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. These articles were in two drawers, in the parlour, which were not locked. I saw them safe about six or seven o'clock in the evening; I then went out. We have no lodgers, except a young man, who went out with us. The prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170070"/>is quite a stranger. I came home about a quarter past nine, and the articles were gone. I had been with my husband to a public-house, where we have to pay the men their money. I left my house locked, and no person in it. I and the young man were the persons who first returned; we found the doors all open. I did not notice that the things were gone for some time. I went back immediately to my husband, to inform him of it. We then examined the premises, and missed the articles from the drawers; I saw them on Sunday evening, at the watch-house; the prisoner was then in custody.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Shadwell: my beat is about sixty yards from Lomas's house. On Saturday night, about ten minutes after nine o'clock, I stopped the prisoner as I was going on duty; he was coming from Lomas's house, with this bundle under his arm. I asked what he had got there; he said, clean things, which he had brought from his father's. I took him to the watch-house, and then asked him what the bundle contained; he could not tell me. I found it was women's and children's clothes. I asked again where he got it, and he said, he picked it up at the wooden bridge, which is near Lomas's. I searched him, and found this key upon him. I saw Lomas on the evening following. he claimed the things. The key was tried to his door, but it was too large.</p>

            . I am in the employ of George Drake Sewell and Thomas Cross. On the 1st of February the prisoner came to the door of the shop, and asked me to cut off some print; she bought that and several articles, amounting to about 5 s., which she paid for - she then asked me to show her some ribbons - I showed her some different drawers of ribbon, and she bought two or three yards of narrow. In one of the last drawers of ribbon which I showed her, she asked me the price of one particular ribbon several times; and, as I was putting that drawer back, I missed that ribbon - she had then left the shop - I pursued and brought her back. Mr. Sewell met her by the shop, and she gave him two pieces of black ribbon, and hoped to God he would forgive her; I immediately said, she had got some more; she put her hand under her cloak, and brought out the piece I alluded to, and that was all she had got. There were other persons serving in the shop. The ribbons which she stole had been in three separate drawers. I saw her searched - she had 11 s. about her, a few halfpence, and twenty duplicates.</p>

On Saturday, the 12th of February, I saw them safe about seven o'clock in the evening, fed them, and fastened the stye. I had had the care of them for ten days, and knew them well - I missed them about ten on Sunday morning, and traced the steps of two of them for about thirty rods, but no further; there is a ditch there, over which there is a plank; if they had crossed the ditch and the marsh, they might have got into Old-Ford road. I saw four pigs in the custody of Carter, on Wednesday, the 16th, and knew them to be Mr. Hart's pigs - they had been scalded.

I asked where they were; he said they were at the Quaker's house, which escaped the fire at Ratcliff, in Butcher-row; I said I would go and see them. I went up in the evening and looked at them; I saw four hanging<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170071"/>up - I saw Perkins only; he asked me a crown a stone for them, without their heads and feet; I asked him what he would have for them with their heads and feet on; he said 4 s. 9 d.; I bid him 4 s. 6 d. for the two smaller ones - I asked him who they belonged to; he said to Mr. Jefferson, who was not there - I said if Mr. Jefferson would take that for them, I would have them. Perkins and Jefferson brought them down to my house that night - I paid him for them, and went to Mr. Seamon's to have them weighed - I hung them up in front of my shop that night, and put a clean cloth before them. Carter came next morning and took them away.</p>

I went to a house, which they said was the Quaker's house, which was not burnt down at the time of the great fire. I saw the pigs in a stable; I saw all the three prisoners there - I asked them again what they would take for them; they said 4 s. 9 d.; I told them the most I would give was 4 s. 6 d. It was Jefferson who spoke to me, and I believe it was him who agreed to take it; he brought one to my house, and one of the other prisoners (I do not know which) brought the other; they weighed 12 st. 3 lb. - I told them to go to Mr. Ottey's, the public-house, and I would come and pay them - an officer came as soon as they were gone; I went with him to the public-house, and the prisoners were taken into custody.

I got up in a few minutes, as soon as I could: I complained of being cold, and he said there was a shed close by, to which he would take me. I walked there with him; - he had hold of my arm: - that was not in my way home; - there was no door to it. I went in with him; he pressed me to sit down, and he sat down by my side upon the ground for a very few minutes. I perceived his hand in my pocket, and asked him what he was doing; he said nothing: he then left me, and said he would return in a few minutes. He never attempted to be rude with me, or any thing of the kind; - he said I could sit and rest myself. As soon as he was gone I missed my money. I never stated upon my oath that he wanted to be rude with me: he never asked me to lay down.</p>

She had appointed to come there to me; but as she did not come, I then searched my pocket, and found that a sovereign and two half-crowns were gone. I then went to the watch-house, and got an officer; and on her he found a paper, which had a sovereign and 1 s. 6 d. in it; she said, that was all she had got, for she had changed the two half-crowns to buy some things with - the officer said, that would not do; he must have more - and, as we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170072"/>went to the watch-house, she said, she would make up the money.

I found her in the house where I had left her: it is adjoining the public-house. I told her where I was going - I had dined in Dean-street, which is five or six miles from where I work. I had 5 s. left in my purse when I went to her room. I had 31 s.; and gave her a shilling.</p>

I went with the prosecutor to the prisoner's room, and told her he accused her of robbing him - she said she had no money but the shilling he gave her, and two shillings in the drawer. I went to search her, and when I put my hand under her arm she drew back; I said I must do my duty - she then put her hand in herself, and took out this paper, containing a sovereign, and 1 s. 6 d.; she said if he would drop the charge she would give him the money to make up the two half-crowns; that she had been to market, and bought a bit of beef.</p>

Russel was brought to the watch-house - a third young woman came in, and asked if the charge was taken of Russel - I asked her who sent her; she said a young woman outside; I sent a watchman to fetch that young woman in, Fleming; she took off her shawl, and wrapped it round her left-hand; I said I must search her; she, with her right-hand, began to open her gown; I said I would search outside first. I then took hold of her left-hand, and found the watch in it. Russel was in the watch-house all the time, but not near her. The prosecutor was very much intoxicated, but he knew the girls when he saw them.</p>

He was so drunk we did not know how to get him along.</p>

The prisoner had been with me about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; there were gas lamps alight. I saw her again in St. James's watch-house, on Friday, the 10th of February; I received information that she was there, from Mr. Smith - I went with him, and he asked me if I knew the woman - she came up with six or seven more; I said "Yes, that is the woman;" I still say I am sure she is the woman.

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. The prosecutor complained of his losing his watch, on Friday, the 4th of February; he described the woman, and I took her up on Thursday, the 10th, about half-past nine o'clock at night. I put her with four or five other women - when he came I let the prisoner come up with several others; he pointed her out directly, and said, "That is the woman."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never saw him till I was at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER DAVISON re-examined. Q. Do you swear that she is the woman - she has a thick manner of speaking - a sort of half Irish accent. Can you swear to her voice at all? A. I can, my Lord. I felt her pull the watch from my fob.</p>

            . I am the brother of John Wilson. This piece of land is his: there are some iron railings there. He uses the ground for the purpose of putting building materials there - the prisoner was at work in the yard for Mr. Cautelon, a plasterer: he had no business near the iron. I went to the yard about twelve o'clock that day - the railing had been there a few days before, but I do not know who took it; I have never seen any part of it since.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had worked on board the ship eight days; after the ship was loaded, we leaked two feet five inches of water, in five hours. I was in danger of my life, and I took my clothes on shore - I happened to take these things in mistake, being a little in liquor. Next morning this shipmate came on board, and enquired about his things; I told him what I had done, and said, if I had taken them, it was through mistake - he said, if I would return them, he would say no more about them. The mate had me put into confinement - I am a Swede, by birth.</p>
               <p>KIRK re-examined. Q. Had the vessel sprung a leak at all? A. Yes; it used to leak about two feet of water in twenty-four hours. He denied taking them till all hands were called aft, and then he owned it.</p>

She said a young man gave it to her to pawn for him. I asked where she lived; she said in Hearn's-buildings, and took me to the house, where she said she lived with Lockwood, who was sitting on the bed. I found by the bed side a pair of trowsers, a teaster cloth, a petticoat, a cap, a pair of gloves, and an apron. I found the counterpane at a shop in Rosemary-lane. She said she was Lockwood's servant.</p>

               <p>ELIZABETH LADDS. I am a widow, and live at No. 8, Gilbert-street, in the parish of St. George's, Bloomsbury. I rent the house. Debenham and the prosecutor lodge in one of my rooms. On the 1st of February, Titswell went out about nine o'clock in the morning; Debenham had gone out between seven and eight o'clock. He came in about six o'clock in the evening, and asked for a light to go up stairs to his room. I gave him one; he was up stairs about a quarter of an hour. I went up to ask him to carry a trunk to Oxford-street for me; he said he would in half an hour. I went into the room; he was doing nothing then; I spoke before I entered the room; he said he was going out, and would return in half an hour. He came down stairs in five minutes, and gave me the light at the door; he had nothing in his hands, and appeared to have nothing with him; only he had changed his clothes. The instant he had shut the door, I went up; lifted up the lid of the prosecutor's box, and found part of his property gone, for I had heard him say his box would hardly hold his clothes, and I found very little in it. I ran down immediately, and went down the street with my son, but did not see him. I sent my son another way, and afterwards sent for Titswell. Owen was taken directly. Debenham did not return.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 1st of February, about a quarter to seven o'clock I was in St. Giles's; Ladds ran up to me; I went and found the prisoners in conversation up Hampshire-hog-yard. I went up; Debenham saw me, and made off. Owen stood with his back to me; I collared him immediately, and asked what he had got; he said his own property; I asked what it consisted of; he said a pair of boots, a jacket, waistcoat, and a few other things. I said he must go with me, and let me see if it was so; he objected; I said if it was so, he had nothing to fear. I took him to the watch-house. He had a coat on his arm, and I found a hat-brush in his breast pocket. As I took him to Marlborough-street, he said he had been to Kennington that day, and coming up High-street, he fell in with the other prisoner, who asked him to be so good as to carry this bundle to the Red Lion public-house, Tottenham-court-road, and he would give him a pot of porter. I asked him what induced him to go up that dreadful place; he said, in consequence of Debenham having dropped a coat in the dirt, and he went up there cleaning it. I did not notice whether Debenham had any thing when he ran away.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's father. I heard of my son being robbed, and went in pursuit of the thieves that night, but could get no intelligence. I had information, and apprehended Debenham next morning (Wednesday) about nine o'clock on foot, going through Kensington. I took him into a public-house, and told him I took him for robbing my son. He said he hoped I would shew him lenity. I said I had nothing to do with that, it depended on my son, but he had better tell where the property was. My son was behind, and gone for an officer. The constable found a pin and a silk handkerchief on him. We found a watch at Townsend's in Little Russell-street; a coat at Harrison's, Drury-lane; a watch, silk handkerchief, and ring, at Reeve's. My son is twenty-two years old.</p>

On Tuesday, the 1st of February, about a quarter past six o'clock, I came to the door, and on the opposite side of the way, where there are some coach-houses and stables, I saw Owen; he turned round to see if I was gone; this made me look after him. I saw him go opposite to Mrs. Ladd's house, and look up. I went in, shut the door, and soon after heard Mrs. Ladd's had been robbed. I never saw him before; but I recognised him at Marlborough-street, and am sure he is the man. He was dressed as he is now.</p>

            . I live at No. 31, Strutton-ground, Westminster, and am a tailor. On the 12th of February the prisoner Dunn came to my shop with two others, named Rhodes and Nix, as I understand. I will not swear that Dunn had any thing; a bundle was left on the counter which was not there when they came in. I measured them all three for trowsers, which I made. They said there were some buttons and a piece of cassimere, and if they were of any use to me I might purchase them. Dunn said he had bought them. I said I did not want them, but the bundle was left on my counter. I made the trowsers partly out of some blue cloth which they brought, and part from my own; I did not cut the cassimere nor purchase it. On the 17th of February Morris came to my house, and took away a pair of blue trowsers, the buttons, and cassimere, and I have a frock coat which was cut out for them. Two pair of trowsers were taken away the day before Morris came, by a young woman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. It is very difficult to identify cassimere? A. Yes; all the things were not to be finished till the 19th; the cassimere was left till they fetched the trowsers. I was taken into custody for five hours on this charge; my nurse saw them in the shop; she is attending my wife, and not able to come here.</p>
               <p>Mr. CRESWELL. Q. Look at these trowsers, (produced by SMITH.) A. I made these for Rhodes, part is made out of the cloth they brought; they brought four yards and a half, and wanted a frock coat and each a pair of trowsers, the cloth was tied up with the cassimere.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Cox. I know this cassimere to be his property. I have cut several garments off it; I cut it about two inches, and then tear it across; I know it by that. We lost nine or ten yards of blue cloth, and a quantity of buttons similar to these.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it not common to tear cassimere? A. I do it so, and have seen other tailors do the same. The trowsers are made from cloth of the same quality; I cannot see any difference in them.</p>
               <p>Mr. COX. I have no reason to doubt about the cassimere. I have the list which I verily believe came off the same piece. I found it among my list at home. I have no other list of the same colour.</p>

               <p>PETER WELSH. I am the last witness's husband. I went to bed last, and examined the house. It was fastened up. I was alarmed between six and seven o'clock next morning by Flynn, it was before day-light; I could scarcely see him till I got a light. I found the back-door, which leads into a court, open. I think they had got in at the window, and opened the door. The window shutter was forced, and two squares of glass cut, to enable them to undo the fastening. There were marks of blood on the sash. The cupboards and drawers in the bar were open. I found a crow-bar on the bar table, several things scattered about, and the articles now in Court stolen. They were all safe the night before.</p>

On the 29th of January, about a quarter past four o'clock in the morning, I went by, but noticed nothing then. I was returning between six and seven o'clock; it was day-light; it might be after seven o'clock; and as I passed I saw the prosecutor's door open, but no shutters down. I thought he had gone to bed and left it open. I put my head in and called out "house" several times. Welsh came down in his shirt, and I went away directly, and did not look to see if the house was broken. I have lived in the neighbourhood fourteen years.</p>

            . I am patrol of St. George's. On Saturday morning, the 29th of January, between four and five o'clock, I was in Hyam's Buildings, Bluegate Fields, about a mile from Welsh's house. I went to No. 3, and saw a light in the front room up stairs. I got on the opposite side of the court; continued there some time, heard somebody talking, and saw some person get up and go towards the candle, extending his hands out as if he had something which he was looking at. This was repeated several times; and presently I heard one say to the other, "I will have that!" - the other answered, "By G - d, you shall not have that!" I thought all was not right. A watchman was passing the Buildings; I told him to go and send one of our watchmen directly. Perry came, and waited while I went to the Inspector, to acquaint him. He told me to wait there till six o'clock. Perry and I stopped there some time. He went to the Inspector again; returned to me; and between five and six o'clock the prisoner Cochrane and another came out of the house and shut the door after them. Perry was nearest; he stopped them. I came up, and told them they must wait a bit. Cochrane went up to the top of the court to go into the privy; Perry went to see for the Inspector and an officer; I was alone with the two, and could not leave the entrance of the court, or they would have come out. Jeffery and Summers the inspector came. I pointed out the other man, and said the other was in the privy. We went to the privy to look for Cochrane, and the other man escaped from Perry. We could not find Cochrane in the privy: I have frequently seen him before, and am sure he is one of the men who came out of the house; it must have been nearly six o'clock when he escaped from the privy. I simply asked where they were going; they said, to work.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 29th of January, I went with Summers to Hyam's Buildings. Love pointed a house out; I went up stairs and found Davis in bed; before that, I saw a young man standing in the Buildings; Perry was with him. While Love and I went to the end of the court to look for the other, he escaped. I found Davis in bed - a candle was burning in the room. I found all the property there; part of it was between two beds, which were used instead of a mattress. On the top of the bedstead I found a white veil, and nine caps were wrapped in a black veil, and about the bed I found five shirts, a shift, two pair of sheets, two silk handkerchiefs, thirteen pieces of silk, a shawl, two pieces of lace, and other articles claimed by the prosecutor, and in the fireplace a ring box was among the coals, and under the grate a bill for wine, which Welsh claims; it is dated 1814. I found a phosphorus box and matches in a cupboard, and above the cupboard one pound of tobacco. I asked Davis who the people were who had gone out; she said she knew nothing about it. I apprehended Cochrane the same morning on another charge, and he was discharged.</p>

            . I am inspector of the watch. I received information, and went to this court to the bottom, leaving Perry with the other man. I found a place at the bottom where Cochrane could have escaped; I do not know where he lived. This is a house of ill fame; there are only two rooms in it, one on a floor; a young man was in the lower room, but Davis was alone up stairs; the houses are let out in tenements.</p>

I only saw the reflexion of one person, but heard two voices - they were both male voices. I have frequently seen Cochrane, but could not recognize his voice; there was a curtain before the window so that I could not see what they had.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH WELSH. This property is all ours, and was all in the bar - nothing was taken from anywhere else. This is a bill which my husband made out for Mr. Connell; I saw it in a drawer in the bar the night before the robbery.</p>
               <p>PETER WELSH. This bill I made out as a memorandum before I was in business, it was in the drawer the night before. I know nothing of the prisoners. Flynn called me in the morning, by singing out that the door was open.</p>

               <p>JEFFERY re-examined. Perry told the magistrate he thought the prisoner was rather too tall for the man who escaped from the privy, but Love immediately said he was the man.</p>

I and a chairwoman were sitting in the kitchen; the washhouse was locked, but about a quarter past eight o'clock I found the door open; it leads into the yard, and is about twenty yards from the kitchen: the lock must have been picked. Persons could come in at the back door, which was on the latch, and get to the kitchen; the wash-house is across the yard. I am certain it was locked, and the key hung on the kitchen stairs; nobody could get to the key; the street door is always kept locked. Three boys came and knocked at the door, and gave us information. We have never found the property. I value the property at 35 s. - The wash-house is quite separate from the house, but is in the yard; we go to it without going into the street.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Tilner, at the King's Arms, Chelsea, but at the time in question I was out of place. I am a pot-boy. I and two other lads were standing at the corner of Hector-court, Homer-street, playing with some more boys, and about eight o'clock, or five minutes past, I saw the prisoner and another man standing at the corner of Hector-court. The other man had a sack under his arm; they looked very hard at us, and the prisoner said something to him, and in about five minutes they went in at the back door of No. 9, Homer-street, which leads into Hector-court; they were in there ten minutes or more, when the prisoner came out with a sack on his back, and something in it, which appeared to be so large, it would not go to the bottom. The other man came behind him; we said it could not be all right, and watched them nearly to the top of Homer-street, and then lost sight of them all in a moment. We returned to No. 9, Homer-street, knocked at the door and gave information. They went into the yard. I am certain the prisoner is the man; he is a baker; I have frequently seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. They looked at you? A. Yes; before they went in; the prisoner went in first, and the other after him. The door was shut. I don't know where he lived, but have frequently seen him smoking at the Castle public-house, at the corner of Chapel-street, New Road. The other boys described him to the watchman, and I was present that night when he was taken at the Castle. Beck told the watchman of it about a quarter of a hour after we saw him go away. I had been out of place nearly three months. I never quarrelled with the prisoner.</p>

            . I live in Harcourt-street with my father who is a baker. I saw the prisoner and another man go in at the back door in Homer-street, with an empty sack, about five minutes past eight o'clock; the watchman had just gone eight o'clock. I had seen them there for about five minutes; the other man had the sack when he went in but the prisoner brought it out, full, in about ten minutes. Both went up Homer-street; we watched them nearly to the top, towards the New Road, then lost them. We went back and knocked at Mrs. Moss's door; I told her, and told the watchman. The prisoner was taken at the Castle public-house in about a quarter of an hour. I went in, thinking I might see him, as I often had. I sent the watchman to the Castle public-house; the other man was not there. We were playing by Mrs. Moss's. I have known Simmons about a year; the other boy lives in Shouldram-street; I have had no quarrel with the prisoner; they saw us when they went in, and when they came out, but did not speak to us. The prisoner had his working dress and a brown cap on.</p>

            . I am fourteen years old, and live in Shouldram-street with my father, who is a shoemaker. I was with these boys one evening; I don't recollect the date; it was the day before I was examined at the office. We were standing at the corner of Hector-court; I saw the prisoner and another come and make water against the wall; the other had an empty sack under his arm; they looked very hard at us: the prisoner went in at the back door, the other followed. They came out in ten minutes or more, the prisoner carrying the sack: it was so full, the things could not go to the bottom. We followed them nearly to the top of Homer-street, to see what became of of the sack, but they crossed the road and we lost sight of them: I could see no watchman. In about twenty minutes I saw Beck and Simmons coming down the street with the watchman, who had got the prisoner. We went back to Mrs. Moss before that, and told her. I am quite sure of the prisoner - I knew him before; he used to live in Homer-street where he was apprenticed: I never quarreled with him. He has an uncle - I don't know whether he has any parents.</p>
               <p>MARIA MOSS. When these boys came to my door, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170079"/>went and missed the property. I did not go for a watchman. Nobody but the chairwoman being in the house, and being lame, I could not follow. I stood at the door and saw the watchman bring him by; the boys said he was the man: his uncle keeps a shop on the other side of the New Road.</p>

I felt a hand in my pocket; turned round, and caught hold of the prisoner's hand in my pocket. I said, "I felt your hand in my pocket, and will give you in charge." I immediately received several blows, and was knocked down twice. I laid hold of him again; the watchmen were afraid to touch him; but at last one took him. I had two sovereigns, two shillings, and some half-pence in that pocket. I will not swear that the money was in his hand. I never lost sight of him.</p>

            . I am a refiner and live in Barbican. On the 11th of February the prisoner came to sell me two pieces of gold. I asked who he brought them from; he said from Mr. Brees. I asked if Mr. Brees had sent him; he said, Mr. Brees had not; but one of the young men in the shop had. I told him, if so, he must fetch a note from the young man; he went away leaving the gold behind him, and called again about one o'clock. I asked him if he had brought the note; he said, no; that the person had not time to write it. I said, I must call upon Mr. Brees, before he could have the money; he said he must have the money or gold. I said I was certain Mr. Brees never sent it for sale, and should call on him. He went away, and I called on Mr. Brees.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. When did you call? - A. About three o'clock, and found him still there. He said he picked up the gold out of his master's forge.</p>

About half-past three o'clock Mr. Child called, and told me what had occurred. Having a very high opinion of the prisoner, I thought it impossible, and sent for him. Child said, "That is the young man." He immediately confessed that he had taken the gold for sale, and had often found a lump in one of the gilding forges. I remonstrated with him, and gave him in charge. It is impossible that he could have found it. I went with the officer to his lodgings, and found three melting-pots, which had melted gold, which were not mine, and a pair of scales. I have observed a great deficiency in my gold for some time. Child produced seven dwts. and a half.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have no mark on it? - A. No; it is impossible that it could be in the forge. He bore an excellent character.</p>

On the 7th of February, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop, he said he had just come into possession of property, and wished to purchase a gold watch; he selected a silver one, at 11 l., but said he intended to have given 30 l., but this had taken his fancy; he put his hand into his pocket, and took out a parcel, which he said contained forty-five sovereigns, which he had brought to pay for it. He then bought a gold chain, seal, and key; the whole amounted to 13 l. 19 s. - I attached them together, and handed them to him; he looked at them, and seemed perfectly satisfied. He then said he would take them to shew to a friend at the Blue Boar, and leave the sovereigns behind the while - I wished to open the parcel to see what was in it; he then said he would leave watch, parcel, and all: I said he should not leave the house till I had opened it; he caught hold of the parcel - I wrenched it out of his hand, and found it contained farthings, and immediately gave him in charge. I had sold him the watch, and given it into his hand - I considered the sale complete.</p>

            . I was with Mr. Hookham, arm in arm, a few steps up Clifford's-Inn-passage. I felt somebody at my pocket, which contained a handkerchief and key - my pocket was lifted up, as it opened inside. I disengaged my arm, turned round suddenly, and caught Keith's hand in Mr. Hookham's pocket. Lewis stood close to him. I saw them distinctly, being within ten paces of two gas lights. Mr. Hookham seized Keith - Lewis ran away - Keith said, at the watch-house, that his father was a bricklayer, out of work. I was going to enquire about him, and met Lewis, and gave him in charge.</p>

I said, "Pray, what do you do here?" he paused, and then said, he came down for a necessary purpose - I went to lay hold of him, and he put the candle out, and used very bad language, and struck me once or twice. I said, "If I lose my life, you sha'nt get out." I called, Murder! and at last I was heard, and the men came, and we secured him - the officers found every kind of housebreaking implements upon him.</p>

On the 17th of January, the prisoner came in and asked for Robinson Crusoe; I showed him one; he said he wanted one bound; I showed him one in two volumes; he said he wanted it in one volume, and asked for Young's Night Thoughts; he told me to make the bill, and I saw him put two books into his pocket. I said, "Are you a bookseller?" He said, "Yes." I said, "I will knock for Mr. Mason, - he will take you a little off." He said, "Never mind;" and was going away. I took hold of him by the collar, and brought him back, and called for the person at the next house. I saw him take them out of his pocket.</p>

The prosecutor was going along; I saw the prisoner looking hard at his right-hand coat pocket: my suspicion was drawn towards him; I watched him about four doors, and saw him lift up the gentleman's right-hand pocket with his left hand, and draw the handkerchief out with his right. I took hold of his hand immediately, and said I would not let him go; he said, "Pray do, Sir." He did not get from me. I called to the gentleman to stop; but he could not understand me. I then collared the prisoner, and threw my basket into the Freemasons' Tavern, and told them to mind it: I kept calling after the gentleman, and the prisoner said, "I will show you the gentleman;" we overtook him in a short time; I tapped him on the shoulder, and told him he had lost his handkerchief; he could not understand me. We then met a gentleman who could speak French, I believe, and he made him understand. We all went to Bow-street, and the prisoner was given in charge.</p>

            . I live in Mill-street, Hanover-square. I was coming up Grosvenor-place, and about three doors before I came to Mr. Cox's, I saw the prisoner with an empty sack on his back, and another man with him; I saw him go down the area; I was going down the steps, and he passed me, coming up again, with the sack still empty - I then went into the housekeeper's room, and while I was there an alarm was given that the house had been robbed by chimney-sweepers; I said if the house had been robbed by chimney-sweepers I knew the men. I came out, and went after them down Grosvenor-place, into Chapel-street, and into the mews, where I met the prisoner by himself, coming down the mews, walking very fast; he had nothing with him; I knew him to be the man I saw down the area: I collared him, and said, "What have you done with the sack you had on your shoulder" - he said he knew nothing at all about it. I said, "You shall go back and account for it," and just before I came to the door I met the constable and another person, who said he could identify the prisoner. I did not see the sack again till I saw it at Marlborough-street.</p>

            . I am one of the day-patrole of Bow-street. About seven o'clock at night on the 8th of February, I was going down Bond-street, with my wife; I met three men walking backwards and forwards by Mr. Allen's house - the prisoner was one of them: I went a little further down and returned back; crossed at the corner of Maddox-street; I found there was a fourth person stood talking to them. I passed close by them and went up Maddox-street, a little way towards the church, then crossed over, and then stood under the shade of a lamp, with my wife, In two or three minutes I saw them all in a bustle, near Mr. Allen's shop, which is the first house round the corner from Maddox-street. I saw two of them cross over to the opposite side of Bond-street, right facing Mr. Allen's shop - I then ran towards Bond-street; but before I could get to Bond-street, the prisoner turned round into Maddox-street, with a parcel under his arm; he was running towards me, but on the opposite side. I ran after him, and laid hold of him by the collar; he had the bundle under his arm when I took him, but I could not then tell what was in it. I kept hold of him, though he made a desperate struggle - I called my wife to lay hold of the property. The prisoner unbuttoned his waistcoat, and let down his coat and waistcoat as low as his elbows. I then took hold of him by the neckcloth, and took him back to Mr. Allen's shop - my wife followed me, and so did the shopman, who had come up. The parcel contained kerseymere; there was a number on it, but I cannot recollect what.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Daniel Allen; I have been there about ten months. I remember the kerseymere being brought from Mr. East's by Thomas Langdon, a little before four o'clock; it was put down in the shop, but not so near the door that any person could have reached it. Between six and seven o'clock in the evening I was at the back end of the shop, and I heard the door rattling, as if opening; I saw no one; I thought the wind had blown the door open; I then went on with my business, and presently after heard the rustling of paper; the kerseymere was in a paper, but was not behind the counter; I then went immediately to the door and missed it. I went to the corner of Maddox-street, and saw the prisoner and the officer struggling together, and saw Mrs. Dorrington with the roll of kerseymere. I assisted in taking the prisoner back to the shop. I saw the parcel opened, and it was the one which Langdon had brought; there was a number on it, and a bill of parcels, which was delivered to me; the value is about 17 l. or 18 l. The prisoner was taken to Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). Though I feel conscious of my innocence - though I know myself to be guiltless of implication or intentional aid towards the crime, - yet I confess myself to be culpable; inasmuch as I have lent my assistance towards its perpetration, in the unconscious haste and inadvertency of the moment, without reflecting whether the person who employed me to carry the property from the premises had a right to its disposal. I most humbly implore you to consider the time and the place when I was engaged to perform this service. At so early an hour, and on premises so apparently unguarded, was it possible that I should entertain any suspicion as to the honesty of the transaction? A man (of whom I declare myself ignorant) meets me in the street - engages me to carry an article for him for a mile or so, and promises an adequate reward. I received the piece of cloth, and so firmly was I convinced of the honesty of the procedure, that even at the moment of apprehension I was fearless of any consequences injurious to myself. I had only two or three days before quitted a situation. I had been on that and the preceding day among my acquaintances, in the hope that I might gain early intimation of another. Perhaps on that unfortunate evening my friends might have induced me to partake of more than was consistent with propiety.</p>

            . I am an attorney. On the 19th January, about half-past seven o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner, in company with another lad, looking through the window of a house in the Curtain-road - it is a kind of broker's shop - I stopped nearly a quarter of an hour on the opposite side of the way, behind a timber carriage, till about a quarter past eight. I saw their hands repeatedly at the window, as if they were marking the window with their fingers, in the same direction as it was afterwards cut. I suppose they went to the window twenty times; if they saw a person approach, they walked away. I saw another person join them two or three times, but he did not stay with them. About a quarter past eight, I saw the boy who was with the prisoner, go away - he ran up the Curtain-road - I went in pursuit of him, and met the prisoner at the bar standing by an alley, near the shop window - I passed the alley, and then returned, and took the prisoner: I am certain of his person. Taylor had been watching with me; he passed the window two or three times, and had a good opportunity of seeing them. I gave the prisoner to Taylor, and went in pursuit of the other down the alley, but I lost him. I came round to the prosecutor's house, and found the prisoner there, and a number of other persons - he was charged with a robbery, and was endeavouring to conceal his hands. I took hold of his hands, and found one of his fingers cut, and the blood running down his finger - I asked him how it was done; he said, he had cut it with a knife. Some person asked him, where the knife was; he said, he had left it at a public-house, in the opposite corner of the alley.</p>

            . I have heard Gray's evidence; it is all correct. I passed the prisoner several times, and saw him very clearly - I saw him with his hand in the window: I went over to Gray, and told him; a boy then went over and interrupted them. Two of them then made off, and the prisoner went into a court. Mr. Gray took the prisoner, and gave him to me; I took him to the shop: he said, he had cut his hand with a knife, which he had left in the public-house twenty minutes before - he afterwards admitted, that he had cut his finger with the glass.</p>

            . I am a headborough. About half-past eight o'clock on the evening of the 19th of January, I was sent for, and went to the house with the prosecutor. I found the prisoner there with Gray and Taylor. I took him into the parlour, and said, "You have got into a fine mess;" "Yes," he said, "I have; but, if you will not take me to Worship-street, I will take you to where the candlesticks are, and you shall have all the property returned." I then tied his hands, and took him to the watch-house - he then begged very hard to go with me, but I would not let him. I said, if he would tell me the number, I would go - he said, "I know why you won't let me go; you are afraid of a rescue."</p>

            . I am the wife of William Townley. On the 19th of January, I placed a candle and a candlestick upon a fender in the shop window. There were six pairs of brass candlesticks there, beside one odd one, two pairs of snuffers, and two trays: the glass of the window was quite whole at that time. I left the shop, and went down into the kitchen, leaving no one in the shop. I returned about a quarter past seven o'clock, or not quite so late, - I went to snuff the candles, and did not then observe any thing wrong or missing. I heard a knock at the shop door, between eight and a quarter past eight o'clock. I went up, and Mr. Taylor brought the prisoner in, and told me to take charge of him, as he had been robbing my window. He did not say any thing - I went and looked at the window; it was cut in two places: three pair of brass candlesticks were taken out, and an odd one; also one pair of snuffers and one tray: they were my husband's property.</p>

About four o'clock in the afternoon of the 11th of February, I was in my shop, and saw the prisoner Leslie go into that house without any thing: he came out, in about ten minutes, with two bundles. I did not see any body ele with him, nor any one join him. I had before that seen a young man go in, dressed in blue, but I could not swear to him.</p>

I answered it, and a young man passed me, dressed in blue: he ran up stairs to the first floor back room; I do not know who he was; he knocked at the room door once or twice, but got no answer; he then ran down stairs, and I called to him and said, "If you please, Sir, have you any message;" he said, "I have no message, I will call again, bye and bye." I did not then know who lived in that room; but I have since heard, it was his father and mother. He went away; I heard the street door shut after him. As he was a stranger to me, I went down, and tried the street door: it was shut safe - Mrs. Hill's parlour door appeared to me to be all safe - I did not try it. I then went to my own room, which is up three pair of stairs - I did not come down again for an hour, when I came down with some dust, I then saw the street door open; I went to shut it, but I saw Mrs. Hill's parlour door open - I did not observe whether it had been forced open; I did no go in, but gave an alarm.</p>

I was at Mr. Grice's shop about half-past three or four o'clock on Friday, the 11th of February, and saw a young man in blue go into No. 7; and, in about ten minutes, I saw a man of colour come out with two bundles on his shoulders; one bundle in a white wrapper, and the other in a yellow handkerchief: I then went out of the shop by the street door, and saw somebody who appeared to be the same young man, in blue going on before the man of colour - I watched them, and the one dressed in blue turned into the hair-dresser's; the other went to the bottom of Eagle-street, and turned into Red Lion-street - I do not know who the person in blue was, but believe it to be Eddy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. What do you mean by swearing, you believe it to be the prisoner? A. Because I saw him go into the house - I saw him again the next day. I was not told I should see him: it was between half-past three and four o'clock. I have lived in the neighbourhood some time; I have seen the prisoners before; they did not go together now in the street - the one in blue had nothing in his hand. I attended the Magistrates the next day, and another examination in the same week.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESSWELL. Q. Did you see the man of colour go into the house? A. I saw him come out - I swear he is the person; I have seen him before.</p>
               <p>BEATRICE HATTERSLEY re-examined. Q. You say you heard the knock, and a young man, in blue, came in, and passed you in the passage - can you tell who it was? A. I did not know him then, and did not see him when he came down; I only called to him. I am sure the person I saw at Hatton-garden is the person who entered the house. I went to Hatton-garden last Wednesday week. I am quite sure he is the same person - I marked him particularly, being a stranger.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. At the time you shut the door after him, did you not say that all was quite safe? A. Yes; it appeared so to me; it was an hour after when I came down with the dust, and saw the door open.</p>

            . I live at No. 6, Red Lion-yard, and am a shoemaker. I have seen Leslie three or four years ago; I have entrusted him with bundles many times, to carry for me, which he delivered right, and returned me the money - he has been a servant.</p>
               <p>Prisoner LESLIE. I was in company with this witness from two o'clock on that day till half-past five o'clock - I never was in the house that I was taken before in all my life.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MEREFIELD re-examined. Q. On the 11th of February were you in company with Leslie? A. Yes, at the sign of the Griffin, at two o'clock - he was there when I went in; I stopped there till a quarter before five.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner stop all that time? A. He did go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170089"/>out two or three times, but was not absent five minutes each time. I looked at the clock when I came away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you employ him to carry a bundle for you? A. Yes; he was to carry it to Portpool-lane; I gave him 6 d. to carry it - it was tied in this handkerchief - I left him in the public-house when I went away: he was to deliver the bundle to Mr. Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he deliver it? A. Yes, he did deliver it at the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other persons drinking in the room besides him? A. Yes; three or four persons who I know, and have seen before, because I work for the house.</p>
               <p>JAMES GRICE re-examined. Q. What was the colour of the bundles you saw? A. I did not observe them particularly - they appeared light.</p>
               <p>SARAH ANSLY re-examined. Q. Did you notice the bundles particularly? A. Yes; one was yellow, and one was white.</p>
               <p>Prisoner LESLIE. Most of the men that use that house were hackney coachmen, and have to work for their bread - they cannot be here two days running. Mrs. Hill has women of the town lodging in her house.</p>
               <p>MRS. HILL re-examined. Q. What was the value of all your things? A. About 4 l.; that is a low and moderate value.</p>
               <p>JURY to GRICE. Q. Can you swear to Leslie being the man who came out of the house? A. Yes; I have known him before - it was about four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

I did not know of his going; there were some wages due to him, but he did not apply for them; he was brought back on the Sunday following. I have an iron safe where I keep books, papers, and a cash box: it is on the right-hand side of my desk in the front parlour. Young was to bring me the key of that iron safe to my room on the first floor, when the office was closed. I was at home on the 37th of January, till five o'clock; then went to the theatre: I returned, and found the key in the back room first floor, on the table, which was its proper place. Next morning, about nine o'clock, I gave it to my female servant, to take it down to my clerk; - soon after this, my cash-box was brought up to me by Anely, my clerk; it was broken open, and all the coin taken out of it. I can swear there were five sovereigns in it, which I put in immediately before I went out on the previous evening. The box was then perfect; I locked it, and kept the key of it: there was a piece of gold coin in it the evening before, called a Louis d'or; it was gone in the morning; the prisoner was brought to me on the Sunday following.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you not seen the prisoner's father before this - he was brought to you? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not promised, that if the Louis d'or were brought back, you would not prosecute him? A. No; his father brought him to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did no one in the boy's presence promise him that if the Louis d'or were brought back, he should not be prosecuted - or was any thing said, that if there was a confession made, he should not be prosecuted? A. No; I had not called on his father, nor did I send my brother to his father's house: I sent him with the officer to make a general search for the boy, and very likely he went to the father.</p>

I would not prosecute him: I said I would use my influence with my brother not to prosecute to death. I will be on my oath that I never said, if a confession was made he should not be prosecuted.</p>
               <p>JAMES WILLEY re-examined. Q. What did you first say to him? - A. I asked him what could induce him to break open my cash-box? He said he was led on to it by another boy, and if I would go with him, he would point him out; and that he had not only some of the money upon him, but he had the Louis d'or. I desired him to wait till I sent for an officer; he did so, and the officer took him.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you any other person in the house to entrust with the locking up of your safe? A. Only during office hours. My clerk is a person of much more experience than the prisoner. My brother does not live with me; - the prisoner had lived two months and a day with me; - I told his father it was a very sad thing that his boy should be guilty of such a thing: he said he hoped I should be merciful; - I said, I would consider of it.</p>
               <p>JOHN WILLEY re-examined. I live at Canonbury; - I assist my brother in his business, but at night I leave. On Thursday, the 27th of January, about a quarter past 7 o'clock I put one sovereign, nine half-crowns, twenty-seven shillings, and nine-pence in half-pence, in a bag in the desk. I had an office there, at the back, in which there was a comb and a knife. There are three rooms at my brother's house, and the middle room is my office. The knife was on the desk, and the comb in the drawer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know a lady named Capel? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say to the father at any time before the boy was taken up, that if the Louis d'or was returned you would not prosecute? A. No, I did not promise that if the father found the property, he should not be prosecuted.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the night of the 30th of January I went to Mr. Willey's, to take charge of the prisoner Young; and from the desk or table in the office, I took some silver, which amounted to 21 s. 6 d., and a comb. The prisoner Young had put it on the table before I got there; Mr. Willey said so in his presence. I took the knife from Mrs. Willey. In consequence of information, I went to take up the prisoner Hoyle - I found him in a street near Newport-market; I think Porter-street - I found on him a sovereign and a louis-d'or - he did not say how he came by them - he said he had given a boy, named Hobbs, three sovereigns to take back to the gentleman - he perfectly understood what I took him for - he had been talking about it before. When I first went, he said, "I did not persuade Young to do it. I gave that boy the money to take back to the gentleman." I took the money from the boy (Hobbs), who was standing by at the time.</p>

            . I am fifteen years of age and live in Two Star-court, Broad-street, St. Giles. My father is a bricklayer - I know the two prisoners - on the last Sunday in January, I saw Young between seven and eight o'clock in the evening; he was with Hoyle in Lacell's-place, as I had heard of Young being in trouble, and he was taken into my house - his father was sent for, and he told his father not to be afraid, as he would go down to his master with him, and that James Hoyle had 6 l. of the money. Hoyle had been sent away - he went when my mother went out, and brought Young in. My father, Mr. Young, the boy, and Mrs. Young, I believe, went to the master's. I then took a walk down Drury-lane, and saw Hoyle standing against a door. I said, if he had any money, it would be better for him to go and give it up. He then gave me two sovereigns, and a Napoleon, as he called it. I told him Young had gone with his father and my father to his master. I did not tell him what Young had said - I told him, if he had any money, to go and deliver it up, and then he gave me those three pieces of gold. I kept them in my hand, thinking to go to his master; but when the officer came, I gave it to him - we were then talking at the corner of Porter-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESSWELL. Q. Are you certain the boy gave you the Napoleon? A. I gave it to Lead bitter. Hoyle said, next morning he would go and get the rest.</p>
               <p>HOYLE'S Defence. I did not persuade James Young to commit the robbery. I did not know that he had done it. Four witnesses gave the prisoner Young an excellent character.</p>
