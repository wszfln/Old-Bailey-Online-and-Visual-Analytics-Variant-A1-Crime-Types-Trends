Bayard"—the first delivery was seven cases on 19th June, twenty cases on 17th July, ten on 7th August, ten on 18th Septem<lb/>ber, ten on 27th September, ten on 17th October, and ten on 1st November—each delivery, from 7th August to 1st November was to Weeks' cart.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 64, Deacon Street, Walworth—I keep a tobacconist's shop, which my wife manages—at the beginning of 1873, in consequence of an advertisement in the paper I went to Mr. Meiter's place in Gracechurch Street, and bought some pouches; I paid Otway for them—after that I went there frequently, and purchased goods nearly every day, I could not swear to particular dates—I paid money on the three invoices produced, and the person I paid receipted them—in the early part of this year I received a communication from Mr. Meiter, in consequence of which I handed to him a large number of invoices.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> When you received the money you have many times been serving other customers, and I have often looked out things for myself—I always paid at the time or next morning—I never had anything to drink with any of the men—I have sometimes been there just at closing time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Meiter—we were away in the North last year for some time; but we were back at inter<lb/>vals for a day, and then away again—we were both more or less in town during October, November, and December last—when money was paid over the counter to the prisoner it was his duty to account to me at night for it, and pay it to me; occasionally it would go for two days, even if I happened to be there—in my absence he would keep the money as long as three, four, or five days, and at the expiration of that time he would hand it to me—I may, on one or two occasions, have been away seven days, then home for one and back again—this is the daily cash-book, and the totals are made up in my writing nearly every day, and by this I can tell when I was in town—the 4th October was a Saturday, the cash was not made up on that day; the first time it was made up after the 4th was on the 15th, on that day he paid over the balance of those thirteen days, from the 4th to the 15th inclusive—he would probably have handed over to me 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of a night, so as to reduce the amount in his box, and on the 15th it was finally balanced—I was probably there between the 4th and 15th—I am sure I received some money in that interval, because the total amount taken in that time would be so large that I should never allow such a sum to accumulate in his box—the total receipts on the 15th, I see, was 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., including the accumulation of overs during that period, which amounted to 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the first time after the 11th November that he</p>

               <p>accounted to me was on the 22nd, he then paid me 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., of which 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is booked as the accumulation of overs from the 4th; and the first time after 8th December was the 17th, I think that would be from the 1st—he had a desk and key, with money bowls, and a box to put the gold in; when he effected a sale and received the money he should enter it in this book—it was his duty to enter all the money he received, with the exception of small sums under a shilling, and at the end of the day those small sums would accumulate, which we call "overs"—those overs were a constant source of grief between him and me; I always blamed him for the overs amounting to so large a sum, and told him the sales should be more carefully entered; with regard to such large sums as those in the indict<lb/>ment they should have been entered at once; nothing but gross careless<lb/>ness, or worse, could have prevented their being entered—these are the dates relating to the other invoices: after the 16th June the accounts were made up on the 17th; after the 15th August, on the 26th; after 29th September, on 1st October; after 17th November, on the 22nd; and after 24th November, on 1st December.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> When you handed me over money I gave you a little ticket for the amount, and you initialled it, and when I balanced with you that was considered a voucher for the cash—you had your money-box to keep those tickets in, and the key was in your own possession—I do not recollect omitting to give you a ticket on any occasion, or making a mistake about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I gave you to pay petty accounts, and deducting it from the "overs," making you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. short—I see here is an entry of 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on 22nd November, altered to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I cannot say at this distance of time whether that refers to the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you speak of—we had such trust and confidence in you that, before we discovered this, we were discussing the propriety of taking a shop at the West End, and putting you in sole charge.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I paid over the money that I received in all cases, and put it in the box. I was busily engaged with other customers while serving Mr. Treenham, that was why the money was not entered. Sometimes I have been engaged serving three or four customers at a time. Next door but one there was another India rubber shop, and if customers were not served immediately they would go there. I placed the money in the till, and when I was at liberty I entered it. I am sorry to say I have sometimes omitted to enter things, and they have sometimes amounted to more than double the amount of the overs. I have in no case taken any money. I have not robbed my masters of any money since I have been in their employ. I was under very great disadvantage in having shopmen about me who were given to drink, and I have been reprimanded by Mr. Meiter for not speaking of their misdeeds, but no complaint was ever made against' me for drinking.</p>

On 23rd January I was instructed b Sergeant Fluister to watch Peck and Outram—I continued to watch them till 4th February—I was with Hunt and Fluister when Peck was taken into custody—I took him to Mr. Biggs' shop—on the way there he said to Mr. Smith, "I admit that I have taken about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth out of stock instead of charging you overtime"—he was asked if he had anything at home; he said "Yes, I have two coats and a pair of leggings"—he said something about Otway—I went to his lodging, and found two coats and two pairs of leggings, and several elastic bands—at the station he was asked how he accounted for the possession of those coats, and he said "I will answer that to-morrow."</p>

               <p>five persons employed in my office—I don't remember the exact words the prisoner used when he was challenged—he said "All I can say now in the hurry of the moment and the suddenness of the charge, is that I thought Jackson had a debt due to him of about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and I think I understood him to say that he had promised to get it for him—whether he said that or not, he said he obtained it, got that 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—he afterward found out that Mr. Bingley had paid the debt due to Jackson, and found it was not due—I could hardly understand his explanation afterwards—I did not understand that he had mislaid the cheque, only that after he got the cheque he found that Jackson had been paid—he did not say at that time that he was ready and willing to pay any funds that were found deficient, but he has since written to me to that effect—I do not say it was im<lb/>possible in a long case like this not to have mistakes made, but probable—the Rent Guarantee Society made a mistake—the prisoner has been in my employ nine years.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 28, St. George's Place, Knightsbridge, and am a fancy wool dealer—I know the prisoner under the name of the Countess De Bar—I first saw her on 27th January, 1873—she called at my shop then, and asked for some sacred Catholic pictures, large ones, I only kept small ones in stock, and she asked me if I could get some large ones and send them on approval; I did so, and the Countess was out—she gave the address 137, Eagle Place, Brompton Road—this is my bill, it came to about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went to Brompton Road the next day to see what pictures she had selected—she said "I am a foreigner in this country, I am going to take a place near here"—she told me she had a brother in Spain, and large tin mines in Spain, and she had a ship load lying in the docks—she asked me if I could recommend her a broker to sell them, and I told her to inquire of the trades people round and no doubt some one would tell her—I asked her to give me a pen and ink and paper to make out my bill for the goods selected—she said "You need not do that, as I require a pound of knitting and crochet cotton, and send the bill the next day,"The message came back that the Countess was out, and would I leave the goods, and that her ladyship would call on the morrow or send, and on the morrow I received a letter which is in Court, to the effect would I call at once, her ladyship wanted to see me—I called on the 29th, and she said "I have decided and taken a house in Queens borough Place," she was going to enter the house on the 25th March, and could I recommend</p>

               <p>her some servants—I think it was four in all I was asked about, a cook and page boy and someone else; it was not a maid, because she said she would get a maid straight from Paris—she did not tell me the number of the house—she gave me some curtain orders and sixty-eight yards of curtain bordering, and said she wanted them sent as soon as possible, and I said I could not execute the order as I did not know the number of the house; she sent back a message to say when she got into the house it would be then time enough for the curtains—I saw Mr. Douglas afterwards and found she had not taken the house—I believed her statement that she had taken a house—I asked her to pay ray bill when she gave me the order on the 29th—she said "I require a great many goods, I don't take trouble with small bills, and I prefer paying you when the order is executed"—she wanted a gilt cheval screen and some arm chairs—the amount of the order altogether was 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and with the expenses in the County Court and all it would be about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I sent her the sacred pictures and some frames and oil paints to paint the pictures with—she told me about the mines in the first place—I did not supply her with any goods after the statement about the house—she mentioned the tin mines on the 28th—on the nest day, the 29th, she told me she had taken the house—the amount of the whole order, if I had executed it, would have been about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I got it in hand and partly finished—none of the goods were supplied before she mentioned the tin mines and before she mentioned the house in Queens borough Place—I had left the pictures for her approval—I think it was about the 9th March I went to Queens borough Place—all the goods had not been supplied at that time—the last goods were sent in on 11th March—I thought there must have been some mistake so I let the goods go—I afterwards summoned the prisoner and her husband to the County Court—the Countess appeared and her solicitor, Mr. Crook—I made a statement to the judge about the tin mines, and how she had deceived me—she was present, and she said she was alone responsible for paying my bill, and I should have it the following month; and I said "How can I rely upon this lady's word, she may be gone out of the country"—she said at the County Court that she had made a mistake, the ship load of tin had not arrived—I asked her if she would return my goods if the judge would grant it—she did not return the goods, and I have never been paid the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 55, Bird Street, West Square, Lambeth, and am a cellarman—on Saturday afternoon, 14th February, I was in York Road, Lambeth, and saw the prisoner coming out of the Sun public-house, followed by the prosecutor and a black man, who had the prosecutor's coat in his hand, and was irritating him to attack the prisoner, and a man with the prisoner put his left hand up and said "Go away, we don't want any <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with you"—that was his uncle—the prosecutor <hi rend="italic">squared</hi> up to the prisoner, who stood with a pipe in his mouth and his hands in his pockets—the prisoner then ran away, followed by Harmsworth and the black man, who overtook him at the fourth door from the Sun, and pitched into him, and they had a fight up against the railings, striking each other—a white-whiskered gentleman came up and parted them, and said to Harmsworth "You ought to be ashamed of yourself to use a young man like that"—the prisoner run away again, followed by Harms-worth and the black man—they had a tussle against the railings at the corner of Sutton Street, and I saw blood streaming down Harmsworth's head—some some one then said "He has got a knife"—the prisoner said that he had not—a constable came up in three or four minutes, and a gentleman at the back of the crowd handed him this knife, saying "Here is a knife I have picked up on the pavement—it was shut—the prisoner said that he had no knife.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have seen the prisoner's uncle here to-day—the prisoner did everything he could to avoid the attack; it was the most brutal attack I ever saw, otherwise I should not have wasted my time to come here—when he was struck he had his hands in his pockets—his pipe was not knocked out of his mouth, he took it out and put it into his pocket—I am certain no open knife was used, I must have seen it if there had been, and should have been the first to have rushed forward to take it from him—I did not examine it—the black man goes by the name of "Snipe," he has dancing dogs, he is a fighting man—Harms-worth was drunk, but the prisoner was sober—I saw Harmsworth about on the Tuesday night, outside the Strand Theatre at 11.35—I spoke to him at the corner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The wounds were very trivial, but a wound on the head may produce erysipelas if a man is out of health—the three posterior wounds were superficial, but the two anterior ones were more like stabs—the closed knife scraped along the head would not cause the marks I saw, because the wounds would then be parallel to one another, and sepa<lb/>rated—you might be able to make a scratch with the outside of the knife, but the anterior wounds were deeper, and could not be done so—there was no blood on the knife when I saw it at the station, but wounds of this nature might be produced without there being any blood on the blade; if the knife is drawn sharply through the integuments the blood does not always remain on it, but when the knife remains in it does—after I had dressed the wounds he walked away, and was taken home by the constable—he was drunk—he came again as an out-patient.</p>

I was going away, this man pulls off his coat and comes up and hit me. I wanted to get away and went some distance. He followed and got bold of me and I got up against the railings with him. We had a bit of a struggle there. He tried to throw me down. I got hold of the railings to save myself. His head was not even under my arm.

I told him I knew nothing at all about it, and I mentioned two persons names who I was almost sure had done it, because I heard them say they were going to do it, and I saw them outside the shop at 1.30 on Sunday morning, and Buckley saw them as well.
