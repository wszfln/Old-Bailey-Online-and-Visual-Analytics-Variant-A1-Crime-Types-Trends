On the 15th of January, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, the two prisoners came to my house, with a man named 
               <persName id="t18170219-1-person67">

            , they said they had some business to settle belonging to the society, and requested the box; I asked them what they wanted with the box, they said it was to settle some business of the society. Kirby was <rs id="t18170219-1-deflabel5" type="occupation">clerk to the society</rs>

I asked him if he had the keys-there were three locks to the box, the prisoner, Kirby, kept one, and the two stewards the other two; Kirby said, he had got them. I brought the box, and gave it them; they had some liquor to drink after they had the box. Kirby and Orford said, they would take the books with them, and that they would not stay long. In about ten minutes time I saw the prisoners come down stairs, and go out at the private door - They did not tell me they were going away, which raised my suspicion; I went up to the room where the box was and found it broken open (producing it), before I gave it them there were 7l. in bank-notes, and 2l. 16s. in silver, and three account books in it, the money and books were gone; I saw Orford about ten minutes after. The prisoners were taken into custody about three weeks after. I made enquiry for them, but could not find them. When they were apprehended Kirby said, he had broken open the box, and took the money, but that it could not be helped now, he did not expect it would have gone so far as it had done. Strew said, he thought it could be made up, and that he would sell even the bed that he lay upon to make it up. I told him the law must take its course. Strew blamed Kirby for leading him into such an error, and said, it was the first trouble that ever he got into. Kirby laughed, and said, we have got into it now, and must get out of it as well as we can. The box has three different keys, Kirby said, he had all of them, but he had but one, as the box was broken open. I found a chisel by the box-it was mine, I believe it was in the room before they came. An officer apprehended them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner KIRBY. Q. What security did you give for the money - A.Only my own word.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BARRY. I am a tailor. In consequence of a direction that I got from Cameron, I went to look after the prisoners; on the evening of the 15th of January, I found them at the Ship and Shovel public-house, in St. Thomas's-street, in the Borough, drinking punch; the prisoner, Strew, handed me a glass. I told him I supposed he knew the business that I came upon. I had another person with me. Strew said, yes, he knew it; and that they had got the money, and we might do our best. They used very abusive language. I left them and went home. They both followed me out, and Strew trod on my toe three times. They were both apprehended the day after last sessinos. When Strew was taken to Kirby, he hung down his head, and said, "Oh Sam! how could you bring me into this dilemma." Strew asked if he could be bailed, or if he could not make the matter up; and said he would sell his bed and all that he had, to make it up; we told him the law must take its course. I did not take an officer with me the first time. I went to where Strew worked, and found him at his usual place.</p>

            . I am a steward of the society; we meet at Cameron's house; the prisoners had no business with either the books or money, at that time of the day; there were regular meetings on the Tuesday night, when the business was transacted. The two stewards have each a key, and Kirby, who was clerk, had also a key. My lock is now locked. The last witness has spoken correctly.</p>
               <p>KIRBY'S Defence. It was considered by part of the society, that the matters were not conducted properly, about twelve proposed that I and Orford should take the money, and we took it for them. The society consisted of about forty members.</p>

The man resembled the prisoner, he stopped my horse, and presented a pistol to me, and demanded my money. I got off my horse immediately, as I was afraid he would fire at me-he was on foot; I gave him six shillings, and said, you shall have what I have got; it was one 3s. and two 1s. 6d. bank tokens, I had nothing else about me; there were people passing by at the time. I caught hold of the man and got him down; the people were coming towards me at the time I gave him the money. I seized him, got him down, and called for assistance, the people went on the road, and another man came and pulled me off the person to whom I had given the money; the pistol was a dark kind of a barrel-it was not a bright one; the man was talking to the people that were going by, in an abusive way, I took him to be an Irishman, by his voice. I saw the prisoner at Bow-Street, three days after the robbery, I heard him talking there, and it appeard to me to be the same voice as the man that stopped me - I will not swear to his voice, it, was like it. The man left me immediately he had robbed me, and did not speak afterwards. I should not know my money again. He went towards Southgate, and the man that pulled me off him, went after him; they were both Irishmen.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On Friday evening, the 14th of January, I, in company with Edwards and Shiers, was going over Ball's-pond common, a man came up to me. In consequence of information that he gave me, I went down to the turnpike at the end of the common, it was near six o'clock, and made enquiry about the robbers. I laid hold of the prisoner on one side and Edwards took hold of him on the other-it was on the common. I rubbed him down, and Edwards took a pistol from him. It was as near six o'clock as possible. The place where we found the prisoner is about a mile from where the prosecutor was robbed, it is between the place where the robbery was committed and Southgate, and in the road to Southgate. As we were taking him to the public-house, Shiers was with us, a man called out, there is the other man; Edwards and Shiers went after him, and left me alone with the prisoner - He asked me what I was going to do with him? I told him I was going to give him a pot of porter; he said he would go no further, and began to make a very desperate resistance; he laid hold of my private parts once or twice, and endeavoured to throw me on my back, but I was too strong for him; he then tried to get my cutlass out, which was buttoned in my coat; I called my brother officers back, and we secured him and took him to the public-house. In searching him, I found one 3s. and two 1s. 6d. tokens in his waistcoat pocket, I think it was his left hand waistcoat pocket. I found a bag of gunpowder upon him, and about thirteen or fourteen slugs in it - He had no silver about him but the tokens. I told him that I took him on suspicion of a footpad robbery. When we laid hold of him, before he attempted to escape, I told him I was an officer, and wanted to see if he had a pistol about him, When I found the pistol, I told him he must go with me, as I believed him to be the man who had committed the robbery, and that I had heard of a footpad robbery. He was secured. The prisoner told me that he lived in Whitechapel; I knew, by his voice, that he was an Irishman. He was coming in a direct road from the place where the robbery was committed - He was coming from Southgate.</p>
               <p>EDWARDS. I am a Bow-street patrol, and was with Upton on the 14th of January, and assisted him in taking the prisoner, it was a little before six o'clock. While Upton and I were at the turnpike, inquiring about the robbery, I observed the prisoner go through the gate, he was coming from Southgate; we followed him, Upton and I laid hold of him, and found the pistol in his right hand, with the muzzle up the sleeve of his great coat; I was on his right hand, the butt end was in his hand, I took it from him, and told Upton to hold him, for I had found the pistol. We were taking him to the public-house, when we were told that the other man was walking by the side of a turnip cart; Upton said he should be safe with the prisoner, if we left him; when we had got about a hundred yards, I heard Upton call for assistance, we returned to him, and found the prisoner fighting, with him. The pistol was loaded and primed, I took the priming out(producing it). I accompanied Upton, with the prisoner, to the Green Man, Ball's-pound; the prisoner was searched, and a 3s. and two 1s. 6d. bank tokens, found upon him, also a knife, and a few halfpence. I do not know where the tokens were. There was a bag of shot and gunpowder found upon him - I saw Upton take it from him-there were slugs in it to fit the pistol. He had no other money about him. The place where we took the prisoner is nearly a mile from where the robbery was committed. The prisoner is an Irishman, by his dialect. He was dressed as he is now, except his handkerchief, which was a dark one.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street, and assisted Upton and Edwards in taking the prisoner; the account they have given is correct. I held the prisoner's hands while the tokens were taken from him, they were in his right hand waistcoat pocket. He was dressed as he is now, except his handkerchief, which was dark.</p>
               <p>WM. SIMMONS re-examined. Q. When the tokens were taken from you, did you observe where the man put them - A. I rather think he put them in his waistcoat pocket, he put them in as soon as I gave them to him I-remember seeing him do it. I believe I gave them into his right hand, the pistol was in his left hand; I do not know which waistcoat pocket he put them in; he appeared to me to put them into the same side pocket as the hand he took them with. I am sure the pistol was in his left hand, he held it in his left hand when he presented at me, and kept it in the same hand. I did not notice his handkerchief. He appeared to be dressed as he is now, with three or four garments on. He had dark clothes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence, When they took me, they asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190005"/>me who was with me, I did not tell them till I was in the House of Correction two or three days, I then told them, and they took some of the same party.</p>
               <p>SHIERS. There were no promises held out to him. I saw him in the House of Correction, he told me if I would take him before a magistrate, he would tell the whole truth about the robberies he had committed; he communicated the name of a man to the magistrate, and we apprehended him-it was for another robbery; no person besides the prisoner, was taken up for robbing Mr. Simmons.</p>

            . I am a patrol of St. Paul, Shadwell; I was on duty, the 24th of January, near Miss Jacks's house, about one hundred and fifty yards from it; as I was calling the hour of three, she called out of her window to me - I went to see what was the matter; I then went to the place where I thought the persons must have got in, I placed myself there, and called to

             to come to my assistance - He came, and I placed him at the other corner; he called to me, and said, there was a man who would assist us; I went up to him, and saw the prisoner, Ferguson, just by Blake, I told him to secure him, and he did. Before he was taken away I searched him on the spot, and took a pair of scissars from his jacket pocket, I delivered them to Morris on the Monday following, I kept them safe untill I gave them to him. We went to look at the premises, and searched Miss Jacks's house, and found the tiles taken off, and the laths cut away, leaving room for a man to get in. We found a hole leading to the privy of the adjoining house, I went down the hole and found the prisoner, Cotton, in the adjoining house-it was not Taverner's house. I endeavoured to take him to the watch-house, but on the road he slipped his arms out of his jacket, and ran away, leaving his jacket in my hands, I called out stop thief! Tuck found him and brought him to the watch-house; I searched his jacket, and found a tinder-box and steel, a candle, some halfpence and farthings. I found nothing more in his other clothes. The place where I first saw Cotton was about sixty yards from Taverner's, there are several houses between, we traced them from Jacks's premises to Taverner's house. We found a stocking, and another pair of scissars, in the place where we found Cotton, in the shed, which is above the hole that leads into the privy; and in another part of the shed where we found him, there was a shirt and a stockings, which appeared to be the fellow stocking to that which I had found. We went to look at Taverner's premises the next day, he was with me at the back part of his premises; the tiling was broken through large enough for a man to get through, it leads into a room adjoining his bar. I delivered the scissars, stockings, and shirt to Morris. No person claimed the last pair of scissars. I found copper upon both of them.</p>

I went to bed about half-past twelve o'clock on the 26th of January, and got up at half-past six, came down and found the stone bottle removed, and the cork taken out-it was empty, it was not empty the overnight. There were three pints of gin in a green bottle gone; I missed a pair of scissars out of the kitchen, which I had seen safe the overnight; I also missed a pair of worsted stockings off the horse by the kitchen fire, and a quartern loaf off the table in the kitchen, it was there the night before I am sure, I missed it about ten minutes after I came down; six tiles were removed from the washhouse roof, over the water butt, there appeared room enough for a man to get through, the laths were cut at one end and broken at the other, I am sure it was safe the overnight. The wash-house joins my dwelling-house, the tap-room door comes into it; there is a street behind the wash-house, a person could get to the top of the washhouse from the back street, the roof is about seven feet from the ground. Stephens looked at it with me afterwards. I saw my things on the Monday after the Saturday that I was robbed. I saw a pair of stockings and a pair of scissars, they are my property. I knew the scissars as well as the stockings. I found my green bottle under the water butt, the gin was in it; I am sure it was in my bar when I went to bed. I also lost a candle and some farthings, which were in a till in the bar, which I keep on purpose for them.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM HEMBREY. On the 26th of January, I left Holborn about five minutes after eight o'clock in the evening. I went into King-street, Drury-lane, and the moment I got into <placeName id="t18170219-4-crimeloc26">King-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18170219-4-crimeloc26" type="placeName" value="King-street"/>

                        targets="t18170219-4-off24 t18170219-4-crimeloc26"/>, three or four men met me, some were behind and some before, they came against me and hustled me down; as I fell one of them struck me a violent blow on my chest; the moment they got me down, they put their hands before my mouth - I could not make any neise. This was about a quarter after eight o'clock, as near as it could be, they held both my arms and feet; I found my watch, ribbon, two seals, and about 20s. in silver, were gone. I felt my watch go from me, and felt a hand in my breeches pocket, where my silver was; they did not hold me down more than a minute and a half; it was just under a lamp. They held my cheek-hones quite tight, but did not close my eyes; I noticed them, and the prisoner, Davis, was the first that caught me by the throat, I observed his dress, it was as it is now; the prisoner, Hill, was holding me while I was being robbed. I saw those two in particular. I am sure Hill is the man, he was dressed in black; there was also a man of the name Fox, who has escaped. I only saw three men. Just as they were taking my watch, one of them called out,"Mary," with a low voice; the prisoner, Lowe came, stooped down, and then ran away with them. I am positive it was her. I did not see Daws. They all ran away but the prisoner, Davis, he kept his knee on my chest, and stopped my mouth. He ran away, and as soon as I could make a noise, I called out that I had lost my property; the watchman was about twenty yards off, he took Daws as he was running from me; some people came out and took me into a house; I was very much hurt with the blows that I had received; the watchman pursued the prisoners, and took three of them, he came from the watch-house, and asked me if I should know them; I was rather better, and described them to him, but I was not well enough to go to look at them. I went home in a coach. I was so ill the next day that I could not go to Marlborough-street. I described the woman to the watchman the next morning, and he took her. I was robbed on Sunday, the 26th, and went to the office on the Monday week after, and saw the four prisoners in custody, I then perfectly recollected the three that I have spoken to. I am sure Hill was one of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I had been to the Castle Inn, Holborn, I did not stop there five minutes, and was going home; I live in the Westminster-road. King-street is near the end of Drury-lane. It was about a quarter after eight, I left the Castle five minutes before eight o'clock, it could not be more than that; the Castle is about half a mile from St. Giles's church - I walked by myself all the way. I had not seen either of the prisoners before; it was a tall man, with a great coat on, that made his escape, he must have been six feet high - I described him to the watchman. I did not see the prisoners again till eight days after. Crawley came and told me that the men were apprehended the same night. The officer did not tell me that Hill was dressed in black. Nobody was passing at the time, but on my crying out some people came up.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 26th of January, I was going my rounds, I had just called eight o'clock; when Mr. Hembrey was attacked, I was coming back, at about the middle of my beat, which is Cross-lane, one end of which goes into Parker's-street, and the other end into Newton-street, which leads into Holborn: there is a passage in Cross-lane, that comes out of King-street; I saw the prisoner, Daws, and a sailor, running in great haste down the passage, out of King-street, I am not quite sure that it was Daws; there are three steps which come down into Cross-lane, when they came down the steps. I was within two yards of them - I knew Daws before. After they had passed me I heard somebody call out, "I have been robbed, I have lost my watch!" as I was going towards King-street, I turned round, and followed them into the Coach and Horses, in Charles-street; as soon as they went into the house I sprung my rattle, when Crawley and the private watchman came to my assistance; we went into the back parlour and found Daws there-the sailor was not with him; I gave him into Crawley's custody, and went back towards King-street to look for the prosecutor, I found him in a chair in the street, he was very much hurt, and could hardly speak - We took him into a shop; I asked him, if he should know either of them, and if one was a sailor? he described the sailor to me as being dressed in a sailor's blue jacket and trowsers; he only described one of them to me them. About an hour afterwards we took Davis from the same house (the Coach and Horses). I secured him in the watch-house, and went back to the prosecutor, he had a surgeon with him, and was sent home in a coach. I went to his house the next day, he was not able to attend, and the prisoners were detained. I took

            . I am a watchman; I heard the rattle spring, and was with Trimbey when he took Daws, nobody else was in the room; we went to the prosecutor the next morning, and he described Lowe to us, from his description I went to her lodging - She was not at home, we found her and took her; I had taken Daws on the Sunday night, about eight o'clock. As we were taking him to the watch-house, the prisoner, Hill, crossed me several times, I told him to keep off-there were several people following me to the watch-house, he would not keep from me; when I had secured Daws in the watchhouse, I went out and secured Hill, and took him in - He was pushing against me, and wanted to rescue Daws. I asked him if he knew any thing of Daws, he said, no; but when Furzeman searched him, he said he did know him, and had known him a long time, and that Daws had worked for his father. We went back to the prosecutor, he described Davis to us, and we went to the Coach and Horses and took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It might then be near nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM READING. I am a watchman. About half-past eight o'clock on Sunday evening, the 26th January, the rattle sprung. I went up and found Trimbey at the door of the Coach and Horses. He sent me to the back of the house to prevent any body from escaping. They<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190007"/>brought Davis out. Crawley took him to the watchhouse. As we were going along, we were pressed several times by Hill. I am sure it was him. I spoke to him several times, and pushed him off the curb to prevent his pressing us. I told him to keep clear off, he had no business with our prisoner. He muttered and grumbled, and went down the Coal-yard. When we got to the watchhouse, Crawley came out and took him. At first, he said, he did not know Daws, and then he said he did. Trimbey returned, and we all went to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It was St. Giles watch-house. I first saw Hill following us in Drury-lane, we had Daws in custody there, he was between us. Hill pressed me a great deal. He came by the side of us, and between us. I told him to keep away. It was about half-past eight o'clock. I did not hear him say any thing.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL FURZEMAN. I am the watch-house keeper. On the 26th of January, Crawley brought Davis in about twenty minutes before nine o'clock. Hill was brought in about three minutes after.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer, and work for Mr. Stubbs, in Camden Town. I live with my father in Kentish Town. I have known the prisoner, Hill, four years, he lives with his father in Kentish Town. I was in his company on Sunday, the 26th of January. I met him at the King's Arms, in Kentish Town, about four o'clock in the afternoon, nobody was with him, we remained there till near seven o'clock - We were quite sober when we left. We went to the Three Brewers, in Moor-street, at the bottom of Crown-street, which leads in a line from Oxford-road to Seven Dials. We got there about twenty-five minutes before eight o'clock, we stopped there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, we did not meet any body there. From there we went to James-street, Covent-Garden, to a public-house at the corner of the Piazza, and waited there about half an hour, we came out at half-past eight o'clock, and parted. The watchman was calling half-past eight o'clock as we came out, and the public-house clock was half-past eight. Before we parted, we agreed to meet at the top of Monmouth-street, Tottenham-court-road end, to go home together, he said, he would meet me there in a short time. We only came to town for a walk. I went there and stopped an hour, he did not come. The next morning I heard he was taken up.</p>

I was standing at the King's Head, at the bottom of the lane. I saw the two prisoners and another man. The barrel stood upon its head, the other man threw it down and tried to roll it away, he could not; but the prisoner, Haines, rolled it away from Darkhouse-lane to Botolph Wharf, I there lost sight of the barrel and the three men. I went round Billings gate to look for Smith, who had the barrel in his charge, he went to look after the men and took them. I am suret he two prisoners are two of them. Willcox was with them when they rolled it away.</p>

The last witness said, it was stolen - I missed it immediately. Mr. Smith went over London-bridge and I remained in Thamas-street. I saw the man who escaped and the prisoner, Wilcox, with it, at the foot of the bridge, I stopped to watch them till Smith returned, he secured Wilcox, and I took care of the barrel; the other man ran away. The prisoner, Haines, was coming down Fish-street-hill, I attempted to stop him, he said, if I did not let him go, he would cut my bl-dy head off, and put himself in a posture of defence. I afterwards took him, with the help of others.</p>

            . I am porter to Mr. Ward, of Thames-street. As I was coming from my breakfast, I saw the prisoner, Haines, rolling the barrel, he rolled it to the top of Thames-street and put it under one of the town carts, and left it there, and went across. Wilcox and another man came and took it up, and put it on the curb. I followed Haines up Fish-street - hill. We then both took him, he wanted to fight Randall. I am sure he is the man that I saw with the barrel.</p>

            . I am a ticket-porter. On the 7th of February, as I was coming down Darkhouse-lane, Walker told me one of the barrels was taken. I ran up the gateway and over London-bridge to Tooley-street. I returned and could not see the barrel in any of the carts as I passed, when I came to the bottom of the bridge at the archway of the church, I saw it against the post, the two prisoners were standing within three yards of it; when Haines saw me he ran away. I seized Wilcox, he said, he knew nothing of the transaction, that he was only standing there for a cart, as his father was gone to Billingsgate. I told him I should detain him. I slackened my hand from his collar, and he ran as far as Fishmonger's-hall - He was secured again.</p>

I have been in partnership with Burch ever since the 20th of July, before that I was in partnership with Whitrow, that was regularly dissolved; the knives were entered into the new partnership account, they were my property before, and never belonged to Whitrow; they were not mixed with the partnership property. They have been entered into the account with Burch as our joint property. The prisoners were in the same room together. I will not swear they were not taken at different times. The prisoners had been home that day, the property was found on them at one time. The two knives found on Hudson, were taken from the same room, but not from the same parcel. After the property was found on them, they both said they were our property.</p>

On the 23d of January last, about half-past two o'clock in the afternoon, I was in my back parlour talking to a gentleman, with my wife, my two servants were in the back workshop. Hearing the sound of glass breaking, I went into my front shop and saw the window was broken, and a vacancy between my watches. I went out, and heard the cry of stop thief! and seeing people running, I followed and saw the prisoner running. Mr. Hall took him before I came up to him. I missed a watch, which was safe a short time before.</p>

            . I live opposite Mr. North. On the 23d of January, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I was coming down, nearly opposite Mr. North's, and saw the prisoner looking at his window, where the watches hung, in a stooping position. I am sure he is the man. I looked a second time and saw him raise his hand, I them saw him strike it into the window and catch at something, he missed the first catch; I then saw him make a second attempt and run off. I did not see him take it. I was within fifteen yards of him. I pursued him for about three or four hundred yards, and took him. I lost sight of him as he turned the corner. I saw him again in a minute, he appeared to be stopping for want of breath. I did not see any thing in his hand, nor did I see him throw any thing away. I am sure he is the boy that I saw make a snatch at the window and run off. I have not the least doubt of it. A person told me that the watch was thrown over a wall.</p>

I kept them in my pocket-book, with three other 1l. notes, that I had before. On the 7th of February, I had eleven 1l. notes in my pocket-book, which I kept at the bottom of my chest, in my bed-room-it was locked. A little after nine o'clock in the morning, I went out. I had taken 1s. 6d. out of my pocket-book that morning, and saw my notes safe then. I put my book at the bottom of my chest, and locked it. There was also a pension ticket in the book, some papers, four 3s. tokens, and 1s. I did not return till half-past nine o'clock at night. The prisoner lodged in the same room with me. He did not sleep in the same bed. He knew I had the money. He went down stairs before I went to my box in the morning. When I came home, I found the lid of my chest had been forced from the asp of the lock, it was still locked, but the lid broken from it. My pocket-book, with its contents were gone, and a black silk handkerchief. I went out to look for the prisoner, but could not find him. I returned home, and found him there, and asked him if he knew any thing about it; he said, he did not. I had him taken to the watch-house, where he was kept all night. I went there at six o'clock in the morning, they told me he was gone. I found him at a coffee-stall. I was on the opposite side of the way, and saw him give the woman who kept the stall, a shilling. I kept on the other side of the way, she scrupled to take it, and gave it to her little girl to go over the way for change. As the girl came over the road, I asked her to let me look at it, which she did, and I knew it to be the same shilling that was taken out of my box, by a large T on one side, and a stroke on the other side, which I observed when I took it. It had been it refused because it was French. I saw the woman give it to the girl, and heard what she said. I gave it to the girl again, and told her, to take it to her mother, and tell her not to part with it, and I would speak to her as soon as the prisoner was gone. I saw her put the shilling on the table, and her mother take it up. I went over and told her not to part with it. I followed the prisoner into the Star public-house, in Well-street-he did not see me. I heard him ask the potboy, how long it would be, before his master got up, when the master got up, the prisoner was in the tap-room, but did not know that I was in the house. I got an officer and had him searched, the landlord handed out three notes from the bar, and a black silk handkerchief. I can swear to one of the notes.</p>

            . I am a widow. The prosecutor and prisoner both lodged in my house, which is in the parish of St. Botolph, Aldgate. There were two more men who lodged in the same room. The prisoner went out about twenty minutes before M'Ginnis, he returned between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, and staid in the lower part of the house till between one and two o'clock. He then went up stairs, and staid there not quite a quarter of an hour. I asked him what he went up stairs for, he said, to mend his shoes. He came down and went out. Nobody was up stairs, from the time that M'Ginnis went out till he returned, but the prisoner. They lived in the one pair of stairs room. I heard no noise. The prisoner returned again, about ten o'clock at night. I had seen M'Ginnis with money. He once gave me his pocket-book to take care of. His money was all in 1l. notes.</p>

            . I keep a coffee stall opposite Wapping watch-house, in Dock-street, East Smithfield. The prisoner came to my stall, on the 8th of February, in the morning, and had some coffee. I am sure it was the prisoner. He gave a shilling, I did not like it, and gave it to my little girl to get it changed. I observed M' Ginnis. The girl came back, and told me not to part with it. She had not got above ten yards before she came back. She gave me the shilling directly into my hand. I am sure it was the same shilling I had given her. There was a T on it, which I had observed, it was marked round the edge. The man came and told me not to part with it. I kept it separate from my other money, and I am sure, I gave the same shilling to the officer.</p>

            . I keep the Star public-house, in Well-street. On Friday evening, the 7th of February, about five o'clock, the prisoner came to my house and had some gin, he gave me three 1l. bank-notes to take care of for him till the morning, saying, that he was going into bad company, and was afraid he should lose them. I put them in a drawer by themselves, and locked the drawer and took the key. When I came down the next morning, my boy told me, in the prisoner's presence, that a person had been robbed, and was gone for an officer, and that I was not to deliver the money till he came back. The prisoner said. I was to give him the money, and if the officer wanted it he would give it to him. I told him that I must keep it till he came. The officer came directly and I gave him the same notes that the prisoner delivered to me the night before. I did not know the prisoner before.</p>

Sometime after he had been up stairs my daughter gave the alarm, and called for a light, the maid took up the candle, and I saw the prisoner come down stairs directly. I was in the bar, it was about a quarter of an hour after he had gone up. I took up my candle and followed him, he made towards the door, Pugh, the hostler, came up to him, and told him he had got a great coat on that belonged to a gentleman's servant, Pugh pulled it off. The prisoner was secured. I had no knowledge of him before.</p>

When I pulled the coat off, I saw he had got another coat on, that belonged to Mr. Tarbuck, who was gone to bed in our house. Mr. Mand came down and assisted me. On taking the prisoner into the kitchen, we took Tarbuck's coat off; we also took off a hat and a pair of shoes, which were Tarbuck's. I then fetched Dean, the constable, who found a purse, containing four 1l. bank notes, and a quantity of silver on him; there were two handkerchiefs and other things, found upon him, that belonged to Tarbuck.</p>

Haines said, he was head constable, and Hall said, he was a con<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190012"/>stable, and that they would take me to the watch-house; they dragged me through Hammersmith; I told them that I had a licence, and if they would come to the light, I would shew it to them; they took me into a dark lane. I said, I would give them all the money I had got if they would let me go; they said they would not till they got to the watch-house. Haines asked me if I was ever on board a ship, I said, yes; he took two pieces of black stuff from me; when they came to a house in the lane, they hallooed out, and a man let them in-Hall beat me in his presence. The woman went for a constable. I had two pieces of Irish which they took from me. I produced my licence, and wanted to go out for a constable; I got out, and met the constable, he asked me if I had not been robbed, I told him I had. I was in great alarm. I might have dropped my money. I am sure the prisoners are the men; I went back with the constable. The master of the house said he would fetch him. I believe the door was open; they did not attempt to hinder me from going out. Hall stopped in the house. The constable took them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHALLENOR. It was in the high road. I told them that I had a licence; I was quite sober; I asked the women to give me a bottle, and I would get some liquor, in order to get away. Hall said he would be five-pence towards some gin, and the prisoner Haines, went with me to look for the constable; we found Hall still within the house. The woman of the house is not here, because she is in labour. I did not know that it was necessary to bring her husband.</p>

On the afternoon of the 13th of February, about four o'clock, as I was coming down stairs I saw the prisoner come out of the room where the tools were, I asked her what she wanted, she said she had been sent to do half a day's work by a person down the alley - She had something in her left hand, under her apron; after she was gone I missed the articles stated in the indictment directly, I had seen them safe half an hour before. I followed her, and asked her what she had taken out of the room that she had just come out of, she said, she had taken nothing. I found the tools under her apron, and brought her back.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WARE. I am the husband of the last witness. My wife gave me the tools, and I gave them to the patrol. They are worth more than 3l.</p>

About a quarter after six o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in Bell-yard, with the mutton on his shoulder, I followed him towards Newgate-market, thinking he might be a porter; he passed the market, I asked him where he was going, he said, to Fleet-market, but did not know to whom he was going to take it; he said he got it from Mr. Stokes, and was to have half-a-crown to take it to Fleet-market. I took him to Mr. Stokes, when he got there, he put it on the same hook from which, he said, he had taken it, and wanted to go away, Mr. Stokes said he had not employed him. I secured him.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 28th of January, about six o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner, with a bundle, in Dorset-street, Spitalfields. I stopped her, and asked her, what she had got in the bundle, she said, clothes, and that she was going to Rose-lane, I told her that was the wrong way. I opened the bundle, and found it contained the articles stated in the indictment. She said they were her own property, and that she had left service, and her master had stopped her box; she run from me, and fell down. I took her. She then said, she lived with Mrs. Israel. Mrs. Israel claimed the things, the prisoner did not deny it. There were other things in the bundle.</p>

The prisoner came to our warehouse, about one o'clock in the afternoon, and told me he wanted about 70l. worth of ribbon; and asked me, to show him a sample, which I did on the counter, and told him the prices. I said, that I had better give him a written list of them. I went to the desk to write it. During this time, he walked about near the counter where the goods lay. I gave him the list; he asked me, if we had got any figured satin ribbon. I went to another part of the warehouse to get them, and he went with me. I pulled open the drawer and shewed them to him, he asked me to look out some to the best of my judgment, as he wanted them for shipping and the colours must stand, as he had shipped some before, and they had flown. I observed him put his right hand into his breeches pocket more than once, and saw some ribbon in his hand at the time. He still continued talking about ribbons. After he had put his hand into his pocket several times, he said, he was in a hurry, and would thank me to let him out, and he would call again in a short time - He went out. Before I saw him in the warehouse, I had taken an inventory of the goods on the counter, the warehouse was on the first floor. I followed him down stairs immediately, he run down as fast as he could. When I caught sight of him in the street, he was still running. He had turned into Shovel-court, a little below our house, which was no thoroughfare, and I secured him just at the end of the court, and told him, I suspected that he had property which did not belong to him; he made no answer. I took him into the King's Head public-house, and gave him in custody to Fullbrook, who was there, and searched him in my presence, and found ten pieces of ribbon on him; the whole of them where Mr. Herbert's property, and part of those that I had been shewing him.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Taylor, who lives next door to Mr. Bennett. About nine o'clock in the morning of the 30th of January, I went to the door, and saw the prisoner, and another boy, looking in Mr. Bennett's window. I watched them. They saw me and went to the next corner, and looked in at the window a little while; they then went back to Mr. Bennett's. The prisoner and another went up to the pile, the prisoner held his coat to conceal them, and the other boy took three pieces of print and gave them to the prisoner; both run off. I pursued the prisoner; he dropped them, and I secured him.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, residing in Bishopsgate-street. I was called to the deceased, about a quarter of an hour after he died. I examined him externally; there were no bruises. I could not form any opinion as to the cause of his death. I saw the body again on the 4th, after it had been opened, there was an appearance of inflammation in his stomach; it was not considerable, in my judgment it was not sufficient to cause his death. I had attended him two years before this, for an inflammation of his stomach, he soon recovered from that.</p>

I had observed that she was large, and told her of it; she said it was her clothes. We slept in the garret. On Monday, the 20th of January, she went to bed about eleven o'clock. I had set up, with my fellow-servant, for my mistress till one o'clock. When I went to bed, the prisoner begged that I would be as quick as possible in getting into bed. About five o'clock, Roots called me, and begged I would come down stairs, as the cook was ill in the scullery. I did not dress myself, but came down directly, and went into the kitchen, and asked her what was the matter. I did not see her, she was in the scullery-it was quite dark. There is only a thin partition of boards between the kitchen and scullery, which do not go to the top. She said, she was very ill with a pain in her bowels. I struck a light. The scullery door, I believe, was shut. She still begged of me not to come in, as she was undressed. She had desired me not to come in when I first came down. My mistress rung the bell and I went to her. She desired me to leave the light in the kitchen - I did so. I returned in ten minutes. As I was coming down stairs, the prisoner called out to me not to come in. She met me at the kitchen door. She put her hand to my breast, pushed me back, and bolted the kitchen door. I waited there some time and begged of her to come up stairs, she told me to go and she would follow me. After waiting some time, I went up to bed. She came up about half-past six o'clock, with the light in her hand; the moment she came into the room she put the light out, and came to bed. I asked her why she went down, she said, she was dreadfully ill in her bowels, and went down for fear of disturbing her master. I offered to get up and get her any thing, she said, she had made a fire, and got some milk and water. She got up about a quarter before eight o'clock in the morning, and I got up at eight o'clock. I went into the scullery about ten o'clock in the morning, and observed some blood in the crevices of the stones and on the stones, there was some blood in a red pan, and some on a board on which she used to stand to wash the dishes; there were finger marks of blood on the scullery table, and on the posts which support the cistern. I also observed marks of blood on our bed-room floor and on the bed. If these marks of blood had been either in the bed-room or in the scullery the day before, I must have seen them. There was some blood on the night-gown in which she slept that night. On Wednesday, I asked her, what was the reason of the blood being in the scullery, she said, it must be from a calf's-heart which she had, had to dress. We had not had any thing of the kind in the house for three months before; upon that I told my mistress, and she went to Bow-street. On Thursday, Jefries came and searched the house, but found nothing; he searched again on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. The scullery is a flat smooth pavement; the marks on the cistern-posts were about a yard from the ground. The prisoner had the care of the provisions. I know all the meat that comes into the house.</p>

            . I am footman to Mr. King. I sleep even with the kitchen, and can hear any noise in the scullery. On the 20th of January I went to bed between twelve and one o'clock. At half past three in the morning I was awoke by the dog barking; he sleeps in my room. I did not hear any thing from that time till half past four o'clock; I then heard a pail rattling as if it was put down; at the same time I heard something of a voice like somebody in pain, but could not tell what it was. I got up and went into the kitchen; it was quite dark. I asked what noise it was; the prisoner answered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190016"/>me from the scullery, saying, "For God's sake do not come here; I am not dressed." She said she had a pain in her bowels. I asked her what she came down into such a place as that for, and why she was in the dark? She said she was only come to get a little water to wash herself, and was going to bed directly. With that I was satisfied, and went to bed again. In about half an hour I heard a violent groaning. I could not tell whether it was a male or female voice. It was about half past five o'clock. I got up and went into the kitchen; it was quite dark. - The prisoner was in the scullery, making a groaning noise as if she was in pain; at the same time I distinctly heard the cries of a child coming from the scullery; I heard it for five minutes, at different times. She begged I would not come in or alarm the house, and said, if I would go to bed she should be very well in a minute. I asked her where her fellow-servant, Charlotte, was - She said she was up stairs, and begged of me not to call her. I went up and told her to come down; she did directly. I heard her ask the prisoner where she was, and what was the matter. She said she had been very ill with a pain in her bowels. Mrs. King rang the bell, and Charlotte struck a light and left it on the table, and went up stairs. She was gone about ten minutes, during which time I was in the passage between the kitchen and my bed-room. Charlotte came down, and the prisoner begged her not to come in. The prisoner came out of the scullery and met her at the kitchen door, and said you shall not come in here, pushed her back, and bolted the door. Charlotte staid at the door some time. I went to bed, and got up at eight o'clock. The prisoner was up before me. I went into the scullery about nine o'clock, and observed some blood in the crevices of the stones. They were wet as if they had been washed. There were finger-marks of blood on the cistern, on the scullery table, and on the scullery door. These marks were not there on the Monday, I am sure. There had not been a calf's heart dressed in the family for some time. I said nothing to the prisoner about it. Jefferies the officer came and took the prisoner away on Friday he came again and searched but found nothing. - He came again on Monday; I was with him, and searched the coal-cellar in the front area; the scullery is quite at the back of the house. He found a bundle in the coal-cellar, among the coals, near the door, the coals were over it. I saw the bundle opened; it contained a new-born female infant; the same child was afterwards examined by Mr. Leese. Jeffries took the child out of the bundle and put it in the pantry, exactly in the same condition as he found it; he locked the door and took the key. The Coroner and Mr. Leese saw it there afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The prisoner has been four years in the family. I understood her to be married. I had observed her to be in the family way. The prisoner knew that I slept down stairs. It was some time before I heard the child cry.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon yourself to swear that it was not the voice of a woman you heard - A. I will swear that it was a child. The blood-marks were not high.</p>
               <p>Court. - Q. When you saw the child was there any thing about its month - A. There was a coarse cloth put into its mouth when I first saw it, and I am sure that nobody touched the cloth before it was taken into the pantry.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. I went to Mr. King's on Thursday, the 23d January. I went into the kitchen, and told the prisoner I had a warrant for her, and told her what it was for. She said it must be a mistake, and she went towards the table, where there was a large carving knife; I told her she must not leave me. She seemed very much agitated. I told her to put on her things and go with me; she said she would; I went with her to get them. She put her hand into her pocket; I asked what she had got there, she said she had nothing in it; she pulled out a small piece of rag (producing it); it was stained with blood; she said she had had a piece of meat in it. She asked me to give it to her, saying that it was of no use to me - I refused. I took her to the House of Correction. It was too late to search the house that night. I searched it the next morning, and found a great quantity of her clothes which were stained with blood. I did not search the coal-cellar, I searched it on the Monday morning; I found the bundle in the left hand corner of the coal-cellar, about two feet form the door and six inches under the coals. Nothing could be seen from the surface of the coals, and there was a large plank put over that part of them. I took it up exactly as I found it, and laid it in the pantry in the presence of Roots. I did not open it till I put it on the pantry table, and the first thing that I observed were the legs of a child. As I removed the clothes, I found the head part with a coarse cloth over the face and neck. I looked down sideways, and said"Why the mouth is full of coarse cloth!"-it was three inches within the mouth (Here the witness produced the cloth, which was quite hard, and formed the complete shape of the cavity of the mouth)-it was a female child. I left it in the pantry, and locked it up and kept the key. The next morning I went, with the Coroner, to Mr. Leese; I opened the door for them, and found the child exactly as I had left it. I removed the cloth out of its mouth by direction of the Coroner-it is now precisely in the same shape as it was when I took it out of the child's mouth-the child was wrapped up in a petticoat and other things-(I produce them).</p>

            . I am a surgeon. On Friday, the 28th January I attended the Coroner's Inquest. I went into the pantry and saw the child on the table. Roots and the officer were with me; the cloth was not in the child's mouth, it lay by its head. I examined the child's body could find no external marks of violence. I took the cloth and applied it to the child's mouth-it was compressed together in a hardened mass; the lump exactly fitted the internal part of the mouth, and resembled the cass of the mouth, as if it had been put in, and became hardened while in the mouth; there was a redness about its neck and head as if arising from strangulation-supposing the child to have been alive, it was quite sufficient to strangle it-it could not breathe. The child appeared to me to be perfect, and I have no doubt but that it was born alive.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It is difficult to tell whether a child is born alive or-not I will not swear it. It had come to maturity, apparently. I did not look for blows-if the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190017"/>child had fallen on the stones at its birth, it would have caused its death.</p>
               <p>JEFFRIES.re-examined. Before Mr. Leese saw the child the Coroner, and Jury, had seen it. I removed the cloth then before Mr. Leese came.</p>

            , Esq. I am Coroner for the County of Middlesex. The Jury, Roots, and Jeffries, accompanied me-the child was lying on its back, with a coarse cloth, apparently a dish-cloth, pressed very tight into its mouth, as far as it possibly could-the whole cavity of the mouth appeared to be full-it was taken out in my presence; it came out like a bung. If the child had been alive, the cloth must have suffocated it.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner put in a written paper, as follows: "The prisoner never had a child before, and being inexperienced, thought she had two months of her time to go. Her reason for not making her situation known was, that she might remain in her place as long as she could."</p>

On the 7th February I bolted and locked my doors before I went to bed-about eleven o'clock I fastened my private door-my cellar has an iron grating over it, which was quite secure. About four o'clock I was alarmed, and found the coal-cellar padlock wrenched off, and the house broken into. Two boards were broken down; the iron grating had been forced up, high enough for a man to enter; the wood-work was broken.</p>

            . I am a watchman-my box is opposite Miller's house. On the morning of the 7th of February I was going my rounds, and heard Mr. Miller's private door jar; I went to it, and found it about four inches open. I asked who was there, several times-nobody answered. The door was drawn back from within, and a man came out - I secured him-the prisoner came out after him, and gave me a violent blow, and struck me with a piece of wood, called a stretcher, which cut my lip; when he was coming up to strike me, the other man said,"Give him a nice one." - I was knocked down. I saw the prisoner come out at the door he had a white apron on. I am sure he is the man-it was moon-light - I saw his face. I gave the alarm - I could not spring my rattle, as I had hold of the man with both hands. The prisoner ran towards Bunhill-row. Cleaver and Newton came to my assistance. I am sure the prisoner is the man that struck me; I saw him again five minutes afterwards.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was going round my beat in Bath-street and Old-street, and looking round Bunhill-row, I saw a scuffle between the watchman and some other men. I ran to them, and saw the prisoner coming from the watchman - I was on the opposite side of the prosecutor's house. I took the prisoner - it was about twenty yards from the house; he was running as hard as he could nobody else was running-Grenville said he was the man that came out at the door, and struck him-the prisoner made no answer; he had nothing in his hand - He had a green coat on and a white apron.</p>

            . I am a patrol. My attention was called to the prosecutor's house about four o'clock in the morning of the 7th of February. Grenville called out, which led me there. I saw a man run from him with a white apron - He was brought back about ten minutes afterwards. Grenville was laying on the ground, senseless; he was unable to stand. I went directly to the prosecutor's door, and found a hat and a dark-lanthorn on the step - I alarmed the prosecutor directly-the door was wide open. On going down into the cellar, I saw a white handkerchief laying under the grating, where it was forced up-the inner cellar had the boards broken down and the padlock forced. Grenville was laying just off the curbstone opposite the prosecutor's door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was you not in Banner-street when you heard the watchman call - A. Yes, but not above a dozen yards from the spot. Grenville was laying opposite the door, in Banner-street. One side of the prosecutor's house is in Banner-street and the other in Bunhill-row-the dark lanthorn has had oil in it.</p>

            . I am constable of Hackney. I was in the Hackney-road on the night of the 15th of January, and passed the prisoner and another man, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's house. I was going to Hackney - I knew the prisoner before - He had the broom on his shoulder, and swore that the first that stopped him he would knock them down. I returned towards town; I met them again, and asked them what they had got-the other man said it was some pickles that they had got from a relation, at Whitechapel. I told them they were coming the wrong way, and I must detain them. The other man ran away, and left the pickles on the ground, and I took the prisoner - He had the broom on his shoulder.</p>

            . I live at Merton, and am employed to watch the common there - I knew the prisoner very well. In January last I found a stray mare, and foal, on the common; I turned them off-the prisoner said they belonged to him, and asked me to buy them. In two or three days after, the mare was gone, and the foal left behind.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought them between Merton and Kingston - I gave 4l. 4s. for them; two young women were with me at the time. I was sent to Guildford to be tried, and was discharged by proclamation. I knew the men. I bought them of, but they are so very unsettled I cannot find them; I had witnesses attending there.</p>

On the morning of the 15th of February, between five and six o'clock, I came down stairs, before it was light, I observed the glass over my parlour door, towards my bar, was broken; I alarmed my family, went into the parlour, and found two squares of glass at the bottom sash of the window, right and left, broken, in order to turn back the fastening that kept it down-the outside window-shutter was broken to pieces, and the iron bolt bent double; the shutter had been forced, and the glass taken out, I found a large ironcrow behind the parlour door, the sash of the window was up-any person might get in or out. I found my tills had been emptied, and the money gone. I also missed the articles stated in the indictment, which were on the table in the bar, the overnight, at eleven o'clock. The prisoner had often worked for me, he had painted several houses for me at different times. The crow was my property, and usually kept in the cellar of the next house, which is mine; I saw it there the morning before, and ordered my servant, John Hube, to take it into my own cellar, but he did not. The prisoner has often been in the cellar of the adjoining house, I kept paint and other things there; he has been there with me and by himself. He has not worked for me for sometime, but has been in the habit of being about my house, he was there the night before the robbery, I saw him in the tap-room; he came to my house again at night, and I charged him with the robbery. I gave him in charge.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Trend. I fastened up the house on the night of the robbery, I fastened the shutters of the back parlour window, and bolted them with two bolts - I am sure of it; I drew down the sash after me, all the squares of glass were in then. My master got up first in the morning, when I came down, I found the crow behind the parlour door and the shutter broken open. I saw the crow-bar in the next house the day before. I did not bring it into the dwelling-house. I took it into the cellar of the adjoining house, two or three days before. Mr. Daws lived in that house. My master used to keep his things in the cellar, it is not kept locked; if the prisoner said he was sent by my master, he could get into the cellar. I tried the crow-bar with the shutter, and the marks fitted, it appeared that the window had been broken open with it.</p>

On the 27th of January, I was down stairs in my kitchen, and heard glass crash as if it was my shop window; it was about a quarter before six, the lights had been lit nearly an hour-it was quite dark. I ran up stairs and found my glass broken-it was a very thick plate glass. There were some watches hanging just by it. I ran out, and heard the cry of stop thief! I ran with the people, and overtook the prisoner within three doors of my house. Wilmot pointed him out to me. I laid hold of him and took him into my shop. There was a void between the watches. I did not know how many were gone - They were safe when I went down stairs. The prisoner's right hand was cut and bleeding. A person brought the gold case into the shop, which I knew to be mine; somebody else brought in the gold watch-the face and glass was broken, and it was bruised; the case was not hurt. It was worth twenty guineas.</p>

            . In the evening, of the 27th of January, I was in Oxford-street, it was quite dark, I looked at my watch at the time, it wanted exactly a quarter to six-the lamps were lit. I was near Holly-street, and heard a great crash, I turned round instantly to where the noise came from, and saw the prisoner running towards me; nobody else was running-there was a cry of stop thief! he instantly stopped and began walking towards me, there being a strong light from the shop; I stopped him, and told him he was the thief; he wanted me to let him go - I refused. I was going to take him to the place where the glass was broken, and heard something fall. A lady instantly said, the man had thrown something down the area, the sound was close to us; I returned and I saw something lay on the area railing. Mr. Dane came up, and I gave the prisoner up to him. I went to the railing and found it was a watch case, the lady picked it up and gave it to me, the case was open and lay across the area bar, it was three houses from Mr. Dane's; I gave the prosecutor the case.</p>

The prisoner called at my master's house, between three and five o'clock in the afternoon, and had some beer; I missed him for half an hour, I do not know where he went, he came back again; he went away about half-past five o'clock. I did not see him with the things, he might have gone out of the house when I missed him. I left Mr. Bullman's door locked in the morning.</p>

Mrs. Thorn fetched Wainwnight, and he took her. The boots were mine, they were odd boots and worth 12s. The prisoner, Brown, went into the shop, and asked, what had became of her sister, in about half an hour; my wife said, that she was the girl who was in the shop with Mackenzie. Brown said, she never took the boots, and asked what I was going to do with her; I gave her to the officer.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. On the 23d. of January, between twelve and one o'clock, the prisoners came into our shop, I was in the yard, when I came in I found them in the shop; Mackenzie asked for a pair of highlows, she said, they were for the other prisoner; Mackenzie said, she was going over the way to get a pint of beer, and would try them on-Brown then said, she was going over the way too, and would call again; Mackenzie went first and Brown followed. I went into the street to look after them, they did not go the way to the public-house. Mrs. Thorn crossed the street, and stopped Mackenzie. I went to the shop window and saw the lamp swinging, which made me think somebody had been taking the shoes. I called my husband to see if any thing was gone, he missed the boots. Mrs. Thorn had taken her with the boots. In about half an hour, Brown came to the shop, and asked if the other girl had stolen the boots - I told her she knew it; she said, she did not, for the girl had found them at the door; this was before I said any thing about them. I am sure they were our boots. When Mackenzie was in the shop, she was folding her gown round her waist.</p>
               <p>MRS. THORN. On the 23d of January, between twelve and one o'clock, I saw the prisoners at the corner of Saffron-Hill, about five doors from Walker's, they were coming from Walker's house; Mackenzie had something folded in her lap, I asked her what it was; she said, they were boots; I asked her, where she got them from; she said, she picked them up at the door. I turned her round and took her back to Walker's; she winked her eyes at Brown, and she escaped.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Taylor. On the 7th of February, the prisoner came to my master's shop, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening - I was busy serving some customers; when I had served them, they were going out, and I saw the prisoner going out with them. Mr. Taylor's two sons were in the shop as well as myself, one of them was serving the customers with me, the other was gone out for change; when the prisoner was in the shop, he did not offer to buy any thing-about a minute after he went out, Mr. Wyatt brought him into the shop, and called me as a witness. I saw him take a pair of shoes from under the prisoner's coat; they were my master's. I did not suspect the prisoner, when he was in the shop. I did not see him look at them. My master's sons were busily employed.</p>


               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were not Mr. Taylor's sons in the shop - A. I cannot exactly say, they might have been there part of the time.</p>

            . On the 7th of February, about eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner looking into Mr. Taylor's window, I was in my shop which is opposite, he waited there about half an hour; I suspected and watched him. Two persons went into the shop to purchase some goods, and in two or three minutes I saw the prisoner go in; I still watched him. After some time the persons came out, and the prisoner came out before them. I did not see him take any thing in the shop. When he got out I thought he had something under his coat. I called him, and asked him to go into the shop with me, and told him, that I thought he had got something that did not belong to him. I took the prisoner into the shop, and took a pair of shoes from under his great coat. King claimed them as his master's property. I gave them to Chadwell.</p>

            . I am a silversmith in Whitechapel. On the 26th of January I went with Mr. Gerrock to the prisoner's lodgings, in Compton-street. I told the prisoner it was clear hat he had been imposing on Mr. Gerrock, and that he had better tell him where he had sold the property, that he might take steps to recover it. I held out no promises to him. After a pause, he said he had pledged about two dozen six-key flutes at Mr. Cordy's, on Snow-hill, besides eight others. I asked him what he had done with the tickets, he said he had sold them to Cordy, and that he pledged the flutes in the name of Simpson-he said he did not think they asked him where he lived - I went there and found the flutes, the desk, and several of the books.</p>

             - I had seen him before 1814, but only once, I believe. It was two or three years previous to that time-Mr. Holmes introduced him to me two or three years before that time. On the 27th of May, 1814, application was made to me to sell 500l. stock Navy 5 per Cents for him and Crispe, by the prisoner - Mr. Crispe was with him - I knew him to be the same person that I had seen with Holmes before, and who, at that time, Holmes called Mr. Crispe.</p>
               <p>Q. If that person had come by himself, did you know enough of him to identify him, without Holmes saying he was the man. - A. I should have known him to have been the person I had seen before, but I should have asked him to refer me to some person in the neighbourhood, or some person in the Bank, to identify him as being Mr. Crispe. Holmes told me to sell out 500l. for him - I did so, and prepared the necessary transfer tickets; it was sold to two different brokers. I sold 300l. to Carter and Campbell, who are brokers, and 200l. to Charles Bennett, who is also a broker, the names given by Mr. Giles are correct. The brokers buy for principals, and give me the names of the persons for whom they buy the stock. When the stock was sold, I attended Holmes to the Bank; the person called

When they came to me, the prisoner said, "This is Mr. Crispe, whom you have seen before with me, (or words to that effect) - We wish to sell out 500l. which is standing in our names." I attended the prisoner and that other person to sign the transfer. He only gave me a verbal order-it is not usual to give written orders (looks at the ledger.)-These are the three transfers of the 500l. Navy 5 per Cents. which I sold by the prisoner's direction.

I had not seen him from the 7th of April. 1815, to July, 1816. In July, 1816, I saw Crispe at the Bank. I did not then know that there had been any doubt about him - I was informed of it at that meeting; Mr. Crispe was there-it was the same man that I had sold the stock for. I was told by Mr. Ferdinando, on that occasion, that there was some doubt about him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not immediately point out the real Mr. Crispe, without any reference being made to him. - A. I did; and immediately stated to Mr. Ferdinando, and another gentleman, that he was the man who had signed the transfer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Crispe, at that meeting, desired to write his name. - A. He was, and I saw him write it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe that the name he then wrote, was the hand-writing of the same man. - A. I am sure it was the same hand-writing that signed the transfer-It was compared with the hand-writing here-(pointing to the book)-Mr. Ferdinando was present, I believe; I pointed out Crispe as the same person I had seen before - I believe him to be the same man. I have not the most distant doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. When you attended at the Bank, was there any stranger, beside Crispe. - A. There was - I attended at the 5 per Cent. Office.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 16th of July, was there anybody there besides Mr. Crispe and the Clerk at the Bank. - A. It was in the 5 per Cent Office, under the letter H.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not attend at Mr. Domino's office. - A. Not on that day. When Crispe had wrote his name, the gentlemen were so well convinced that it was his hand-writing, that they shut the book up altogether.</p>

I and the prisoner met in London, for the purpose of managing his affairs. I was in London, in October 1811; I saw the prisoner at that time, to sell 350l. stock, that was in our names in the bank, as executors to Mr. Crispe. We had 3000l. there, before we sold out, it was in the Navy 5 per Cents. When I went out of town in October 1811, there was 2,650l. standing in our names in the bank. I was not in London, in May 1814. Between October 1811, and May 1814, I had not seen the prisoner, Holmes. I had had no communication with him within that period, about selling out any of our stock. Holmes received the dividends - I never received any. They were applied to pay annuities of 150l. per annum under Mr. Crispe's will. I had had no communication with the prisoner, within the times I have spoken of. I was not in London, in April 1815. I never had any communication with Holmes, after 1811 about selling out stock, which stood in our joint names. In consequence of some suspicion which I entertained, I came to town, in July 1816, and went to the bank. I there found, that 700l. of the stock had been sold out, which stood in the prisoner, Holmes's name and mine I went to the bank, on purpose to enquire and see if the money was safe there. I knew the hand-writing of Holmes when I see it, (looking at the transfer.) I believe it to be his hand-writing-there is the name of William Crispe under it; that is not my hand-writing. I think it resembles it-there are three transfers on the same sheet. I am positive that the name of

             there is not my hand-writing. I was not in London at that time. I have my day-book, in which I put down occurrences on that day - I make these entries from day to day; it is my day-book for 1814 (producing it). - I look at it. On the 27th day of May, I was at home in my own business.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is there in your book that makes you know that you was at home. - A. Because the entries are made in my own hand-writing, so that I must have been at home to have made them. The entries in the book were made on the day that the particular occurrences took place, for instance-if they took place on the 27th, I put them down on the 27th. I do not transcribe this book from another - I write the meat down as it goes out of the shop; it is my day-book, and always lays in my shop-the entries are entries of the different quantities of meat sold to my different customers in the morning; they are entered as it is sold; there are thirteen entries on that day(May 27) - They are all in my own hand-writing; there are no other entries of anybody serving in my shop. I have another book, which I keep for my fat and skins-(looking at it) - I keep an account of the days on which I sell fat and skins; the entries are made on the days to which they refer. I slaughter on a Friday, and sell my skins to one person. I am enabled positively to say, that I was at my own shop at Maidstone the whole of that day - I have not the least doubt of it at all. I did not come to town till October, 1815, after October, 1811. I was not in London at all between those times. I came to town for medical advice - I did not see the prisoner there - I did not see him there until he was taken. When I was absent from the shop, Mrs. Crispe always made the entries; she is my wife; upon all other occasions, I make my own entries. I look at my fat and skin-book, and find I sold, on the 27th of May, both fat and skins.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. I know I was not in town on that day. Maidstone is thirty-four miles from London.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you give that as a reason. - A. I was not in town from 1811 to 1815, because I made entries.</p>
               <p>Q.Cannot you come to town, do business, and go back again the same day. - I will swear the entries were made on the morning of that day - I will swear that they were made in the forenoon.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of day did your skins go out - A.About eleven or twelve o'clock in the forenoon. I will swear it. There is no hour in my book. I will swear it from memory. You can go to town from Maidstone, remain in town four or five hours, and go back again the same day. I was in town the 16th of July, I was at the Bank. I do<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190026"/>not recollect that the broker pointed me out. I was called upon to write my name.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not swear, before the magistrate, that both the signatures of Holmes and Crispe, were in Holmes's hand-writing - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. If your books had not been here, have you a particular recollection, that you was not in London between the times you have mentioned - A. I have, independent of my books.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you make any transfer with Holmes, except that in the year 1811 - A. I did not make any other.</p>
               <p>Q.by MR. CURWOOD. Did you not give as your reason for not being in town, that you was ill - A. I never gave that reason.</p>

I think I have - I looked at the book, there are no entries of mine on the 27th of May; it is my husband's hand-writing, if he had been absent, it would have been my employment to make the entries. Mr. Crispe was not absent in the year 1814, sufficient time to go to London. I remember his going to town in 1811, I remember he went for medical advice - I was with him. I never remember my husband going to town on a Friday, he is always particularly employed, it being slaughtering day, and Saturday is market-day. I never recollect his being absent upon a slaughtering day.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. I never remember his coming to London, or his going any distance - He is not absent much, he goes to Rochester market, but he is not absent many hours. You can go to London in the morning, and come back again in the evening.</p>

             went with me - We saw the prisoner. I told him a gentleman wanted to see him at the White Horse, Eden Bridge; he said, if he went he would ride, and called for his horse immediately; I told him he had better walk with me, he said, he should not. I did not tell him what we wanted him for. He went towards his house, and I followed him - He went in doors, and so did I; he pulled off his smockfrock and hat, and went into the wash-house, to wash his hands. I went into his wash-house, and saw him running down his garden; I called to Burgess to run one way to meet him, and I followed him the other. Just as I had got nearly close to him, he turned round, we seized him by the collar, threw him down, and tried to hand-cuff him, without success - He made a great resistance; in the struggle he threw the hand-cuffs away, while we ran after them he got up and went towards his house. I seized him again. He repeatedly asked me to shoot him; we had each a pistol. When we got him down, he had his servants round, I charged a man to assist me, he said, he was his father, and he would not, and went away. The prisoner went into his house with Burgess and me - We took him in. I think I told him he must go to Eden Bridge. I asked his servants to go after the gentleman to Eden Bridge, but he would not let any of them go. After about half an hour, as we could not persuade him to go, Burgess went to fetch the gentleman from Eden Bridge, it was Foy, the officer; he left me alone with the prisoner; after he had been gone a little time, the prisoner said he wanted to write a letter; there were several persons about, and I was much alarmed for fear he should get away, not that he would injure me; he wanted to go up stairs to write the letter - I refused, but he would go up. I went up as far as the room door with him, but he would not let me go in; he came down stairs very quietly, and sealed it. He then walked about, talking to a person who called himself Bright, and asked him if he would write a letter to a man at Chaddy, whom, he said, owed him some money. He went up stairs a third time, and, by some means or other, got out of the window, and went away. I had told him that I had got a warrant for him, but I did not tell what it was for. I looked after him several nights and days, and searched his house several times, but could not find him.</p>
               <p>JOHN PHILPOT. I keep the Chequers, at West Farley, in Kent, it is nearly twenty miles from Eden Bridge. On Christmas Day last, I saw the prisoner at my house, I detained him, and sent a letter to Crispe. I received an answer from Crispe, and told the prisoner that I detained him for selling out money from the Bank of England; he begged that I would let him go back from whence he came. I told him I could not, for I had pledged my word not to let him go; he said he would give me any thing if I would let him go back again. I told him Mr. Crispe had had a great deal of trouble, and I had pledged my word to stop him if he came my way. He said, he was afraid I had wrote to somebody else to come besides Mr. Crispe. I told him I had not, and shewed him my letter, and the answer. He said, he had fully intended to replace the money again, but that he had been deceived by the Earl of Thanet, and times had turned out bad, that he had not had it in his power. I told him I did not exactly know how the money had been sold out; when he said he was very sorry that he had ever ran away. I told him Mr. Crispe had desired me to stop him. I did not tell him the manner in which the money had been sold out. He said, a friend had persuaded him to run away, and he was very sorry he had done it. Sometime after, the prisoner asked me for a sheet of writing paper; when my brother came to the door for the writing paper, I was standing just outside the door, when my brother stood at the door-way, he said, "half a sheet will do;" and at the same time opened the window out of the room that went backwards-the prisoner was in the room; my brother stood at the door, asking me for the writing paper, he said, half a sheet will do, and jumped out instantly. I heard a noise the same minute that the window was pushed up, he said half a sheet will do. He ran away, through my yard, and down a meadow-nobody was with him at the time. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190027"/>and my brother pursued him-my brother got up to him first, I was close upon him; the prisoner turned round, and said, "You cannot blame me for trying." We brought him back. and secured him in a room. I do not know what passed afterwards. He said, "I cannot die above forty years before my time, and they shall not have me and the money both." He wrote a letter (a letter put into the witnesses hand), it is the same, I saw him write it. I kept it, I did not send it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not tell you that the money was sold by him and Crispe, for his use, and that he had given an undertaking for it - A. He did not. I came up on Saturday by the Maidstone coach. I did not say, I should make a very good thing of it. I did not say, I should hang one, and that it would go hard with the other. A stranger said so; I did not.</p>

On the 27th of December last, I was sent for, to Mr. Philpot's house - I found the prisoner there, and told him, I was come on some business respecting the Bank; he said, he understood it perfectly well, that it was a very bad job, and that he had not a minute's happiness, since it had been done; he also said, that the stock would have been replaced long before, only his friends had deceived him; he said, he had been to France, and had only returned three days; I said, you have done little Smith; he said, he had, and should have done Philpot the same way, only he had broken a glass getting out of the window. Before that, I told him, it was my duty to search him; I did, and found two papers upon him - I put my initials on them, (one put into witnesses hand) this is one of them. As I was bringing him to London, he said, Lord Thanet had deceived him. When we were at the George Inn, in the Borough, he said, he would endeavour to raise the money then, if that would do, but they should not have him and the money too.</p>

            . I am a stock-broker.(holding the stock receipt). I purchased the stock to which this refers. There is the name of Maquire in it. The prisoner brought me this stock receipt; she told me, that previous to her bringing it to me, she had been to the Bank with it, and had presented it to some of the Bank Gentlemen, and that they sent her to the office, her name being wrong; she said, her name was wrong, and that she wished to have her money (which she told me she had paid) immediately, for she was fearful of losing it. The prisoner was a long time at my office, and was extremely clamarous, which made me notice her. She requested me to alter her name from Maquire to M'Quire, in consequence of which, I directed my clerk to draw out an affidavit. I had a great deal of difficulty to satisfy her, that the money was safe. This is the affidavit, (looking at it.). I had a great deal of difficulty to get her to leave the receipt, in order that I might draw up the affidavit - She was unwilling to leave it. She did leave it, and about four days after, she came, and brought a person with her, to sell 12l. out of the 40l. stock. I should not know the other person again. I am sure, that the prisoner is the person that came to me, and the person for when I get<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190028"/>the alteration made. I had bought the stock originally. I had no recollection of the person for whom I bought it; it was the 18th of September 1814, and this transaction was in September 1815. Whens he came with the other woman, she said, she wanted about 10l. in money - I sold out 12l. stock. She introduced the other woman as

I went to the Bank with them, for the purpose of transfering 12l. stock, it was done. I saw her again in October 1815; there was another woman with her - I do not know whether it was the same, or not. I went to the Bank with them then, they both went with me for the purpose of transfering 28l. stock, which was done; then, as witness, I saw the name and the mark made-one of them wrote M'Guire, and the other made a mark. The money for the stock was paid at our office. I do not know whether I saw it paid, or not. They went back with me to the office after they made the transfer.

            , Owen Mulhern, and Bridget Mulhern, his wife-(producing it).</p>
               <p>MARY MAQUIRE. I am a widow, and live in Kent-street, Borough. I know Bridget Mulhern. In September 1814, I went with her to the Bank. We went to Mr. Rumford's office, and saw him; we gave him 40l. and he gave us 2l. out of it. He went out. We waited there till he came back. He gave us a paper, (looking at the stock receipt), I believe that is it, he gave it into Mulhern's hand - We went home immediately. When we got home, we sewed the receipt up in a green gown lining by the consent of each-it was Mulhern's gown. We sewed it up immediately, and in about six months after, we put it into a trunk, and pledged the trunk with Mr. Barber on the 18th of March 1815 - He is a pawnbroker, and lives opposite St. George's Church, in the Borough. The next day I went to Scotland, and got in trouble there, and got into the county gaol at Sterling. When I was there, I desired somebody to write a letter for Bridget Mulhern, and ordered it to be directed to Swain. He passed as the prisoner's husband. I had lodged with the prisoner a few days before I went to Scotland. I returned to London about the 9th of March, and went to Mr. Barber's. I went first to look for the prisoner, and found she was gone away. I afterwards went to Barber, the pawnbroker, and found Bridget Mulhern's box was not there, nor my own either, (my own trunk had been pledged there also). I did not go to the Bank after the time that I bought the stock in with Mulhern. I never sold out any of the stock. I did not see the prisoner from the time that I went Scotland till she was in custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not write to me to go to the Bank and sell the money - A. Never. I did not give her any authority to sell the money.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you write to me, to send a letter to Mulhern, when you know she was in Middlewich gaol - A. I did not know it then. I went into goal to her, about two years ago. Before I went to Scotland, I sent to the prisoner to tell Mulhern, that I was in custody, and wanted some money and clothes. I desired the person who wrote the letter for me, to tell her to go to my sister, meaning

             - She is not my sister, but I call her so. He wrote to her, that as soon as she received the letter, to go to Barber's and get the trunk and clothes, as the money was enclosed in the trunk. I enclosed the duplicate of her trunk in the letter. She knew that the receipt of my money was in the trunk. The duplicate of my trunk, and three 1l. notes were also in her trunk; she was to take the receipt out, and go to the stock-broker's to see if he would give her the interest of my part of the money that was in the Bank-there was one year's interest due. She was to send it to me, with three pounds, which the prisoner owed me. I had lent it to her in the presence of Mulhern; she was to send them to me with some clothes. After I had left Mulhern in custody, I had not seen or heard of her; she was taken into custody for passing as a soldier's wife, and taking their travelling charge. They would not take bail for her. This was five months after I had wrote to her. I had wrote to the prisoner to tell her of the trouble that I had got into; and she wrote to me, to say, that she thought Mulhern would be in town soon. I was in gaol for being in company with women, who called themselves soldier's widows, and drew money under false pretences. I was in custody eight months. I had been there four months, before I wrote the letter. I came to town when I was liccrated; I was acquitted of the charge. I walked to town, except occasionally geting a lift. I had no money sent me from England after I wrote the letter for the money. I was obliged to be relieved by the different parishes that I came through.</p>

            . I joined with the last witness in putting some money into the Bank. I am a soldier's wife. I am the person who applied to Mr. Rumford, to have the money put into the Bank. I never went to transfer it, nor did I make a mark, or sign my name, to have it transferred. I was not at the Bank in October, 1815. I went to the stock-broker's in 1815, to enquire for my money, if it was drawn out, it was after I had been to the pawnbroker's. I went to Mr. Barber's, in October, 1815, where the receipt had been pledged in my trunk, it was stitched up in the lining of my gown, and put in my box. I kept the key of my box myself. I went to him to enquire for my box; he told me, that Swain had been and released it. I went to Swain's house with Mary Matthews; it was in Kent-street, Borough-the prisoner met me at the door. I asked her, if she had got my trunk; she said, she had got it. The other witness had not a key of it. I desired her to let me see it; she took me up stairs, and shewed it to me. It was shut down, but the lock was broke open, there was nothing in it. I asked her where my property and clothes were; she said, she was in distress and had taken the liberty of pawning my clothes, but would immediately get them for me. I asked her, if she had seen the receipt of the bank, or the duplicate of Maquire's trunk, or if she had taken it out of the green gown; she said, she had. I asked her to give it to me; she said, she would not; for she had had a letter from Mary Maquire to secure her property, and that she would produce nothing until Maquire came forward. I told her, I would go to the Bank, and that she would be made to produce it. She saw I was determined to go to the Bank, and she then confessed, that she had drawn the money out, she said, "I unfortunately signed Maquire's name-do not go to the Bank, I 
               <persName id="t18170219-58-person529">drew</persName>
             the money," she said, she might as well confess the truth to me. I said nothing to her about telling me, she confessed of her own accord. I asked her, how she could do that, when nobody could take the money out but us two; who went to the Bank together. She said, the stock-broker saw no more in her face than he did in Maquire's, and that he did not know the difference. I had received no letter from Maquire containing the duplicate; I asked her, to let me see the letter; but she would not.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did you lodge with her before you knew that she had sold the stock, or after - A.Before and after.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to lodge in her house after you knew she had sold the stock - A. I had no where else to live; she told me, I might live with her until she could make up the money, and until her husband's quarterly pension came due; she said, she would pay me 10l. in hand, and the rest the next pension day; I told her as she had taken it out of the Bank, she must put it in again, and Maquire would come forward; I told her I would not consent to taking it back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Have you not received 4l. 14s. 9d. of the first payment - A. Not a farthing - I told her I could not.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not leave your son at my house, while you went to Hastings - A. Yes, and agreed to pay 5s. per week for him. I returned before the week expired. I never was in Carlise gaol.</p>
               <p>MARY MATTHEWS. I know Bridget Mulhern, and the prisoner. I went with Mulhern to the prisoner's, in October, 1815, we saw her; she told Mulhern, that she had unfortunately signed Maquire's name, and drawn the money out. Mulhern had asked her, where the check was belonging to the money, and she made that answer. Mulhern also asked her about her clothes and trunk; she said, that she had

             the money out, but that she would pay 10l. in hand at pension time.; Mulhern said, that she could not take the money, but she must pay it to the Bank till Maquire came forward; that was all that passed in my presence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not tell Mulhern in your presence, that Maquire had wrote to me, that there was 3l. in her trunk, but Mr. Barber had seen that there was only 2l. - A. I believe she did; the prisoner said, that Maquire had wrote to her, to secure her property.</p>

The prisoner applied for it several times, she brought a letter; we would not give it up to her, until she brought the duplicate. She brought a letter in her hand; I did not take any notice of it, but told her it would not be delivered without the duplicate was produced. She applied four or five times, and at last produced the duplicate, and the box was delivered. I saw it opened, there was some money in it; I cannot say how much. I think the trunk was broken open-there was 2l. in it, and perhaps more.</p>

            . I live at No. 9, Old Belton-street, Long-Acre. Some time after the 22d of December, 1815,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190030"/>the prisoner sent for me. I know it was December, because my husband came home that month, it was after he came home. The prisoner's husband fetched me; I went to her - She put on her things, and we went out together. I asked her, where she was going; as we were walking along, she said, she had received a letter with a Bank paper in it, authorizing her to draw part of the money from the Bank and send it to them, as they were in great distress, and that they were in gaol; she said, they were acquaintances of her's, she neither mentioned their names nor shewed me the letter. We went to the stock-broker's; she said, if they should ask for my name, I was to say, it was Bridget Mulhern. We went to the Bank with the stock-broker's clerk; she said, that she had been to obtain it, but could not get it without a second person being present - We went to the Bank. A gentleman took down a book, and asked me if I could write; I told him that I could not - He then wrote in the book, and desired me to make a mark; I did so, and drew back from the counter. I do not know what passed afterwards. I was afraid that some other questions might be asked, that I could not answer. The prisoner introduced me to the stock-broker as Bridget Mulhern. The gentleman did not ask me any questions. Some months before that, I had lent the prisoner 7l. - she paid me 3l. of it on that day. I have had nothing for this business. She told me it was out of kindness to the poor woman in gaol, and would be of no consequence to me, because what she had said was a fact. In October I went again; she said, she was going to draw the remainder of the money out, and when she saw the women she would give it to them; we went every way as before. She said, she would give the money to the women with as much advantage as if it had been in the Bank. She introduced me again as Mulhern, and we went to the Bank and signed the book as before, (looking at the Transfer Ledger) it was a large book like this. I always make a mark like this, when I take my husband's money. I will not swear that it is my mark. I saw the money paid to the prisoner each time, but do not know how much it was.</p>

Maquire wrote me a letter and stiled me her sister, desiring me to take her trunk out of pawn, to take care of the Bank receipt, and to go to the Bank and draw her dividend, and send her 5l. to employ a counsellor, which I did. The duplicate was enclosed in the letter. Mulhern came to me, and asked me, if Maquire had not sent me the duplicate of her trunk; I told her, yes. She had received 4l. 14s. 9d. towards her share, and was satisfied that I should pay it off so.</p>

            . I am shopman to Messrs. Jones and Simons. On the 7th of February, about half-past five o'clock, the prisoner came to the shop and asked for some silk handkerchiefs; I shewed him some. I saw him put his hand on two of them, they were together. I said nothing but watched him. I shewed him several, he objected to them all. I presently saw him put the two handkerchiefs into his great coat pocket. He offered me five shillings and sixpence for those that I asked him eight shillings and sixpence for. I came from behind the counter; and asked if he really would give five shillings and sixpence for one; he then said, he would rather give one shilling, and moved towards the door. I followed him and got before him; he drew back to the counter, and as he was pulling them out of his pocket, I secured him. He had been to the shop several times before, but never bought any thing. He struck me twice in attempting to get away.</p>

I did not recover until the next day. When I left my father's house, I had a watch in my pocket, with three gold seals, two gold keys, and a gold ring attached to the ribbon. When I came to my senses the next day, I found myself in St. Bartholomew's Hospital. I found that I had got my watch, but not my gold seals, key, or ring; the ribbon was also gone. I am sure that they were all in my possession up to the time that I was knocked down. I was deprived of my senses. I also received several cuts on my face-it was about twenty minutes after seven o'clock. My seals hung out quite visible; I had no great coat on. The cuts appear to have been done with some sharp instrument-one of my teeth was also broken. I remained in the hospital until the Sunday following. I saw my seals afterwards, in the custody of the pawnbroker's man; there was an officer with him-it was either Gleed or Armstrong. I cannot say whether the prisoners were with the persons who rushed against me.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Alabaster, who lives at No. 6, North-green, Chapel-street, near the Curtain-road. On the 30th of January, I was in the Curtain-road; I saw Mr. Jones there, by Holywell-lane - He was on the same side of the way that I was - I was following him. We were both going in a direction from Holland-street. When he came to the pent-house there, three men rushed out and knocked him down. I am sure that one of the three men knocked him down. I was too frightened to raise an alarm; I was close to Mr. Jones at the time. I believe the prisoner, Clarke, is the man that knocked him down, by his features, but I cannot swear to him - He was dressed in a long blue great coat, trowsers and shoes - I mean the man that knocked Mr. Jones down - He appeared similar in size to Clarke. After they had struck Mr. 
               <persName id="t18170219-65-person565">Jones</persName>
             a second time, they ran away. I will not swear to Clarke's features, but he is, to all appearance, the same man. There was no light but that of the moon-Mr. Jones was in the shade; the moon enabled me to see their persons.</p>
               <p>Prisoner CLARKE, Q. Did you not say, at Worship-street, that the man had a blue jacket on. - A. No; I said, a long blue great coat. I cannot swear to his features-to the best of my knowledge, the prisoner, Clarke, is the man, by his bulk and dress; I will not swear positively to him.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Killingworth, who is a pawnbroker, in Brick-lane, which is about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour's walk, from the Curtain-road. On Thursday, the 30th of January, about a quarter before eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner, Clarke, came to my master's shop - I never saw him before that time - He came to sell the two seals and a key, with a ring attached to them; my master looked at them - He asked 16s. for them. Mr. Killingworth asked him who they belonged to - He said they were his own, and that he had won them, at a raffle, the evening before. My master said he did not care to buy them, but if 8s. was worth his acceptance, he would give that for them. The prisoner immediately took up the seals, and went to the door, as if he declained taking the money; he then returned and took the 8s. As soon as he went out, I went to the door to shut up; it was about eight o'clock-the prisoner, Clarke, immediately crossed over the way-there was a man and a lad waiting for him; they all walked away together. I do not know the other two; there were three in company together. I was present the whole of the time that Clarke was talking to my master, and am quite sure that Clarke is the man who produced the seals for sale. I am quite positive that he is the man. There was no ribbon attached to the seals. I do not know whether Wall is, or is not one of the other men. Clarke had a blue jacket and trowsers on-my master did not suspect him. The seals and key were worth about 15s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner CLARKE. Q. Neither of the other men, who were in the shop, can swear to me, but this man. - A. The person who was in the shop at the time is here, her name is Susanna Swinbourn. Killingworth's son was present - He is not here - He was at the further end of the shop at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he not sworn that I was not the same man. - A. He was examined before the magistrate; his examination was taken in writing. I do not know why it was not signed. I heard what he said, and saw his writing, but should not know it again. I was examined, and signed my examination.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he not swear that he was not the same that he was stouter, and he did not believe he was the same person. - A. He did. Killingworth, jun. was employed at the further end of the shop - I was nearer to the prisoner than he was.</p>

            . I live in Gulston-place, Whitechapel. On the 30th of January, I went to get some articles out of pledge-it was between seven and eight o'clock. I saw the prisoner, Clarke. there; I am positive that it was him; he brought some seals in his hand. Killingworth, sen. asked him what he wanted; he said he did not want to pledge, but to sell them. I heard Killingworth ask him what he wanted for them. I had never seen him before, but am quite sure the prisoner, Clarke, is the man that produced the seals. I heard him say, he had won them at a rafile, the overnight. I saw Killingworth pay him for them. I stopped in the shop for something that I wanted - I saw him go out at the door. I am sure that the man that I saw produce the seals, and go out, was the prisoner, Clarke. There was one lamp and three candles in the shop.</p>

            . I am a painter, and live in the Curtain-road. I saw Mr. Jones there on the 30th of January ast - He was laying on his back, under a shed, or penthouse-he was very much hurt. I heard the cry of murder; he could not speak - He was struggling - I took him up; he was completely insensible. I followed him to the surgeon's, and took him to the hospital, and left him there, after seeing his wounds dressed. He came too a little in the cock, and kept getting a little better every yard that we went. Before we got to the hospital, he said he lived at Ivy-place - He said he had lost his watch.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street, In consequence of information that I received, I went to make inquiry about the seals, the day after the robbery, I went with Armstrong, sen. to Killingworth's - He shewed us some gold seals and a gold ring. I afterwards assisted Armstrong and his son in taking the prisoners into custody. From the description I received from the pawnbroker's man, I went and apprehended the two prisoners, at the Bull, in Kingsland-road. When we had put them in the watch-house, I went back for a boy, who had been described to us, but he was gone. The boy was in the house when we took the two prisoners, but we were not certain that he was the right one. He was in the tap-room, but I do not know whether he was in company with the prisoners. I told them what we took them for - They said they knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>JOHN ARMSTRONG. I am an officer. I assisted in taking the prisoner into custody. I took Peto, the pawnbroker's man, to Mr. Jones, with the seals - He claimed them. The prisoners went with us directly. The prosecutor was very much hurt when I searched him at the doctor's - He could not speak. I did not find the watch on him. (Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

We had some apartments to let, and a bill in the window. About a quarter of an hour after she was gone, a man and woman knocked at the door. I have seen the man since-it is the prisoner Hallard. I saw him at Hatton-garden. He came with the woman. The woman asked me if there was not a room to let; I told her there was. She asked me which it was; I told her the front parlour, and opened the parlour door, and they both went in. While we were in the parlour, I stood against the parlour door; I had shut the street - door - A second knock came at the door, and while I went to open it, the people who were in the parlour shut the parlour door close I found the prisoner Handley at the street - door as soon as I opened it-he leaned his arm against the door-post, and said, "Pray is Susan at home?" (There had been a person of that name lodging at our house). I told him Susan had left. He said, "Left!" and seemed much surprised. He said, "How long?" I told him about a week, and gave him her address. He rushed into the house very quick, and went down stairs into the kitchen - He said nothing more then. The kitchen is under ground-the staircase may be seen from the door. I followed him. When I got down stairs, he was resting his elbows on the mantle-piece, and said, he wished to know the particulars of Susan's leaving; I told him it proceeded from a quarrel between Mrs. Bright and herself, and that she had left. At that moment, I heard a crash up stairs, like the breaking of a door. I left the kitchen, and went up one pair of stairs, above the parlour. When I got up, I saw the the prisoner, Hallard, breaking Mrs. Bright's bed-room door open. I said, "For God's sake, what are you doing?" he said, "I am looking for the woman that I brought in." I said, "The woman you brought in is now sitting in the front parlour." (I had seen her as I went up stairs-the parlour door was then open) I told him so. The prisoner, Handley, followed me directly out of the kitchen, and stood close against my left arm. He did not touch me then. The prisoner, Handley, looked up at Hallard, and asked me, whether I knew him (meaning the man who was breaking open the door); I said, "No, I do not." He said, "Did you ever see him before?" - I said, "No, not to my knowledge; he is a total stranger to me." He then looked in my face, and said, "Do you know me?" I said, "No, I do not; you are likewise a stranger to me." He took me with a grasp round the waist, and took me down into the kitchen; as soon as he got me into the kitchen, he put his hands into the breast of his coat, and pulled out a double-barrelled pistol, and said, "Now you know what I am<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190033"/>come for." He then went to a drawer in the kitchen, and and took out a piece of canvas, and tied it about my mouth - He tied it behind. I said, "For God's sake, do not take my life!"-He said, "I will not, at present." he desired me to give him my hand, and said, "By the word of a man-by G-d I will not, at present." He then took a large piece of dyed cotton, and doubled it, and tied it over the canvas on my mouth, so as to prevent my calling out. I was not able to call out - He tied it most violently tight. I put up my hand to relieve my mouth, and he said, "If you lift up your hand against me, I will give you the contents of this pistol down your mouth;" - He had the pistol in his hand. After this, he took a piece of printed cotton, and tied my hands together, and said, "Now you must consent to every thing." There was a turn-up bedstead in the place; he took the bed down, and said, "You must consent to go and he smothered in that bed." He then said, "But stop a moment!" and took the cotton off my hands. He had a leather strap, and strapped my hands behind my back, and brought it round my waist-(it was like a gentleman's brace) - He took me to the bed, and laid me on it. He opened the kitchen door, and called out,"Tom, have you got a rope?" I did not hear any answer; he shut the kitchen door, and said it was all right. He went to the table and loaded the pistol; he put two small bullets into it, and put some powder into the pan - He took the powder out of a little piece of paper, which he took out of his waistcoat pocket. He came, and rested his right arm on my left shoulder - He had the pistol in his hand-and said, "Now you must make up your mind to take the contents of this as soon as you are able to receive it; it will be better for you; for when you are dead you can swear to nobody, because I should be sorry if you should be brought into any blame." He then said, "But I have a few more questions to ask you."-There was a small chest of drawers by the bed-side; he put his finger to the ring of the drawer and pulled it, but found it locked, he said, "It does not matter-when you are no more, we shall soon know the contents." At that moment, a double knock came at the street-door - I heard it-at this time I was on the bed. There were two double knocks. The person knocked twice, and came down to the kitchen. The door fastens inside; there was a handle outside-nobody could enter from the outside, if it had not been left open-it was a gentleman; he came down. The prisoner, Handley, was in the kitchen, standing at the door; he left me the moment that he heard the knock at the street - door - He got up from the bed; he went and stood with his feet against the door, to prevent it from opening-the gentleman tried to push the door open, and the prisoner said,"You cannot come in." A voice from the outside, desired to come in, and the prisoner, Handley, said, "Nobody shall come in here." The person from the outside forced the door open with his umbrella-it turned out to be a gentleman. The kitchen door came open a little way; the prisoner started from the bedside, looked at the person a little while, and made a start and got off-it was Mr. Buttery. When I came to myself, I went over the house, and saw no more of the prisoners. The other prisoner, and the woman, were gone away. I went up stairs in about ten minutes. I do not know how I was untied, I was in such a fright - I said, "My life! my life!" to the gentleman; meaning he had saved my life. He went to alarm the neighbours. Mr. Best came in. I found Mrs. Bright's drawers were all emptied, and put on the bed-the property was gone; it was very soon after the prisoner went out. Mrs. Bright returned about four o'clock. I did not tell her what had passed for sometime, I was so far gone in fright-it was near six o'clock before I could tell her, what had happened. - She came back with one of the lodgers of the house. Mr. Best went to the Police-Office with her before I told her the particulars, I suppose. Mr. Best's wife was in the house with me when Mrs. Bright came back-she came into the house directly after her husband had seen the state of Mrs. Bright's bed-room, and stopped with me. Mr. Best brought her, and she remained with me till Mrs. Bright came back. I did not see either of the prisoners till about a week after, when I went to the Police Office, and saw the prisoner, Hallard, in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. On the solemn oath you have taken, have you any doubt that the prisoners are the two men - A. I have not the least doubt of it. I had a full view of them at the door, when they were breaking it open. None of the property has been found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. They came in about a quarter past two o'clock. I should have gone into the parlour to Hallard, and the woman, if the other man had not gone into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. On the solemn oath you have taken, do you not let rooms out for half an hour, or an hour - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Mrs. Bright - A. Not that I know of. I have lived with her nine months.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Does she permit men and women to come to the house - A. She does.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the man and woman, when they came, ask for a room for half an hour. - A. No; they asked if there was not a room to let for a lodging; I did not ask them for a shilling. There was a girl, who was gone with Mrs. Bright, she is one of this description. Mrs. Bright has got a son; he does not live with her. I never was in a Court of Justice before. We had a person named Susan living with Mrs. Bright once. I gave a description of the prisoners to Limbric and Reid; Mrs. Bright's son took it down on paper from my mouth. I gave the description, for the purpose of its being given to the officer-it was read over to me, before it was given to them. Reid, the officer, brought Hallard up to me at the office; he was hand-cuffed; he was by himself. This was the first time that I saw him, after he left Mrs. Bright's house; I said he was one of the men; I knew him by his face. I saw Handley in Newgate, and knew him as soon as I saw him; he had the very same coat on that he wore on the day of the robbery. I was alarmed, but not insensible - He did not cover my eyes; I am sure that he put two bullets into the pistols; he put the powder into the pan. I have heard that there is a reward. Buttery did not appear at Hatton-garden. I told where he lived.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. In the course of your examination, you have said, that the man loaded the pistol with powder and bullets - A.He put one bullet into each barrel; he put the powder into the pan; he did not put any powder in the barrels.</p>
               <p>ELEANOR BRIGHT. I am a widow. I live at No. 4, Northampton-street, Battle-bridge, St. Pancras. On the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190034"/>8th of January, I went to the Bank. I left my house a little before two, and returned about four o'clock. I had left every thing safely locked up when I went out; I left Martha Green in the house by herself. I found my door and cupboard locks broken, as well as my drawers; the drawers were left empty on my bed; I missed the articles mentioned in the indictment. I am sure they were all safe when I went out. When I came home, I found a picklock-key in my room-door, and a crow-bar on my bed. Martha Green was all but dead in the kitchen; she was speechless. I found a handkerchief on the bed in the kitchen. Green could not tell me any thing for some time when I came home. I found Best and his wife in the house; they live next door. Directly that he had shewn me the state of my place, I sent him to the Police-Office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Best was the first that told me that the house was robbed. I have known Buttery for five years; he used to come to see my lodgers; the magistrate told us to find him - We found out where he lived; it was at No. 7; Brill-row, Somers-town, he is a music-master. I have paid for his subpoena.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live next door to the prosecutrix. On the day of the robbery, I saw a man looking at her house, about two o'clock; it was the prisoner Hallard, he had a woman with him; they were walking on the opposite side of the way, as if they were looking for a lodging; I took notice of them, as I had a lodging myself to let. I went on, and when I came back, I saw them coming out of No. 4, which is Mrs. Bright's house; it was the same two persons. I am quite positive that the prisoner, Hallard, is the man. I saw him at Hatton-garden, about a week after. About half an hour after, I heard the house had been broken open; I went in and saw the servant there. My wife afterwards went into the house, and remained there two hours.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It is a lodging-house. I will swear that Hallard is the man; I saw him quite sufficient to swear to him. He had a long, loose, dirty great coat on. I returned in about twenty minutes - He had no bundle when he came out. They walked quite leisurely towards Edward-street. I did not see a bundle with either of them. The woman had a great shawl on - She might have many things concealed under it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long would it take to break open thirteen locks - A. You could break open more than thirteen in twenty minutes. Hallard was very stout when he came out, A gentleman called me into the house; I found Green in a very bad state-after a little while, she told me what had happened, as well as she could. She said, that the man had tied her mouth and hands, and fastened her to the bed. When Mrs. Bright came home I went to the Office.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When you first saw Green, in what situation did she appear - A. She was very ill, trembling and shaking; she appeared to be very frightened; I had seen her before. When I first saw her, a gentleman was with her. A person, who had put on the appearance of fright would not appear as she did. I really think that she was frightened. The lock of the drawer was burst open, apparently by the foot, it was wrenched. Green said, that there had been a party in the parlour.</p>

            . I live opposite to Mrs. Bright. I saw a man very much like the prisoner, Hallard, coming out of her house on the same day that the robbery happened-it was about an hour before I heard of the robbery. I saw him go in, and about an hour before the alarm was raised, I saw a man come out, but do not think it was the same man that I saw go in. I saw Hallard at Hatton-garden, about ten days afterwards - He is the man that I saw go into the house - He is very much like him; he is the same man. I will not swear to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The man that I saw go in had a blue coat on; I think I saw him go in about two o'clock, or a quarter after; the servant let him in - I afterwards saw her come out, very much alarmed, and go into Best's house next door. The man that came out had a pint pot in his hand; he did not appear so tall as the man who went in; there was a woman went in with the man; the woman went in, and the man followed her; she shut the door.</p>
               <p>JAMES BOTLAS. I know Mrs. Bright's house, I live opposite to it. On the day of the robbery, I saw two men walking about to and fro, and another went in; I did not see him come out; I saw no woman.</p>

            . I am a police-officer. I went to look after Buttery; he lives at Somers'-town; the servant directed me there; I could not see him, I left a notice with his wife, for him to come here to-day. I went after him last night; they gave me his name. After Best came to the Office, I examined Bright's house, and found it broken open. They said there was a gentleman there; I afterwards learned his name. Green said, a gentleman, who lives at Somers-town, was in the house.</p>

             re-examined. I found the bed-room door broken open, and a skeleton key forced into the lock; I could not get it out. The drawers were broken open and emptied; it appeared to me to have been done with an iron crow; I found one in the room, and compared it with the marks on the drawers-it agreed with them. It would take great strength to break open the door. Green gave me a piece of leather, a piece of canvas, and a piece of dyed cotton. On the 13th of January, I apprehended Hallard, in consequence of the description I received from Green. I took him at a public-house. He asked me if it was concerning a warrant; I told him it was not. He asked what; I told him, if the people could not identify him, I would let him go. As soon as he got to the door of the Office, he ran away. I took him again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was present at all the examinations. Green gave Buttery's address; she said she did not know his name. I went to look for him last night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Rainsford expressly order that he should be brought before him - A. He did; the examination was adjourned, in order to have him produced. I never could find him out. I did not apply to Green to go with me. I thought the man would come forward.</p>
               <p>Q. After Mr. Rainsford directed that the man should be brought forward, why did you not enquire for him - A. I did last night. I have had a great deal of trouble with him to bring him forward. I never attempted to find him till last night.</p>
               <p>ELEANOR BRIGHT re-examined. Limbric never knew where Buttery lived till I went to take out the subpoena, which was on Saturday. I have found him out within the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190035"/>last fortnight; I did not know where he lived till then - A Mrs. Hamilton told me. It was after all the examinations were over.</p>
               <p>MARTHA GREEN re-examined. I knew Buttery's name about a fortnight afterward. His name was not given to the magistrate; it was not known till after the prisoners were committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, that you knew where the person lived - A. I said, I would make every inquiry. I said, I saw him go into a house at Somer's-town. I did not know his name.</p>

I had a bundle under my arm, containing seven yards and a quarter of moreen, which I had been to buy for Mr. Dray, of Tavistock-place. I bought it with my own money. I was going home, towards Broad-street, St. Giles's. The prisoner rushed out from somewhere, and snatched the bundle from under my arm; he struck me on the arm, and pulled the bundle three times-it was on my left arm. My sister had hold of my right arm-it laid across my arm; I held it with my hand; he snatched at it three times - He struck the upper part of my left arm. He struck me as he was taking the bundle; it was the first time that he snatched that he struck me. He took the bundle from me at the third snatch. I fell upon my knees when he snatched it from me - I held it tight. I fell on my knees by the force of the snatch I held the bundle as tight as I could; he struck me with the side of his hand, not very hard. I caught hold of his coat; he got away, and ran up Hampshire Hog-yard; my sister and I ran after him. As he turned round, I had a full view of his face. I am sure that it was the prisoner; I saw him by the light of the shop-window, and a lamp over the corner of the place; I could see him distinctly, and I am quite positive that he is the man. I have such a recollection of him, as to he confident that he is the man - He got away.</p>

            . I was with my sister, and had hold of her right arm. I had been with her to buy the moreen. My sister screamed out as he hit her. He snatched the bundle from her after making three snatches, and ran down Hampshire Hog-yard. When he made the third snatch he got the bundle, and she fell on her knees; she caught hold of the prisoner by his coat, he gave a spring and run up the yard, we ran after him, but lost him-he got away with the bundle; when my sister screamed out, I turned round and saw him by the light of the shop. I saw his face distinctly and the rest of his person. I am sure that the prisoner is the man-it did not last many minutes; he did it in a minute or two. I saw his face when he made the third snatch; the light of the shop reflected on it-nineteen shillings were paid for the moreen. We paid two shillings and sixpence per yard for it.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was in High-street, St. Giles's, in company with Roberts, that evening; I saw the prisoner there, and another man with him, between seven and eight o'clock - I had seen him several times before that. I ordered him to go about his business, and not let me see him there any more; he said he would, and went off very quietly; he had a white coat on at that time. I and Roberts went to the watch-house, and at a little before twelve o'clock we had information of the robbery. On the Monday following, the prosecutrix's father came down to me; I went in search of the prisoner, but could not find him. On the Thursday following, I was going up High-street, and saw the prisoner, and another man, coming from Hampshire Hog-yard. He had an umbrella in his hand, walking. They both went into the coffee-shop. He gave the umbrella to the other man. I crossed over, and asked the man, where he got the umbrella; the prisoner came out. I asked him, what he had done with his white coat; he said, it was old, and that he had given it away. I told him, that he must go with me, and I secured him. I told him that I had information, and by the description which I had received, I thought it was him; he denied it.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM COPE. I am also warehouseman to Messrs. Todd, and Co. I purchase for them. When I buy the articles, I mark the price on them that they are to be sold at; it was the duty of the last witness to sell them for that price.

I put the mark on the goods, and the party who sell them, are to sell them at that price only; they are not at liberty to take a less price. The twelve shawls, the last witness spoke of, were shewn to me. In consequence of what had passed. I accompanied Brand to Mr. Knott's, in Holborn; I saw Littlewood there, and a large quantity of silk goods, that were our property.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. What is the duty of the person when he sells goods - A. He is to see them entered in the day-book immediately. The daybook is kept in the warehouse on the first floor. There are four day-books, they are placed in different parts of the warehouse. If he sells in the lower part of the warehouse, he must go to the back of the warehouse and put them down. They are all took to that part of the warehouse to be entered; the clerk enters them for him. If a person wants their goods immediately, his duty is to see them entered. If he sells for ready money, they are to be entered, but they are sometimes entered after they are delivered, in the warehouse-book. Edwards has lived nine months with Todd, and Co. He was authorized to sell.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. We mark the lowest price on the goods, it is a private mark.</p>
               <p>Q. When a person comes into the shop, he has no means of knowing whether the price asked, is right or not - A.He has not. Goods have been bought at our shop at a very low price - We have bought them at a very low price. The seller has no right to lower the price. I have seen Levick at the shop once, perhaps oftener. When goods are sold, they are put into a drawer kept for the purpose. There are ten drawers, each seller has a drawer.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Knott, who is a linen-draper, and lives in Holborn. I manage his business. I spoke to the prisoner, Levick, to send me twelve shawls, on Tuesday the 11th of January; it was the evening before the shawls were stopped at Messrs. Todd and Co.'s house; a little boy brought them to me - I believe he was in Levick's employ. I saw Levick after they were delivered to me; I told him, that I was not certain whether I should take the twelve shawls or not, meaning those which his boy had brought to me. I gave Potts the same shawls that I spoke to Levick about. Levick was a dealer in those articles, he was in the jobbing line. I only knew him, by his bringing goods for sale. I never enquired how he got them.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body brought them, would you buy without asking how they got them - A. We buy many in that way. Levick named eleven shillings, or eleven shillings and two pence, for each shawl, and I told him, he might send me twelve. I gave them to Potts.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I bought the goods for myself, not for Mr. Knott. Levick has sold Knott those kind of goods. I did not know where he got them.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a common thing for men to job about, and bring goods to the shop with them - A. It is. I do not exactly know the value of the goods; we sometimes buy of the jobbers as agents, and sometimes as principals.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. What quantity of goods of this description, has he sold your master - A. Three or four dozen; we sold them for eighteen or twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q.On your oath what did you sell them for - A.Some for eighteen shillings, others for sixteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say, you did not know the value - A. That is not the value; I bought them for myself.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is it the custom of your trade, for a shopman to buy and sell the same articles as his master - A. I believe it is not customary.</p>
               <p>Q. To under-sell your master in his house, while you are receiving his wages to sell his goods - A. There are shopmen who buy goods without their master's knowledge-we sell them to our private friends. We buy things without enquiring how the parties come by them.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BRAND. I am a City marshalman. The shawls were delivered to me by Mr. Cope, at Mr. Knott's.</p>
               <p>Q. When Levick came to Mr. Knott's, did any conversation take place about them - A. Levick came in, I asked him what he had got; he said, he had got shawls; I asked him, where he purchased them; he said, at Mr. Todd's, and produced a bill of parcels; I told him a suspicion had fallen on Edwards, who was Mr. Todd's servant, and that I found he (Levick), had sold Mr. Knott a quantity of shawls, and asked him how he came by them; he said, he had regularly bought them at Mr. Todd's, at different times, of Edwards; I asked him, if he had bills of what he had bought; he said, he had bought both gloves and shawls at Mr. Todd's, but he believed he had not got bills of all the shawls; I asked him, if he had any more than those he had sold Knott; he said, he had sold different parcels to different persons, and mentioned their names; he said, if he had not got bills of parcels, he had entries in his own book at home, of all the goods which he had bought, and if we would go with him, he would produce his books and show us what documents he had; I asked him, if he had any goods at home, previous to that, we had found a bag of shawls; he said, he had no more to his knowledge - We went home with him, and found thirty-five shawls in a parcel, and two scarfs in a clothes box, one of which he said he had selected for his wife, from a former parcel, and the other for a friend. He produced his book - We found a number of entries of goods bought and sold, of gloves and shawls, but no bills of parcels of shawls, except one; I told him it was a singular way of doing business, by buying goods in large quantities, and having no documents to shew; he said, he had generally bought for ready money, and frequently brought the goods away himself, and sometimes he sent a lad, who was a relation of his, for them. We went down to Mr. Todd's, leaving Levick in a coach in the street, till we had examined Edwards. Edwards was fetched into the parlour, and Mr. Todd asked him, if he knew a man named Levick, and if he had not had some dealings with him; he said, he had known him about two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190037"/>years, and he had at times bought goods; I asked him if he had sold him any shawls, and how many; he said, he had sold him two or three at a time; I asked him, if he could recollect how many he had sold him in all, after a short pause, he said. he believed three dozen to be all he had sold him; I asked him how many he had sold at one time; he said, two or three or so, but being pressed, he said, he believed he had sold him as many as sixteen, and at another time eight, which was the eight that Levick had bought that morning. I repeated the questions as to the number of the whole, and he gave the same answers. I asked him what he had done with the money, and if they were paid for; he said he had always placed it to his master's account. (I should have mentioned that in the course of the conversation with Levick; he said he had paid Edwards a 50l. note, for goods; I understood him it was the day before; he said that he had the number of the note). I questioned Edwards as to the receipt of the note, and he acknowledged receiving it. I asked him what he had done with it, he said he had left it on the warehouse mantle-piece when he had sold the goods, and went down stairs, leaving Levick in the warehouse, and when he returned the 50l. note was gone, and he knew nothing further of it. I asked him why he did not pay it to the account of his master; he said he intended to have the goods back that Levick had had, and to return him his money; we then questioned him whether he had made entries in the books of the money he had received; he acknowledged that he had not. I told him that I had Levick outside, and brought him up. Edwards said, he had sold the things to Levick. I afterwards found the 50l. note in the ceiling of the cellar of Mr. Todd's house, there was 138l. in all, there, including the 50l. note, and a letter with it (I produce it).</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN JOHNSTON. The prisoner, Levick, lived servant with me, he left my service about a month ago. I had an opportunity of seeing his hand-writing, it looks like his hand-writing; it is in pencil, I believe it to be his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>WM. BRAND. The note is directed to Mr. Edwards-(reads)-"Mr. Levick will be obliged to Edwards to send by bearer, twelve shawls; and to say how many more he has on hand, and the price of the damask scarfs Mr. L. looked at, with 35s. per cent. off." I told Levick that I had discovered the 50l. note that he had paid Edwards, and that the number he had given answered; he appeared glad of it. I asked Levick about the different payments he had made, and if he had paid for all his goods; he said he had not, for there was a balance due to the firm; he said, that he had been dealing with Todds, through Edwards (I produce the shawls).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Edwards told me that he had not paid the money, because he hoped to get the goods back, as he had done wrong.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I only knew where Levick lived, by his telling me it was 75, Portland-street. We found the shawls laying open on the table, in the first room we entered; he told me the number of the 50l. note. He said he considered himself as dealing with Todd, through Edwards, as his servant.</p>

            , and John Edward Todd; after the discovery was made, the prisoners were together, in my presence, Edwards charged Levick with having biassed his mind; that observation was in answer to my question, whether he had taken off a discount; he replied, that he did not himself understand discount, but that Levick had biassed his mind. I asked him how the balance of money was to have been paid, seeing that he had made no entry of the goods in our books; Edwards said, that they were to have had a meeting that afternoon or evening, when it was to have been fully arranged.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Edwards had been nine months in our service; we have considerable property exposed to the mercy of our servants. I never suspected him before, but always had a very high opinion of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I may have seen Levick at our house; but do not remember seeing him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know of his dealing with you for a considerable number of bandanas - A.Only from an invoice which he gave up, it was regularly made by people in our employ. I do not remember seeing him before he was taken; he had a regular invoice of some of the things, but not for these articles; he produced two more invoices of other shawls.</p>
               <p>Q. When Edwards said Levick had biassed his mind, did it arise from an observation about discount - A. I had asked Edwards, generally, about the robbery, his answer was, that he was biassed.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are we to understand you, that he meant to say, that his mind was biassed by Levick, as well as to the robbery, as the discount - A.Certainly so.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he not say, that Levick was not to blame - A. Not a word like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say so - A. I might have made an observation of that kind, when we were going to his house, before we were aware of things.</p>
               <p>Court. Are we to understand you, that Edwards said to Levick, that he had been biassed both with respect to the robbery, as well as discounts - A. I understood him to say so, he spoke generally, I had spoken to him about discounts.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM THOMAS. I was also employed in Messrs. Todd and Co.'s warehouse. I remember Levick dealing with Edwards for some shawls, on the 8th of March, they are the same kind of shawls; he said he had given a guinea for worse some time back, he bought eight; I do not know what he paid for them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. He did not say how long ago. I have not known such a falling in price, as from 21s. to 12s. I never knew such a difference.</p>

             re-examined. I have an invoice of some shawls, which I purchased on the 12th, the price paid for them was 15s. 9d. they are the same sort, not quite so good in quality as were offered at our shop for 11s. 3d.; the shawls for which 11s. 3d., was offered, were better shawls than those that I paid 15s. 9d. for, the same day, they are worth 18s. The shawls produced are my master's property, they were brought to me by Crow, they have our private mark on them, made by myself. We do not always take the private mark off the goods when they are sold; we generally take it off, if the purchase<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190038"/>takes them with him we should not take it off. We may have sold several hundred of them.</p>

            , chief clerk to the magistrates at Guildhall, was then called, who read the examination of Edwards, wherein he stated, that he had been in the habit of selling goods to Levick, and that the money was not entered in his master's books, and that he intended to get the goods back.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, Levick, put in an exceeding long defence, stating, that the whole of his dealings with the prisoner, Edwards, were publicly before the rest of the persons in the warehouse; and that he was in the habit of buying goods cheap, and selling them again. That Edwards told him Messrs. Todd and Co. were in the habit of purchasing goods very low, and he always considered himself as dealing with Edwards as their servant, in the presence of the rest of the servants; and that Mr. Morrison had often seen him dealing with Edwards.</p>

            . I am warehouseman to Messrs. Todd and Co. - I have often seen the prisoner, Levick, at Messrs. Todds', and have asked him if I should serve him, but he would not let me-he said he would wait for Mr. Edwards. I sold in the same department as Mr. Edwards. When Edwards has been engaged, Levick has waited, from five to ten minutes, for him, after I had offered to serve him-he was always served by Edwards.</p>
               <p>MR. NOTT. I am a linen-draper. Levick has sold me shawls two or three times - He did not keep a shop. I bought goods of him when he lived with Johnston in the jobbing line. We buy shawls, from 8s. to 18s.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. When he brought goods to your shop, did he not tell you he bought them of distressed tradesman? - A. Yes, he did. I never inquired how he came by the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the way you trade. - A. I understood him to be a partner with Johnston.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN JOHNSTON. The prisoner, Levick, has been in my service-he has left me about a month. I did not know of his doing business on his own account while he lived with me. He had a commission from me for selling hosiery and lace, but not for silks-silk is out of my line. I should not allow him to deal in any goods but mine.</p>
               <p>MR. WILLIAM EVERINGTON. I am a linen-draper, I live on Ludgate-hill; Levick has sold me shawls - He described himself as a partner with Mr. Johnston.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Did he not tell you he had them from the country. - A. He did - He said he had them from Macclesfield.</p>

I asked him if he had bought any paper of Hempstead; he said he had bought a ream, and produced it; he said he was to give 17s. for it. We asked Hempstead if he had sold him any thing else - He said he had sold him six packs of cards.

I received 14l. 7s.; it was about two o'clock in the afternoon. About twelve o'clock the same night, I was passing by St. James's Church, near Old-street, St. Luke's - I was perfectly sober - I had been to Drury-lane Theatre<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190039"/>with some of my shipmates; I had not taken any lodging; I came from the play between nine and ten o'clock; I fell in with two women in the street, who asked me to treat them.

             was one of them. John Hiett was not with them at the time. I do not know where the public-house was; I stopped with them nearly an hour, and treated them with supper; we came out of the public-house together, and then took a coach. I told the coachman to drive to Whitechapel; both of the women got into the coach with me; it drove to Old-street, near the Lying-in-Hospital. We went to a room where they told me that they lived; I was perfectly sober at the time, and am quite sure that I had 7l. 12s. 6d. about me at the time. I bought some clothes before I went to the play. I went to their room, as the room of two women of the town; it was in <placeName id="t18170219-70-crimeloc394">James-court</placeName>

When Eleanor Hiett returned, they both stopped with me. I took off my clothes, and went to bed. After I had got into bed, the other woman said she was ill, and left me; she did not return again. After she was gone, two men came up stairs; there was only one bed in the room. The prisoner, Eleanor Hiett, put out the candle - They came in after she put it out-she left the room as soon as they came in. When I got into bed my money was in my fob-my notes were there. The men came in immediately as she put out the light, before she left the room. She had no opportunity of taking my money before the men came in. I took my trowsers, and put them under my arm, and went to the door, meaning to go out, but they stopped me. The room-door was open. One of them opened a knife; there was a light that came through the window; I could see what passed in the room perfectly well; it was a bright light. I could not see any light in the passage. One of the men caught me by the collar, and the other seized my clothes from under my arm, and took my money out; the other man was holding me by my shirt-collar. The man who took my trowsers, took seven 1l. notes out. I saw him take them, and give them to the other man; they counted them in the room, at the window, before my face. He said,"there is only seven," and came back to me, and asked me if I had any more. He had the knife open in his hand. I was frightened at two men, and one with a drawn knife. I said, I believed that I had no more. He shook my under-waistcoat pocket, and said, "You lie; there is more money here." There was 11s. 6d. there - He took that also. They went down stairs, and I followed them.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time they came to you and took the money, did they say any thing to you - A. He gave me no reason for taking it; he said, I should not lose it. When he counted the money, he said, "Do not be afraid, mate, you shall not lose it." He said nothing about the women. He did not accuse me of getting into company with his wife.

I dressed myself, and as soon as I got my clothes on, I came down - They did not leave the room until I had dressed myself; they ran down first, and I followed them. They ran into James-street - I lost them. James-court comes into James-street. I went to a light, and called out, Stop thief as soon as I got down. I am quite sure that there was light enough for me to see that the prisoner, John Hiett, is the man who had the knife in his hand. I went into a house about three doors further, where I saw a light, at the opposite side of the court, and told a woman; she dressed herself, and we went to the watch-house and gave information. After this, I went back with her, and laid down by her fire-place; she went to bed with her husband. About nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner,

I searched him in a baker's shop, and found 2s. 6d. in copper, and 11s. in silver in his jacket pocket, and in his fob I found two 1l. notes.

He said, Mr. Sims, the owner of the ship, had paid him the money. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190040"/>asked him if he was sure that Mr. Sims had paid him the money.

He came there about ten o'clock, with Seneway, who lodges there, he left the house about eleven o'clock at night. I gave Seneway the key, (the prisoner was with him) to let themselves in. About five o'clock in the morning, I heard somebody coming down stairs; I did not hear him come in again. I sleep in the parlour. I asked who was there three times - No answer was given. I heard the watchman call five o'clock in the morning, it was quite dark in the room, the shutters were to. I heard the street door open, it was bolted and locked. I heard him unlock the door; he went away. When I got up in the morning, I missed a large shawl which hung on a line, and a jacket which belonged to a gentleman, whom I wash for. I got up about eight o'clock in the morning; I missed nothing else-that was all that belonged to me. The jacket hung on a line, in the same room in which I slept. They must go through my room to go up stairs. It was a white linen jacket. I had only let Seneway the lodging three weeks.</p>

            . I was in company with the prisoner. I met with him at the Kettle-Drum, in Denmark-street, and took him to my lodgings about half-past ten o'clock at night, he went in with me; it was on the 22d of February. I lodge in the one pair of stairs; he was to sleep with me that night. We went out about half-past eleven o'clock, he went with me. Mrs. Williams gave me the key; I returned with the prisoner to my lodgings about twelve o'clock, he went into my room with me; he said, it was too late for him to go home, and he would sleep in my room that night. We let ourselves in with the key, and left the key on the table in my room. I am quite sure that I locked the door when I went in. The prisoner slept in the same bed with me. We both got up about three o'clock in the morning; he wanted to go into the yard. I went down with him. We returned to bed again. I awoke at half-past four o'clock - He was not gone then. I awoke again at half-past seven-the prisoner was then gone. I found the key of the street door on the table. It is a spring lock and goes back without the key. I missed the things I had taken off the overnight; it was a pair of trowsers, value 12s., a waistcoat, a silk handkerchief, a jacket, some stockings, and two 1l. notes. The prisoner was taken up the same morning about half-past eight o'clock; he had my clothes on.</p>

I asked the prisoner about the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190041"/>money; he said, if I would go to a public-house, he would produce the two 1l. notes; he afterwards, said, that he did take the shawl.

            . I am a watchman. On the 14th of February, about half-past five in the morning, the prisoner passed me with something under his great coat, I asked him what it was, and he ran away. I followed him; he fell down and the pump fell from him. I secured him. I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>RICHARD PLUMPKIN. The prisoner was brought into the watch-house. I asked him where he got the property; he said, he found it. When I left the watch-house, I found a key in the lock-up-room, and asked the prisoner, why he concealed it there; he said, "what, my master's street-door key!" nobody else had been in the room but the prisoner.</p>

Jones and Simon's shop, and look at the pelisses; I watched him, and saw him throw the sleeve over the bar, he then walked about, and then went up and took it and ran away. I am sure the prisoner is the man. I saw him again on the 9th, but could not leave the place where I was, it was at an Exhibition. I described him to the constable, and he took him.</p>

               <p>GEORGE SHEWNEY. I am a bricklayer. I was at work on the top of a house in Charlotte-street, and saw the prisoner and three more go by the shop. The prisoner took the flannel in his hand and looked at it. The three men went to the corner, and the prisoner went up to them - They talked together for five minutes, and the prisoner and another man walked as far as a jeweller's shop, and came back to the other men. The other men took the flannel, and the prisoner took it and put it under his arm, and ran up Goodge-street. In about five minutes he returned again. I sent to Mr. Harris, and we went into Percy-street after the prisoner, and took him. I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I am a linen-draper, in Bishopsgate-street. On the 23rd of January, the prisoner came to my shop about four o'clock in the afternoon, and asked for some handkerchiefs - I asked him 2s. for one; he offered me 1s. 6d. for it - I refused to take it. He desired me to cut one off. I asked him for the money - He put a 3s. token in my hand; a person came in, and told me to detain him and the token-(looking at one)-this is the token he offered me. The officer took him - He struck the officer, and tried to escape.</p>

               <p>THOMAS SAPWELL. I am a beadle. I went into Pratt's shop and took the prisoner. I searched him, and found 3s. 8d. in loose copper in his pockets, and a 5s. paper of halfpence, and seven 1s. 6d. tokens, all good, and a counterfeit shilling (looking at one)-that is it. He behaved very violent.</p>
               <p>VALENTINE TOONE. I am a hosier, and live in Bishopsgate-street, about twenty doors from Mr. Pratt. On the 29th of January, the prisoner came into my shop, about four o'clock in the afternoon - He asked the price of some stockings, and gave me a 3s. token - I told him it was bad; he took it up and went out with it, and brought me another. I watched him into Twell's, and told Sapwell of it.</p>
               <p>GRIFFITH EDWARDS. I am shopman to Mr. Twell, in Bishopsgate-street. On the 29th of January, about four o'clock, the prisoner came into our shop and looked at a handkerchief, which came to 2s.; he tendered me a 3s. token. I told him it was bad, and asked him if he had got another - He said, No, and went away.</p>

            . I live in Red Lion-street, Spitalfields. On the 29th of January, I was at a public-house, and saw the prisoner there; he had some beer, and tendered a 3s. piece; the man said it was bad, and I saw it was bad; he said he had no more money, except two-pence-halfpenny, and the man took it for the beer, which was one farthing short. I afterwards watched him into several shops.</p>
               <p>MR. JAMES THURGOOD. The token resembles those issued by the Bank-it is counterfeit-the shilling also is counterfeit-it is only washed; they have never been in circulation.</p>

I have a violin and bow, and a silver watch-the watch was offered to pledge about two o'clock in the afternoon of the 22d of January, by the prisoner. I had information that they had been stolen. and detained the prisoner. He had only the violin and bow with him at the time. He said, that he gave 30s. for the watch some years back - He afterwards said he gave a Jew 12s. for it last Monday. He wanted me to let him go. I went to the shop-door to look for the man - I had sent for the prosecutor, and he ran out at the side-door. I stopped him, and took him to the watch-house. He then said, he had left some things in a bag behind the counter, he desired me to get them-they were the violin and gaiters; he had the gaiters on his legs when he came into the shop, but while I detained him, he took them off, and put them into the bag.</p>

I saw the house when the prisoner was taken, on the 15th of February, and found the waterpipe completely twisted off, and laid on the ground in the yard. It was worth 3s.

            . I am an headborough. About one o'clock in the morning, of the 5th of February, I found the padlock of the outer-door loose. We went into the house and found the leaden cistern taken - We went to the house about six o'clock in the morning, with Byrne and Hall; we found nobody there. We went into the front room, and in about a quarter of an hour, I heard the door open, and footsteps come in; the door was shut. We went into the back room which leads into the yard, and found the prisoner there. We found a crow-bar in the yard. The padlock of the door appeared to have been forced by the crow-bar. We watched the house from ten o'clock till six.</p>
               <p>FLINT re-examined. I was with them. The pipe was taken away, it was safe the last time I was there. The crow-bar was there. I compared the crow-bar with the marks in the sink of the cistern-it fitted. When we went out, we left the padlock on the door, as if it was shut; nobody could tell that it was open. The sink was worth fifteen shillings.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. On Monday the 17th of February, about ten minutes before seven o'clock in the morning, I was going to do some work at Mrs. Brown's house, No. 5, Devonshire-street. I put the key in the door, and found it unlocked, there was something behind it, I could not open it. I found two men behind the door with loads on their backs. I took hold of a man who dropped his load and knocked me down, and gave me a black eye. My fellow workman struck one of them a violent blow over his arm with his axe - They both ran away. The man pursued and brought the prisoner back. I believe the prisoner to be one of the men. He left his hat and knot in the house. When the prisoner was taken to the watch-house, he sent to the house for his hat. He had the copper on his head and some lead.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 1st of February, I saw the two prisoners and another man, coming along with the beef; I asked them what they had got; they said it was beef, which they had bought at Hoxton. The prisoner, Holmes, had it in his hand - He ran away when I took hold of him.</p>

My window, except the sky-light, is covered with lead, it was safe when I went to bed at half-past eleven o'clock; I hold the house of Messrs. Reid and Co. When I went to bed I heard a noise over my head, I looked out of the window, and saw a man cutting the lead - He was dressed in white trowsers and had no hat on - He was folding the lead flat. I called out to him, what are you doing, and stop thief! I saw him drop over the parapet-wall. I got a light and found the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190047"/>lead was entirely moved off the place that it was cut from, and folded up. I do not know whether the prisoner is the man, or not.</p>

On the 1st of February, I was crossing towards Mr. Powell's house, I heard the cry of stop thief! and saw a man in white trowsers jump off the place; I was about six yards from him. He ran away - I pursued him, and never lost sight of him till he was stopped. The prisoner is the man. He had no hat on. He was taken not far from the spot. I am sure I never lost sight of him.</p>

I stopped Burton, and brought her back; I took the bundle from her-it contained the articles stated in the indictment - They were carelessly tied up.

            . I am foreman to Mr. Deacon. I missed some wood. I saw the prisoner go out on the evening of the 25th, and thought he had something under his coat. I told Mr. Deacon of it. I went to the prisoner's house, and found five chair-back legs, which were Mr. Deacon's property. I asked the prisoner what he did with them - He said, they were not Mr. Deacon's, for he had had them by him for a long time, and had cut them by a mould which he had made at the place he worked at, before he came to our place. He went with me to Mr. Deacon's. He denied taking them. Mr. Deacon went for his great coat, and the prisoner told me he hoped he would not be hard with him, for he had only taken two back feet, and it being such a trifle, he hoped he would look over it. I told him, I hoped this was all, as I missed other things. He said, he had no more. I told him Mr. Deacon had sent for a constable. Mr. Deacon came back, and I told him, that the prisoner confessed taking the chair-feet. The prisoner kneeled down, and begged of him to forgive him - He was taken into custody. On the 27th of January, we took out a search-warrant, and went to his house, and found the property stated in the indictment; some of it was wrapped up in sheets in the bed, some in another bed, and some on the drawers, and a great deal under the staircase in the cellar; we also found several tools, one of which had Mr. Deacon's name on it.

We first went to Cork, from there to Madeira, from there to Trade Town on the coast of Africa; we traded there - We came to Calabar in the August following. In October, the captain was taken ill and died, upon which the prisoner succeeded him - I was then made mate. The ship went eighty or ninety miles up the Calabar river; the Qua river flows into the Calabar river, before it goes into the sea. Before we arrived at Calabar, we had some irons on board, they were not proper handcuffs, but were intended for handcuffs; five of them were taken from the ship, and put on board a Portuguese schooner. When we were up the river, the prisoner told me, there was a cargo of slaves for me to carry, belonging to Duke Ephraim. We had a schooner on board. While we were on the coast of Africa, it was used to carry ivory and blackwood. When we were at Calabar, the prisoner ordered the ships bulk-head to be knocked in, to make a bulk-head to the schooner with it, to divide the male and female slaves; the ivory and wood could be better stowed in the schooner without this partition. This alteration was made the morning before I went with the slaves; I went on there for palm oil, and returned on board the ship in the afternoon, and the prisoner told me, that the schooner was ready to take in the slaves. The partition had been put up while I was on shore. I was ordered to bed at seven o'clock in the evening, and called up at ten o'clock, by James<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190052"/>Renton the steward; he told me, that the canoe was coming, I got up, it proved to be a canoe of yams; I did not know that they were coming. When I got on deck, Renton was there, the canoe went alongside the schooner that was along side our ship; the yams were put into the schooner. I was called down into the cabin - I found the prisoner there. I left Renton on deck, looking out for the slave-canoe. The prisoner said, there is a cargo of slaves, call at Qua River, at which place you will get ten more - I went on deck, and in ten minutes another canoe came with slaves. The prisoner told me, to make the best bargain I could for the slaves, for the good of himself and the owners. I was to take the ten slaves to Camarooms, about three hundred miles south, down the coast, by the prisoner's orders; he said, keep in shore, whatever you do. If a Man of War's boat, or a Man of War falls in with you, they will take you, and condemn the ship. When the canoe came, it had nine black men and twelve women slaves; they were brought alongside the schooner tied hand and foot. The men were put in the fore hold and the women in the cabin, on board the schooner.

             and I went on board the schooner, we took water, beef, and brandy, from the ship with us; we had four muskets, six cartridge-boxes, two pistols, and four cutlasses; two men belonging to Calabar went with us to assist us. While the slaves were being removed out of the canoe into the schooner, the prisoner told me to count them, I counted twenty-one and told him so; he was on deck when the canoe first arrived, and saw them moved from the canoe to the schooner, and told us to shove broad off, and make the best of our way to Qua River-this was between ten and eleven o'clock at night, in January or February. We proceeded to Qua River and got one female slave there, and then proceeded to Camarooms with the slaves. When we got there, a Portuguese boat came alongside with King Aqua in it; he said, he could not purchase them. The Portuguese captain said he would, as he kept them in his factory on shore - I said, very well; and they were taken on shore that night. I went with them, and made an agreement with the captain, to have a pipe of brandy, two gang casks, which contain about thirty gallons each, two barrels of gunpowder, sixty iron bars, and two pieces of Manchester cloth, for the twenty-one slaves. We brought one female slave back, because she had a sore leg, and the articles that we had bargained for. On our return, we reported what we had down to the prisoner, and shewed him my book, containing an account of what we had got in exchange for the slaves. The brandy was taken on board, and the rest of the things went on shore with the female slave. I used to keep the log-book ever since the 25th of October; after I had sold the slaves, I asked the prisoner, if I should enter the slaves in the log-book, he said, "No, do not do that whatever you do; it will be worse for ourselves." Five of the handcuffs, were sent on board the Portuguese schooner at Calabar, a little before we went with the slaves; they kept three pair and returned two, as they were to small. One of the slaves had jumped over-board of the Portuguese vessel; Duke Ephraim, who was on board at the time, asked me if there were any irons; this was another slave ship, which lay alongside our ship. The prisoner ordered Renton to bring them up, and put them in the Portuguese canoe which came alongside our ship. The handcuffs were first put on board our ship at Liverpool; in the course of the voyage two pari had been put on our men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. The Portuguese ship was not the same that I afterwards saw at Camarooms. I had been at Africa twice before this. The prisoner was on board when we sailed for Liverpool. We were in the Calabar river when the captain died. Duke Ephraim spoke English. The bulk-head was taken down to make room for a cargo of oil; there was one taken down for that purpose six months before, and the materials were thrown away. We did not keep regular watch at Calabar. We go quite to another part of the coast to King Aqua.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not the slaves carried for Duke Ephraim, the prisoner having no property in them - A. I do not know. I was never told, that I should be prosecuted for this transaction.</p>

The prisoner then asked one of the Duke's men if that was all, the man said, "all at this time," but the schooner is to go between Parracloud and Qua River and will receive more; the yams and plantains were took on board the schooner, with some beef, bread, and rum. The prisoner told Evans to shove broad-off, and make the best of his way to Camarooms, to make the best of them that he could, and to deliver them to King Aqua, who would see them properly disposed of;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190053"/>their hands were tied-the men were put in the hold, and the women in the aft, with the bulk-head between them; their feet were loose. The schooner was absent about twelve days, and then returned. I was on board the James when she returned; she brought rum, cloth, powder, and iron bars, part of which was sent on shore, and the other part was received on board our ship. One of Duke Ephraim's canoes took it to shore. There was a Portuguese vessel at Calabar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Part of the rum was sent on shore afterwards-some of it was taken in gang casks-the rest was kept on board for the ship's use. The schooner had been trading for the ship before. When she took arms with her, it was to sell them.</p>

            . I shipped myself on board the James. We went to the coast of Africa. The captain died and the prisoner took the command. We took the schooner with us from Liverpool. We had the bulk-head of the schooner taken out to make her hold more oil; she was employed to carry oil, ivory, and wood, we could carry more ivory without the bulk-head. The bulk-head was put up again in the same way, and the floor laid, by the prisoner's orders-the materials were taken from the ships bulk-head, which was broken down for that purpose. As soon as this was done, the prisoner told me to go on shore, and tell Duke Ephraim that all was ready - I did so; and the Duke said, very well. I returned on board and told the prisoner, Duke Ephraim was on board the ship, when I returned. The next morning a canoe came from the shore alongside the schooner, which was alongside the ship, and brought some yams and plantains, which is negro food, and put them on board the schooner-the bulk-head made a division in the schooner; after this, the canoe went ashore and another canoe came with black slaves; this was at night. Renton, Evans, the prisoner, and I were on deck, the rest of the crew were in bed. I was boatswain. There were twenty-one slaves, in all, male and female; some of them were about thirteen years old, apparently. There was about five guards with them, who had fire-arms. The slaves were naked. The men had their hands tied before them, quite helpless; they were put in the hold, and the women were put aft, with a partition between them. The prisoner gave orders for taking them in; he then asked Evans if he was ready, and told him to shove broad-off and go away. The canoe went ashore. Some of the guards went into the schooner with Evans and Decam-it returned in about thirteen days. Evans and the schooner was absent from the ship all that time. He brought some liquor in a pipe, two gang casks, cloth, and iron; I believe the liquor was Portuguese brandy. The prisoner was on board when the schooner returned. The liquor was brought on deck, and the other things remained in the schooner-one of the female slaves returned with them; she had a sore thigh and was sent on shore with the guards. We afterwards returned to England.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Some of the brandy was drank by the ship's crew.</p>

On the 13th of January, I came to town to buy cheese, bacon, seeds, and other things for my business.

Several persons came to my assistance; the goods were all put in, and the persons went into the Bull and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190055"/>Butcher, after I had satisfied them for their trouble. I went into the Bull, which is about a quarter of a mile farther, and left my cart in the Bull yard, with the goods in it. When I got up, at six o'clock in the morning, I missed the articles stated in the indictment. I sent for the patrol, and we went to the Bull and Butcher, and searched the premises, and found a piece of blank paper in the stable where Hutchinson worked. I thought it was the paper in which some of my sugar was wrapped, and gave Hutchinson in charge.</p>
               <p>NATHAN JACKSON. I am a patrol of Bow-street. I went with Freeman to the Bull and Butcher, a little before eight o'clock in the morning. We found a piece of paper in the stables, and took Hutchinson up; he was at work there; he gave me some information, and we went to the prisoner, Ashwell's house, which is about a quarter of a mile from the Bull and Butcher; he was not at home. We found two sides of bacon, three cheeses, and a bag of seeds there. After that, I went to the prisoner, Fox's house, and found one side of bacon under his mattress, and a cheese under his bed, with a piece cut out of it, and some oatmeal in a bag. The night before this, I had seen Hutchinson, Ashwell, Johnson, and Beech, in company, at the Bull and Butcher, about twelve o'clock. I heard Ashwell say, "we will go down to the Bull, and see what is to be done with the old cheeseman, and see if there is any bacon or cheese to be had." Fox was not with them. They went away. I took Ashwell afterwards at the Bull and Butcher. Hutchinson had told me that two sides of bacon and three cheeses were at his house; he cried, and said they were there - I afterwards found them there. I took beech and Johnston at the same time. I told them I had been with the others that took the property - They made no reply. I took Fox about an hour after, at his own house. I told him Hutchinson said, that he awoke him in the morning, and said that he had stolen the things, and offered him half to keep them in his house, as he did not like them to be in the stable - He did not deny it. When he came to Hutchinson, he said, "You have brought me into a pretty job."</p>

            . I was horse-keeper at the Bull and Butcher. When the cart broke down, I, with Ashwell, Beech, and Johnston, helped the goods in again. I was with them at twelve o'clock, and Ashwell said he would go down to the Bull, and see the old cheeseman, and have some beer. I went there with him, Beech and Johnston; we had some beer, and when we came out, we went to the gates to see if we could get round to Freeman's cart. Ashwell said,</p>
               <p>"we will get round to it." Ashwell, Beech, Johnson, and I, went to the gates, and Beech lifted me up. I got over the gate, and unfastened it, let them in, and shut it again; we all went in, and each loaded himself with what he liked. We took three sides of bacon, four cheeses, and a bag of seeds, and brought them to my stables. One piece of bacon, one cheese, and some oatmeal, were left for me; they said they would take the rest to Ashwell's house. I took them to Fox's house about five o'clock in the morning. I knocked at the door, he got up - He was not with us the night before. I took them into his house - He shut the door. I told him they came from an old man's cart, which had been overturned by the Bull and Butcher, and that I had fetched them from the Bull Inn yard, and mentioned the party. I told him, if he would take care of them, he should have half for his trouble. He said he would, and that I might have it cookde at his house. I left the bacon against the bed, and stood the cheese against the wall. I breakfasted with him, and went to my work-the officer took me up, and I told him about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. We were not alone at the public-house-anybody might have heard what Ashwell said. Ashwell did not pay the rest for their shares. I was in the stable when they took me they took a piece of paper out of the binn.</p>

            . I work at Mr. Bryan's, trunk-maker, Ludgate-hill. On the 5th of February, about a quarter after nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came into our shop, and asked if he might leave the things there till four o'clock. I never saw him before. I gave him leave, and he went away. At a quarter before one, he came for them. - I had got the officer in attendance at the time; he asked the prisoner if the property was his; he said it was, and that he had brought it from an hotel. The officer said he would go with him. There was a French grammar among the things, which had the prosecutor's name in it.</p>

I desired him to shew me the hotel - He took me to the Swan with two Necks. I found he had been there, but they knew nothing about him.

            . I am a watch-house-keeper. The prosecutor was brought into the watch-house intoxicated, about one o'clock. He was put into the lock-up-room, and went to sleep. The prisoner was afterwards brought in, charged with some offence. I searched him - He had no watch about him then; I put him into the same room with the prosecutor - nobody else was in the room that night. About four o'clock, the prosecutor got sober, and complained of losing his watch and money - He said he had it safe when he was brought in. I found the watch in the prisoner's stocking, on his leg-Hall claimed it.</p>

I saw him cutting the seals off, and said, "he is cutting your seals off," and took hold of his hand. Mr. Meredith laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>BOWEN DUNN MEREDITH. I live in Whitechapel-road. Between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, on the 31st of January, I was in Jennings's shop, Mine told me the prisoner was cutting my seals off - I caught him by the collar. My seals were safe when I went into the shop, I missed them, and distinctly saw the prisoner drop them. The seals and key were found just behind him; I found a pair of scissars in another part of the shop. My watch ribbon appeared to be cut with scissars.</p>

            . I am a poulterer, and live in Shoreditch. On the 6th of February I bought the ducks of the prisoner, and put them out at my shop for sale. I gave him six shillings for them, about six o'clcok in the evening, he had asked me in the afternoon, if I would buy any ducks, and I told him I would look at them. I knew him before, he lived near Hackney. He told me he had bred them; the next day the prosecutor claimed them. Armstrong was passing at the time, and he went with me and apprehended the prisoner, at his lodgings, behind the prosecutor's house; he said he took them through distress.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 15th of January, about seven o'clock in the morning, I was standing in Long-alley, about twenty yards from Anderson's shop, and a man came by with an apron full of meat, three more of his companions came up to him and looked in his apron, another man came by with an apron full of something, the three went to the shop and my son followed them; my son came back and said, they had broken the shop open, and that he had watched them; and told me that one was coming towards us, with a piece of meat under his coat; I secured him - He threw the meat at me and ran up Crown-street; my son followed him. I believe it was the prisoner. I will not swear to him.</p>

I was standing in Long-alley, with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190060"/>my father, and saw a man go by with an apron full of something, three other men met him, and looked into it; another man came up with something in his apron, but I do not know what - He went in the same direction; the three men came as from Anderson's. I then saw the prisoner go towards the shop. I am positive that he is the man, I knew him before - He went across to Anderson's shop; the other three were walking on the opposite side of the way. When the people were gone by, all four went up to Mr. Anderson's shutters, and put their arms as if they were getting something out of the shop. I was on the other side of the way. I then saw the prisoner come away from them, and put something under the left side of his coat - I went and told my father; he attempted to stop him, when the prisoner threw a loin of pork from under his coat, I ran after him, calling stop thief! but he got away. On the Monday following I saw him in George-alley, I ran to Worship-street, and Garton went with me and took him. Anderson's shutters were pushed in at the top, there was sufficient room to get out the meat. The rails were stripped as far as they could reach. I carried the pork back to Anderson.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 22d of January, about half-past nine o'clcok in the morning, I heard of the robbery, and about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prosecutor gave the prisoner in my charge. I found one 5l. and three 1l. bank-notes on him, and two foreign gold coins, two guineas, one half-guinea, and a gold ring, in his shirt. The prosecutor claimed them. The prisoner begged for mercy, and said he had changed the 10l. note, but could not tell where, as he was drunk; he said he would make it up the first voyage he went.</p>

I pursued him; he ran down Gun-street - I lost him. About twenty minutes after, they both passed the shop again - I ran out and secured him.

On the 7th of February, about nine o'clock in the morning, I was going up stairs, and saw the prisoner in the shop; I watched him. The young woman handed him down the ribbon box; he put his hand into the box, as if he was pointing at a piece. I saw him put a piece up his sleeve, and then into his pocket-he paid for one yard of ribbon. He then had another box down, and took another piece, and put it into his pocket. He bought two yards. He was going out - I stopped him and searched him. I took two pieces of ribbon out of his pocket, and found another piece on him. There were forty-three yards altogether. He pleaded distress. He had one shilling and threepence in his pocket, and several small pieces of ribbon.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live in Brick-lane. The prisoner brought me the rug, counterpane, and blanket - She said she was selling them for a person in distress; I told her to call again. Before she called, Mrs. Fairman came to know if I had the things. I shewed them to her - She knew them to be the things that her husband was taken up for stealing. The prisoner came soon after, and I told her they were stolen, and that a man had been taken up for stealing them. She said it served him right, for she was selling them for him.</p>
