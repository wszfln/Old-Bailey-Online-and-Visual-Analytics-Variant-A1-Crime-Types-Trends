Kirby, or order, signed "Alfred Clarke"—I told him I did not know the bank nor T. F. Kirby—I agreed to pay him £2, and the balance if honoured—he said the bank was all right, and Kirby had money in the bank, and he said, "I am an old <hi rend="italic">pal</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Clifford, and I would not do a cheque that was not right"—"<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Clifford" is Mr. Clifford, of the Black Swan—I paid it into the bank, I believe, the same day—it came back to me marked, as it is, "No account"—I applied for a warrant at the Mansion House—then I got a letter and a telegram expressing regret at the annoyance, and enclosing the balance.</p>

On October 3rd I was employed as watchman at Hampstead Lane, on the Regent's Canal—about 11 p.m. I was under a little archway—three women were on the bridge above me, coming from Chalk Farm Bridge towards the Oval Road Bridge—they all had white aprons on—they started quarrelling and using very bad language to one another—I told them to clear off, and they used a foul expression to me—I said I should blow my whistle and get a policeman if they did not clear off—they went along the towing-path towards the Oval Bridge—after they were out of my sight I heard one say, "You b——I will do</p>

                  </hi>. I am Deputy Coroner for Central London—I was present at the inquest held by Dr. Danford Thomas concerning Gertrude Dick—I took down the evidence given—both the prisoners were present—they each gave evidence on oath—they were cautioned by the Coroner—they affixed their marks to what was written down—these are the two statements: Adamson, on oath, said: "I am a single woman, and used to do charing. I lived at 71, Kennedy Court, King's Cross, Holborn, for about 12 months sometimes. I have known the woman as Louisa Josephine for about 12 months, but not to speak to lately. I have known the deceased as <hi rend="italic">Gertie</hi> about 12 months. On Wednesday last we had all three been drinking after meeting in a road round Primrose Hill, and, coming through the top of High Street, where the canal is, there were some few words between us about Louisa's <hi rend="italic">chap.</hi> A watchman came to us and took hold of our hands, and we stopped quarrelling, and then we went on to the towing-path, and as we got lower down by the arch it was very dark. I stood on one side and Louisa stood in the middle, when I heard a splash go, and I screamed out and cried for help. I heard the poor girl in the water scream out, 'Oh, Louisa, you have done it.' Louisa went to run away, and I pulled her back, and we afterwards did go and lay down. The constable came along at break of day, when he asked what we were doing there. That was on a little bit of green path. He told us to get up and go out. We walked up and got out. Another constable outside came after us and said we must go to the station with him. At the station and before the Magistrate I said, 'Louisa pushed her in; I saw Louisa push <hi rend="italic">Gertie</hi> in, and I swear it.'" <hi rend="italic">By the Coroner</hi>:"I heard Louisa say to <hi rend="italic">Gertie</hi>, 'I have had it in for you for a long time; I will do for you.' That was about 10 minutes before Louisa pushed her in. She banged her in with her fist and said, 'In you go; I will do for you,' and then I heard the poor girl say, 'Oh, Louisa, you have done for me.' There were no blows struck. I did not quarrel with <hi rend="italic">Gertie</hi> first. We had been drinking mixtures, and a rare lot, together." Belton said: "I have been a laundress, but I have not done work for a long time, I used to live in Clarendon Street, Camden Town; I have known Adamson over 12 months, and the deceased four months; we were together on Wednesday afternoon and evening, and had a quarrel; we got to the canal about 11 o'clock at night; we had all been drinking, <hi rend="italic">Gertie</hi> and myself the most. I remember going on to the towing-path, all three of as together; Martha and <hi rend="italic">Gertie</hi>

               <p>were quarrelling. After that I heard <hi rend="italic">Gertie</hi> go into the water. <hi rend="italic">Gertie</hi> had been about to strike me, and Martha said, "You won't hit her with one arm,' and then I heard her go into the water and scream."<hi rend="italic">By the Coroner</hi>: "I saw her go into the water; Martha pushed <hi rend="italic">Gertie</hi> in; I did not put my hands on <hi rend="italic">Gertie.</hi> It was all done accidentally, when we were all full of drink. I went to jump in after her, and Martha jumped at me and fetched me back, and laid me down; and we were there, a little further off, by St. Mark's Church, till the morning, till a policeman woke us up. We both quarrelled with <hi rend="italic">Gertie</hi>, as she followed us, and we did not want her, and wanted to get rid of her. I just remember going down on the canal bank; <hi rend="italic">Gertie</hi> always slept there, and we were going with her. Martha and I said at the station that <hi rend="italic">Gertie</hi> jumped in, but that is all wrong; she was pushed in by Martha. I wanted to get help, but my mate would not let me, and I could not do so, as I was in drink, and had only one arm. <hi rend="italic">Gertie</hi> has on two or three occasions threatened to jump into the canal. We had been drinking in the New Inn Public-house, St. John's Wood."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoners' statements before the Magistrate: Adamson says</hi>:"We all three had been drinking a lot of mixtures outside Primrose Hill. I do not know the name of the <hi rend="italic">pub.</hi> As we came along through High Street, Camden Town, to the lodge entrance to the Regent's Canal we got a little way over the bridge, when a few words began between us three about a man named Punch Nichols. His real name is George Nichols. That dropped, Belton said, 'Come and let us have a lie down.' When we got a little way down there was an archway. <hi rend="italic">Gertie</hi> was by the side of the water, Belton next to her, and I the other side of Belton. All of a sudden Belton turned round and hit <hi rend="italic">Gertie</hi> in the side with her fist, and I heard a splash and a scream. She said, 'Oh, Louisa, you have done it; I cried for help. I saw no one near; the place was dark. Belton went to run away, and I went after her. She said, 'I have done it; I have done it; I meant doing for her a long time ago.' That is all true, I will take my solemn oath." <hi rend="italic">Belton says</hi>: "Me and my friend <hi rend="italic">Gertie</hi> had been drinking all day at the New Inn, St. John's Wood, and were turned out about 6 o'clock. We went then to Primrose Hill. Adamson was with us. We parted from <hi rend="italic">Gertie</hi>, and came back to the New Inn, Adamson and I. When we left we met <hi rend="italic">Gertie</hi>, and we all came along the Albert Road, and as we were going along Adamson stopped at the corner to ask an old man to let her warm her hands. After that we went on to Primrose Hill again, and were sent off by a police constable. We came off, and <hi rend="italic">Gertie</hi> asked us to come and have a drink at a public-house next the Queen at Primrose Hill, and we all three went there. We left there about 9 o'clock and went to High Street, Camden Town, and had a drink at the Elephant public-house. We came out then, and went to the Lock at Chalk Farm Bridge, as <hi rend="italic">Gertie</hi> always went there to sleep. She asked us to go with</p>

               <p>her, and we went there, and Martha got rowing with <hi rend="italic">Gertie</hi> over jealousy because <hi rend="italic">Gertie</hi> was with me. Because <hi rend="italic">Gertie</hi> would not go she pushed her, and she fell into the water. When she fell into the water she screamed. I went to jump in after her, and Martha would not let me; she said, 'Come down here, run,' and I own I did run with her. We went and lay down. Before we lay down I asked her where <hi rend="italic">Gertie</hi> was, and she said she had got out of the water and gone down the path with a man. I said, 'If she is all right I will lay down.'"</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pianoforte maker in partnership with one other as the Bridgeport Piano and Organ Company, 78, Finsbury Pavement—about March 4th Sutherland came to me, and asked if I did wholesale business—I said, "Yes; the bulk of our business is wholesale"—he said that he had a large connection among the best cabinet houses in London, and mentioned Maple's, Shoolbred's, and Barker's, of Kensington, and said that he was trying to get into Whiteley's, and if I was open to do business he thought he could do us good—I asked him for a business card—he said he had not one with him—I gave him this slip of paper, on which he wrote "A. Sutherland, 50, Roxburgh Road, Shepherd's Bush," and I added the words "5 per cent, commission," as the terms arranged—he then went away, and called again in two or three days—on March 7 th he brought me an order purporting to come from Rose and Sons, of Romford Road—after making inquiry I found they were no good—I declined the order, and told them so—I told Sutherland that Rose's were no good, and unless we could have cash with the order we could not execute it—he promised to see Rose's as to what could be done—he called the next day and said, "Now I have got something good," and after a conversation he gave me this card, and said that the Romford Furnishing Company seemed to be a respectable house, and I should find them all right—I asked him about references, and wrote at his dictation "Potts &amp; Ward, 69, Great Eastern Street," and "Rothschild &amp; Co., Wool House, Wells Street, E.C."—he gave me the particulars, written in pencil, on the back of the card as to the goods that were to be sent, to the value of £99 15s.—I inquired at the references—the terms were a 30 days' bill for £49 15s., and a three months' bill for £50—the £49 15s. was paid by a cheque brought by Sutherland three or four days before maturity, when he brought me another order for about £200 worth of</p>

               <p>goods—I took the cheque, and returned the bill—I paid Sutherland £5, which was 5 per cent. on the order I executed—I believed what he said about the good connection, I would not have executed the order if I had not—I did not execute the order for the £200—about Easter Tuesday I told Sutherland I had not got the £50—he seemed surprised—I said, "Do you know that the Romford Furnishing Company are no good?"—he seemed surprised, and said, "Do you mean to say, then, that they are a Long Firm?"—I told him I did not want to be mixed up in any question of breach of character, and I did not say that; but he repeated that question three times, and I told him he had better go and get my £50—the next day he called and asked me to go and see the Romford Fur<lb/>nishing Company—I went to their premises, 17, Wells Street, Oxford Street, and he introduced me to the prisoner Cohen—we had sent two pianos to Wells Street and two to Romford Road, according to Suther<lb/>land's arrangement—I said to Cohen, "You had better pay me my account and get rid of me"—he said he was not in a position to do that then, and after a conversation with him and Sutherland I arranged to take five cheques of £10 each, with a week between the dates, the first being dated May 8th and the second May 16th—those were paid—the second cheque came back marked "Irregular as to signature"—I compared it with the first, and found it was signed "Louis Ziff," so I ruled out the rest of the signature and presented it in that way—two came back marked "R. D.," and the fifth I never presented—I gave the second cheque to Suther<lb/>land and asked him to bring me a new one, and he brought one signed, "Louis Ziff"—the first cheque was on the bank in Titchfield Street, and was paid—the others were on the London and Provincial Bank—when the cheques came back marked "R. D." I wrote to Ziff at Romford Fur<lb/>nishing Company, and I got this answer, signed by Cohen, of May 11th—(<hi rend="italic">Promising a cheque the next week, as money was slow coming in.</hi>)—I after<lb/>wards got these letters of May 14th and 18th—(<hi rend="italic">That of the 14th promised a cheque at the end of the week, and stated</hi>: "Kindly do not push me so; cash is coming in slowly;" <hi rend="italic">that of the 18th, said</hi> "Kindly note I have not got the cash to pay you; you must wait a few days; I am sure I do not understand your letters, andshall ask the advice of my solicitor," <hi rend="italic">Signed "Louis Ziff</hi>")—shortly after March 21st Sutherland asked if I did retail business in pianos on the hire system, and gave me an address, "D. Moss, 26, Upper Maryle<lb/>bone Street"—I went to see Moss, who seemed respectable, and I drew up an agreement for the hire and purchase of a piano, which he signed "David Moss"—the day following Sutherland came in, and I told him I thought we ought to have a reference or two for Moss, and I received a letter purporting to come from Moss, with two names—I got my bank to ask about one, and I wrote about the other—one was Fuller &amp; Co., 151, High Holborn—I said to Sutherland, "I think I had better run up and see these people," and he said, "Oh, a letter is always better; you write them, and you will have their reply in writing"—I did so, and got a very favourable report—this is the letter I got from "D. Moss, Wine Merchant": "Enclosed I beg to hand you my reference, and if you cannot see your way to trust me with the pianos on the hire system, you had better not send same"—the body of the letter is in Cohen's writing—the "t" in "truly" is identical—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

For credit ahead no risk")—Sutherland brought me another order, purporting to come from C. Henri &amp; Co., of 45, Newman Street, Oxford Street, W., with two re<lb/>ferences (the Welsh Harp and Zeither Company, of 62, High Street, Croydon, and Smith, West &amp; Phillips, 40, Burners Street, W.), in Suther<lb/>land's writing—the note across as to three months is my writing—he said, from what he could make out, Henri &amp; Co. had come from "France" or "Paris"; that he knew nothing of their means, but understood they had money locked up in shares, bonds, or something of that kind—I said to Sutherland that we ought to have a shorter term—he said that he would try to get them to agree to half at 30 days and half in three months, and I gave him this postcard to write back: "Yes, quite agreeable; 30 days, 90 days.—<hi rend="smallCaps">SUTHERLAND"</hi>—I went and looked at Henri's place, and found it empty—I looked over the glass, which was frosted over, and saw an old table—I got paid £2 out of the £47 15s. on the Moss transaction by a cheque, signed by Moss, and brought to me by Suther<lb/>land—I said to Moss, "Cannot you pay me a little more, £5 or £10?"—he said he was rather short, but he took out his pass-book and showed me accounts he had paid—I asked him where the piano was—he said, "Oh, it is at my private house; I had to move into rooms"—that was contrary to agreement—he was to pay 30s. a month—Sutherland said, "I suppose I will get a commission on the retail as well as the whole<lb/>sale?"—I said, "Yes, if the accounts are all right, but wait a bit," something like that.</p>

Kindly let bearer of this note have box goods and oblige"—I believe the bearer fetched them in a car—I received the letter of March 17th, asking Mr. Silva to call on the manager in the morning with samples of various goods, and two days afterwards went to 17, Wells Street—I saw Cohen—he said he would take me over to a firm who did a heavy shipping trade—he took me to 9, Lower John Street, Golden Square, on the second or third floor—the name on the door was "G.

I believe your name is Berthold Cohen?"—he said, "No, I am not Berthold Cohen"—upon seeing Rothschild he said, "Yes, I am Berthold Cohen"—I said, "I have a warrant for your arrest, which I will read to you"—I read it to him—on the way to the station he said, "I was the buyer for the Romford Furnishing Company, but I had no power to sign cheques. Mr. Ziff was the proprietor"—later on, under a search warrant, I searched his house at 16, Tolmer Square, Hampstead Road—I found these exhibits, Nos. 95 to 109—(<hi rend="italic">The correspondence as to references.</hi>)—the same evening I went to 15, Roxwell Road, Shepherd's Bush, and said to Sutherland, "I am a police inspector. I have a warrant for your arrest for conspiring with a man named Simonson to obtain goods by fraud, at 9, Lower John Street, Golden Square. The warrant is in the name of Williams"—he said, "I never went by the name of Williams in my life. I was employed by Simonson whilst I was there; I never did anything that I am ashamed of"—I took him to the station—he appeared at Guildhall the following Monday—Mr. Mason handed me the copy letter-book of 17, Wells Street—in it I found about 100 applications for catalogues and goods in Lon<lb/>don, the country, and abroad—I found that a man named Grosse had offices as Fuller &amp; Co., at 151, High Holborn—he has absconded.</p>

I am a wine and spirit merchant, of 19, Gala<lb/>bria High Street—I had a customer named Dr. Paul Zimmer<lb/>man—on July 21st I received a cheque from him for £12, drawn by T. Morris, which was paid—on July 27th he owed me £2 19s.—he brought me a cheque for £12 10s., drawn by T. Morris on the London, City, and Midland Bank—I gave Zimmerman the difference between £12 10s. and what he owed me—I paid the cheque into my bank; it was returned marked "R.D."—I tried to find Zimmer<lb/>man, but could not—on July 31st I saw the prisoner—I did not know him before—I told him that the cheque had come back, and asked him if he would pay it—he said it was not his cheque, and he knew nothing about it—I pointed to the drawer's signature—he said it was not his, and knew nothing about it—he said Zimmerman was a first-class swindler—I went to the bank, and made some inquiries—I took out a default summons at the Clerkenwell County Court—the service of that would be left to the Court ✗builiff—the hearing was eventually fixed for September 19th—I attended to prove my case—the defendant was absent£judgment was given by</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Clerkenwell County Court, and am appointed to administer oaths and take affidavits—on August 4th a summons was issued in that Court, at the suit of George Guyott, against Theodor Morris, to recover £12 10s. on a dishonoured cheque; it was served by our officer on August 18th—the defendant had 12 days in which to pay, otherwise judgment would go by default, but he would be at liberty to file an affidavit setting forth any grounds in which leave might be obtained from the Court to show his inability to pay—on August 30th the prisoner came to the County Court and told me he would defend the action—I told him he must prepare an affidavit, show<lb/>ing that he wished to defend the action—he spoke in broken English—he said he could not write much English, that he had never had a banking account, and had not signed the cheque—I said, "That is a very good reason for obtaining leave to defend, but it must be by affidavit"—I recommended him to go to a solicitor, and he would advise him—he said he had not enough money—I suggested that he should get a friend to write out an affidavit for him—he went away—he came back with a stranger or a friend, who said in the prisoner's presence that he had come to write out the affidavit for him—I gave him a sheet of foolscap, and he took it to a desk in the office, with the prisoner, and returned it complete—I saw them both at the desk—I could not hear what they said—I asked the stranger to explain the affidavit in German, so that there should be no misunderstanding—he spoke to the prisoner in a foreign language—then I swore the prisoner in the usual way—he took it away to make a copy of it—he signed it and swore the affidavit in the usual way—leave was given to defend the action.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think he understood me—I thought there might be some doubt about his understanding it, so I asked his friend to explain it in German—I did not say I could not understand the affidavit they first brought—there was a partition between us, with a window in it—the prisoner and the man were on one side, and I was sitting down on the other—I could not see who wrote the affidavit—I do not know who the</p>

Routh, Stacey &amp; Co.—he appeared to be in his usual health at that time, I did not see anything the matter, with him—I saw him occasionally after that—I remember seeing him on November 30th at my office, when he did some business with me—I executed an assignment—he appeared to be all right at that time—I was also concerned in the sale of the White Hart, which was sold by the prisoner to a Mr. Gillett in the early part of 1899—the prisoner had a joint mortgage with me on it, and I bought him out—I paid him £6,000 for his interest in it in June or July, 1899; I knew of nobody else with him in the matter—I first saw him ill at his house about the second week in December; he was in his bedroom—I knew he had filed his peti<lb/>tion—I first knew he had done so when I saw it in the paper—I did not see him on December 5th—when I saw him a week before Christmas, I did not discuss his bankruptcy with him—I heard he was very ill, and I went to see him—he told me then that he had been to the Bankruptcy Court that day—he did not say what he was suffering from, but I knew he was suffering from neuritis—he lost the power of his legs.</p>

I am managing clerk to Mr. Edward Cecil Moore, who is trustee in the prisoner's bankruptcy—I have had the managing of the bankruptcy—I have examined the pass-book of the pri<lb/>soner's account at the City Bank, and of Mrs. Leech at the South-Western Bank—I have made out a statement (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 13) showing the payments into the accounts—the total payments into Mrs. Leech's account from October 21st to November 14th was £282 in notes and gold—in October to the prisoner's account, £285, and in November only £35 was paid in—I produce the counterfoil of a cheque dated May 18th, 1899, from Mrs. Leech's cheque-book for £1,000, payable to Truman—at the bottom there is "For G."—on May 20th there is an entry showing the payment of that cheque—on May 11th, 1899, I find that there was a payment into her account of £1,050—in the prisoner's pass-book I find that on May 11th £1,050 was drawn out of his account by a cheque payable to "self"—the cheque for £940 5s. 3d. was never disclosed to the trustee or to me by the prisoner—I questioned him about it, he said he knew nothing about it—he gave an explanation which seemed to be feasible; he said it was his wife's money—on September 4th I went to Ladbroke Grove and ques<lb/>tioned him about the £900—his wife was there—I was with Mr. Douglas—I said it had come to the trustee's knowledge that certain notes and the proceeds of a cheque given to him by Mr. Truman had been cashed, and we had ascertained that it had been cashed principally in notes, that some of them had been traced through him or his wife, and I demanded the balance of the notes—I gave him a written demand for it—he said, "I do not know anything about it, and have no recollection"—that was after he had been publicly examined—he did not disclose the £1,000 from Mr. Gillett as a debt—it was not in his sworn statement of affairs.</p>

Barber—a week later, before the credit for the first order had expired, Reeves called on me again, and said he had had a letter from Stickings, who said he could do with another five firkins of butter—I had only three firkins, so Reeves said, "Well, we must make that do"—that was bought at 110s., which amounted to £8 5s., on the same terms, cash in a fortnight—this is the delivery order (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) to Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am London manager to Lever Brothers, Limited, Upper Thames Street—Roberts has been there as store-keeper since August, 1899, and during the latter part of the year he acted as wharf manager—these bundles of dockets (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) are sent in by the travellers, and then sent into the stock department office, where they are put into loads, on green load-sheets—to each load-sheet there are two break-down tellers—the figures on each ought to agree as far as</p>

               <p>quantity is concerned—they are then affixed to dockets to deliver next morning to the wharf foreman, into Roberts' hands—before the load sheet and the break-down tallies come it is the duty of the wharf foreman to put on the top of the sheet, in pencil, the name of the foreman who takes the load out; the green load-sheet and two tallies and the docket are then handed out to the man at the loophole, who tallies out the van—I hand the docket to the carman—the two break-down tallies are handed to two other men—the goods having been put on the van, the man who has been breaking down brings his tally, as also does the intermediate man, to the loophole, and the figures in the three are agreed—the car<lb/>man signs for the quantities removed at the back of the load-sheet; the number of cases and the signature are always in the carman's writing—on August 14th the eight boxes of soap were worth £5 8s., and the eight boxes on September 1st £5 4s., being a different soap—the boxes weighed fully 1/2 cwt.</p>

               <p>and rolled out five casks of oil into Theobald's van—Theobald then left the premises—there were eight casks in the van—three I did not see rolled in—Theobald then drove into Annie Street, and then into Barking Road—we followed him back to Forest Gate, two miles, and he went into the mews in Disraeli Road—Hayes was there—Theobald and Hayes removed two of the barrels from the van, and dropped them on some old sacking—they then left—Theobald led the horse, Hayes walking by his side—Lidlow then marked the two barrels in the mews—I followed the van, which went round Forest Gate to Theobald's stable yard—at 4 p.m. I went to Mason's works and saw Busher—I said, "I am a police officer; I saw you and Lawrence in the works this morning, and I saw Theobald back his van into the yard and load it up with eight barrels of oil; that oil was stolen"—he said, "No, you didn't; Lawrence told me the van was coming for empties, and so far as I know, that is all there was"—I said, "I saw you and Lawrence put the barrels into the van; you must have known whether they were full or empty"—he said, "I went to work about five this morning; Lawrence came about 5.45; I unlocked the gates at 6 to 6.30; the van came and backed into the yard, and I assisted him to put the five barrels into the van; he left soon after"—about 4.45 that day I saw Lawrence at his house—I said, "I am a police officer; a load of oil was taken from the works this morning; you were there to load it up; that oil was stolen"—he said, "Yes; it is the waste I had from the firm about six months ago; I took the liberty of rolling it from my yard across the firm's, to where the van was; I sold it to a man named Brett, of Forest Gate; there were eight barrels"—he lives in Annie Street, close to the works—I took Busher and Lawrence into custody—they were charged, and made no reply—I examined the two marked casks, and also the six in Theobald's van, in his presence—they contained oil—I took these samples (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) from each a day or two after, also from the tanks in the firm, one of raw oil and one of boiled, and one of <hi rend="italic">foots.</hi>

I live at 609, Barking Road, Plaistow, and am manager to Mason &amp; Mason, Limited, printers' ink manufacturers, of Mason Street—up to the day of their arrest Busher and Lawrence had been in the employ of the firm, where Busher had been for six years as engine-driver and timekeeper—he packed the goods, and had all the keys, except of my private office and safe—he would have to clean out the office—it was his duty to be first on the premises—Lawrence had been in their employ, off and on, about 16 years—it has been a limited company about nine years—he was a labourer—linseed oil enters largely into the manufacture of printers' ink—there are several large tanks there—they are cleaned out about once in five years—the sediment at the bottom is called <hi rend="italic">foots</hi>—this is a bottle of <hi rend="italic">foots</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—with the sanction of the company I sold foots to Lawrence, taken out five years ago—I should say it would be £2 a ton—about nine months ago the tanks were cleared out again, and he again purchased the <hi rend="italic">foots</hi> at about the same rate—there would be about five barrels—we bought the casks to put the stuff into at about 3s. apiece—when the tanks were cleared out about nine months ago, we bought pipes—a pipe holds about half a ton—to the best of my knowledge, Lawrence put the <hi rend="italic">foots</hi> into two pipes—my firm does not sell oil; they simply buy it for the business—neither Busher nor Lawrence had any authority to sell oil off the premises—we buy it of the manufac<lb/>turers—these represent the raw linseed oil and boiled oil as they would be taken from the tanks—I have seen the eight barrels at the station-house—they are from my firm, and contain linseed oil—I did not see them sampled—it is necessary to the manufacture of the ink to boil the oil—we have to treat the raw oil—the eight barrels full would weigh about 28 cwt., and their value to us would be about £48—about October 4th Lawrence asked me to let him have eight barrels to make a load of empties up—he bought all the empties from us—I sold them to him at 3s. a barrel.</p>

               <p>past President of the Society of Chemists, and public analyst for several Counties—until I was requested to make an examination I had no know<lb/>ledge of the case—I am an entire stranger to Mason—I have had many years' experience in the analysis of oil—yesterday morning Mr. Store, the solicitor, handed me four bottles of oil and one of <hi rend="italic">foots;</hi> two are labelled "Tank" and two "Van"—two of them contain golden, coloured oil and the others dark boiled oil—the fifth bottle has no description—the two golden samples are raw oil; they are not identical, they do not come from the same place; the two dark samples are boiled oil; they are not identical, but they are similar—they are ordinary samples of oil—two are <hi rend="italic">foots</hi>—a very small quantity of raw oil can be separated from the <hi rend="italic">foots</hi> by filtration—the sample I obtained produced an oil not of that kind, but it differed largely from the samples of raw oil; that is the only way in which oil can be extracted from <hi rend="italic">foots;</hi> you can heat <hi rend="italic">foots</hi> in a boiler and skim it off; I have done that, and failed to obtain raw oil of this nature.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. I heated the <hi rend="italic">foots,</hi> and a good deal of the solid fat melted; the oil was of a much darker colour than the raw oil, and approxi<lb/>mated in colour—it was lighter than boiled oil, and much thinner than any of the oils here, boiled or raw; a good deal of solid fat was there when I warmed it; it has far less drying properties; in boiling oil it is treated with litharge or oxide of lead, and contains a little lead, and neither of these oils contains any lead.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> From my experience I come to the conclusion that these oils were not taken from the same tank, and they may be oil from different manufacturers—one method of separating oil is by using cen<lb/>trifugal machinery, or an exactly equivalent process would be allowing the oil to stand—I analysed the samples for metallic substances, but found none; no lead; that was because the <hi rend="italic">foots</hi> was made from the boiled oil—I am acquainted with the manufacture of oil, and could see that the small bottle had been standing some time—the longer it stands the thicker the <hi rend="italic">foots;</hi> if it is allowed to stand a considerable time you would get towards the bottom, a mixture like this larger bottle, and if you allow it to stand three years or five years, you would get it just like that—with five or ten tons of oil you would have some deposit in a month—we call that "young <hi rend="italic">foots,</hi>" and the other "old <hi rend="italic">foots</hi>"—you cannot tell anything without analysis, and you cannot tell by analysis whether it is added oil or not—if I have <hi rend="italic">foots</hi> like this in the larger bottle I can extract a much larger quantity—I get the residue settling down and down, and the oil extracted would be a very different quality, too—it is pumped up into the casks—there w a nozzle to the pump—that is done by steam—it Is most unusual to do so, and most slovenly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Lamp-black would be used in the factory—when all oil has been taken out, the pump is taken out, and what remains is the foots—if the <hi rend="italic">foots</hi> is left out in the open it will solidify; it would settle down through gravity—putting it in a yard, turning it out in the heat of the summer, would make the oil rise to the top, and you can take it off—I fiad a difference in the iodine of these samples; they are not identical—on October 5th, that which is labelled "pans" could not be drawn from the same receptacle as that labelled "tank."</p>

               <p>practically no oil could be got from it—it would require 3 tons of the <hi rend="italic">foots</hi> in the two bottles to get 1 ton of oil—I should get much more by heating than by straining—assuming 28 cwt. of oil, you might get 32 cwt. or 34 cwt. by straining—the best sample might produce 20 cwt. of oil, and supposing the heating was done by being put into a boiler in the yard, it would require about 30 cwt. of foots to get 20 cwt. of oil, but it would not be pure oil—if boiled, no oil like the samples would be produced; it would be thick when cold.</p>
