On Thursday, the 11th of December, the prisoner came to the shop, accompanied by a young woman, who asked for some cloth to make a pelisse; she had had a pattern in the morning - the cloth was taken down. I asked how much she wanted; she said,</p>
               <p>"Enough for a pelisse, how much will it take;" I said two yards and a half; she said she wished to have a cape - I said a quarter more would do. She did not seem satisfied with the quantity, and the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"I will have a waistcoat off it, and you may as well cut three yards and a half," which was done. It came to 2 l. 9 s. The prisoner threw a 5 l. note down on the counter, which I took up; he said,</p>
               <p>"Here give me change of this" - I suspected it to be forged, and asked his name and address - he said, Stevens or Stevenson, No. 218, Tottenham Court-road, which I wrote on the note, with L. L., my husband's initials. (Looks at a note.) this is it; it has</p>
               <p>"Mr. Stevens, 218, Tottenham Court-road, L. L.," on it. I called my son, and told him in the prisoner's presence, to get change, and said something to him to Hebrew - I gave him the note; he went out with it, and was gone above a quarter of an hour. Mr. Levy said the boy stopped a long time; I spoke to him in Hebrew - he then opened the door and went out, and in a few minutes the prisoner also went out, and returned to the door in about a minute, and said to the woman,</p>
               <p>"I cannot stop for the change, you stop and take it, and I will meet you by and by;" he went away. The note was brought back by my brother-in-law; I told the woman it was forged - she still remained in the shop, and was afterwards discharged.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Are you certain that I said Stevens or Stevenson, or did I say Simpson - A. No, he said Stevens.</p>
               <p>Q. When you asked what name you should put on it, I said,</p>
               <p>"Put Simpson on it, it is a note I took of a person of that name, who lives in Tottenham Court-road - A. I am certain that he said nothing of the sort. I am certain that he is the man.</p>
               <p>LYON LEVY. I am a clothes salesman. The prisoner came to our shop on Thursday evening, the 11th of December, between 6 and 7 o'clock, with a girl - I was in the parlour, and remained there till Mrs. Levy called me to cut three yards and a half of cloth - I cut it off and tied it up. He threw the note down, and said,</p>
               <p>"Give me change of this." Mrs. Levy asked his name and address; he gave it, Stevens or Stevenson, Tottenham Court-road; I do not recollect the number, but my wife wrote it on the note immediately; she spoke to me in Hebrew, and gave the note to my son, who went out with it, and was gone a quarter of an hour, but before that I went out, and the prisoner followed me, and saw me at the corner of the street, and said,</p>
               <p>"I cannot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180004"/>stop, but will go and tell Mrs. Levy to give the change to the girl;" he went back, and came out; and suspecting him, I followed him down towards St. Clement's church, then turned back again towards my house, but did not go into Hollywell-street; he went into a public-house in the Strand, and came out in an instant with another man - they went towards New church, and crossed over to Somerset House. I ran back to see if my son had returned with the note; I saw him, ran back, and found the prisoner standing at Somerset House gateway, talking to a man. I said he must come back for there was something not right in the change of the note - I insisted on his coming back: he said,</p>
               <p>"I shall be back in a quarter of an hour;" I said,</p>
               <p>"You must come back now," he said</p>
               <p>"If I must I must," and went quietly with me. I found the woman in the shop - nothing was said to him. An officer came instantly, and took them both. The woman was afterwards discharged.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Had I not plenty of time to go away - A. He did not attempt to go; I think he could not have got away if he had attempted. He was never out of my sight after I accosted him.</p>

On Tuesday evening, the 9th of December, he came and asked me to give him change for a 5 l. note. I asked what he was doing; he said he was selling cloth on commission, and had business in the neighbourhood, and could not get change. He lived with his father, who kept a wine-vaults, when I knew him, which was twelve years ago, and after that he was a police officer. He said he had been asking at several shops for change, and could not get it, and believed they thought the note was a bad one. I gave him change, and asked his address - he said,</p>
               <p>"No. 27, Tottenham Court-road," which I wrote on the note; (looking at one,) this is it; it has</p>

               <p>"Never mind, let me have a sovereign, and the difference of another sovereign, and give me the rest on Sunday, when I intend having the honour of dining with you." I gave him 1 l. 17 s.; he said he would come on Sunday, and that he was happy to inform me he had got a situation of 20 s. a week in the West India Docks, and expected to have his wages raised in about six weeks. I gave the note to my wife, and somebody came to me next day, and on Saturday he came himself, and got his full change from my wife - I did not expect him on Saturday; he did not come on Sunday. My wife gave me the note again, and on the Monday following, I paid it away at the West of England fire-office. I had no other 5 l. note, and know it to be the same.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When I gave you the note you took it into the tap-room - A. Yes, for two tradesmen to look at; I had not marked it. A man had it in his hand for about a minute, but it was not out of my sight till I gave it to my wife.</p>

I put the parcel into a handkerchief, and went to the Magpie and Pewter Platter, public-house, Wood-street, where I lodged; I slept there that afternoon, and gave the parcel to Greeves, the landlord to take care of while I went to bed. I got up a little after three o'clock, asked him for the parcel, and he gave it to me in the same state as when I received it. I then took it in my hand to the Swan with Two Necks, Lad-lane, and put it inside at the bottom of the coach, which stood in the inn yard, by the tap-room window; this was about half-past three o'clock, and in less than five minutes I missed the parcel.

             outside; Crowder said to Ward,</p>
               <p>"Give Bill" (meaning me)" your money, and then he can have all the things, and give you yours out."</p>
               <p>Q. What was Ward to give you money for - A. He was going to buy some notes as well as me. Ward was to have six notes, and I nine. Ward said he did not like to trust any one with his money. Ward, Turnley, and Crowder went round the corner together - I saw them again in about two minutes, altogether. Turnley pulled a lot of notes from his pocket, and counted them into Ward's hand, and said,</p>
               <p>"I think I have given you seven" - Ward said,</p>
               <p>"If you think so, count them over again," but he did not. Ward went away. Crowder said he thought Turnley had given him seven - Turnley then pulled some more notes from his pocket, and counted them into Crowder's hand, and said there was only eight; they were 5 l. notes. Crowder gave them to me, and said Ward had got one to many. Turnley was going away; I said,</p>
               <p>"Here is the money;" he said,</p>
               <p>"No, stop till I come back." When he was gone, Crowder took the notes out of my hand again, counted them, and said there was only eight. I said,</p>
               <p>"Will you have the money" - he said Yes, and I gave him the ten sovereigns, and said,</p>
               <p>"When shall I have the other note, I hope I shall get the other;" he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, you shall when he comes back." Turnley returned, and said to Crowder,</p>
               <p>"I will be d - d if there is not one wrong somewhere;" Crowder said,</p>
               <p>"Then Ward has got it;" and be would be d - d if he would not sooner be lagged (transported) than done out of one. I saw Ward afterwards; Crowder called him out of the Three Crowns, and said,</p>
               <p>"George, you have got one too many, you had better turn it up, or I will be d - d if there will not be a bl - y row" - Ward said he did not know what he meant; some words passed, and Ward called a man named

             out; they had some words, and I went in and got half a pint of gin, and gave them a glass all round - they went into the parlour, and had a row there, but I went away. I had a glass of wine and water there, and asked for a biscuit; they had not got one, but brought me a slice of bread and butter. I asked for a bit of lemon, as Crowder told me to put a bit of lemon into the wine and water. I delivered the eight notes to Mr. Payne, having first marked them D. G., and informed Mr. Bird what had happened.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. You have not told us what you are - A. A brass-founder by trade; I work for myself. I sell handkerchiefs and all kinds of goods at Norwich, I have not worked at my trade for three years, or longer. I was a journeyman brass-founder at Birmingham.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you within the last four years worked as a brass-founder - A. Yes; it is four years as near as can be. When I left that trade I went to the coal work, for three or four months, and then got a hawker's licence, and continued at that till the licence was out. I took that licence out about fifteen months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there were two years between that which you cannot account for - A. I was at Birmingham, and have done business for Mr. Payne, the keeper of the prison - I was employed for the Bank of England to detect forgeries. They thought me a kind of a sly chap, whom they could depend upon.</p>
               <p>Q. You understand the slang language very well - A. They all understand that at Birmingham; they are all fly there, and all know flash. I was employed by Mr. Payne for three or four months, and then lived on my money like a gentleman - I saved above 100 l. Mr. Redfearn has had 60 l. of mine, and Mr. Payne 20 l.; that was three years ago. Redfearn is an officer of Birmingham.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any one ever make a charge against you about a note - A. There was once a 1 l. forged note, which I was tried for passing, but I was acquitted.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that the occasion of the Bank taking you up as a convenient person - A. No; it was before that; this happened at Norwich. I was never taken up at any other time. I had not lived at Norwich above a fortnight when that happened; I have lived there ever since - it will be three years ago next Summer Assizes. I have been a soldier, and left the regiment after the battle of Waterloo. I knew Turnley before, by a little conversation I had with him on the 3d or 4th of September, at Barnet, when I went to sell my master's horse. It was Turnley who asked me to buy the notes - he said they had got nearly 11,000 l., and fenced them for 2000 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they were all gone if they had fenced them - A. Yes; that was a different thing entirely; he said they had bought a good many back on speculation, and sold them. He said that in Crowder's presence.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Turnley to suppose you could put them away - A. I was in the habit of going about selling things. I never had any of them before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you were at Malden did you write to Mr. Payne - A. As soon as I got to Huntingdonshire, where I met my wife, which was in October; it was not many weeks after the conversation. When I came from Mr. Payne, I asked Crowder for the notes. I have gone by the name of Bill; I did not wish them to know my real name. Crowder was a stranger to me till I saw him at Malden - they called me Bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Was anybody within sight when you were all four together by the Three Crowns - A. The people came round to see what the matter was when there was a row kicked up; there was a dispute between Ward and Crowder about the note - it was darkish; only the gas was lighted. It was six o'clock; it was dark where we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180007"/>stood. I counted the notes when he gave them to me; I could tell by the feel that they were notes, and I looked at them after I got into the house. I counted them in the dark when he gave them to me. I counted them in the passage where the gas-light shone; I went beyond both the doors to a private part of the passage.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. When you were applied to to buy the notes, were you a hawker - A. No. (Looking at a letter;) this is the letter I wrote to Mr. Payne; it is dated Huntingdon, 19th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. Having counted your notes, you went into the passage to ascertain what they were - A. Yes. I saw the landlord of the house, and the girl who waits there. Ward was in the house, and Turnley, but he did not stop there. I delivered Mr. Payne the same notes as I received from Crowder, and paid Crowder for them; he counted the notes over to me in the dark.</p>

            . I am chief constable of Birmingham, and was formerly keeper of the prison. Gray had been employed by the police, under my direction, and in consequence of a letter from him in October, or November, I communicated with Mr. Bird, and from what passed with the bankers, I employed Gray to buy some of the notes, and in December I gave him fifteen sovereigns to buy them; he left, and about three days after returned to Birmingham, and gave me eight 5 l. notes - this was on the 17th. I saw him put his initials on them before he gave them to me, and I put the day of the month on each of them, and gave them to Mr. Bird. These are them (looking at them.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Some persons have already been convicted at Birmingham, of receiving these notes - A. Not that I know of. Gray was paid his expences liberally for every transaction he had with the police. I have promised him nothing for this.</p>

There was a disturbance about notes; one man who was to have had seven had eight, and another who was to have had eight had but seven; the party did not come into the house after the quarrel.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. You came out in front of the house I suppose during the quarrel - A. They were quarrelling outside the door at first, and then in the parlour; my attention was directed to them in the parlour, which is on the right hand side of the passage; the passage goes beyond the door. I do not think that Gray was in the parlour at the time of the row. I was in the bar, and hearing the noise went into the parlour. I did not notice whether any one was in the passage; there was a good light there - I did not see Crowder there. Gray was there that evening. No gin was carried into the parlour. I was in the bar some time before the row, and do not recollect Gray coming for any gin; he came for some wine and water just before the quarrel, and had it in the taproom - I saw no papers in his hand.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. What makes you remember the wine and water - A. He said he did not like quarrelling, and would have it in the other room, as it was quiet. It was quite dark, but the lamps were lighted.</p>

On the 29th of January, master and his family went to the play, and about seven, or a quarter past, I went up stairs - some of the clerks were in the counting-house at the time. There are leads to the house, which lead from our bed-room into Mr. Proctor's garden, in Billiter-square. On getting up stairs I found the lead doors both open - I went to shut them; I was obliged to go out on the leads to shut them; I staid outside for a few minutes, as the bells were ringing, it being the King's accession. I turned my eye round, and saw a candle standing on maser's bed-room table, below where I stood, and saw the prisoner very busy, passing too and fro in the room, but could not see what she was doing, The plate was kept in a closet in that room. She came up stairs to our bedroom to me, and said,</p>
               <p>"Is that you?" I said, Yes - she took something off her own bed, and immediately went down into master's bed-room again; I then went down to see what she was doing - she came out, and pulled the door too to prevent my going in, and I did not go in, but came down into the kitchen, and felt very uneasy; I did not know what to do. I went up stairs, put on my bonnet and shawl, and went out to watch if anything was taken out; I shut the street door as I went out, and the middle door also, and on getting into the street, I saw a man standing with his back against the India House, looking up the court. I did not know what to do, so I went down the street - the man followed me quickly down the street. I returned to the house, and found both the doors wide open; the prisoner came out of the parlour into the passage. I asked what she did with both the doors open, saying I thought Mr. Kriwen would be angry if he knew it - she said,</p>

               <p>"I expect a friend;" I said,</p>
               <p>"Let him ring the bell;" she shut the parlour door; I passed her, and went into the parlour, and found a bundle standing on a chair there; she stood before the chair sometime, and seemed confused. I said I thought all was not right, and that she had been there a very short time; she said,</p>
               <p>"Then you are a very suspicious woman;" I then caught sight of the bundle, and called in Mr. Barr. the clerk - he came - I said something induced me to think all was not right, and at that instant she left the parlour. I then saw what the bundle was; there was a silver bread basket in it, and the silver which is now in it - Barr immediately locked it up. I did not examine it till master returned. I did not see the prisoner afterwards till she was taken. I am the cook. The plate was usually kept in a closet adjoining the bed-room.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Kirwen; his house is in the parish of St. Andrew Undershaft, Aldgate Ward. King called me about five minutes before eight o'clock; I went into the parlour, and the prisoner went up stairs. King was extremely agitated, and pointed to a bundle, which I examined; it contained plate - I immediately locked it up in the counting-house. A bread basket and other plate was in it; but I cannot say what; I kept it till about twelve o'clock, when Mr. and Mrs. Kirwen came home; I took it up to Mr. Kirwen myself. I went up stairs to endeavour to find the prisoner, and found her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180009"/>walking backwards and forwards on the leads, in a very distracted manner; I was afraid she would make away with herself, and persuaded her to come in and stay in the room till Mr. Kirwan came home. She said nothing to me. The bundle contained various articles of plate, a bread basket, silver tray, and other things.</p>

            . I live next door to Mr. Kirwan. The clerk came to me; I went to the house, and found the prisoner on the leads in great agitation; and after she came in, she desired me to go on the leads with her, to assist her to bring in a basket off the leads, but having the gout, I was not able - she fetched it in herself, and said it was plate. I immediately locked it up, without opening it, and it was not taken out until Mr. Kirwan came home - Lloyd carried it in to Mr. Kirwan. I asked her what was in the basket; she said it was plate, and that she put it there in her confusion, to hide it, and that there was a person at the door, who had induced her to do it, through his poverty - that he was her husband. The basket was on the outside of the leads, fastened round to the railing; it was dark; I could not see it, but I felt it hanging to the railing.</p>

On the 16th of January, about six o'clock in the evening. I went up to the top warehouse, and found a candle placed in a very dangerous situation, and placed so that it would not he seen at the window - I could find nobody there. I looked about, and just as I took the candle up, I saw Palmer peeping in at the window; he came in; I asked what he did out there - he was agitated, and made no answer. I ran down stairs, and went to the end of my premises; Simmons followed me. I went to the end of the yard, suspecting somebody was there, and that Palmer had been throwing something down to him. Hatt was trying to get over the pails at the end of the warehouse - he had been in the warehouse, and was getting back over a hoard, from the bottom of the warehouse. A house had been pulled down there. He was under the window at which Palmer came in; he was getting over into the street. We stopped him, and found two bundles of whalebone hair, weighing 20 lbs., over the board. I am sure it is mine, by the string round it; it had come from Hull, and is a particular sort of string.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was Hatt on your premises - A. He was off the premises. I did not see him on the premises, but he was under the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Would a line falling from the window come upon him - A. No; he was about three yards from it, round the corner at the end of the warehouse; he could not see the window where he stood. It was not usual for me to go up stairs at that time. There was a small piece of glass broken in the window, but not sufficient for the hair to fall out.</p>

On the night of the 26th of January, about ten o'clock, Mr. Creed called on me, and stated something, in consequence of which, next morning at eight o'clock, when Seaton came to work I called him in, and asked where he went last night after he left work; he said to the Welch Harp, public-house, to get a pint of beer - I said,</p>
               <p>"Did you go anywhere else;" he said, No, and persisted in it. I put him aside, and called Hatt, who was also my porter - he said he went to the Red Lion, public-house; I said he went somewhere afterwards; he said, Yes, he helped Thomas lock up the stable, but took nothing with him. Seaton then came up, and said, if I would forgive him, he would tell me all about it; I said I certainly should punish him-he said he had stolen a can of oil, and that it was old sediments, which had been at the wharf at the water side, and was going to sell it for cart grease; I said if it was that sort, it was fit for my cart, but I went to his house, and found the can hid in his cellar, full of sperm oil. I believe it to be Hatt's only offence. Seaton had 21 s. a week.</p>

On the 26th of January, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, I went out, returned between twelve and one, and missed a waistcoat, which was safe that morning; also a shirt of my boy's. The prisoner slept in the same room with me and five more; I had left him in bed; he returned in the evening, and I asked if he had my boy's shirt, or my waistcoat; he said No; I said if he did not say what he had done, I should use foul means - he then said he had sold them at No. 32, Monmouth-street. I had him apprehended, and found them at No. 82.</p>

I returned before five o'clock, went up stairs, and did not notice any thing wrong then. I went out again about five o'clock - it was not quite dark, but the lamps were lighted. I put the key on the bannisters as before, locked the stable-door, and took the key with me.

I went into the adjoining room, and found his box taken off the table and put on the bed, opened, and all his clothes and mine gone - it had not been locked.

I asked where he slept the night before I apprehended him; he said no where, for he had no money to pay for his lodging. I found 3 s. 7 d. in his pocket when I took him. I asked where he slept on Monday night; he said, in St. Giles's, but could not tell in what street. On the Thursday following, I heard he had sent a letter by Charles Serjeant, for the prosecutor and prosecutrix to come to him at Tothill-fields. I reported this on Monday at Marlborough-street, and Ballard was sent with the prosecutrix to him; and on the same day I accompanied Ballard to his lodging; we went into the room he had slept in, and found two bundles which contained a coat, three pair of breeches, and a quantity of property claimed by Child.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was desired by the Magistrate, on the 9th of February, to accompany Mrs. Child to Tothill Fields, to see the prisoner. I said to him</p>
               <p>"You have seat for Mr. Child, what have you to say to her." After a little hesitation, he said, he wanted to know what Mrs. Child had to say - what promises she had to make to him. I told him she was not come to make any promise, for she could not be allowed to do any thing of the sort, that she was come in consequence of his having sent for her, and he might say what he liked, and if not, we must go back again, for she could make no promise; he then said he should like to see Mr. Child; we both said he could not come, and if he came, the Magistrate would not allow him to see him, unless I was present; he hesitated a good deal, and repeated again that he should like to see him. I said he could not, and said,</p>
               <p>"Do you mean to say anything, if not, we shall go;" after a little hesitation, he asked for pen, ink and paper. I said I had a small memorandum book and pencil, which I gave him, and at the same time told him no promise could be made whatever, his statement must be voluntary; he then wrote in this book (reads)</p>
               <p>"That part of the things were at his lodgings, at Mrs. Patterson's, a public-house in Oxford-street, and one coat at a pawnbroker's, named Stonestreet, in Oxford-street" In answer to a question put to him, he told me in what part of the room the things were, and which was his room. I went and enquired where he directed me, and they did not know him by name; but I described his person, and the room he said he lodged in. I was shewn into a bed-room, and found all this property, which I produce, except one coat, which I found by his direction at a clothes shop, at the corner of Chandler-street, and David-street - not a pawnbroker's. I have had the property ever since - it was claimed by Child.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not Mrs. Child say she would not prosecute me if I made a confession - A. She said nothing of the kind in my presence, and I was not absent.</p>
               <p>MRS. CHILD. Before he was taken to prison, I said if he would confess where the things were, I would not appear against him if I could possibly help it - this was on the 4th of February. I think I said so more than once.</p>

On the 26th of January, at a little after six o'clock in the evening, I was in the parlour - it was quite dark, the window was shut, and the outer shutter put to, but not fastened. I am sure that the sash was down. As the bell was going eight o'clock, my daughter went into the parlour, and called me; I found the window sash open, and thrown up to the top. I went through into the bed-room, which is on the same floor, to see if any one was concealed. My daughter called me, and I missed three Bibles, a knife-case, and a watch-case stand, off the mantle-piece; a work-box, three yards of lace; two pin-cushions, two umbrellas, which hung on the parlour door, and a pinafore, marked A.

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 26th of January, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner passed me in the Curtain-road, with a bundle under his arm, about half a mile from the prosecutor's. I asked what he was carrying, he said some books, which he had brought from his father - it was three Bibles. I asked where his father lived, he said in Edward-street, Commercial-road. I took him into custody, and then he said he had brought them from nowhere - the watch-stand fell from his person. He afterwards said two men met him at the top of the Curtain-road, and gave him the bundle to carry, and that each of them were carrying an umbrella. I said I should take him to the public-house and search him, which I did, and found some duplicates on him, and a pinafore in his hat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He said each of the men were carrying umbrellas - A. Yes; and that they were on the other side of the way.</p>

I left town on the 4th of November last; before that I locked up several valuable articles in different wardrobes on the second floor of my house. I came to town in December, and saw all the property safe on the 13th of December, where I had placed it. Some repairs were to be done in the breakfast-room, in which part of the articles were; the others were in a room adjoining, and all were under lock and key. My jewell-case was in a third room, in which no repairs whatever were going on; the jewel-case contained a pearl necklace. The prisoners were at work at the house - they had the key of the two rooms, but not of the third. I left two female servants in care of the house; the dirk was in one of the wardrobes in the breakfast room, and my clothes were in another wardrobe in the same room - the wardrobes have a drawer in the centre for papers; these two centre drawers have better locks than the doors; my snuff-box was in the upper division of the same wardrobe as the dirk - the lace and ladies clothes were, I believe, in the bed-room. I employed Mr. Hudson, a builder of respectability to do the repairs. I left town on the 18th of December - returned on the 15th of January, and on Saturday, the 17th, I had occasion to unlock my writing-desk, and found the key go stiff. I unlocked the desk, but could not relock it, but had no suspicion. I took no more notice of it on that day, but on Sunday the 18th, in consequence of information, I tried the lower part of the wardrobe, where the dirk was, but could not open the lock, I then tried the upper part, in which the snuff-box was, opened it, and missed the snuff-box; and hearing that goods to a considerable amount were missing, I sent for an officer, and on further search, found the jewel-case had been forced; the lock was a patent one, and the depredators being unable to force it, had wrenched the lid off; various articles of jewellery were missing, among which was a necklace of seventy-eight large pearls, with a diamond clasp in the centre - the centre diamond was a large, and a remarkable one, yellow, and set in gold; there were fourteen other diamonds in it. I also lost an amethyst and topaz head ornament, a pair of ear-rings, of amethyst and pearl - that is all I missed from the jewel-case. On examining the drawers in the sleeping-room, we found they had been opened, and many of the locks injured; (there were twenty-six locks in all opened.) I then went to the wardrobe, and opened the place were the dirk was, and missed that. I opened the place by force - the lock was immediately taken off, and the bolt had been sprung, by the application of a false key, and could not be opened again, and to that I ascribe the safety of a number of valuable articles which still remained there. I went to the other wardrobe in the same room, and missed a blue dress-coat and from the appearance of the drawer, I am certain other things were taken. I found a remnant of lace severed from the rest of a large piece in the bed-room. I missed a coronation gold medal, two other snuff-boxes, one tortoiseshell and gold, and the other a remarkable tortoiseshell, with a Scotch pebble on the top of it; and next day, in looking over another part of the room, I found the medal and snuffboxes in the drawing-room in a china dish. The value of all that I lost was 7 or 800 l. I have recovered the pearls since. I have received the dirk from Inderwing.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mr. Macqueen. I was left in the house when he went from town - the three prisoners were employed to paint the breakfast-room, on the ground floor; it looks into Park-lane, and there was a little job in the bedroom - they had nothing to do higher up in the house than that bed-room. One day while they were there, (it was three or four days after they came, or more than that) I went up the back stair-case, to go into the back drawing-room, and found some resistance behind the door - they had no business in that room. I opened the door a little, and somebody pushed it back. I was frightened, and ran away. I went up and mentioned it to Joseph Thompson, and asked him to come down into the drawing-room, and as we came down we met his brother James - he had come up a fight of stairs higher than the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180015"/>drawing-room - he said he had been into the room by mistake, to look for a crack. I said the crack was in the dining-room, and not there; a young man came to the house once or twice afterwards, and one day, I saw an old man in the house; he asked me which way he should go out. I told him to go out at the front door, and soon afterwards I went up to let my aunt out, and found the door open. I went up to one of the prisoners. I think (Joseph), and asked him who it was that went out - they said their master or governor, or something. I took no notice of any thing else, till master came to town.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. - Q. Who else was at work there - A. Mr. Stubbings and his two sons, and two carpenters, while master was away.</p>

            . I am nephew to Mr. Harrison, pawnbroker, Wardour-street. (Looking at the dirk.) On the 18th of December, I took a dirk in pawn exactly resembling this of the prisoner William, for 1 l. 1 s. The duplicate of it was lost; and on the 9th of January he applied for the form of an affidavit of the loss of a duplicate, which I furnished him with. The affidavit was afterwards brought to me by one of the other two prisoners, but I do not know which. I saw William sign the affidavit. The one who brought the affidavit paid me the money, and redeemed the dirk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You attended to him yourself - A. Partly; I have known him several years, and am certain of him - he brought it in the day time - he came into the boxes. I am not certain of the value of it, but should fancy that I got a good price if I sold it for two guineas, as a fancy article in trade; it might cost ten guineas to make it - I never saw such a thing before. He came for an affidavit on the 9th of January, alone. It is usual to make an affidavit when a duplicate is lost - I produce it: it is sworn before Mr. Conant; one of the other prisoners redeemed it. I have a counter-part of the duplicate.

            . I live at No. 23, Jermyn-street. I bought this dirk about a month ago - the prisoners James and Joseph were together when I bought it. It was on a Monday, about three weeks before I went to Bow-street, about twelve o'clock - I gave them 30 s. for it; one of them had been to my shop and bought a travelling cap, and before he left, asked if I bought anything in the fancy way; he said he had a Scotch dirk, that he bought at the time he was in Scotland, and was of no use to him now, and three or four days afterwards he brought it; I gave 30 s. for it, and sold it to a person who came from Norwich, for 2 l, on the same day.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Were you taken into custody - A. No. I did not know the value of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have the goodness to tell me the day of the month - A. It was about three weeks before I went to Bow-street, which was last Saturday week.</p>
               <p>MR. MACQUEEN. This is my dirk; the chasing and binding have been taken off - it is an old family one; in 1816, I sent it to Edinburgh to have it ornamented - I paid for the ornaments and a pair of buttons, 39 l. odd. I can conscientiously swear that it is worth five guineas. I believe if I went to buy one, I should he asked five guineas for a common one, without the carmagoran ornaments.</p>

I saw it again at Bow-street, about three weeks after; there was a warrant issued for me; I was in custody from Saturday till Monday morning, and then gave this account to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you have worked at your trade, and got your living honestly for the last six months - A. Yes. I have known the prisoners three months; not more than four.

            . I am shopman to Mr. Carnegie, No. 57, King-street, Soho, a refiner and dealer in stones. I saw the prisoner James at our shop with a pearl necklace, with a diamond snap; I did not have it in my hand. The pearls were about the size of a cherry-stone; (looking at some,) they were about this size; the snap had a good many diamonds in it. I saw Mr. Carnegie take them out; there were several; I do not know what he did with them - they were weighed; he sold them to Mr. Carnegie: I left the place before the money was paid - he was to give him 3 l. per carat. I do not know what they weighed.</p>

               <p>Q. What was done with the gold they were set in - A. I do not know. I saw the pearls afterwards in Mr. Carnegie's possession - I do not know what became of them. Mr. Carnegie has a crucible.</p>
               <p>Q. Which is generally warm - A. No. We put the gold together, and melt it in a week or a month; this gold was melted in a lot, I dare say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that it was - A. Not that identical gold.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not this melted within two hours - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Within twelve - A. I cannot say. I do not know what the pearls are worth.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Was anybody present but you and your honest master - A. No. My master was apprehended and taken to Bow-street. The pearls were brought to us in the form of a necklace, in the evening, after dark. I think the prisoner separated them. I had seen him once or twice before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long before that had he been at your shop - A. Perhaps a month before; it was only James; he brought some hits of gold, and old jewellery. I do not know what sort.</p>

            . I live at No. 57, King-street, Soho, and am a dealer in gold and silver. I buy diamonds and pearls, and anything in the jewellery way - I melt gold and part a little, but do not refine. I have been in the house about twenty-two years. The prisoner James has been to my house three times as well as I can recollect; he always said he bought the things which he came to sell - he has brought in little his of gold and silver, and a pair of broken ear-rings - I bought a pearl necklace with a diamond snap of him; the snap contained better than three carats of diamonds; the center one was larger than the rest, and a very discoloured, a very dark one. I took them all at 3 l. a carat. I paid him for the gold they were set in, and melted it.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you melt it - A. It might be eight days; I bought them on the 26th of December. I may have melted them within four days after, on perhaps a fortnight; he asked 2 s. each, for the pearls, which I gave him.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the lowest value of them - A. I cannot say, for I never had to do with such large ones - we have them at 1 d. and 2 s. each. I have bought some at 4 s. 6 d. and 5 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that they were worth 15 s. each - A. When they were new they might; I should think the fair trading price now would be 15 s. each. There were seventy-eight of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave 2 s. each for them - A. Yes; but I did not set the price; he shewed me an amethyst center of a brooch or necklace, but I did not buy it, and I think he shewed me something of a painting. I cleaned the diamonds, and put them into my diamond boxes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of them - A. The officer has the largest ones mixed with my own; the small ones are sold.</p>
               <p>Q. For how much per carat - A. Five pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. They are not so valuable as the large ones - A. Yes; for the large ones were discoloured.</p>
               <p>Q. When this matter was talked about what was done with the pearls - A. My wife took them to her mother's at Westminster, and afterwards sent the servant to fetch them - they were brought back to my house, and given up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Were you ever tried here - A. Never. The moment the solicitor for the prosecution came to me I acknowledged that I had bought them.</p>

James Thomson gave me a bunch of keys, a bow, and three glass feathers, and told me to give them to Mr. Beer, who keeps a book-shop in Little Windmill-street; (looking at the keys.) these are what he gave me. I saw him give Beer a few china images a few days after; it was about six weeks ago.</p>
               <p>JOHN BEER. I am a bookseller. Osborne gave me the keys and feathers - James Thomson gave me the images and a piece of lace, to keep for him for a day as two - it was six weeks or two months ago.</p>
               <p>MR. MACQUEEN. These glass feathers belong to High-land cap of mine; the cap was in a cap-case, in my bedroom, with three feathers of this kind.

On Sunday, the 24th of January, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner passed me in Goswell-street, with a bundle, I asked what he was carrying - he said, butter. I took him into a public-house, and asked him how he came by it - he said his brother-in-law, who lived near Cambridge-heath, gave it to him - he did not know the name of the street, or number of the house, but his name was Chiswick; that his brother-in-law had left Mr. Tucker, his master, about a fortnight ago, and he gave him a tub of butter, a cask of ale, and a sack of coke. I locked him up, and at eleven o'clock went to him - he said,</p>
               <p>"Now I will tell you the truth," and said voluntarily, that if I would go to Tipple's, I should hear all about it, that he got it from there. I found some pieces of gum among the butter, which was in a tin dish.</p>

I took hold of a knife, and said</p>
               <p>"Deliver it up, or I will cut your block off," and she gave me my pocket, there was a sovereign and 16 s. in it. I said I had lost more, but if she would give me half I would give her the rest. When I left the Cross Keys, I had six sovereigns and 16 s. loose in my breeches pocket.

When he was gone, I found I had given him 9 d. short, and waited his return, and not coming in a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes. I went to the banker's saw Mr. Smith, and found the bill unpaid. I went to his brother-in-law's, where he lodged, but could not find him; but on the Monday following, I found him at Portsmouth, and asked why he had absconded with the money, if I had used him ill; he said voluntarily that I was a very good master; he could say nothing for himself, and was very sorry for what he had done - the 10 l. note was stopped at the Bank. I found a boy in town whom I understood he was acquainted with - he behaved well. I believe it to be his first offence.</p>

I fetched a light, heard a noise above, and saw the prisoner sitting on the leads over the door; I told him to come down, and secured him. He could get out of the window on to the leads; I did not notice whether it was open - there is a lamp post near the window.</p>

He went away, returned in an hour and a half, and asked if his friend had been, and desired me to shew him the watch again - he held it in his hand some time, and suddenly threw a quantity of snuff into my face, and ran out of the house with the watch and seals; he ran down Castle-street, and I after him; he stumbled and fell. I saw some person pick him up. I went back to look for the watch, as I saw his arm move, and thought I saw him throw it down; some person in the crowd picked it up; it was taken to the watch-house, and returned to me at Bow-street - I am sure it is the watch I shewed him; but the two gold seals, a key, and part of the chain are gone. I am sure he is the man - he was half an hour with me the first time. The value of the watch, chain, and seals is full 4 l.; I would not take that for them.</p>

            . I am a watchman. The prisoner was stopped, and I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) I solemnly declare, with a clear conscience, I am as innocent of this charge as one who never saw London, and I am as positive as the persons who prosecute me, however positive that they may feel that I am the person. I was in company with some persons from half-past seven o'clock, until a quarter to ten; and scarcely had left one of the party, when I proceeded down Castle-street, towards the Haymarket, and on hearing the cry behind me, of Stop thief! I was in the act of turning round, and was knocked down by a man that was in full speed; he passed on, and I imagined he entered a public-house, and about one minute afterwards, I was picked up by some people, and conveyed to the watch-house, where I was charged with this. It was not until the next morning that I was sensible of the nature of the charge, because at the time I was knocked down, I was nearly intoxicated, which together with the effects of the fall, rendered me quite insensible for a time; but should I be convicted of this shameful charge, I hope your Lordship will in pity sake, send me out of the country, where I can reap unmolested, the benefits arising from industry - for believe me, my Lord, was I found guilty of this false charge, and the gates of this prison thrown open to me, it would be constant misery to me, for all my prospects in this country are blasted.</p>

            . I live in John-street, Curtain-road, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch, and rent the house. On the 15th of February, I and my wife went out together, leaving nobody in the house. I shut the doors and windows, and on returning, about eight o'clock, I opened the door with the key, and found two men in the house; I am positive that Moore is one of them, but cannot speak to the other; both ran away, and I followed them. Moore was stopped without my losing sight of him; the other ran down Charlotte-street, and next morning Glede was taken. I examined the house, and missed a clothes brush and a pair of shoes, which were safe about eleven o'clock in the morning, when we went out. They must have entered the house in front; there were marks of a crow-bar where they had tried to open the door; but it must have been opened by a false key. I saw Moore throw a crow-bar away as he ran. I did not see it picked up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Are you sure that you locked the door when you went out - A. I do not know whether my wife, or myself locked it but I tried it, and it was fast. I was not at home after eleven o'clock.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife - we went out at eleven o'clock; the door was fastened - we always try it, and are very particular with it; we returned about eight o'clock, my husband unlocked the door. I passed him, and the prisoner Glede caught hold of me by the shoulder. I saw them both in the parlour before they touched me - they had no light, but there is a gaslight from a public-house opposite. Glede took me by his two hands, as I was entering the parlour, and shoved me right out of doors. I am certain of him - Moore was behind him; Glede ran out first, and Moore followed. When a light was brought, I found every cupboard-door in the parlour thrown open, and a clothes brush, and pair of shoes taken off the table; there was nothing else down stairs that they could have taken; there was property up stairs. I saw Glede at the watch-house next morning, and knew him. I looked at him quite amazed in the room; the light was strong enough for me to notice his features. I thought at first that it was my brother playing us a trick; we have not found the brush or shoes; there were marks of a crow-bar on the door; it had been opened by a key.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You at first thought it was your brother - A. I did not know what to think; my brother could not get into the house - my back was to the light, and his face towards it. I looked at him, before they moved to go out; they were hid up in a corner ready to run out when the door was open; we have no lodgers.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BEADLE READ. I live in Hoxton-market-place, and am in the prosecutor's service. I was standing near the house, and saw master and mistress come down the street, and open the door. I heard mistress scream, and master call Stop thief! I saw a person run out, and pursued him. I did not see him come out of the door; he was about five yards from it, and got off. I did not see his face, and do not know who he was. I saw him throw something away. I got a lantern, and found a crow-bar in the street, about thirty yards from the house - that was not thrown down by the man who I saw. Next morning I found three skeleton keys at the bottom of Willow-walk, three hundred yards from the house; the man I followed ran by that spot, and threw something from him there; he ran through Willow-walk.</p>

            . I am a constable. Turner gave Moore into my charge at ten minutes past eight o'clock. I found nothing nothing upon him. I locked him up, returned to the house, got a light, and went into Willow-walk, and found a dark lantern and phosphorus box, picklock key, and crow-bar, and the other keys were given to me next morning. I tried the crow-bar to the door, it exactly fits the marks, and here is some of the blue paint of the door on it. Next morning I apprehended Glede, in consequence of information, locked him up, and fetched Mrs. Turner, who said in his hearing,</p>

On the 17th of January I had occasion to look at a pane of glass in my front window, which had been previously cut or started in two directions. I observed one of the pieces of glass almost loosened, but not out, and, just after four o'clock, I observed the two prisoners at the window, and told my servants 
               <persName id="t18240218-46-person482">Freeman</persName>
             and Carpenter. I sent Freeman into Holborn, to stand near the hackney coaches, and told Carpenter to have his eye on the pane of glass; the prisoners separated several times, and came backwards and forwards to the window for nearly half an hour - they then came back together to the broken pane. Carpenter opened the door, and pursued - Salt ran off down Holborn. I went out immediately, and secured Gibson, who ran among the hackney coaches. I brought him into the shop. Carpenter and Freeman immediately brought Salt in with a pistol, which I missed from the window; they were taken to the watch-house, and, on searching, the constable found a knife on Salt; the blade of it fitted the marks made in the window frame - a piece of cork was found in the shop, which fell from one of them; there was a quantity of grease at one end of it; the piece of glass was out of the window, and we could not find it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Had you lighted candles - A. No. It was between four and five o'clock, and quite light. I was in the shop, and saw them for half an hour - there is a glass case to my window. I have to look through two glasses - my attention was directed to them. I have seen them both before at my window repeatedly, and knew them well. I cannot be mistaken in them; the glass was loose when I looked at it, but not a piece of it was out. I have inquired, and find Salt's mother is a decent woman, and that he bore an honest character.</p>

Master sent me out the back way - I went out to the coach-stand, and in about five minutes saw the arm of the prisoner, Salt, go towards the glass, and directly afterwards Carpenter opened the door and ran out. Salt ran away, and we both pursued; and when he had got near the end of the coach-stand, he threw the pistol away - I saw him swing his arm, but did not see the pistol come from him. I stopped at that spot till Carpenter brought him back to me, and he asked him what he had done with the pistol - he said,</p>
               <p>"What pistol? - I have not had any pistol." Carpenter said,</p>
               <p>"Don't tell me that, for I saw you take it out." We both looked for it, and found it under a coach, opposite to where he threw his hand out - I took it back to the shop, and gave it to Mr. Parker.</p>

I saw the prisoners lurking about, to and from the window, for half an hour - they then both came to the window, and I saw Salt push the piece of glass out; he then put his two fingers inside, and lifted a pistol off a peg which it stood on, and took it through the hole in the glass. I then moved from where I stood. Salt ran off, and on opening the door Gibson ran also. I pursued Salt, who was first, running down Holborn; I first came up with Gibson, but did not meddle with him, and after I had passed him he cried out,</p>
               <p>"Master, I have got the pistol." I answered,</p>

               <p>"I will let you know who has got it;" and when I came within three yards of Salt, he turned his hend and saw me; he put his left hand towards his pocket, and I very distinctly saw him throw the pistol under one of the coaches. I still pursued, and took him about five yards farther, and brought him back. Foreman met me - we found it under the coach, and took it back to the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you observe the state of the glass before they came up to it - A. Yes; no part of it was out before, but it had been cracked - it was quite daylight.</p>

             was one of them, and the prisoner another. We dined altogether in the field, about one o'clock, and were all in good humour at dinner - we had a pot of strong beer each. We got up from dinner between one and two, and went across the swath of clover towards our work. Words occurred between Johnson and Richardson - Johnson swore that he had a foot wider swath than Richardson - he said he would lay him 1 s. that he had. They continued walking further across the field - we were nearly all together. Richardson said to Johnson, with an oath, that he would strike him - we all had our scythes; Johnson threw down his, and, with an oath, told him to hit him, if he liked. Richardson still repeated that he would strike Johnson, but I never saw that he did, nor did I see him make any attempt to strike him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there anything to hinder your seeing him if he had - A. No; I was within two poles of him - he possibly might have hit him, but I never saw him - my back was sometimes towards him - I was walking before them sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. After Johnson threw down his scythe, what was next done - A. Richardson still threatened to hit him. Johnson picked up his scythe, and, with an oath, swore he would chop his legs off. He had hold of the handles of his scythe as if he was going to mow, holding it in both hands. He stepped up to him with his scythe as soon as he possibly could pick it up, and said he would chop his legs off.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180024"/>They stood hesitating together some little time, and then the prisoner struck him with the scythe. Richardson had not got his scythe, he had laid it down.</p>
               <p>Q. After Johnson had taken up his scythe, had Richardson used words of any kind to him, and before he struck at Richardson - A. They stood wrangling together - the prisoner struck him with the scythe, and Richardson directly fell backward, and said,</p>
               <p>"Oh Lord! Oh dear! - You have killed me!" I ran to Johnson and said,</p>
               <p>"Oh Lord! Oh dear! What have you done! - are you not ashamed of yourself?" He said he would serve any man so that meddled with him; he was in a passion at that time. I was so much frightened at seeing the deceased lay bleeding there, that I ran immediately for a horse and cart to carry him away. I was not gone half an hour, and when I returned Johnson was gone - Richardson laid as I had left him; we put him into the cart and took him home. He said he was dying, and died in a few hours. I saw him after he was dead. The prisoner lived near Hadley. I never saw him afterwards till this month, when he was in custody at the Town Hall, Borough.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the deceased a stout young man - A. He was tall and thin, but stouter than the prisoner - the whole cause of the quarrel was about their work - we were all very sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe at any time that Richardson had clenched his fist, as if to strike him - A. No, he threatened him; he said,</p>
               <p>"D - n your eyes, I am a good mind to hit you." I did not look at him till I saw Johnson pick up his scythe. I was walking before them; he struck him in the left thigh; the scythe went through one thigh and struck the other.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do not you know that the man was a quarrelsome fellow, he was a quarreling with you before - A. He quarrelled with me the year before that, but not on this day; they were both very hot tempered resolute men. I have known him quarrel, but there was no quarrel on that day before this circumstance - he was of a hasty temper.</p>

            . In June, 1821, I was working in Mr. Paris's field, on a Friday, and dined with the men - we were all in a very good humour at dinner, and after that, words occurred between the prisoner and Richardson, about which had got the biggestswath from the ground - I do not know which began it; they kept wrangling, and I left them; but before that, the prisoner asked me to measure the swath, I said I would not, and begged of them to come to work - they still kept wrangling, and I heard Richardson say to Johnson, that if he called him so again, he would knock him down. I did not hear Johnson make any answer. I went on a little farther, and then heard Richardson scream out. I instantly turned round, and saw him lay bleeding on the ground. I went back to him immediately - he was laying flat on his back with his heels up in the air - I do not recollect his speaking. I saw the prisoner at that time, but did not observe what he was doing; the scythe laid on the ground a very little way from Richardson. I asked the prisoner if he was not ashamed of what he had done; he said No, he was not ashamed for he would serve any person so who hit him. I helped afterwards to put Richardson into a cart, and tied five handkerchiefs round the wound on his thigh, before I could staunch the blood; we took him home - he died that afternoon. I did not see Johnson again till he was apprehended; he lived in Enfield parish, and had a wife and children. I have to state that Richardson was certainly a very aggravating, domineering man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far off were you when you heard the scream - A. About twenty yards, or more. I could not see Richardson strike him if he ever did.</p>

            . I was working for Mr. Paris at this time; we finished dinner between one and two o'clock, and were very good friends; but, on the way to our work, words passed between the prisoner and Richardson; they laid a bet, which had the biggest swath. I left them at high words, and was going down the field. I turned my head, and saw Johnson coming down the field with his scythe on his shoulder - he had laid it down to measure their work, when I turned to go away. I turned and saw him with his scythe, and saw the deceased coming after him - he also had his scythe on his shoulder - they were still at high words. I turned round and saw the deceased have his left hand up, with his fist clenched, holding it towards Johnson (he was a left handed man) he was within reach of him - they were almost close together - he was near enough to hit him. I kept my eye on him, and did not see him hit him.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time he held up his fist, had Johnson his scythe in his hand - A. Not at that moment, but when Richardson held up his fist, Johnson picked up his scythe, and cut him down. I saw the blood flow from the wound; he fell instantly, and the blood came from his thigh. I heard him say,</p>
               <p>"Lord have mercy upon me." I went to fetch the surgeon, and when I came back, he was taken home. I saw him when he was dead.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I think you must have seen him hit me, when he held his fist up - A. I never saw him strike him, only hold up his hand as if to strike him.</p>

            . I was working in the field when this happened. We all dined together in good temper, and as we crossed towards the work, words arose between the deceased and prisoner, about which had done the most work. I went on about my business, and began to work at some distance. Johnson came to me soon after, and asked if I had got any money in my pocket - I said I believed I had 4 s.; he asked me to let him have it - I gave it to him, and he went away. I did not know what had happened then - I was twenty or thirty poles from where the quarrel began.

            . I am a surgeon. On the 9th of June 1821, I was sent for to see the deceased. I found him wounded in the thigh, about six inches above the knee: the principal wound was a very extensive one in the left thigh - the principal artery was divided; he died between three and four o'clock. His death was occasioned by the division of that artery. The wound was on the side of his thigh, and passed through - it might have been done with a scythe.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Beckett was the first man who came up to me, and said,</p>
               <p>"D - n your eyes, you have killed this man, and I will hang you." He fell on me and knocked me about, and all of them knocked me about. The deceased had been quarrelling all day about mowing, with Austin; and when he challenged to fight me, the row began. He said he would lay me a pot of beer that his work was two feet more than mine - Austin and Beckett measured it, and mine was two feet more. I said,</p>
               <p>"Now, Jem, I have won." He said,</p>
               <p>"No, you have not; and you shall pay, or I will thrash you." I threw down my scythe, took it up again, and he ran after me and kicked my backside, and then I cut him with the scythe.</p>

I went into the counting-house, and found that the iron chest had been opened by a key, which was afterwards found at the watch-house. Several bottles of wine were taken down and put into a basket, which had a bladder in it; a 5 s. paper of halfpence, and two skeleton keys, were picked up in a drain in the passage; a dark lantern and crow-bar were found - the largest skeleton key opened the street door; a half-crown and three shillings and sixpence were found in the drain, and a door communicating with the upper part of the house was forced open.</p>

On the 31st of January, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I heard a noise in their room - I thought it was a table thrown down; I heard bad words pass between them, and then heard something like earthenware breaking - I could not tell whether it was thrown or whether anything fell on it. The prisoner came into my room with nothing on but his shirt, which seemed very wet. He said,</p>
               <p>"See how I am used by this drunken woman." She rushed in after him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Come out of this room, for here you shall not be," using very coarse language. She was in a great passion, and very much in liquor. Riley and his sick wife were in bed in my room; he said,</p>
               <p>"Go out of the room, both of you, and don't disturb my sick wife." She said,</p>
               <p>"D - n you and your wife." and took a plate off the table and threw it at him. She would not go out; Riley got up and pushed her out. I observed a little blood on her arms. She went out, brought in two watchmen, and gave charge of the prisoner and Riley. The prisoner was lame, and said he could not walk to the watch-house; he was at last taken there, but the woman being drunk, they would not take the charge. She charged the prisoner and Riley with heating and cutting her.</p>

            . I am surgeon of St. Bartholomew's Hospital; the woman was brought there on Sunday morning, the 31st of January; she had a cut on her forehead, which laid the bone bare. I did not apprehend danger. I told her to come next morning, to have it dressed, but she did not come till Thursday; it was then very much inflamed, erysipelas had spread over her face; she died on the Tuesday week following; the erysipelas caused her death; it often follows wounds, where people have a bad constitution; it commenced first in the wound; if she had lived temperately. I think it would not have come on; my opinion is, that the wound did not cause her death.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that the deceased was intoxicated, and had thrown a pot of beer, and the contents of the chamber utensil at him, and, by endeavouring to prevent his leaving the room, she had fallen over it.</p>

On the 15th of January, he came to me, and stated, that a quantity of galls ought to be forwarded immediately to Scotland; we had been particularly engaged; he said, he had better pay for them, and forward them. I asked him the amount, he produced the weigh-notes of the East India Company, and in pencil put down the amount, and said it was 86 l. 11 s. 11 d., but that the Company owed us 9 l. 10 s. overpaid on a former occasion, and a draft for 77 l. 1 s. 11 d. would be required for these galls. I wrote a draft for that amount, desired him to pay for them, and forward them immediately. I asked him in the afternoon if he had done so, he said yes, and had forwarded them. I asked him repeatedly since, in consequence of a correspondence between us and our friends in Scotland; he invariably said, that they were forwarded; he absconded last Monday week, and we discovered this.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bishopsgate Ward. On the 19th of February, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I was in Bishopsgate-street, and saw the prisoner in company with another; the prisoner had a basket on his shoulder; they crossed over, and went through Clark's-court - I went round Camomile-street, and stopped the prisoner at the end of the court with it. I asked what it was; he said some wine, which he had brought from the Ship Tavern, and that the landlord's name was Thompson. I said that was not right, and I should detain him - he threw it down and ran away - I pursued and took him in Bishopsgate-street - returned and found the wine.</p>

Purcell went into a baker's-shop; Harmer waited lower down - I went into the shop; the person refused the money, and she came out; they then went to Slack's shop, in Barbican; Purcell went in; Harmer remained about twenty yards off. When she came out I went to the shop, came out, and followed them to a pastry-cook's shop - Purcell went in, and bought something; Harmer waited outside - she came out, and joined him. I went in, and Ware produced me a sixpence from the counter; she marked it before she gave it to me. They went to a cheesemonger's shop; Harmer was brought out to me by Waddington. Purcell was also taken while I was enquiring at the cheesemonger's shop.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was with Colton, and followed the prisoner, and saw them go to Slack's and Clinton's - the woman went into the shops; Harmer waited outside for her; she always came to him, and I saw their hands close together, but saw her give him nothing. They went to Slack's and Clinton's, and then to a cheesemonger's in Beech-street - I there took them into custody. I took Harmer, and observed his left hand in his breeches pocket - a man came up; I said,</p>
               <p>"Lay hold of his left hand;" he pulled his hand out, and I saw something drop - the man picked it up, and gave it to me; I found it contained nine shillings, separately wrapped up, and seven sixpences, all counterfeit. Purcell said she hoped I would he favourable to the man, for he was innocent - that she picked the money up in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180028"/>Somer's-town, and met the man at the Angel, thinking him distressed, and was going to treat him. I asked how he came by them; he said she gave them to him to hold, and it was a d - d had job for him. I found 18 d. or 2 s. worth of copper on him, and a counterfeit shilling in his waistcoat pocket.</p>

On the 19th of January, between two and three o'clock, I went into the kitchen, and saw the prisoner; he caught me round the neck, and struck me in the face - I struggled with him, made an alarm, and got from him. Some people came, but he had then got away. We found him concealed in a large box in the counting-house, with some wearing apparel and my watch; I saw his father take it from him. It was safe in my bed-room at three o'clock that afternoon.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. I left the house at twelve o'clock on Christmas-day - I shut the doors and windows, and double locked the front door. I returned at eleven o'clock at night, with my husband; he put the key to the door, and found it on the spring lock; I am positive that I had double locked it - he unlooked it. I saw a small bundle laying in the passage. I then called a watchman, who went over the house with Mr. Jarvis. The whole of our wearing apparel was gone, and the house in the greatest confusion; all the drawers and boxes empty - they had not been locked in the morning, as we keep no servant. We found nobody in the house. When I went out at twelve o'clock, while I was fastening the door, I saw the prisoners Easterby and Ryan; they had passed the door, and got two or three yards; when they observed me double locking the door; the key makes a great noise; Easterby nudged Ryan on the arm; they spoke to each other, and turned their heads over their shoulders, and saw me take the key out of the lock. I had seen them before, and am certain of their persons. I went down Rawstone-street, and across Spafields - Easterby followed me as far as Spafields, and Ryan followed me only to the end of Rawstone-street. I was at my door on the Sunday following, (the 28th) and saw Easterby opposite the house, standing looking over towards our door - I looked at him, and he walked on. When I first saw him he stood with his hands in his pockets, and appeared smiling. I found part of my property in possession of the officers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You were absent from your house about eleven hours - A. Yes. I knew Ryan and Easterby before, sufficiently to be able to speak to them, and cannot be mistaken. Easterby is of a very striking appearance. Some of the articles stolen were worth more than 40 s., but none of those are found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Are you sure that you saw Ryan - A. Yes; they were both together. Easterby followed me across Spafields; I saw them talking together as far as Rawstone-street; they walked together as far as there, and then only Easterby followed me. I am positive of both on my oath; I have seen both before. Ryan was not with him on Sunday. I saw Ryan pass the shop about a week after.</p>
               <p>Q. Were your suspicions sufficiently excited as to induce you to cause them to be apprehended - A. I described their persons to the patrol, and at Bow-street. I did not take them when I saw them, as I did not know that I had the power.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you anybody to assist you to apprehend him when you saw him on Sunday - A. I called my husband, and told him that was the man who followed me; he looked at him, and came in again. I am certain they are the men who were by my house. I had seen both before.</p>

             re-examined. I came home with my wife and unlocked the door, I found it on the single lock, I am certain; I found a small bundle just beyond the door, and being afraid that some one was in the house, I called a watchman - we went over the house - I found the drawers all empty, and the boxes in the garret empty, and some boxes in the parlour empty; every thing was gone - we have only the parlour and three garrets; the other apartments are to let. Every room had been entered - a cupboard on the first floor was broken open, but there was nothing in it. My desk in the shop which I had left unlocked was opened, and thirty sovereigns gone, which I had saved to pay my rent; it has placed me in great distress - I found every thing gone that was worth a farthing. except a little stock of furniture which I had in my house. A parcel of rags were strewed over the parlour - the salt thrown about the room out of the salt cellars. I found four phosphorus matches in the passage; at the bottom of the stairs, two of them were burnt. The lowest value of the property stolen, is 100 l., including the sovereigns. I had a great quantity of sheets and blankets and things. My wife pointed Ryan and Easterby out from seven or eight others, when they were in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You found matches at the bottom of the stairs - A. Yes, they lead to the garret, and down to the kitchen. There are windows to the kitchen, but the shutters were shut. The front kitchen is secured by iron bars, and has no shutters, and there is a light comes down from the staircase. There was nothing in the kitchen but what they brought up to the passage, which was the bundle, containing two dirty sheets and a petticoat. There is plenty of light below.</p>
               <p>Q. When the back kitchen shutters are shut, can persons see about conveniently - A. They might not see a pin, but could see any thing as large as a hat; the back kitchen is a wash-house; there is light enough to find every thing which was there, or which they could expect to find in a wash-house; it would be dark if they shut the door. We lost spoons, a pepper-box, salt cellars, and other things; no one has any business in the house but my wife and I.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. How many sovereigns did you lose - A. Thirty; seven were found on Ryan. I saw them in the desk that morning. You can see at twilight in the wash-house if the shutters are shut.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In all the rooms except the wash-house was there sufficient light to see to do anything - A. Yes my Lord, it is as light as this Court, and a strong light comes from the staircase and shines into the wash-house.</p>

            . I am a constable of Worship-street. On the 10th of January, I went to the lodgings of the prisoner Easterby, in Turk's Head-court, Golden-lane, with Vann, Garton, and Lines; we went up stairs, knocked at his door, and waited twenty minutes before any one would open it; we got in after some time - when we told our names he opened the door himself, and when I got in I found him and Bennett there. I went to the fire-place, where there appeared to be a quantity of things burnt; we found tinder there, which I took up - it appeared recently burnt - cinders were put on it to smother it. I took it up, it was quite warm; a person wanted to speak to Bennett - I went down stairs, and while I was down Bennett escaped. We took Easterby into custody. I went down on the ground floor of the house, which I do not think was occupied by Easterby, but by the landlord of the house - the door was open - the landlord's name is Sheckell - he is not here. I myself found nothing in Easterby's room - the tinder appeared to me to be like muslin handkerchiefs - it was very fine linen - I took it to the window and examined it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any difference between the tinder of linen and paper - A. I cannot say. Bennett was taken a few days after.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find in the lower room - A. A basket containing a salt-holder, a pepper-box, a veil, several muslin caps and pieces of muslin, and the lining of a bonnet. When I produced the basket before the Magistrate, Easterby said they were his wife's wearing apparel.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. I presume you are not in the habit of burning fine linen - A. No; I do not know what sort of ashes it produces. The things were all in the basket when Easterby said they were his wife's apparel - the basket was not claimed. I took the things out and produced them before he said so. The salt-holder had salt in it when I found it in the basket. The landlord is a very infirm old man, and can hardly speak.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it before the basket was opened, or after the things were produced, that he said they were his wife's - A. After I produced them.</p>

            . I am an officer. I searched this house on the 15th, after the officers had been. I went to Easterby's lodgings, in Turk's Head-court, and found nothing relating to this robbery. On that morning I apprehended Bennett in Mills's room, Little Arthur-street, St. Luke's. I took her up to an upper room, in which was a bed, with three boxes, some hat-boxes, a bonnet-box, and bundle. Bennett took a bonnet off the bed in that room and put it on, and finished dressing herself. (I had taken her in Mills's room.) I asked her who the boxes belonged to - she said they were a person's who was coming there to lodge. I took her down stairs, and asked Mrs. Mills, in her presence, who the property belonged to - Mills said it was Bennett's property, that she had brought it there. Bennett then said it was hers, and gave me the keys of the boxes, which opened them, and in them I found a table-cloth, a towel, and comb; and in the bonnet-box, two frilled handkerchiefs; and on my way with her to her former lodging, where Vann was, I asked her who the basket belonged to; she said it had been her mother's, and was given to her by her sister. I then asked if the ribbons and lace were hers; she said that they were, and that she left them with her landlord on the Friday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did not Mrs. Mills call her Mrs. Easterby, instead of Mrs. Bennett - A. No. The basket was not produced when I was talking to her about it - the table-cloth is not of much value - she might have such a one of her own - none of the articles would be too good for her use.</p>

            . I am a constable of Worship-street. In consequence of information, on Friday, the 9th of January, I went to the lodging of the prisoner King, in Bell-place, Bell-alley, Goswell-street - King was in the room. I asked how long he had lived there - he said</p>
               <p>"Rather better than three months." I said,</p>
               <p>"Is the room furnished" - he said No, the things were his own. I said,</p>
               <p>"Then all the property in this room belongs to you" - he said Yes. We then proceeded to search the room, and under the bedstead, on the floor, were two bundles, containing a salt-cellar and a piece of lace, among other things. Next morning, I went to Easterby's with the officers, and saw the tinder in the fire-place. We found nothing in the room relating to this robbery, but the three boxes which were afterwards found at Mills's were the same boxes which we searched in Easterby's room - I am certain of it. On the 14th, I apprehended Ryan; and between his bed and the sacking I found seventeen sovereigns, tied up in a piece of old rag. Before I opened it I said,</p>
               <p>"Halloo! what is here?" He said,</p>
               <p>"There is seventeen sovereigns, but they are not mine - they are my wife's, which she has saved up." At the office, Easterby said the salt-cellars were given to his wife by her mother.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Where did you find the sovereigns - A. In Ryan's room. I know that he did live there - I think I have seen him there before - I know that it is his room, and know the woman he lives with - he was in the room with his wife, and had just got up, but was not dressed.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with Gleed and Vann to Easterby's room. We were kept outside full twenty minutes. I kept down stairs, and the others went up; and when they got in, I went up stairs. A woman said,</p>
               <p>"They are at home." I passed her, and on going up the second flight of stairs, through a crevice in the wainscot, I saw a hand; and said to Gleed, who stood at the door,</p>
               <p>"There is somebody within - I saw a woman's hand;" and then the door was opened. A saucepan was on the fire; I took the lid off - there was nothing in it - I took it off, examined the chimney, and found nothing; but I saw all the ashes had been taken off the back of the fire and from under the grate, and patted down. I took the poker and stirred the fire, and tinder fell out. I said,</p>
               <p>"Something has been burnt." Bennett said,</p>
               <p>"I have been burning a bit of rag." Easterby said, he would not open the door without a warrant; I said I should break it open - he then opened it.</p>

               <p>MRS. JARVIS. (Examining the property.) Here is a salt-cellar, which I know, but my husband can speak best to it; the lace I am sure is mine, and was on a cap when I lost it. I had washed and ironed all my caps the day before. The property in the basket is ours; here is the lining and ribbons of my bonnet; the lace and handkerchiefs are mine, and a muslin curtain, which I have the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180031"/>fellow to - and here is the fellow-piece of the ribbon - one curtain was left, they match; here is a handkerchief which was taken, and here is the fellow one left behind; the one stolen had not been washed, but the other has; here is an apron, but partly made. I have a piece of the same, which was left behind; here is a salt-cellar which I had chipped at the corner in washing; all the things are ours. (Examining the property found in Bennett's room at Mills's house.) Here is a small breakfast-cloth and two towels; the towel pawned with the gown is mine, and the pepper-box. I believe everything produced to be ours; it was in the house on the day of the robbery. This is but a very small part of the property stolen.</p>

I went into the front parlour, and missed a table-cloth. I found the parlour blinds open, the glass of the sash cut, and the sash open; the shutters were forced open, but put too again. I missed a desk and tea-caddy. I found the caddy, through an advertisement. Four or five phosphorus matches were left behind; three or four of them were burnt, and a piece of candle had been burnt almost to the socket.</p>

            . I have a tea caddy and a shoe. On Friday, the 9th of January, I went to King's room, and found this tea caddy concealed under the bed among other things; King was there, and said all the property in the place was his. I asked how he came by these things; he said a woman had brought them up there. I took Ryan's shoe off his foot; a chair was brought to the office which stood in the prosecutor's parlour, under the window; it appeared that the person on entering the window had stepped on the chair - the mark of a foot is on it now, and the shoe fits it; here is the chair; it is the print of a right shoe; his shoes are rights and lefts; the heel and waist of the shoe fit the mark.</p>

               <p>Prisoner KING. When you came into the room and asked if all the things belonged to me, I said Yes; not knowing that these were there; but when you found them, I said I could produce the woman who brought them up. I sent for the woman, and she came up and owned them. - Witness, The woman he lived with came up and said they belonged to her; and we took her to the office; the Magistrate discharged her; her name is Sharp.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prisoner himself say when they were first produced that they belonged to Sharp - A. No, my Lord, it was

               <p>Prisoner KING. When I said I could produce the owner, Sharp came up - you shewed them to her all separately, and she owned them all. - Witness, He never told me he could produce the owner. Blackwell said Sharp had brought them up there; Sharp came up and said she brought them there.</p>
               <p>JURY Q. Did you suppose these things to be stolen - A. We found so. I took the woman to the office with Blackwell - they were discharged. Sharp was sent to Clerkenwell Prison, and afterwards discharged.</p>

            . I am an officer, and accompanied Vann to Easterby's and to King's, where we found the tea-caddy, with other property. Blackwell said a girl named Sharp brought them there - Sharp came up in a few minutes, and owned them. Sharp was in custody some days. King said nothing about who brought the property there - it was Blackwell - and when Sharp came up I saw Blackwell pull her by the gown, but what it it meant I cannot say. King said he rented the room, and that all the property there was his, speaking generally.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you give this account when you were examined half an hour ago - A. Yes. I did not mention about the woman coming up and claiming the property - as the woman was discharged I did not think it necessary. I have been an officer nine years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know it to be most important, for the purpose of a conviction, to prove that man in possession of and claiming the property - A. I cannot say that I did. I would not say a wrong thing if I knew it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not think it materially in his favour that the property was claimed - A. If I have done wrong, I am sorry for it.</p>

I came out of the house about half-past five, and under an archway two men pushed me; I got by them, and ran down Bell-alley; Hepburn ran after me, and said something. The two men came after me; one took hold of my shoulder, and pulled me round, and said I was a thief - they pulled out a staff; the prisoner was not one of them. One of them took this property from me; I ran after him, and then the prisoner King stopped me, and asked what I was hallooing about; I was then about five yards from the spot where I was robbed. I told him two men had robbed me; he told me to stand still, and he would go after them - he then ran away. I ran after the men, but could not see them, so I ran back towards King, and then another man stopped me, and asked what was the matter - King had run away a hard as he could. I went to him about an hour after with the officer, and knew him to be the man who had stopped me; they took him into custody - he had taken nothing from me. The property has not been found.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the property was taken did King come to you - A. In about half a minute. I am sure of him.</p>

She was up in the room; Hepburn asked for Bill; she said she would fetch him - I did not mention what I had about me - it was buttoned in a bag inside my coat; they could see that I had a bag; the string was twisted round my arm; it belonged to Mr. Britton, a silversmith. Hepburn had taken me there once before - we were kept waiting for Bill about eight minutes, and then he came up. When I came out some men tried to hold me under the archway, by the side of the house. When we first went into the room, Blackwell asked me to come to the fire, and said she had been ill; she did not press us to stop. I went back after the robbery, and found King with her.</p>

I returned home at one, and at half-past two he came in. I asked him where my box was - he said at first that he had not seen it, but after asking him some time, his brother said,</p>
               <p>"If you get your box you won't hurt him" - I said,</p>
               <p>"I want my clothes and my box, and nothing more" - meaning that I would not punish him if I got them. The officer went to Moorfields, where the prisoner said he had taken it to, and found it there.

            . On Friday, the 30th of January, I understood that the prosecutor had lost his box. I met the prisoner coming in doors about two o'clock, and followed him up stairs; and on entering the second floor room, occupied by one Tyler, I accused the prisoner of having stolen this box. He said, how could I think of accusing him of it - he had seen no such thing. I asked him how he could look me in the face and say he had not taken it, when I had seen him, between eight and nine o'clock, take it out myself (this was not true), and I must send for an officer. He said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake don't do that - I will take you to where it is, if you will go with me." I sent the landlord for a constable, and in the mean time he cried a great deal, wished us to go with him, and kept asking for forgiveness. When the constable came he insisted on his telling where the box was, that he might fetch it; he said he had taken it to No. 25, Little Moorfields, to Mrs. Jones, and that it was exactly as he had taken it away, for he merely went straight there and back. We asked him about a watch which had hung in the room - he said he had sold that for 5 s. to a person in the street, and he believed, on Ludgate-hill, but not being acquainted with town he did not know the street; 3 s. was found on him, which, he said, was part of what he had sold the watch for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You told him an untruth - how are we to believe you now - A. I said so because I had been told he had taken it out.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 30th of January, I was fetched, and took the prisoner; he voluntarily told me that he had taken the box to Mrs. Jones, No. 25, Little Moorfields. I found 3 s. on him, which, he said, was part of what he received for the watch, which he had sold to a Jew for 5 s., in the street. I went to Mrs. Jones, and found the box - it contained all the property stated in the indictment, but the watch.</p>

It was secured by a latch, staple, hasp, and pin; it could be opened outside by taking out the pin. They were stolen one night, about the middle of August. I have not found them.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner seven or eight years - he lived at Stanmore, and is a rat-catcher. I went with him one night, just before harvest, about eleven o'clock, to Mr. Seabrook's - we lodged just opposite there. We took nineteen ducks from the house adjoining the dwelling-house - it was fastened with a latch and staple. We killed and put them into two bags, and carried them away - the bags belonged to the prisoner. We took them to Worrall's, at Edgware; he would not buy them with the feathers on; we carried them away and concealed them in a hedge, and left seventeen of them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180034"/>there till the next night, and took the other two home unpicked. Mrs. Clark dressed them for us - she picked them. We went at night, got the seventeen, and Worrall gave us 6 s. for them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you first tell this story - A. Three or four months afterwards, to Mr. Wadlington, the Magistrate. I was taken up for stealing a hare, and kept four days; was then taken to Clerkenwell prison for six weeks. I mentioned about the ducks four days after I was taken. I saw the prisoner at St. Alban's gaol; I was to have been a witness against him there, but the Grand Jury threw out the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember telling the prisoner, that as the evidence was not enough for him there, you would do for him in London - A. I never said such a word. Worrall lives about two miles from Seabrook's. We got to Stanmore-marsh about three o'clock.</p>

               <p>MR. WADLINGTON. He made this statement before twelve o'clock in the morning: and seemed to have his senses completely about him. I read it over to him, and he said</p>

My family consists of my wife, a servant-maid, and children; the eldest child is fifteen years old. I saw that the house was all fastened, and went to bed at half-past eleven o'clock; and was not alarmed in the night - the servant got up about eight. I got up myself and found every thing in the lower part of the house scattered about the floor, and in confusion; the drawers had been emptied, and the cupboards forced open. The thieves had entered by the back kitchen area; the iron grating in the yard, over which, was forcibly wrenched up; it had been bedded in the brick work over the back kitchen window. I missed the articles enumerated in this indictment, with many others, amounting in value to 30 l. or 35 l. at least. I saw a few trifling articles in the possession of Garton; ten or twelve days after, the adjoining house was empty, and in that some of the property was found; they must have come through there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you instruct counsel in this case - A. I have no solicitor. I have not employed counsel at the suggestions of Garton or Vanu. A gentleman suggested to me the propriety of employing counsel, as the Judge on the former case had much trouble to trace out the case, having no depositions. I was present when the Judge directed an acquittal, in consequence of Vann concealing a fact.*</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 9th of January I went to King's apartment, Bell-court, Bell-alley, Goswell-street; there was a woman in the room (not the female prisoner.) I asked how long he had lived there - he said, three months. I asked whether the place was furnished or unfurnished; he said it was furnished, and that all the property in that room belonged to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that, without your putting the question to him - A. No. When I got into the room I asked how long he had lived there - he said three months, and that it was furnished. I said,</p>
               <p>"Then are all the things in this room yours?" - Yes, said he; we then proceeded to search the room. Garton and Lines were with me.</p>


               <p>Q. Did King make any objection to your searching - A. None. We found two bundles under the bed. I asked him who they belonged to; the woman (Blackwell) said, that a woman of the name of Sharp had brought them there, and, in a few minutes Sharp came up into the room. Blackwell got her to the door whispering, Garton pulled them away, and made them come apart. I asked Sharp whether that property was hers - she said Yes, and acknowledged that she had brought them there. I asked her, in King's presence, how long she had had them - she said, a young man had given them to her. I asked her who the young man was - she then altered her story, and said, a young man had given her money to purchase them, and that she had bought them in Petticoat-lane. I brought the bundles, and took all three to Worship-street; and the evidence I have now given as to what Sharp said, I gave in my deposition to the Magistrate, but it was afterwards ordered to be erased out, and a fresh copy taken.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of your evidence was to be erased - A. That part where I asked Sharp if she brought the property there. Mr. Thomas claimed part of the property in the bundles. I apprehended Easterby next morning at his lodgings, Turk's Head-court; Bennett was with him, and on a table in the room, I found this fork; we were a good while before they would let us in. Garton came up and said, he saw a hand, and called out, that if they did not open the door he would break in. Easterby then opened it; he had said he would not let us in without a warrant.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You were examined this morning on your oath - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. It became material to enquire whose property certain goods found in King's room were - A. It did.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath, did you tell the Judge one word about the woman, saying the property belonged to another person, or about another person claiming it - A. No. I explained it. I did not shrink from it, when King put the question to me; I did not state it, because it was put out of the deposition.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath, did you mention it, till the verdict was recorded - A. It was on the next trial. Mr. Bevil ordered it to be erased. I did not think it necessary to state it. I did not conceal it wilfully.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you sworn to tell the whole truth - A. Yes. I would have brought the woman, if I had thought it necessary. I did not think it necessary, it being erased, or I would have stated it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the Jury state, that if they had heard it, they would have acquitted the prisoner - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean it to be taken down, that you stated that a woman in King's company said the property was not his, and that a person came and claimed it, and that the Magistrate ordered those facts to be erased from your deposition - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. How long have you been an officer - A. Eight or nine years, and have been upon the established five or six.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street, and accompanied Vann to King's lodging. Gleed was with us, but not in the room - we found King in the room, and a woman named Blackwell. Vann asked King if he lived there - he said Yes; he asked how long - he said about three months; he asked if the property in the room belonged to him - he said it was his. Vann asked if it was a furnished lodging - he said the things were his own. Some knives and forks, and several other articles were found between the sacking and the bed; some dishes and plates were found under the bedstead near the head of it; we brought away several articles; the knives and forks and some table-cloths were tied in an apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Did anybody come in while you were there - A. Yes, a girl of the name of Sharp. I omitted to say that Blackwell said Sharp brought the things there, and when Sharp came in, Vann asked her if she had brought them there - in the mean time I saw Blackwell give Sharp a nudge; she pulled her gown - I said,</p>
               <p>"Fall back, I will have no conversation between you," and had something to do to make her go back. Sharp said they were her property; Vann asked how long she had had them, and where she got them; she at first said (I think) nine months, and then six months, and that a friend gave them to her; she said afterwards that she bought them in Petticoat-lane, and a friend gave her the money to buy them - we took all three to the office. I went next day to Easterby's lodging, with the officers. I placed myself at the street door to let nobody go out; we at last got into the room, and found Easterby and Bennett. I took a saucepan off the fire to examine the chimney, and found nothing, but tinder came out of the bars when I poked the fire. Vann found a fork. Bennett said she had put a bit of rag in the grate. I was not present at the examination.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you state to the Magistrate all that you have now - A. Every word, all but about Sharp; I was not questioned about that, for I was not at the examination. Mr. Bevill said I must be bound over on account of the tinder being found in the fire. I was bound over after the prisoners were committed. I was not at the office when Sharp was there.</p>
               <p>Q. To day when King was on trial for his life or death, did you state a word respecting Sharp claiming the property - A. I did not. I was examined to day against King.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you suffer the Jury to return a verdict against him without stating it - A. I did; if I did wrong, I am sorry for it. I did not know that I had any occasion to do it, when I gave no evidence to that effect at the office. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180036"/>would sooner speak on a prisoner's behalf, than half a word against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you are not to state a word more than you say at the office - A. If I had been asked the question I would have stated it. The woman had one or two hearings, and was then discharged, and I thought it would have died away then.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought you would not state what was material for the prisoner - A. The Magistrate did not believe Sharp, or he would not have discharged her.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, as you did not mention it here to-day, and your brother officers also omitted to tell the Jury, l ask whether you agreed that it would not be convenient to mention it - A. No; it was pure accident; it was through the woman being discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was purposely omitted - A. I did not give it a thought.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street, and have some property claimed by Mrs. Thomas. On the morning of the 15th of January, I went to a house occupied by a person named Mills, in Little Arthur-street, St. Luke's, and in the first floor room of that house, I found Bennett - I afterwards took her up stairs, where there were a bed, three boxes, and a bonnet box; she took a bonnet off the bed, and put it on, and finished dressing herself there - I asked her who the boxes and property there belonged to; she said to a person who was coming there to lodge. I asked Mills in Bennett's presence, who the boxes belonged to; she said to Mrs. Bennett - I afterwards received the keys from Bennett; they unlocked each of the boxes, and the key of her former lodgings, where Easterby and her had lived, and in those boxes, I found among other articles, a pair of cotton stockings, two pounds and a half of candles, and a small quantity of tea; and on the way to her former lodging, where I had left Vann, I asked how she came possessed of a basket which was left there, and if the ribbons and lace among other things in it were hers; she said they were her own; that the basket was her own, and she had left it with her landlord on the Friday (this was on the 15th.) I went to her former lodging with the key she had given me, unlocked the door, and in that room, I found a pair of scissors, and some clothes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you any conversation with Vann before you went to Mr. Bevill - A. Not before he had been to Mr. Bevill. I have had conversation with him before he came here - he told me about Sharp; I heard him examined to day, and heard the Judge's observations; Vann stated to the Magistrate that Sharp came up, and claimed the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you not surprised when you heard him say nothing about it in Court - A. I thought he had forgotten it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not your surprise increased when you heard Garton omit it, did you think he had forgotten it - A. I did certainly believe both had forgotten it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not occur to you that if they had not forgotten it, the prisoners must be acquitted - A. Perhaps I did not know sufficient of law. I did not state it to them.</p>
               <p>Q. You suffered the Jury to go to their verdict without stating it to them - A. I think I should have done extremely wrong; to dictate to any witness when he was being examined.</p>
               <p>Q. When they retired from the box, did you say to Vann or Garton,</p>
               <p>"You have forgotten something which would save that man's life" - A. I did say something when I heard that the prisoner was convicted. I said to Vann</p>
               <p>"Something has been omitted, which should be communicated to the Judge;" and I think my words were these</p>
               <p>"Before the man should suffer, I will tell the Judge," but I did not think this the place to speak to the Judge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you or Vann examined on the second trial - A. I was not a witness on the second trial. I determined to communicate it, but did not think this the place to do it. I did not know the facts of the other case; it was only hear-say.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On Saturday, the 10th of January, I went with Vann, Garton, and Lines, to Easterby's lodging; they left me there while they went to another house; I stayed in the passage all the time; they returned in twenty minutes. One of us then knocked at the door, and mentioned his name; somebody said they would not open the door; at last we gave our names, and Easterby opened the door; he and Bennett were in the room. Garton poked the fire, and something appeared to have been burning - I took some of it in my hand; it appeared to have been recently burnt. I went into the lower room, and found a basket. Bennett escaped while I was down stairs. Some of the property in the house has been claimed by Mrs. Thomas.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The basket was not found in Easterby's room - A. No; it was produced to me in the absence of both the prisoners.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 9th of January I was on duty in Goswell-street; heard a boy had been robbed of some silver, and went into Bell-yard. Vann and Garton came down, and I followed them to King's house in Bell-court; there was a woman in the room - Vann had been talking to her before I got up - I only know what passed in the room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You forgot to mention that in the morning that Sharp said the things were hers - A. I was only examined about Easterby - I was not asked at all about King; I did not mention what Sharp said.</p>
               <p>Q. All four of you forgot to mention it - A. I only came about Easterby. I was not examined at the office, I heard what Sharp said, and did not mention it in the morning.</p>
               <p>MRS. THOMAS. My name is on some of the things found at King's, and the knives and forks are ours. The lace is mine, and here is a green ribbon of mine, some brown ribbon and muslin - they were in the house on the night before the robbery. The scissars found in Easterby's room are mine - (Looks at the property found in Bennett's boxes). I lost a piece of brown Holland like this, a pair of stockings, and some candles, but cannot swear to them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Is there any mark on the muslin - No; but I have a piece of the same - I speak to the pattern. The stockings are marked, and are my own mending. I have a piece of ribbon to match what was found. I had the whole piece made me a present of; I believe it is unsaleable. The fork found at Easterby's corresponds with mine - I have brought one to match it. The servant put the knives and forks into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180037"/>water, which made the rozin start; we lost two dozen. These knives were made for us by Mr. Morgan.</p>

I asked how much - she asked how much I had lost. I said it did not matter, how much had she found - she said she had found four sovereigns on my drawers in the bed-room. I asked if that was all she had found - she said it was. I said I would take her to the watch-house - she seemed irritated, and said, if I would not, she would go down into the kitchen and get them me. I sent for an officer, who went into the kitchen - came up, and asked her where the sovereigns were - she said she would go and get them; he went into the yard with her, and brought them.</p>

On the night of the 27th of January, he sent for me, and told me in the prisoner's presence that she had said she had found the sovereigns on his bed-room drawer. I said, she must have some key to get them. I was going to search her, but she said she had no pockets. I searched her box, but found nothing there. I asked her where the money was - she said down in the kitchen. I went down and found 17 s. 1 1/2 d. in her work-box. I came up and asked where the gold was - she said, if I would go with her she would shew me where it was concealed. I took a light; she went into the yard with me, and between the prosecutor's fence and my own, in the garden, over his dust-hole, I found four sovereigns wrapped up in a piece of rag - I took her to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am an officer. I received the prisoner in charge at the watch-house. Beeton charged her with robbing him of five sovereigns, and said he had no doubt but she had taken more. I made her no promises, but told her she was not bound to say anything. I questioned her; she said, the first she had taken was a sovereign from her master's drawer; that on the second time she took two, and the third time five. I asked her if her master did not keep his drawer locked - she said he did. I asked how she got possession of the money - she said she took the housekeeper's keys, which hung in the parlour. She mentioned a number of articles which she said she had bought with the money she had taken; and finding she mentioned having spent more than the amount she said she had taken, I said she must have taken more; she then admitted that she had taken a sovereign from a bag in the parlour, and had left 1 l. 12 s. at the butcher's for safety, when she went to the play. I find that her friends are very respectable.</p>

               <p>"Who is down there?" Nobody answered - I rapped at the door and sprung my rattle; and after knocking two or three times a gentleman came down, who lives in the house, looked out of the window, which was open, and asked what was the matter - I told him to let me in - the servant opened the door (not Chapman). I went in and searched the kitchen all over - then went into the yard at the back of the premises, found the privy door half open, and the prisoner standing up there; I collared him, brought him into the passage, and gave him in charge of another watchman - went to the door for further assistance - came in again - took him into the parlour,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180038"/>and gave him in charge of the patrol of St. James's, who searched him in my absence.</p>

               <p>"Come along, I want you" - that is all.</p>

She said the shift she had on was her mistresses, and gave me a book, which she said was her own, and seven duplicates. I asked her about a brooch and black satin spencer; she said voluntarily that she had pawned them at a shop at the other end of the town, and left the duplicate on the counter; she did not know where the shop was.</p>

I ran down with the awls, and called the watchman, who took him on the stairs; he dropped the muslin, cap, handkerchiefs, pinchers, and one of the awls, after I left him; I had put the cap, muslin, and handkerchiefs, into a bonnet box, just before; the street door was kept open.</p>

I agreed to meet him at his own house, at half-past nine o'clock; he said he lived in Crown-street, and I was to ask for Mrs. Jones - a woman in the street directed me to No. 14. I was in liquor.

On Sunday evening, the 11th of January, I went to chapel, leaving him and four of my youngest children in care of the house. I returned about eight o'clock, and found he had left contrary to my orders. I missed nothing that evening, but on the 22d, I found by an advertisement that some silk laid at the public office; I then looked at my winder's book and found the silk sent out had been returned, but on looking at my dyer's book, and again referring to my silk book, I found I was two bundles of 14 lbs. each deficient. I found it at the office, and can swear to it, because we skein ours very large, and very different to most manufacturers; I know it by the size of the skein, and the silk is more common them most that I manufacture. On the 18th, when I returned from chapel, Warren had absconded. I examined my silk drawer then, but it is so large I could not miss the silk without referring to the books - I have not got my books here; but I am positive that on the 9th, before I gave out work to the winders, there were two bundles of 14 lbs. in the trunk, knotted in the same manner; and on the 22d I missed them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLHHUS. Q. When did you see the advertisement - A. I was informed of it about a week before I ascertained my loss - the prisoner was with me then. I could not tell that I had lost any thing till I referred to the books. My servant, who keeps the book, is not here. I always stand by while he makes the entries, and call the work over to him. I know it by my manner of knotting the skein.</p>
               <p>Q. I might make a knot by accident exactly the same - A. Perhaps you might - there is a thread tied round eight skeins, which, my dyer says, is quite different from any that he does for other people.</p>

            . I am an officer, and was with Barrs. Perry said the bundle was a child; I felt it, and said it was silk or cotton; she said if she must tell the truth, it was dirty linen, which she had brought from home, but when we found what it was, she said she had found it in the street, opposite the church. It was wrapped in a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. At what time did you see her - A. About half-past six o'clock in the evening. We told her that we were officers. She was dismissed before the Magistrate.</p>

             re-examined. I have seen Warren with this handkerchief on his neck, and am positive of it - I have picked it up in my house, and given it to him. I live in Fort-street, Spitalfields.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You will positively swear that you have seen that very handkerchief on his neck - A. I have; I cannot say when. I know it by no mark, only by its rough twill, and these holes in it; it has a red border, and is very thin in the texture. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180040"/>have a bundle of the same silk, which the Jury can compare. I have eight or twelve work people.</p>
               <p>WARREN'S Defence. I have often found the door open of a night, and not long ago three men came in when it was open - I have found it open scores of times. People can prove they have had silk out of his warehouse unweighted. The books cannot prove his loss.</p>
               <p>PERRY'S Defence. I was going to set up with my mother at the hospital, and met my brother, who asked me to carry that bundle for him, and had no sooner got it than I was taken. I did not think them officers, or I should not of said what I did.</p>

On the 23d of December, in the morning, when I got up, upon unlocking the kitchen door, I found the window open, and all the linen, wet and dry, stolen; the window was shut the night before. The prisoner lodged in our back parlour, and had no business in the kitchen. I knocked at her door, and receiving no answer, put my hand to the lock, and found it open; she was gone - I did not see her again till the 14th or 15th of January, when she was in custody, at Mr. Creed's, Gray's lnn-lane - a great deal of my property was produced at Hatton-garden. The value of all that we lost is about 16 l.</p>
               <p>Q. If she broke at all, she must have broken out of the house, and not into it - A. The kitchen door was locked, and I had the key, and I found it locked - there were foot marks in the yard near the window, and the trace of a person going to and coming from the window. I was not the first person up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SHORT. Q. When you came down it was pretty light - A. It was just before eight o'clock - I saw her about eight o'clock the night before; she came into our parlour - she has not a key of the street door, but one of the lodgers has. I found the door shut when I came down, but not locked, as one of the lodgers go out at six o'clock. I know that the prisoner was at home at half-past ten.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. At what time did you go to bed - A. About eleven o'clock. The window appeared to be pushed up from the outside - it opens inward. No violence was used, either to the street door, or the kitchen door.</p>

            . On the 22d of January, about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw two men standing in the carriage-way in Fitzroy-square, wrapping something in a white cloth. I went up, and one ran away - it was quite dark; the other dared me with a shout - I tried to take hold of him, but he ran away, and threw the things over a wooden paling. I did not see what it was, but it rattled like plate, as I thought. I followed him, calling Stop thief! to the end of Carburton-street; he then came back. I waited till he came up to me - we made a blow at each other; I then followed him across the street, knocked him down, and nearly fell myself, and on recovering, saw him in the hands of the watchman. I left, and cannot say whether it was the prisoner.</p>

I said it was unusual to buy gold at that time of night - he said I might depend on its being the best gold, that a friend of his had just brought it from the East Indies - it weighed about 8 ozs., and I gave him 28 l. 15 s. for it. I offered him a cheque, which he said he could not take, for he had got to pay the money away that evening, and could take nothing but cash - he was dressed in a surtout coat, and I think a black cravat - he said he was in the trade, and was in the habit of having gold and silver, and, from his appearance I considered him a dealer. In consequence of his refusing a cheque, I drew one for 30 l., and got Tomlinson to get it changed in the neighbourhood, and find by my book that I gave him 28 l. 15 s. I have not put the weight down, for I found shortly afterwards that I was done, and have written the word</p>
               <p>"done" in the book. I found, in an hour or less, upon examining it closely, that it was silver gilt. I did not see him again till within the last two or three months. I called on Levi, of St. Mary-axe, in consequence of information. I went there with Mr. Kidder, of Hatton-garden, and took the chain and bracelets to him. I afterwards went to the prisoner's father, 
               <persName id="t18240218-75-person795">
                  Henry

             - the prisoner Isaac was present, but not Hymey. I stated to the father, that a chain and bracelets, which I had bought some time ago for gold, which turned out to be silver gilt, I had traced to the possession of his son Isaac. Isaac, the father, and others, who were present, declared they had neither seen nor heard anything about it. I said I was convinced, from the information I had, that it had been in his possession. Isaac then said, it had been in his possession, but he had not sold it - that he had offered it to Mr. Levi, and he knew that I had got my information from Levi, and that he offered it only as silver-gilt - they were very abusive, and said, I might go to Hell. Isaac said he had not sold it to me or to Levi, but had sold it in the Jews' Coffee-house, with upwards of 100 l. worth of other goods - he did not know to whom. Isaac constantly dealt with me, and was in and out of my shop, and must have seen the chain there before I went to him about it - I shewed it to him once.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were at the father's, was any doubt expressed about the chain being the same - A. No; but another brother said he was a d - d fool for owning it. I produce it - it is solid silver gilt; the weight of it deceived me - I believed it to be an Indian gold chain - it was as heavy as a hollow gold chain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. If it had been solid gold would it not have weighed considerably more - A. Yes; gold chains are frequently made hollow. I sent next morning to several shops, to know if it had been offered. I instituted this prosecution last Sessions. I saw Isaac at my shop several times after the chain was brought. I pay the expences of the prosecution, and employed Mr. Isaacs, the attorney - I never employed him before. I did not proceed till I saw Mr. Levi. It has always been my determination to do so if I could meet with the party.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. How long have you known Isaac - A. More than twelve years. I have only known Hymey two or three months. I have been to the father's house perhaps a dozen times before I bought the chain, but never saw Hymey till this transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see him, on your oath - A. I do not exactly know; he has come into my shop within the last two or three months. I am not concerned in a commission of bankruptcy against Hymey. Mr. Isaacs called on me (before I employed him). with one Cashmore, or Cashman; I asked his advice on the subject. They did not solicit me to prosecute; I thought, from what Cashmore said, that Mr. Isaac would know more about the party, and was induced to give him the instructions. I think I shewed the chain to the prisoner Isaac within a month after I bought it. He was a good deal among the shopkeepers, and I thought he might have seen it elsewhere. I do not swear to Hymey Abrahams, because I was much engaged at the time; he had a surtout coat on, with a black collar lined with red. Hymey brought an epergne to my shop very lately - I think it was before I saw Mr. Levi.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180042"/>COURT. Q. Did you know him again - A. No, my Lord; the epergne did not suit me, and I did not buy it. He and his brother brought me a bag of silver prior to that.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to stop him - A. I did not know him - it did not occur to me - I did not recollect him, as he was with his brother, who I did more business with than him. It was daylight, and the epergne was brought by daylight. He has several brothers.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. When Hymey came after this transaction, he came in company - A. Generally with his brothers; and my business being with the brothers, I did not notice him. My attention was called to him afterwards in consequence of what Levi said. Mr. Isaacs recommended me to send the chain round the trade, to see if any one had had it offered. I called on the father by his recommendation, and proposed that I should give him a fair opporunity to return the money, if he had sold it in ignorance - he said he had never seen it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is there in the appearance of Hymey to induce you to believe him to be the person - A. From his size, appearance, and countenance.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you know him better now than when he brought the silver - A. Because he has been two or three times since with his brothers. I broke one link of the chain - it is silver gilt. I have never assayed it.</p>

            . I am in the service of the prosecutors, and remember the person coming to sell the chain; the defendant Hymey is the person, I have not the least doubt of it. He brought the chain, threw it down on the counter, and said a friend had brought it from the East Indies, and it was made of ducat gold. Mr. Griffin was busy marking off a lot of plate which he had bought. His brother weighed the chain by his direction - it weighed between eight and nine ounces. Mr. Griffin had not enough money, and asked him to take a cheque; he said his friend was going into the country next morning, and wanted the cash. Mr.

             a cheque for 30 l., which I got changed, and Mr. Griffin paid him; and between ten and eleven o'clock that night, we found that it was not gold. I took it round the trade next day, to ascertain whether any shopkeepers had had it offered, in order to find out the parties who sold it. I did not see Hymey again till I saw him in Duke's-place, two or three months ago, I charged him with having sold it - he denied it, but would not give his name or address at first, but did afterwards. I never recollect seeing him in the shop, except when he offered the chain; the chain is silver gilt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How have you tried it - A. Mr. Griffin filed it. I swear that there is no gold in it. I was not at home when the epergne or silver were brought.</p>

            , that you charged Hymey with being the person - A. Yes. I knew where old Abrahams lived; but did not know that Hymey was his son; my master deals with his brothers. I was assisting Mr. Griffin in putting away the plate when he came; I think he had a dark olive coat, and a black stock on - my master never told me what coat he had on. I mentioned to my master today, that he had an olive coat on; I never mentioned it to him before that I recollect.</p>

            . I live in Bury-street, St. Mary-axe. In the early part of last year, the prisoner Isaac came to my shop, and produced a chain; it was the one produced (looking at it.) He proposed to sell it as gold, and asked 4 l. an ounce - I looked at it, and having some doubt about it, gave it to my brother to have it tried with a file - he called out,</p>
               <p>"Don't file it;</p>
               <p>"I said</p>
               <p>"The file will not hurt it, if it be gold;" he said,</p>
               <p>"No, don't file it, for if it is not gold, I can return it to the person from whom I had it." I said it was fit it should be filed, as if it should not be gold, it should not be further offered - he said he insisted on having it back in the state he brought it. I handed it over to him, saying I doubted its being gold; he went away with it. I saw him again two or three days after, and told him I understood the chain and bracelets were sold in the neighbourhood for gold, and 27 l. or 28 l. obtained for them - I had heard that from Mr. Griffin's man, who had called to enquire if such an article had been offered me, by a person pretending himself to be the mate of an Indiaman; the answer Isaac made was</p>
               <p>"I did not get half that money for it." I had promised the man I would make enquiry about it. Tomlinson called the following day, and I told him what had passed; I did not tell him it was

            . I live at Hatton-garden. I accompanied the prosecutor to Levi, and received information from him respecting the chain. I went to the prisoners' father's house, Bevis-marks, with Mr. Griffin; Isaac was present. Mr. Griffin stated to him that he had bought a chain of some person, who he did not know, but had traced the possession of it to him; that if it had been sold<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180043"/>to him without knowing that it was not gold, he gave him an opportunity of returning the money, which he should expect him to do - Isaac said he had had the chain in his possession some length of time, and I think he said he had bought it at Bath (the chain was produced - he did not question it being the same); he said he had offered it to several persons in the trade, among whom was Mr. Levi, for 6 s. an ounce; but that he eventually sold it among a quantity of goods, to the amount of upwards of 100 l., to a Foreigner (at the coffee-house), whom he did not know, but should know him if he saw him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Mr. Griffin was with you, and heard all this - A. Yes. The name of the coffee-house was not mentioned, I am certain. I know dealings are carried on at the Jews' coffee-house.</p>

            . On the 9th of January, I sent a quantity of goods in a basket from my house, in the Borough, by the van, to my shop at Brighton; they were worth 38 l., among the rest were eighteen pair of women's boots - on the following week I received information that one of my shopmen was in custody; and on the 17th, I went with the officer to the prisoner's lodgings, Cirencester-place, Fitzroy-square; the officer asked if she had any boots or shoes in her possession - she said not; we found a pair of boots in her drawer. She then said she had bought them in Cranbourn-alley. When we got to the office, I asked to see the boots she had on, and they were also mine - she then acknowledged receiving them from my shopman; these were not taken from the basket - but those found at her lodgings were.</p>

            . I apprehended the male prisoner at his master's - went with him to his lodgings, and in a tin box found the duplicates of the property produced. Before he knew what I came about, he told his master how sorry he was that he had taken the property from the window, but that it was through distress, and said he had employed his wife to pawn them. I found a quantity of duplicates for childrens' clothes which had been pledged before these things.</p>
               <p>MR. M'PHAEL. He had 24 s. a-week. I have since learnt that he has four children, and was in a most deplorable state.</p>

The prisoner Milford was in my service for three years; she gave me notice to quit on the 4th of November, to spend Christmas with her friends, and was to return to me again. I paid her her wages on the 4th of December; she took her boxes and left on that evening, and was to return into my service; she called next evening and had tea, and went off in the evening. A trunk, containing this property, was always kept in her room, locked. On the 16th of January it was unlocked in my presence, and four sheets, two pairs of pillowcases, three tablecloths, a white cotton night-gown, and a silk handkerchief, were missing. I apprehended her in the street, and found a silk handkerchief on her person which was taken from the trunk; nobody could get to it but her. A pair of shoes were found in her box, and one silk handkerchief was taken from another part of the house. I told her I wanted her on some business which I dare say she guessed; she said she knew nothing about it. The officer came up, and asked where she lodged? She said in Dock-street, and took us there. I found the shoes in her box; I asked if she knew anything of the property - she said she did not, but that

On Saturday, the 24th of January, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I was at home, and answered a ring at the bell. I found the prisoner Sutton there; he asked if that was Mr. Slack's; I said Yes, and he gave me this note (producing it). I took it up to my master, it was sealed up, and the instant I gave it to my master I heard the street-door open. I had shut the door, and left Sutton in the passage, as he requested an answer. I ran out instantly, found the door open, and missed a coat which hung in the hall, near the door, and he was gone. I ran out, and saw him running, with the coat on his arm; no one was with him. I pursued,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180046"/>calling Stop thief! some one ran from the corner, and called out Stop him! but he got away. The coat belonged to Mr.

               <p>Prisoner SUTTON. Q. You said at the office, you did not know which of us it was - A. No, I did not; when I was at the lock-up house the place was rather dark - I had not a good view of them, and I did point to Davies, and say I thought that was him, but I should know better when they came out.

I have three chests of drawers there - I looked, and missed nothing. I called the pot-boy, and the prisoner declared to him that he had nothing, and was going down stairs; I called out to two gentlemen who were in the bar; they stopped him.

            , one Gustavia Augusta, and two Calamus Nigers, from different places in the pits; the persons must have gone all round the pits to take them. I went to the front of the house, and saw footmarks; they could not have been taken out through the window. I informed Mr. Alton, who took me to Bow-street, and I accompanied Ruthven to Mr. Colvill's nursery, at Chelsea. I went first to the prisoner's house, and saw him; Ruthven stepped forward, and said,</p>
               <p>"I am Ruthven, of Bow-street, I want the box you received this morning from Kew-bridge" - he stood about two minutes, appeared struck, and said nothing. Ruthven then told him that he knew all the circumstances of the case, and it was of no use to hesitate, and there was only two ways for him, either to go to the watch-house, or deliver up the box; he said he would go and shew us the box - he took us to Mr. Colvill's house, adjoining the nursery ground. He (Sweet) asked for Colvill, and told him that we were come about the box that came that morning; before Colvill answered, Ruthven stepped forward, and told him his name; Colvill said to the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"You know nothing about the box, and I know nothing about the box" - Ruthven said it was of no use, for that Sweet had brought him there to receive the box, and he would search all the gardens over, but he would find it, and it was of no use to hesitate. I was sent to fetch a coach to take him to the watch-house, and brought one within twenty yards of Colvill's door - I found the garden door open when I returned, and no person there. I knocked at the house door; Colvill came running down the street opposite, and spoke to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go to a house in Colvill's garden - A. Yes; Ruthven and Mr. Sweet were there - the door was locked. Colvill found a key after some difficulty, and let us in. Ruthven then said to Sweet,</p>
               <p>"Now, where is the box?" He looked round the shed, and could not find it. Ruthven then asked where the plants were - the door of the plant-house was opened - we all entered, and went along the passage. Sweet took a plant down, and asked me if that was one - I said No - he then took another, and asked if that was one - I said No; I did not want that at present, but we had lost that plant some time ago. I suspected that it belonged to the gardens. Ruthven said,</p>
               <p>"Come and look here," where Sweet was looking - I did so, and immediately recognized two plants, the Gustavia Augusta, and a Calamus Niger. I said to Sweet,</p>
               <p>"I want a small plant of Banksia Grandis;" he went to an adjoining house, took it off a back shelf, and gave it to me. I knew them all well - all these three were under my care, on Wednesday, the 28th. I then said to Sweet,</p>
               <p>"I want an Eugenia, of the species Mallaccensis;" he said that was in another house - we went to that other house - it was with some difficulty the key was found by Mr. Colvill. Sweet picked the plant out from among other plants. I then said, there was a Jacquinia. Colvill said," We have different species of them." I described it as having<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180048"/>pointed leaves, and Sweet produced it. I then described another plant, with large leaves and glands on the foot-stalk, which I have no name for but Seerah Koah, the native name - it comes from the East Indies. Sweet took us to a house, and found it among other plants, after some difficulty. I said, there was another plant. Sweet said,</p>
               <p>"No: did you not get the two Calamus Nigers?" - I said, No; we had only got one - we went back to the first house, and found it in the same place as the other - I knew them all on seeing them - they were in larger pots than when they were at Kew - they are of great value, and are not to be found in this country, except at Kew. The Calamus Niger, Seerah Koah, and Banksia Grandis, have been previously taken from Kew, and there are now some of them. One

             was a gardener employed at Kew on the 28th; he absconded on Friday, the 30th, six days' wages were due, which he has not called for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. How long have you been employed at Kew - A. Two years. There are a great many work-people there at times.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not Mr. Aiton the privilege of buying - and does he not part with some of the plants at times, without consulting anybody - A. I do not know; he may allow cuttings to be given to growers - he has given plants away, but by what authority I do not know - he has ordered them to be packed up and sent away. We often receive plants at Kew without any letter intimating from whom they come.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not that the constant habit of botanists - A. Yes: we receive boxes which remain for a week before we open them to see what is in them, because we do not know where they come from. The prisoner was in Mr. Colvill's service - he has a most extensive nursery, part in King's-road, and another is called the Grosvenor nursery - we found the plants at the Grosvenor nursery. The prisoner lives five minutes walk from there. I told the prisoner that the box came from Brentford, or Kew-bridge, they were both mentioned. Ruthven said,</p>
               <p>"I have come for the box you received from Kew-bridge, or Brentford," I am not certain which. Colvill strongly denied knowing anything of the box, and then Sweet denied it. Handcuffs were then put on him, and I was sent for a coach.</p>
               <p>Q. You mentioned to the prisoner the plants you came in quest of, and he produced some to you of, the same description - A. He produced the plants I wanted - I saw none of the same species with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not claim two plants as stolen from Kew, and afterwards admit that you were in error - A. I said, there was one I suspected had been stolen from Kew, but in that I might be wrong. Sweet took it down and asked if it was one - I said,</p>
               <p>"No; we lost that a fortnight ago." I have said, that I may be mistaken in that one. The plants were not in the same pots, or the same mould, as when at Kew.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not every botanist prepare mould in his own way - A. Yes; when we receive plants we put them into our own mould, but we never open the boxes till we are ordered. The prisoner has published a great deal upon botany.</p>

            . I am principal officer of Bow-street. In consequence of information, I accompanied Mr. Smith to the prisoner's house, Old King's-road, Chelsea. On Thursday evening, the 29th of January, about ten o'clock, he came to the door - I told him who I was - and that I had come to him for a box brought to him that morning, from Brentford - he hesitated for some time. I told him not to deceive himself, for I knew all the circumstances, and that the man brought it to him, about ten, or between ten and eleven o'clock that morning - he hesitated and then said he had received a box. I asked if he would shew it to me - he hesitated, and I told him I must take him to Bow-street; he said he had the box, and would shew it me. I at that time had only asked for the box received from Brentford - he fetched his hat - and walked with me to Mr. Colvill's, which is about one-third of a mile off. As we went along, I told him the box contained plants - that there were five or seven in it - and asked if he had opened it - he said Yes; but he did not know how many it contained. When we came to Mr. Colvill's house, he rang the bell, and asked for Mr. Colvill, who came; he said I had come about the box; and before Colvill answered, I told him my name, and who I was - Colvill said to Sweet</p>
               <p>"You know nothing about the box. - I know nothing about the box" - I said that would not do, and turning round to Sweet, said</p>
               <p>"Are you inclined to say where the box is" - he said</p>
               <p>"No, I do not know" - I said that equivocation would not do for me - for he had brought me there to get it - I took him into the house - handcuffed him, and sent Smith for a coach to convey him away, as he would not tell me - and after some hesitation he said he would shew me - Mr. Colvill said to him again,</p>
               <p>"You know nothing about them, or where they came from - I know nothing about them; we have many things sent us, and we do not know where they come from" - I, Sweet, and Colvill, then left the parlour to go into the grounds - it was then nearly eleven o'clock - when we got outside the door, Colvill separated from us and went out of the grounds, fearing there was something wrong; I took Sweet without a light across the ground to the place where he was going to shew me - he took me to a place called the Sand-house - I asked him for the key; he could not find it - I endeavoured to lift the gate up; he said he could open it; which he did - and about that time Colvill came in a direction from his own house - calling</p>
               <p>"Sweet, Sweet, where are you;" he said</p>
               <p>"Here" - and immediately he came up, he took him by the arm, and said</p>
               <p>"I know nothing about the box - do you know what you are at?" I told Colvill that would not do, that he had brought me there to find the box, and if he did not produce the key, I should find something and break it open. Colvill fetched the key and a light afterwards; we opened the door, went into the sand-house, and there was two boxes; Smith said he did not think it was either of them; we then went into the plant-house - he walked down the paths - I asked him to shew the plants, as it would save a great deal of trouble - he pointed to one and asked if that was one. Smith who had joined us, when Colvill came up, said</p>
               <p>"No," he pointed to another - Smith said</p>
               <p>"That is not what we are looking for, that we lost about a fortnight ago." Sweet went to another end of the path, I asked him again to shew us the plants, as it would save a great deal of trouble; I asked him two or three times over; he made no answer; but seeing his eye directed to a place over the shelves, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180049"/>called to Smith, and said,</p>
               <p>"Take the light, and look there;" he looked, and picked out two pots. Smith asked for another pot; he took us to another house, and and in a corner, nearly at the top, Sweet reached the Banksia Grandis - he asked for another. Sweet took us across the ground to another house, in which was found two more; he asked for a sixth; we went to another house, and found that - Smith then said there was another plant. Sweet said</p>
               <p>"Did you get three;" and I said</p>
               <p>"No; only two." We went back to where we got the first two; and on the same spot found the third; we then went into the seed shop; and saw one Durdon; and Sweet asked him for the box that came to him that morning. Durdon pointed to a box; but we did not think that was it; he said there had been a second box which was sent away. Colvill, Sweet, and Durdon, agreed that this was the box (producing it). I said it was two small to contain them; but they said they came in smaller pots - I asked Sweet where the direction was, which was on the box, or if he knew where it was; he said No. I then began to search him - he then said</p>
               <p>"Perhaps I have got it in my pocket - and produced this from his pocket - (handing it in). Read,</p>
               <p>"Mr. R. Sweet, at Mr. Colvill's nursery, King's-road, Chelsea, to be delivered immediately." He had got one of his hands out of the handcuffs, as he has a small hand - I compared the nail holes in the direction with the box - but there were no nail holes in the box; the direction could not have been on that box. On Saturday morning, between King's-road and the office, I asked him if he knew Hogan, who worked at the King's gardens, at Kew - he said No; he did not recollect - I told him to be careful of his answers, for if he told me what was not true, and I proved to the contrary, it would act against him; and told him I believed there was but one Irishman worked in the Botanical garden - and I meant him, (Philip;) he said Yes; he believed he had seen him, but did not know him - I said if I proved that he had written to him and was acquainted with him, it would be against him; he said then that he did know him very well; and had talked to him at Mr. Colvill's garden, about plants; and that he knew other workmen at Kew gardens.</p>
               <p>Q. This happened on Saturday; had he been at large - A. On Friday night I went to the gardens again, and could not get to the office to appear against him, and he was discharged, and on Saturday I took him again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You found him still at his own house - A. Yes; there was a nursery where he resides. I do not know whether that is Colvills. There was nothing on the direction of the box to inform him that it came from Brentford; he said he had taken out the plants, but did not know whether there were five or seven.</p>

               <p>Q. Why not take the master in whose grounds you found them - A. I received information that he was concerned; and the box was directed to him - the master could not get away, and I could not take both - there was three of us, and the plants to go in the coach - Colvill was examined at Bow-street, and held to bail; bail was offered for the prisoner. After the two first plants were found, he pointed out the rest; the box produced had a cover to it, but I have not brought it. I left it at Mr. Aiton's, and do not know what has become of the cover. I am not aware that this is a prosecution from Bow-street. I have given no evidence on any bill against Colvill. I felt it my duty to ask the prisoner the questions I did - it was to ascertain who was the thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say to him</p>
               <p>"you won't do me to-day, though you got the better of me yesterday" - A. I said so to the master, who made a false representation to get him at liberty.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Has the cover of that box any mark or writing on it - A. None; I think it impossible that the plants could have been put into it.</p>

That thousands of plants had come directed to him (the prisoner) unaccompanied by any letter or message, and he has not known for months after who they came from, that they were sent in compliment to him, being a publisher, and that these came like many others, and were transplanted into Mr. Colvill's mould, that he would have produced the direction to the officer, but he said there was guilt in the transaction, and he did not wish to implicate his master.</p>

            . I have been clerk to Mr. Colvill for twenty years - the prisoner lived five years with him as cultivator - he is author of the Botanic Register. Plants have been frequently sent to Mr. Colvill, and we not know who they came from.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not the courtesy of the profession, when there is anything rare, to send it without any communication to another cultivator for improvement - A. Yes; when plants come, we move them into our composition mould - the prisoner lives at the other nursery - these plants were put in a public place - a number of people constantly come there.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you mean, that you often receive plants or cuttings - A. Plants, cuttings, and seeds; we transplant them the same day, if they are perishable; the prisoner was employed at the nursery daily.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you name any one instance in which valuable plants have been sent without an intimation from whom it came - A. I know that plants have been sent without any message or letter. We have received valuable plants, boxes, and seeds, without any message or letter; I do not know the value of these - they are reckoned valuable. We have received valuable plants from Sir

               <p>WACEY WHISKIN. I am a gardener in the employ of Mr. Colvill, and have been so about thirteen months. Sweet is managing man - I am under his direction. I have known boxes and packages to come directed to him without any letter - we constantly receive plants without knowing whom they come from. Sweet is the author of botanical works, and plants come to him for experiments - they are placed in the house according to their proper temperature; these were put into different hot-houses, near those of the same species. We have the Gustavia Augusta and Banksia - I think we have plants the same as all of them, but cannot say - I am only there for improvement - Mr. Colvill receives the money the plants are sold for.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. When was your attention called to them - A. I saw them in the course of the afternoon - they were not shewn to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you have plenty of the description of all those produced - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Point out the Jaquina - A. I do not know them in this state - I know these are plants of the same species, but do not know their names. I have heard them say, when unpacking them, that they did not know who they from.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. You are only on improvement - A. Yes. I saw the place these plants were moved from, and saw plants of the same species about them.</p>

            . I am curator at the Apothecaries' Company's garden at Chelsea, and understand botany. I have seen plants of the description of all these in this country except one, which, I think, is the Calamus Niger. I have some of all the others. Plants frequently come to me without advice from various views. My friends at times send me plants to puzzle me - the puzzle is to know who they come from. Mr. Sweet is considered the first practical botanist in Europe; and as his talent appeared, I courted his society, which is for the last seven years. I never knew an imputation on his character. I know that Colvill has plants of the description of both these.</p>
               <p>Q. Might a young man know from the look of these plants the species, without knowing their names - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You often receive plants sent to puzzle you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you then put them in a place for sale - A. We have no sale place; they are put into a hot-house for nursing - (Looking at the plants). - Here is a Zamia Spinalis - we are not tied to Kew names. The Banksia is not common, but it is in this country, and has been sold. I have looked over Colvill's collection, and will venture to swear he has Engenia and the Jacquinia; here is one without leaves, which I cannot speak to. Here are only two of them which I would take to Chelsea, which is the Calamas, and one which I do not know the name of. There is no price but as fancy leads - some of them I should think worth 10 s. 6 d., others 5 s. - the value depends on whether they can be propagated.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If plants were sent you. you would put them where they would thrive - A. Certainly.</p>

            . I am a bookseller, and live in Piccadilly. I have published several botanical works for the prisoner - he has two periodical works going on now. I do not know that he has spoken of Mr. Aiton in them. The Botanical Register is not his publication. I suppose, within the last five years, I have received fifty or sixty parcels for him - they have come containing what is considered rare plants, and sent to him to be figured for the Botanical Register - sent to him without his knowing who they came from - they come in such a state, that the engraver cannot draw them. Mr. Sweet brings them into a state for their beauty to appear.</p>

            . I live in Bainbridge-street. On the 14th of January, about ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came and asked me to change her a 10 l. note; she had it sewed up in her petticoat - she produced it, and it was a 20 l. note; I put down the number, which was 10, 572. I said I could not get change, and returned it to her, as I did not like to have it.</p>

            . I am Leonard's brother. On the 14th of January, the prisoner came and asked me to go with her to the Minories to get change for a 20 l. note, and said if I would go with her she would buy me some things, and if they asked any questions, I was to say I was her son, and that I had received the note as my own money. One Phillips was to go with us to pass as her sister, and my aunt. I had known the prisoner for years, and thought she had received the money from her husband, who is a seaman. I went with them to a sale shop in the Minories - she asked for some clothes, which were fitted to me. She took the note from her bosom, and told me to get change for it; I handed it to the shopman. She bought a pelisse for herself - the shopman went out, and returned in half an hour with the change, and handed the prisoner 15 l. 8 s. 6 d.; she put it into her bosom. I heard her say the day after that she took the money from a gentleman's shop in George-street.</p>

I waited till he got into the loft over the stable - then went up to the horse and found a ham hid under the manger, and when they returned into the stable, I asked Prigmore if there was not something under the stable which there should not be; the prisoner went to where the horse was, turned the straw and ham over altogether, and said there was nothing there. Bailey pulled the straw up, and found the ham. I asked him about it; he said he knew nothing about it.</p>

            , ESQ. On the 4th of February, I went to Drury-lane Theatre, with three friends, for a private box, and was directed to the Princes' side of the house, where I saw the prisoner; he said he had some disengaged up stairs, which I declined, as I wanted one below - he then said he could put me into the Duke of Gloster's box - I asked the expence; he said I might give him what I pleased. He wished me not to bring my party through the body of the house, but to go to the door in Vinegar-yard, which I did, and he was waiting to receive us, shewed us into the box, and I gave him two sovereigns and two shillings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did not you understand he was letting you into the Duke's box, as a favour, and you were to give him what you pleased - A. It did not strike me at the time. I said in order to get a lower box, that I would go to Covent Garden; he then said he would let me into the Duke's box - he did not say that if the Duke came we must turn out.</p>

            . I am box-keeper to Mr. R. W. Elliston, the proprietor of the Theatre. The prisoner was private box-keeper on the Princes' side - the Duke of York's box is under his care; his Highness has it on alternate weeks, not by the year; this was a week in which it belonged to his Highness, and was entirely at his disposal. Mr. Elliston had no liberty to let it. If the prisoner had brought me the money I could not have received it.</p>

            . I had the care of this shop for my father-in-law. I was present on Saturday night, the 18th of June, when the boy shut it up. I went there on Sunday morning, about twelve o'clock; and all was safe - and on Monday, at half-past eight, I found the private door, which is up a gateway, on the single lock - I had left it double locked. I found all this property gone - the shop was nearly stripped - I can swear to the tea tray; I saw it at the door on Saturday, and know it by a particular scratch across the throat of the figure on it. I know the candlesticks by a private mark on them; and here is a pair of snuffers which I can swear were in the shop on the Saturday night, and likewise a sugar bason which I saw at eleven o'clock at night. I believe all the things to be ours.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with a search warrant on the 12th of February; to Walker's house, Vincent-street, Old-street; and in the bottom room found a tea tray, sugar bason, tea pot, milk pot, snuffers, corkscrew, tea cannister, candle box, and other articles. Walker was asleep upstairs, with his wife, some were in a cupboard, and some at the top of the cupboard. Walker said all the property was his own, and said something about buying them some time ago; but I do not perfectly recollect what. I went to Heath's house, City-gardens, City-road, and found a carving knife and fork in a drawer, a snuffer tray in a cupboard, a pair of curling irons, cork-screw, and nut crackers, in his table drawer; they were not concealed. Heath said they were his own, and that he had bought them. I found three picklock keys in his table drawer. I took one Goodman, who was in the house; but he was discharged, as none of the property was found in his room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Have you told all the truth - A. I have; except that Vann came down stairs with a picklock key at Walker's - we went there to take the two prisoners. Heath, I believe, is a shoemaker - we brought away three hides of leather from his premises, presuming they would be owned - there had been a robbery of leather; he said</p>
               <p>"The things are mine, I bought them;" not speaking particularly to any one article; he spoke of all the things in the room. I do not recollect that he spoke to these particular articles.</p>
               <p>This witness was cross-examined at considerable length respecting his evidence upon the trial of Easterby and others, pages 174 - 177 - 180, and gave the same account of the case, as upon those trials; it is presumed unnecessary to restate it.</p>

               <p>"Mind, you have not found them on my person." I went to Heath's house, and found a footman, two saucepans, and fire irons; he said he bought them - we took one Goodman there, but he was discharged.</p>

I helped him to move on the 23d of January, and saw it then - it was one of the same size and pattern. I cannot swear that it is the one. When he moved his goods, dishes were put in it, which might scratch it. I have drank tea off it twenty or thirty times.</p>

On the 17th of January, I sent her on an errand; she stopped longer than I thought proper; I told her of it - she was saucy, and said I might turn her out. I suspected her, went up stairs, looked in her box, and found my petticoat. I laid it down again, and sent for Atkinson, the officer, who came and took her up stairs to her box, in which were found a miniature, and a variety of articles of mine. She said she hoped I would forgive her. The officer produced a key to me, which opens my sideboard and drawers.</p>

            . I am a headborough. I was fetched, and found the prisoner in the kitchen, and told her I wanted to go up to search her box. She wanted to go up stairs behind me, but I made her go before. I examined and found the property stated in the indictment. When the miniature painting was found, she said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, pardon me, mistress, pardon me!" She wished to put her hands into her pocket, which I would not allow. I found a key there, which Mrs. Smith said had been taken off her bunch of keys; she said at the watch-house, that she had put some of the things into her box, but not all; that she found the key the day before, and forgot to give it to her mistress.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what hour were you called in - A. Between ten and eleven o'clock. I live two or three hundred yards off. Mrs. Smith was agitated when the miniature was found. The box was open, and one or two things seemed to have been lifted up at the top, every thing else was laid with exactness. As soon as I went up, she said some person had been to her box, and had put the petticoat in, but said nothing about the other things being put there. She said the sash was her father's. The epaulet was pinned up in an old stocking, nearly at the bottom of the box. No conversation passed in the room - what she said at the watch-house was voluntary.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 2d of February, I went to Pimlico wharf, and saw the prisoners and another man standing at the corner of a recess, at the top of the wharf; they moved round, saw me, and all three walked off. I ran as fast as I could, and saw two cart wheels there - they had stood close by them - it would take at least two men to put them there. They crossed a ditch into the Vauxhall-road - I jumped over the ditch; Brown turned, and seeing me, immediately ran away - I followed and took him; and in bringing him back met Peel, secured him, and took both to the wharf. Peel said the wheels were his own, and Brown said he assisted him in bringing them there. I took them to the office. Peel said he had bought cart and all at Smithfield for 19 l. Rubergall saw and claimed them.</p>
               <p>PEEL's Defence. I was alone at Kensington, and saw two wheels - enquired round the neighbourhood if any one had lost them, and met Brown; asked him where I could sell them, and he took me to this man.</p>
               <p>BROWN's Defence. I met Peel by accident - he asked if I knew who would buy the wheels. I took him to a man, whom I had sold a cart to two years.</p>

               <p>"It is too soon to go to the gentleman yet, stop till six or seven o'clock, and I will go with you;" and about six o'clock the prisoner came to my aunt's, and said, he would go with me to the gentleman in Lincoln's-inn-fields, about the place; as we went along, he said, he understood I had had a good deal of trouble, and had lost my father and mother - I said I had; he said,</p>
               <p>"You are quite sure of this place, and will have very little to do, and when you get there, don't get me into any disgrace" - he said he knew the gentleman well - he took me up to some chambers on the second floor in Lincoln's-inn-fields, and then said,</p>
               <p>"Young man, stop down here, and I will go and speak to the gentleman, and when I come down I will call you up" - he went up higher, and called me up, and said, the gentleman was at home, and I could see him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Young lad, I will go down stairs, and get you a groom's coat, I know where to put my hands on one in a moment, and it will look better to see the gentleman in a groom's coat - pull off your own, and I will go and get you a groom's;" he helped me off with it, and said he would get me a groom's coat - he went down with it. I never saw him afterwards, and have not recovered it. I waited there half an hour, and then spoke to a woman, who said, I was taken in.</p>

I met the prisoner at the Plasterers' Arms - he asked if I knew anybody who wanted a place; I said I wanted one myself; I had seen him there several times before - he said it was a groom's place, but not exactly that, for the gentleman kept his horse at livery, and it was to ride about with him all day, at 14 l. a-year, and two suits of livery, but I was too heavy for him; a young man said, there was a young man next door, who had come from the country. I thought he would suit, and went to tell the prosecutor's aunt, whom I knew. I saw nothing more of the prisoner till I met him, and secured him.</p>

On the 21st of January I met the man in Tothill-street, about five o'clock in the afternoon, and treated him with a pint of beer, and some gin, and then went to the Feathers, public-house, Broad-way; his wife came in, and we had a pot of beer - he borrowed one shilling<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180056"/>and sixpence of me; I pulled my purse out of my left hand inside pocket. I had eight half-crowns there - I laid all the money on the table - put it into my pocket again, and treated them with two pots of beer; we came out, and went into the George and Ball public-house, St. Ann's-lane. I treated them there with three pints of beer; the woman said,</p>

               <p>"Mr. English, you are wet and cold, come to our lodgings, and warm yourself, it is only three doors off;" they took me to <placeName id="t18240218-104-crimeloc590">Pye-street</placeName>

I had some soup there, and sent for some beer - the man wanted her to stop with me while he fetched it, but I said she was the most fit to go, and she did, and after that I wanted her to go for more, but heard him whisper to her,</p>
               <p>"Don't go for any more, I will knock him down, and take his purse" - I then got up, and said</p>
               <p>"Good night, I will have no more here, but will give you anything down stairs;" he got between me and the door, and she came and laid hold of me, while he took my purse out. I said,</p>
               <p>"Bartlett, you have robbed me" - he said if I said a word he would knock my eye out - she ran towards the fire-place, and he ran down stairs. I followed him into the One Tun, public-house, and said he had robbed me - he said he would split my skull - a parcel of girls came round, and began laughing. I went to the office, could find no officer, but next morning got one, who took the woman, and on the following night I saw the man, drunk, and fetched Pace, who took him - a man came and gave me 10 s. not to prosecute. I shewed it to the Justice, but he committed them - I had drank no liquor but two glasses of beer - I did not halloo out in their room, as it was of no use. The landlord was in the bar of the One Tun, but it was of no use to say any thing there. I told two or three watchmen that night, but they said they would have nothing to do with it.</p>

On the morning of the 22d, the prosecutor informed me he had been robbed in Old Pye-street, and took me to the first floor of No. 20; I found the female prisoner there - she denied the charge. I took her to the watch-house, and about six o'clock in the evening the prosecutor came, and said the man was at the Feathers, public-house - I ran there, and found him quite intoxicated. I asked if his name was Bartlett - he said not; the prosecutor said he was the man, and I took him.</p>

I said I was a poor widow, and had no money - I stood at the door to hinder him from coming in, and said I would not have them - he sold them and went for another half bushel. Bruce said he insisted on it that I should have them; he pushed me in doors - they said Mrs. Temple had had two sacks. I then said I would have half a bushel - they both came into the room with them; and while I was getting the money from the cupboard, I suppose they snatched a bundle, containing this linen, off my bureau bedstead; I had put it there just before - one staid for the money, and the other went out - and their cart drove off in great haste. I took up a candle and found they had not left me a quarter of a peck of coals, and missed the bundle - I ran after the cart, but they got out of sight, and I have not found my property. I am sure they are the persons.</p>

            . I am an officer. I stopped the prisoner between five and six o'clock, in Bedford-street, Strand, with this cloth in his apron. He said they were cuttings, which he had saved up, and afterwards, that he had bought them of somebody, but he could not tell who. I went to different shops, and the prosecutrix claimed them, and described one particular piece.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. In what state were they - A. Tied up with list round them - he had them in a leather apron. He said he gave 5 s. for them. I know that he worked a little as a tailor.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. On the 10th of September, the prisoner came, and said he wanted a pair of shoes for a customer - I knew him before. He looked at several pairs, and at last said,</p>
               <p>"These will do; what is the price?" I said, seven shillings. He asked for a pair of laces, and while I turned my back to get them, he snatched the shoes off the counter, ran out, and closed the door after him. I did not know where to find him. I had not seen him for three years before - he did not pay for them.</p>
               <p>JOHN WILLIAMS, JUN. I was in the shop when the prisoner asked for the shoes, and while my mother was getting a pair of laces, I saw him take them off the counter and run away; I called for the apprentice, who ran after him, but he got off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to the mercy of the Court.</p>

On the 15th of January, Bridges came and asked if I had lost any thing, I looked round my shop, and missed a candlestick from about five yards from the door - it was safe five minutes before; he desired me to follow him, and we overtook Watson in Long-alley, looking into a chandler's-shop. I saw Bridges take the candlestick and book from him, and in the chandler's-shop we found Smith.</p>

            . I am a headborough. On the evening of the 15th of January, I followed the prisoners down Windmill-street to Providence-row, and saw the prisoner Smith go into Mr. Freeman's shop, and come out directly - Watson was waiting about five yards off, pretending to be about a certain purpose - I looked them both in the face, then ran into Freeman's shop - we crossed Finsbury-market. I saw Watson looking in at the chandler's-shop with the candlestick in his hand, and the book under his arm. I pushed him into the shop, and took Smith - he said he knew nothing of Smith.</p>

He said he must go to his old shop, in Piccadilly, and get a pair for 6 s. I saw him take a pair of boots, and conceal them under his coat, and as he went out, I asked what he had under his coat - he said nothing. I collared him, and took one boot from under his coat. He ran away; I followed, calling Stop thief! he was stopped, and a man produced the other boot.</p>

She described a ribbon to me - I fetched another drawer and shewed her; she said she wanted one with a flower. Mr. Cross came and asked me a question, and as I turned my head, I saw her put something under her child's clothes - her child was on the counter. I said I had not got what she wanted - she immediately left the shop. I missed a piece of ribbon from the drawer, followed her into the street, and told her she had taken a piece of ribbon - she said not. I said it was useless to deny it. She was then taking a piece from under her apron - I took it out of her hand, and have it here. It was in the drawer when I shewed it to her.</p>

The child dropped it on the step of the door, and before I could turn to take it back, the gentleman came.</p>

I took hold of Wall; he asked what I wanted - I said nothing but the meat he had taken; he then dropped something, and ran away, and I after him. I overtook him - he knocked me down and ran off again; I still followed, and caught him in Stepney-causeway. Marshall came up, and he was secured - and said he had not seen any bacon; I did not name what meat it was.</p>
               <p>GEORGE MARSHALL. I am a shoemaker, and live at Ratcliff. I saw five boys lurking about Atkins's window - the sash was partly up; they walked by three times, and the third time I saw Wall take the bacon, and put it under his left arm; French was behind him; I went into the shop, and North went with me. They went down Vine-tavern. French was taken.</p>

               <p>JAMES FRAKES. I am a shoemaker, and live in Baldwin's-gardens. On the 21st of January, about seven o'clock in the morning, I was in my room, which looks into Tollinton's yard, and heard glass breaking; I looked out, and saw the prisoner dragging the ladder under a door, into part of the yard, which is divided off for the lodgers. I went out, and he asked me to help him carry it to Leather-lane, which I did; we put it down by the side of the White Horse, public-house, and went to the prosecutors to enquire if it was all right.</p>

The ring she pawned was wrapped in an old piece of printed paper; she returned me one wrapped in similar paper, but immediately she was gone, I found she had given me a metal ring instead of the gold one.

            . I live in Closeall-court, Barbican. In August last, I got my husband's watch out of pawn, and met the prisoners in White-cross-street - they had lodged with us - they asked me to go and drink, I said I was in a hurry, for I had been redeeming my husband's watch; they pressed me, and I went to a public-house, and had two glasses of rum and water, and called for a third. I paid 1 s. for it, and said, when the last glass was drank I should go - Mrs. Rowley said, it was a long time since we had met, and I need not hurry - another glass, and a fifth was called for. I was getting very sleepy, as I had been up all night - another glass was brought. I said,</p>
               <p>"This is too much, we don't want it." I had not got much money, and gave my husband's watch to the landlord to take, instead of money, and said, I would call in the morning for it, but Rowley would not let me - he paid for it - I laid my head down, and fell asleep - Mrs. Rowley awoke me, saying, the house was going to be shut up - they both came home with me, and sat for an hour, and, when I undressed, I missed the watch, and found my purse in my pocket, but empty. I had 29 s. 6 d. in it - my husband's name is on the watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you not been to some other public-houses before you went to this - A. No; I was quite sober when I went in - I was not over and above drunk; I was very heavy and sleepy I did not offer the landlord the watch to pawn.</p>
               <p>Q. Why offer it, when you had so much money - A. I did not want to own to my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the landlord send his servant to see you part of the way home - A. No; I drank my share of four glasses, but none of the fifth.</p>
               <p>Q. When you met the prisoners, did they not take you out of a mob, and bring you into this house, to save your life - A. No; I was in no row. I did not give Mrs. Rowley the watch to pawn.</p>

I stopped the prisoner on this night with Smith - the prisoner had the paper tied in a blue apron, he said a man gave it to him at the corner of a court in Golden-lane, to take to Mr. Carrier - that he did not know the man, or what he was to have for carrying it. I took him to Mr. Carrier, who did not expect it.</p>

            . I am errand-boy to Mr. Chandler. On the 19th of February the prisoner came into the shop with another boy, and asked for low priced shoes. I shewed them some, which would not suit - they then asked for laced boots; he said he would go for the money, and come in half an hour; the prisoner asked if I had any to fit him - I shewed him some; they both left together, saying, they would go for the money. I saw the prisoner take a pair of women's shoes off the rail, and put them under his coat - I went out, took hold of him, and took them from him - the other ran away.</p>
