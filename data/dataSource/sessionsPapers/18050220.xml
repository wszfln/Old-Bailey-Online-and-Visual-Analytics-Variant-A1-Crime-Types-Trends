               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at home at the time? - A. No, his wife was; we found the pork in a tub; he had pickled it; it was in his bed-chamber on the first floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner himself? - A. I saw him throwing up some dung at Totteridge; I told him I found some pork at his house that was my master's property; he replied that if I was to come to his house at Christmas, I should find as much beef; I told him he must go with me to the Magistrate; he readily consented, and went with me; he denied it before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner? - A. He is a <rs id="t18050220-2-deflabel10" type="occupation">carter</rs>

               <p>Q. What quantity of pork might there be in his house? - A. I cannot justly say; I think I missed about sixty pounds; we found six joints in his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him about your master's house about the 1st, 2d, or 3d of January? - A. No.</p>

            , coming to your stables in February last? - A. Yes; I cannot justly say the day; I shewed Mr. Drake the horse. I took the horse in myself of the prisoner at the bar on the 1st of February; he brought the horse to our stables between the hours of twelve and four in the afternoon; I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state was the horse when he came in - did he come in with a saddle? - A. No, no saddle, only a bridle, a roller, and a cloth; he asked me if there was any chance of selling his horse there, or whether we wanted to buy a horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say his horse, or this horse? - A. I cannot justly say; we asked him if it was his horse; he said it was; we said he might leave it there a day or two, we would try it; this was on Friday; he came there again on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, to walk him about, and brush him over.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any account how he came by the horse? - A. Yes, he did say where he bought it, but I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he fix any price on it? - A. Twenty-five guineas; the prisoner was apprehended on Monday, when he was riding the horse on the ride.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner brought the horse in, had he the appearance of being hard ridden? - A. No; he came to our stables from a livery-stable in Moorfields, I think he said Pope's stables; he did tell me, but I do not justly recollect; I think I understood him that he had stood there from the Monday before; the cloth and roller came from their stables, he said, and he took the cloth and roller from our stable.</p>

               <p>Q. You had not seen Mr. Drake at that time? - A. No, it was about three days before I saw Mr. Drake; it was a friend of Mr. Drake's that took me there; I went with Mr. Drake to the Eclipse livery-stables; when I apprehended the prisoner, I had the bill in my hand; I looked at the horse, and it answered to the description in the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went with Mr. Drake to the livery-stables, was that the same horse you shewed him there, that you apprehended him on? - A. The same horse.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200006"/>Q. When you apprehended the prisoner, what did you say to him? - A. I desired the prisoner to bring the horse into the stable, I asked him whose horse it was; he said, the horse was his own; I asked him where he got the horse; he said, he bought it of one Mr. Baker, in Gloucestershire, a farmer, I am sure that was what he said; I told him it was a stolen horse, and that he was a prisoner of mine, he must go to the Magistrate, and satisfy him about Mr. Baker; I took him into custody, and brought him before Mr. Conant; Mr. Conant asked him how he came by the horse; he told him he bought the horse on the road this side Hammersmith, but he did not know where to find the man; the prisoner is a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Drake.) Did you go first to the Eclipse livery-stables without the officer, or in his company? - A. I went first without the officer; I am confident that is the horse I had lost, I had the horse two years and a half.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was walking through Hammersmith, and coming back I met this man, he said his name was Baker, and he was a Gloucestershire man, he was on this horse; he says to me, groom, will you buy a horse? I said, if it is worth the money; he asked twenty-five pounds for it; I bid him sixteen pounds for him, afterwards I bought him at eighteen pounds, the horse, bridle, and saddle; I rode him to London, and put him up at Mr. Hobson's stables, I do not know the name of the street, it is in Moorfields; I put him up at livery there; I bought him as he was, he had got two splints and a very bad sand-crack, which I did not see till afterwards; I asked Mr. Hobson to sell him for me; they examined him, and said he was lame, they had no chance to sell it, they having many horses of their own to sell; my landlord knows that I had such a quantity of money, I took twenty-four pounds when I left my last service, and ten pounds I lent to a shoe-maker; I have been in the habit of buying beasts, I have had three hundred pounds stock; I produce a letter - (a witness produced another.)</p>

On the 30th of January, about twenty-five minutes past eleven at night, I saw the prisoner at the bar come out of No. 6, Lisle-street, by himself, he had nothing with him, he went to a house that was repairing, there is a fence before the house, he went up to one corner of it; as soon as I saw him in the corner, I crossed the way to him, his back was towards me; I asked him what business he had there; he made no reply; I asked him again; he told me he was looking for a glass-cutter, or glass-grinder; I asked him how he came to come out of that house; he answered still he was looking for a glass-cutter, or glass-grinder; I took him back to the door of No. 6, I asked him how the door came open, and how he came to be in that house; I told him when I called the hour of eleven o'clock, it was fast; at eleven o'clock I put my hand against the door, it was fast; then still he insisted he was looking for a glass-cutter, and when he was got within six or nine inches of the door, he put his finger to the key-hole of the door, and pulled too the door; the door fastened with a spring-lock; I then was going to take him to the watch-house, and when he had got to the middle of the front of the fence, he made a start, and got from me before I could get any assistance; I halloaed out, and he was stopped by a person coming along; I then secured him, and took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it is the same man? - A. It is the same man, he was never out of my sight; he was searched at the watch-house, and nothing was found upon him; when we came back from the watch-house, we searched the parlour windows outside of the house; we found the two parlour shutters were forced open, and one of the staples broke; the bolt was hanging down, but the sash was fastened by the catch; the next morning I fetched

             sworn. - About half past eleven o'clock, on the 30th of January, the prisoner was brought to the watch-house by these watchmen; I searched him, and found nothing on him; the next morning I took him before the Magistrate, and by his order I went to the house to find out, if possible, by what means he got into the house; we found the parlour shutters wrenched, but the sash fastened down, and we found the kitchen shutters open, and the sash of the kitchen windows open; but I am of opinion it was impossible for him to get in that way, because the kitchen-door was bolted outside of the door, and there was no way, by my examination, which any body could get in but by the door; there was a chest of drawers in the back parlour, and all the drawers forced open but one; I am certain they were forced open, because I found part of the beading on the floor; Mrs. Jones was with me at the time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was at work with my father on Wednesday, the 30th of January, and about half after four o'clock in the afternoon there was a man came and told my father, if he would send his son down to his house, he would give him some work; I went out to go there, I met some young men, and I staid out and drank with these young men; this watchman laid hold of another man, and whether he gave him something I do not know; he let him go, and took hold of me.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Jones.) No part of what you lost has ever been found? - A. No part whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left the house the day before, in what state was the chest of drawers? - A. Every thing safe; it was full of clean linen, sheeting, counterpanes, and blankets.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 21st of January, was the prisoner Hilsley in Mr. Brickwood's service? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that day, in the afternoon, did you go up into the floor, No. 2.? - A. Yes, about four in the afternoon; and I observed the heap of malt, and a strange man with the prisoner, in the floor No. 2, they were standing by a sack of malt, one on one side, and one on the other, by the malt heap; there were two sacks lying down, and one standing up, the sack that was standing up was turned inside out; all the sacks were close to the malt heap, the two sacks lying down had Mr. Brickwood's mark on them.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. You could not read what was marked on the third sack? - A. I could only see there was a mark.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you make any particular observations on this sack of its contents? - A. There were red letter marks on it, and there was a little bit of a hole just by the top of the sack, I put my finger in this third sack, in the hole, and found it was malt; I did not say any thing to Hilsley then, nor the stranger, I left them there, and came away; about ten minutes afterwards Hilsley was coming out of No. 2, and going down stairs; I spoke to him then, and asked him what he was about; to the best of my recollection, he said, that he had been shutting a door in at the top; I then went up to No. 2, and the strange man was standing by the sack of malt, I staid there about five or six minutes, and then I came away, the strange man continued there; I only came down to No. 1, the floor below, where I staid ten or twelve minutes, and then went up to No. 2, again, and the strange man went to the floor No. 1, I saw him come below, and when I went up to No. 2, again, I saw

            , he went up before me to No. 2, and when I went up the third time, Hilsley took one of the sacks in his hands and set it up an end; I came down and left him there, and stopped below perhaps ten minutes or longer, between the wharf-gate and the mill; Hilsley came down, to the best of my recollection, and stood by the strange man, I was never out of sight of the warehouse, nor from under the roof all the time; I said to the stranger, I think you have the appearance of a soldier; Hilsley said, yes; I told Hilsley, and I spoke to a man that we had, that I was going to my quarters; I live in Old Fish-street-hill, I went away almost immediately, and left them both there in the wharf, this was near five o'clock; I had dropped a pocket-book, which I observed as soon as I came home, and returned immediately; I had not been gone from the wharf above ten minutes, at the farthest, and when I came within six or seven yards of my master's gate, in Broken-wharf, I saw Hilsley scrapling a sack on his shoulder, just as though he was taking it out of my master's little gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he outside of the gate before you saw him? - A. Yes, just got there; it appeared to my eye that he had just come through the wicket, by his scrapling it up; there are two glass lamps just by the gateway; I could see to pick up a pin; he got it on his shoulder and met me, and I met him in the yard, with the sack on his shoulder; the two lamps reflect a very bright light, within five yards of my master's gateway; I saw his face, his stockings and shoes, and likewise the sack of malt that was on his shoulder; I am sure it was Hilsley, I spoke to him but he would not speak to me; I felt the sack with my hand, and felt it to be malt; the sack appeared to have no mark on it; I stopped at the gate, and found somebody was fastening the wicket.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Could you by the light of the lamps form any judgment whether the sack was turned inside out? - A. It appeared to be wrong side out, by the light of the lamps.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Was it the usual hour to shut the gates? - A. No, just as the carts come in; sometimes eight or nine o'clock; they are usually put to before they are finally fastened; I followed the prisoner by the light of the lamps; he went up Broken-wharf, and went into No. 57, Upper Thames-street, a <rs id="t18050220-11-viclabel61" type="occupation">green-grocer's shop, kept by Lawless</rs>, as a person told me; he went into No. 57, the door was then standing open, he went into the passage and pitched the sack down, I am sure it was Hilsley that went in with the sack, he went into a little room, the glass door of which faced the street door; a man came with a light.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you at all see that man's face so as to know him? - A. I could not; Hilsley staid in the house about ten minutes, and I stood at the street door; I saw Hilsley in the room, and when he came out I stepped back, and then I came up to him, and said, Richard, is that you; he replied, yes; I then went immediately to Mr. Brickwood's warehouse, No. 2, and there I saw that the sack that was standing up first, and had been turned inside out, was missing, and only the two other sacks were there; there was no malt at that time at No. 1, only oats.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you inform the clerk of any suspicion that you had? - A. Not till the next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What time was it on the next day that you told any body about it? - A. Perhaps twelve o'clock to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200011"/>Q. You were upon extremely good terms with Hilsley? - A. I had nothing against him, I had a few light words, but not to bear him any malice; I never had any quarrel with him, only a few sharp words, such as when men are at work they catch up one thing and the other another thing, and one finds fault with the other.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived with your master? - A. About a fortnight before last Michaelmas; Hilsley was on the wharf when I came there.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master is a lighterman? - A. He is a corn and coal factor.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not a variety of people's sacks in your master's warehouse, and so you borrow one of another in the course of your trade? - A. Never, none but the London company's sacks; they are sacks that come with flour.</p>
               <p>Q. These are not the only persons that your master deals with? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore there are other sacks that find their way into your master's warehouses? - A. It might be so.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, whenever you have taken out the malt from a sack, you turn it inside out if it belongs to another person; have you never seen that done before in your life? - A. I never saw it done there; I have seen flour sacks turned inside out, and then turned back again.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you saw the prisoner pitch it on his shoulder, that was the very time that the person, whoever it was, was going through the wicket? - A. It was just by the wicket, he had just got through the wicket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any lamp there? - A. There was a light there.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, if any person was there he must see the person go through the wicket? - A. I cannot say, I did not see the other person.</p>
               <p>Q. But if there was any person they might have seen him for what you know; you have said, the moment that person went through the wicket, the gate was shut? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said that you stood at the door of the house, No. 57, and you looked through the passage to the glass door? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a lamp at the street door? - A. No, there might be a lamp-iron at the door, that I cannot say; there was a light in the room, and the glass door opened immediately as he went into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. When he went into the room where there was a light, did the door shut immediately as he went into the room? - A. Not immediately; I believe it was a minute or two after Hilsley went into the room with the sack before he shut the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure that he left the door open to give an opportunity of looking at him, whoever it was; and that he shut the door after he had let you see every thing he had done? - A. He pitched the sack, and then the door was shut.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you to say, in your original examination, that a man came with a light? - A. Yes, he had a candle.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell us whether you know the face of that person again? - A. I saw the face of that person, but I cannot tell him again.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell us how that man was drest? - A. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hilsley return to work again? - A. I never saw him any more that night; I saw him the next day at my master's wharf as usual, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the size of the wicket? - A. I never measured it; it is a wicket I can go through with a little difficulty, by stooping my head I can easily go through it myself, it would not take two persons to go through at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you yourself seen persons carrying loads through the wicket? - A. No, never; the gates are always open in the day, I could take a sack through there with stooping my head.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You say you could carry a sack through, could you pull a sack through? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a usual thing to turn sacks inside out, and then fill them again? - A. Just as they require it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any quarrel with Hilsley to bear him any malice? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You observed this stranger a great deal, was it light or dark? - A. I did observe him, it was about four o'clock in the day, not very light, I could see to do any thing in the granary.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you should know him again if you were to see him? - A. I think I should; I never have seen him since.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you were watching Hilsley in the passage of No. 57, do you think that person who had a light had his back to you? - A. He stood with his face to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to suppose that he saw you? - A. I cannot form any judgment whether he did or not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not speak to Hilsley or any parties at the time the sack was being carried to No. 57? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not any reason to know what was in the sack but by feeling as he was going from the wicket to No. 57? - A. I felt it a great many times, I did not put my finger in the hole then; I never lost sight of the prisoner, when he came out of No. 57, I did not observe he had any empty sack then.</p>

I do: On the 22d of last month, about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200012"/>five o'clock, I took with me two constables, Hughes and Comley, to No. 57, a green-grocer's shop, where I found the prisoner, Lawless, on the ground-floor, in a room where he usually slept, as I understood; I found three sacks and a half of malt there; I took a separate sample from each of the three sacks, but not from the half sack; I compared the three samples, and every one of the samples were like the bulk of malt in No. 2; I could not discover the least shade of difference in the world between the bulk and these samples; I have been in the malt trade upwards of thirty-four years, I have had a great many thousand quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you are not an unexperienced person, and as far as belief can go, what is your belief? - A. Really, as I am in the presence of Heaven, I believe that the three sacks of malt were stolen from me, I have no doubt of it; on the 23d, I had the bulk measured by sworn meters, I found a deficiency of two quarters and six bushels.</p>
               <p>Q. How many bushels did you find in the sacks? - A. I believe them to be as near as possible about four bushels, they were full sacks; I saw Lawless when I first went in, but he was taken away by Hughes, the constable; Comley assisted in searching, I did not see the malt when I first saw Lawless, he was not in the room where the malt was found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I understand that you knew the prisoner Lawless, that he has been in your service? - A. He has, and I have known him living at No. 57 for nearly a twelvemonth; he had worked occasionally for me as a labourer, he had never been a fixed servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know, of your own knowledge, that he carried on any business at that time? - A. No, I have heard he kept a chandler's shop, and sold greens.</p>
               <p>Q. People who deal in the chandlery line sell beans, and malt, and other articles? - A. I never heard of a person that sold greens to sell malt.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take any notice of the room with the glass door? - A. I was in that room, I took no notice of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard that that was the room in which the malt was deposited? - A. I heard so.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you sell by wholesale or retail, or both? - A. Only wholesale.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before had you sold any quantity of malt? - A. On the 14th of January I sold fifteen quarters to Messrs. Dodd and Turner, in Tooley-street, and five quarters to Mr. Golding, in St. Giles's; I estimated that I had ten quarters, and it was from that I was induced to send for sworn meters, to ascertain the quantity; I took stock about the 2d of January.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is there any other person who keeps corn within any warehouse to which your gate leads? - A. None, I do not let any part of my warehouses to any corn-dealer whatever; I have no partner.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you known the house, No. 57? - A. Thirty-eight years, I have known Lawless six years, he has kept the ground floor of that house for three or four years, I have seen him in the room where the malt was found, he sleeps there, and I have seen him with the mash-tub, brewing in the back room; he keeps a chandler's shop; I have seen him making use of all the three rooms; the back room has had a glass door, but the glass is all out, and has been some years.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you been frequently in this shop? - A. Yes; he sold oysters, candles, small beer, and split peas; it is not a corn-chandler's shop; I have seen him brew there about once a week; I measured the wicket, the width is one foot three, and the heighth is four foot six.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you go with Comley and Mr. Brickwood to No. 57? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him live there? - A. He has been there three or four years; he paid twenty-seven pounds a year for the ground floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen him before in that room before you apprehended him? - A. Yes, he keeps a chandler's shop there, and sells butter and cheese, and all kinds of greens.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What are you considering of - have you ever been here before? - A. Yes, as a witness and a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever tried here? - A. Yes, I was, but I was acquitted.</p>
               <p>Hilsley's defence. I am innocent of this piece of business, I am wrongfully accused; Grant accused me the next day when I had been at work; as I was going out of the yard, he asked me if I did not carry a sack out of the gate, as I was putting on my coat to go to dinner; I said, no; he said, he thought I was the man; he said, he saw a man carry a sack from the gate, and go along with it up the street; I gave him some rough language, he told me the less I said the better; we had been filling a tub full of oats, I worked there all the day till night, when Mr. Hughes came and took me; he swears wrongfully to me, I am not the man.</p>
               <p>Lawless's defence. I am innocent; I never bought a grain of corn of this gentleman in my life.</p>

               <p>Q. On Monday the 21st of January, did you bar the wicket, and put the chain up? - A. Yes; I cannot justly say what time, it was past four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner go out that afternoon? - A. I let him out at the wicket, he was alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any light, or any candle, at the wicket? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the prisoner, to see if he had any thing about him? - A. He had his great coat on his back, nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him go to the wicket with any thing on his shoulder? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body else go out with any thing on their shoulder that afternoon? - A. No, I did not; that I am quite sure of, I can be upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You did not see Grant go through the wicket at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor did you see him standing by the wicket? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Would it be possible, in the situation in which you were, for him to have gone out with a sack on his shoulder without your seeing it? - A. He had nothing on his back.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any man take a sack from your master's yard without your seeing it? - A. I cannot say, because when I am in the stable I cannot see what is done there; I was in the stable when Hilsley came and asked me to let him out.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether he had been out before, or had not been out, you do not know? - A. The wicket was chained when I went to let him out.</p>
               <p>Q. Any body might open the great gates? - A. Yes, they were not locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing I were there, and had a sack upon my shoulder, I might have gone out and you not have known it? - Q. It would make a great rattle if you did it.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you venture to swear that nobody opened the wicket, and put the chain up again, without your knowing of it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. All that you mean to swear is, that when you let Hilsley out, he had no sack on his shoulder; and the moment you let him out you shut the door, therefore, whether Grant was at the door you cannot tell? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you any suspicion that caused or induced you to look, to see if any body was outside of the wicket? - A. No; I did not look to see, I had no suspicion.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you remember, on the 21st of January, Dennison letting the prisoner Hilsley out at the wicket? - A. I saw the prisoner, and the last witness letting him out at the yard; I saw the prisoner go first, and Dennison go afterwards; I did not observe that the prisoner had any thing with him but his great coat, he stood within half a yard of me at the time he went out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You were at that time bushel-man, and foreman to Mr. Brickwood; you were turned off? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had the care of the malt, had you not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You took good care of it? - A. I took as good care of it as I possibly could, I did not see any carried away; I do not recollect that I had been up to No. 2, since the morning; I had lived with Mr. Brickwood about nine months.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. If you had seen any body take any sack of malt on his shoulder, what should you have thought it your duty to do? - A. To have told my master; if the prisoner had had a sack on his shoulder, I should have told my master; but I swear positively he had not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is the smallest quantity that you sell? - A. I never knew any less than a quarter sold at the time I lived there.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Prosecutor.) What is the smallest quantity that you have sold? - A. Five quarters; to oblige a friend, I might have sold two or three quarters; but that I do not believe I have done above two or three times in my life; never so little as a quarter.</p>

No; he would have turned me off, he left word with the miller for me not to stay, but I was going off; I saw the prisoner in the dusk of the evening, at No. 1, and I saw him going down stairs, it was between four and five o'clock, he had nothing with him only his great coat; I did not see him any more that evening, I staid not quite half an hour after him; I am sure he had nothing with him when he went down.</p>

             sworn - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe you are agent to the Henley Navigation company? - A. Yes, I live at No. 4, Amelia-place, at present, and I hold an apartment of Mr. Lawless, for which I pay him eight guineas a year, at the back of the passage in the front of the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any glass-door to that room? - A. There is a glass-door, but not much glass in it, it is almost broken, the door is generally open at all times of the day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. How often are you there? - A. Generally every day, sometimes I am there two hours, and sometimes four or five, and sometimes I do not come at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When you are not there Mr. Lawless has the use of that room? - A. It is free open for any person to bring sacks in.</p>
               <p>Q. I might go there if I choosed; he brews there once a week? - A. I cannot say that, I have seen him brew.</p>
               <p>Q. Every fortnight? - A. I cannot say, he has brewed frequently in that room.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know the other prisoner, Hilsley? - A. I do not know him when I see him, I heard of Lawless being taken up on the next day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. On the evening before he was taken up, did you light any man with a sack into that room? - A. No; I am sure I was not there so late.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any authority to dispose of any of the Henley Navigation company's corn? - A. No, I have sold corn so far as this, if I wanted a sack of corn for myself or my friends, I could have it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever sell any sack of malt to Lawless? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Prosecutor.) Q. Supposing a person employed in the warehouse No. 2, could any person come from the warehouse No. 2 with a load, and not be observed in No. 1? - A. Yes, for nothing is more clear; there is a fire burning for three months together in the kiln, and it very often happens that men are roasting potatoes at the fire; when I have gone in the floor No. 1, and could not find them, nothing is so easy for fifty men to come down from No. 2, and not to hear them; there is a temporary erection which would conceal fifty people in No. 1, what we call the pea warehouse, and persons passing from No. 2 could not be observed, but there are many situations in No. 1 in which persons could not pass it without being seen.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Waight.) Do you mean to say that there is no part in No. 1 but in which you could observe any person coming from No. 2? - A. No, it is as Mr. Brickwood has said; but all the part where I worked at no man could pass without my seeing him; I was at work for half an hour at that part of the warehouse which overlooked the stair-case that leads to No. 2, I was sorting of sacks, the ragged ones from the whole, and putting the room to rights.</p>

            , jun. sworn. - I am an Officer of Lambeth-street: on the 22d of January this man was brought to our Office, about the middle of the day, charged with a felony; he had a large bag, containing various articles, and among them I found this piece of flannel; I asked him where he bought the different things; he said, he bought some at Mr. Weddell's, and told me where Mr. Weddell lived, and amongst the cloth I found this card; I carried it to Mr. Weddell, who owned the card and the cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Prosecutor.) Look at that cloth; what is it? - A. It is a Salisbury flannel; I know it is mine by the card, otherwise I should not; I had such flannel in my house, but I did not know I had lost it till the Officer came; then I searched and found it was missing; the card has our private mark on it, and it belongs to this piece of flannel.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it when it was in your shop? - A. In the window.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. (To Prosecutor.) Q. Do you think you can swear you had this stuff in your shop two days before I came to your shop - A. I would not wish to swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the card fixed to the cloth when it came back? - A. It was loose.</p>
               <p>Q. Then upon looking over that card, does it satisfy your mind that that piece of Salisbury flannel was the same flannel to which the card was affixed? - A. I could think it was, and the quantity taken corresponds with the quantity left exactly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. A Jew that travels about declared to me, that Mr. Weddell had sold that piece of stuff to him three weeks before I bought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200015"/>it; he is at Portsmouth, on board of a man of war, with slops.</p>

             sworn. - Q. You slept in the house? - A. Yes: About twelve o'clock Robshaw came down and let me know what they were doing, in consequence of that, I went up, and saw what he has related. I saw Warton put it into the basket, the other prisoner was standing close by; they made use of the words, when they were doubling the copper up, that the copper was too small; then I went to my dinner, I dined in the room that they go out on the plat; I saw Warton come in at the window with the basket under his arm, and Maylin followed behind; I suspected what they had in the basket, and after they were gone, I opened the window, and there I saw Warton going with it under his arm, he went round Burlington-gardens; I went to a window that looked into Burlington-gardens, I saw Warton carrying it under his arm, and Maylin followed him behind; I then shut the window and went down stairs, and followed the prisoners, I lost sight of them by the time I got down; when I got near them I saw them in Swallow-street, standing near a pewterer's shop; then I saw Warton give Maylin some money; I suspected by where they stood, that that was the shop where they had sold it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who keeps that house? - A. Buckingham; I saw Mr. Anstie the next morning and told him what I had seen the afternoon before.</p>

             sworn. - I live at No. 24, Swallow-street, I am a pewterer and brazier, I bought this copper of the two prisoners, and gave them ten-pence a pound for it; I believe I bought of the two prisoners in the whole 40 lb. or better.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day? - A. Part on the 12th of January, part on the 14th, part on the 15th, and on the 16th I bought seven or eight pounds of copper of the prisoners</p>
               <p>Q. Can you shew us what you bought on the 16th? - A. I really could not tell was it ever so, it was all put together inside of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Prosecutor.) Does all the copper belong to you? - A. I judge so, because I have missed as much more as is here.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Ewster.) Which is the one taken in the basket? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any part you sold there? - A. Yes, this one piece.</p>
               <p>Q. You went there for the purpose of detecting this? - A. Yes; he told us what he bought of the two prisoners afterwards, when we found him out, but not at first.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. How long was it before you found him out? - A. I informed him on the Thursday, as we found him out on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you sold this last parcel, you informed your master of it? - A. No, after we had sold this last parcel; we sold this on the Queen's birth-night, on Friday the 18th, and on Saturday they were apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Buckingham.) When did you buy it? - A. I cannot directly say.</p>
               <p>Q. It is another piece, sold on a different day? - A. I cannot tell whether they came on a different day or together.</p>
               <p>Q. Take another piece, when did you buy that? - A. In the course of the four purchases.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you buy your purchases? - A. First on the 12th of January, second on Monday the 14th, third on Tuesday the 15th, and the fourth on Wednesday the 16th; they are all here, I believe; the greatest part was brought on Monday, I believe, that was twenty pounds; eight pounds on the 15th, eight pounds and a half on the 16th, six pounds and a quarter, I believe.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know which parcel it is you bought on the 16th? - A. This is a piece I bought on the last day, I am sure of it, by reason it was put in the fire; it was very thick with lead, I was taken in with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other day on which you purchased any with solder? - A. There were; I did not see it till after I purchased the last time, and then I took a small allowance for it, but not enough. (The witness handed a card to Mr. Gurney.)</p>
               <p>Q. You give me this card that I might know your address; is this your writing? - A. It is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose writing is it? - A. A little boy's of mine, that I asked to put it down, it is merely for a memorandum.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at it, and tell me whether it is your's, or your little boy's? - A. It is my writing I see.</p>
               <p>Q. Both by this piece of paper, and this card, they do not agree with your evidence: they make the solder sold on the 15th? - A. No, the solder on the 16th.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200018"/>Q. Now which is correct, your paper or your evidence? - A. Both, I hope.</p>
               <p>Q. Take your choice, which is correct, both is impossible; was it Tuesday or Wednesday? - A. Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you point out any one piece, except that one piece you gave me now, that you bought on the Wednesday? - A. This is another piece I bought on Wednesday, I think there were six pounds and a quarter; they were reckoned five shillings, and for which there did not weigh three pounds of copper when the lead was taken off, it came to four shillings; there were several pieces of this kind.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were first questioned by the officer, you said you had bought none? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When Ewster came to your shop, you told him you had not bought copper of these persons? - A. The young man came into the shop to ask me if I bought copper; I told him I must know whether they got it honestly.</p>
               <p>Q. I am asking you, in point of fact, did you or did you not, deny having purchased copper? - A. I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you did not? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Prosecutor.) How much copper have you lost in this house? - A. I suppose double the quantity, and more.</p>
               <p>Q. What pieces have you matched to your house? - A. Only two or three pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you have the goodness to shew us the two or three pieces? - A. These two pieces match exactly; we did not try any more.</p>
               <p>The prisoners did not say any thing in their defence, but called three witnesses each, who gave them a good character.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer, I had a warrant to apprehend the prisoners on the 15th of this month; I took the man when he was on guard, and the woman in Peter-street; when the man was examined, I pulled a glove from off his hand to see if his hand had been cut; I observed the skin was off his right-hand third-finger, it appeared to be very much lacerated, as if it had been rubbed or bruised, it did not seem to be a cut from glass, the skin hung over from one joint to the other, the skin had not been taken from the wound, and it appeared as if it had been done some time; he denied to me ever seeing the woman since he had left the lodgings at Mr. Burst's, he at last acknowledged to the Magistrate where she lived; when I searched the woman, she got up, and put her hand in her pocket first, and pulled out something which she endeavoured to secrete, which was this duplicate of the bed-gown; I found a key on the woman, and went to the room where they lived, and found this hat, (produces it;) it was marked on the top with white, as if it had rubbed against a white cieling or wall, the white mark was rather fresh on the hat then; I took this hat to Mr. Burst, and desired him to go the most natural way he could into the kitchen through the window, and when he got in, he said he could not get in without rubbing his head against it; upon his re-examination, I asked him if this was his hat; he said it was, but the white mark had been put on; the woman prisoner said she had picked up the bed-gown ten minutes before six o'clock in Snow's-rents, which is at the back part of this man's house; first of all she said she had it a good while; I asked her how long, and she found me inquisitive, she at last said that; I found in his room a piece of rag, it appeared as if it had come off some one's finger, it had a little blood on it, and a little blood I found on a little bag in the room.</p>

               <p>Q. (To Prosecutor.) There is nothing about your money that you know it from any other person's money? - A. On one of the shillings there is W.G. marked, I observed that when I was at Rotherhithe, when I was in company with a young man there, he was telling me that he had three bad shillings; I said, I have silver in my pocket, I will see if I have any bad; I said, here is a shilling marked W. G. with a particular dent in it; I said, they might as well have punched it through while they were doing it; that shilling I will undertake to say I had in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you did not stop in the street, and talk to her? - A. I did not say a word to her more than I have said to you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was walking along Soho-square, he stopped me, and asked me if I would take a walk with him round the square; I told him I would, and I did, and that young man gave me three shillings for a compliment; then he said I had robbed him; I told him I would not give it him back, as he had given it me; I had three shillings and sixpence in my pocket before he kept me walking round the square with him.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the prosecutor.) Is any part of that true? - A. Not a word of it.</p>

            , for stock exchanged, then the transaction of Mr. Sherrott, the broker, in order to make this transfer, was entered? - A. Yes, perfectly regular.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing more then is necessary, than the appearance of the proprietor, in order to sign the book? - A. That is all.</p>
               <p>Q. So with respect to the purchaser, and with the person selling, they, according to the monies that pass between them, have a receipt? - A. Justly so.</p>
               <p>Q. But to the transfer it is necessary to have the signature of the clerk of the Bank, and the number? - A. The clerk of the Bank signs the execution of the transfer at the time the proprietor or his attorney signs; with respect to any witness to a receipt, that may or may not take place with the clerk of the Bank, because the witnessing clerk to the receipt has a ticket with the number that the stock is transferred.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You do not consider that as a receipt? - A. That receipt was filled up, and ready to be witnessed by the clerk.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. After the transfer is made, and signed by the proper person of course, and the receipt signed, and the money paid that changes the property, then it would be wrote down on the accompts in the book; you have nothing to do with the receipt at the Bank? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Except when it is brought to shew you when it is entered? - A. Certainly, it is an article of reference to us. (The receipt read.)</p>

               <p>W. Waltham.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. That transaction was only in its progress, without it was signed at the time by the clerk, it is of no sort of use; it could not have the effect of a forgery? - A. It could not.</p>
               <p>Court. The receipt as far as he had any thing to do is perfect; if it had been witnessed by the clerk it would have shewn that he had received so much money, it is in order to shew that something had been done, in another place that upon producing that they may without difficulty come to the transfer, that is the only use of it to the witnessing clerk, it leads his eye directly to the book, but till it is so signed the purchaser of stock only knows that this is the person that sells him the stock, and the witnessing clerk is only a voucher that the transfer has been entered; still this is a receipt; you are right that he has not obtained any of it, but he has executed one instrument, and that one instrument is the receipt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Without the witnessing clerk had signed it, it is not a receipt for money, it is requisite that he should have signed it, and therefore a receipt should be given after rather than before.</p>
               <p>Court. I should think rather before the transfer, for when the transfer is executed, the party has conveyed away his interest.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Therefore it is like the conveyance of an estate, they should be done at the same time, afterwards to be delivered over to the purchaser,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200027"/>when the purchaser delivers him over the money, because the broker or the principal will not pay him the money till he sees all the ceremony complete.</p>
               <p>Court. It strikes me that the offence with which he is charged is signing a receipt for money; your question is whether this is a receipt for the money, I say a receipt for the consideration of money is a receipt for the transfer; he has signed a receipt for money after all, and in point of fact it matters not whether he did it first or afterwards; he has signed a receipt for the transfer, but when the transfer is complete, there is some mark put on the receipt by the officer of the Bank; then it is a transfer, the other is a receipt; he is not indicted for forging a transfer, he is indicted for forging a receipt; he has put his name upon an instrument purporting to be a receipt, there is something more to be done to it in order to make it a transfer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Heath. This indictment is for forging a receipt, it has nothing to do with a transfer; whether this instrument was for a transfer of property is not the question, that is the use he meant to make of it afterwards, which is immaterial to this charge.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you returning home any night about ten o'clock? - A. I believe in the month of May, on Whit-Tuesday, about a quarter before ten o'clock in the evening, I was returning home; I had been at Somers Town, where I was engaged; it was not dark; I do not know that it was moonlight at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me whether you saw any of the prisoners there at that time? - A. I saw that one, I believe his name is Hodges; I was going across into <placeName id="t18050220-32-crimeloc186">Bedford-square</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18050220-32-crimeloc186" type="placeName" value="Bedford-square"/>

               <p>Q. At the time that he accosted you, did you observe any other person near him? - A. I saw no one; I answered him that I was going across Bedford-square myself; we went on together, and he walked along with me; as soon as I had answered him, he began to speak of the great buildings there, and said, what excellent houses, and so on, and when we came to the corner of a street, called Bedford-street, he made a halt for a moment, and said, what a fine house this is (it is a corner house), and what a magnificent portico to this house; he stopped for a moment, and I stopped for a moment for him, out of civility, and in a moment, he made one step behind, and I felt him, as if he had fell against my side; it was a sort of thing, as though a man's foot had slipped.</p>
               <p>Q. At the moment when he hit against you, did you observe any other person? - A. As I was in the act of turning round, to see why he had so struck me in falling against me, two men rushed out, one seized me and the other him.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time did they say any thing in the hearing of the prisoner? - A. We were close together; I inquired, as soon as I could recollect myself, what this meant, and what was the reason of it, and one of the men, or both of them, answered, we are here to detect and seize such men as you; we are two of the Bow-street patrols, and stationed near this spot, for this express purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. On their saying, they were there for the purpose of taking such men into custody, what effect had it on Hodges, one of the prisoners at the bar? - A. He appeared to be in the most extreme state of agitation; he seemed to lose his legs, and to fall in this manner, and held out his arms for this man to support him; he cried out that he was ruined and undone for ever; these people abused him, and swore to him, and abused me very much, and I expostulated with them, as well as I could; they said, we will not let you go, we know what you are, we observed you both, and we will take you to the Coal-yard; I still kept pressing on them, that they had not detected me nor him, that we were perfectly innocent.</p>
               <p>Q. What effect did that produce? - A. Great abuse, with saying, that I had better be quiet, or it would be worse for me; they said they saw what passed, and they conveyed by expressions that they had detected me and this man in some unnatural proceedings.</p>
               <p>Q. When that was communicated to you, was there any promise made by any body? - A. They were leading this man and myself across the square, towards a street that goes into Bedford-square, towards Tottenham-court-road and Gower-street;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200028"/>when we got near Tottenham-court-road, one of these pretended officers said to the other, stop a moment, do you not think something may be done without carrying it any further, these men seem both Gentlemen; what a dreadful thing it would be to themselves and families, if matters were carried to extremities; the other man answered, he knew he was determined to do his duty and nothing should persuade him to have it made up; they went on then towards Tottenham-court-road, when the man who had spoken before to the other renewed his request that it might be made up, the other man then said well, we will walk up this way and see if something can be done.</p>
               <p>Q. That was upon his renewing his request; was any thing proposed? - A. We walked up to Tottenham-court-road, and it was proposed that money should be given.</p>
               <p>Q. Who proposed that? - A. One of the two men said that if it was done it must be done by means of money, for they were running a great hazard in adopting this manner of settling it; they walked slowly up Tottenham-court-road, and there was some private conversation amongst themselves, whispering; then one of them said, unless you give twenty pounds, we cannot let you go; I answered I would give twenty pounds; we walked on farther up Tottenham-court-road, and Hodges still seemed to be in that state of agitation, overcome by distress, as it appeared to me he had almost lost his senses; they could not get any answer from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether there was a watch in his pocket? - A. I did; after they returned to Tottenham-court-road, and come along Great Russell-square, towards my house. When we came into Bloomsbury-square, I desired them to stop; I told them that I would give them my word and honour that I would bring them twenty pounds, for them not to follow me; and on one of the men appearing to treat Hodges roughly, he said, he had but little money in his pocket, he had a few Banknotes; and while the man was talking to him, he seemingly pulled it out, and said, see what a fine watch this man has got, if we cannot get the money we must have that; whether he pulled it out of his pocket I cannot tell, I saw it in one of the men's hands; I left them at the moment, I had not far to go to my house, it might be fifty or sixty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in sight of your house? - A. No, it was in Bloomsbury-square; I left them talking about the watch; I went to my own house to fetch the twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the men follow you there? - A. I went into the house, and could not make up any way twenty pounds, so I brought out a Bank-note of thirty pounds, and there was then a third person whom I just had a glimpse of, he ran off; Hodges was not there then, I saw him no more that night; the thirty pound note I gave to one of those two men.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, upon your oath solemnly, what was the motive that induced you to part with that thirty pounds? - A. It was an extreme dread of the unnatural accusation these people held out to me; I saw no more of them that night.</p>
               <p>Q. On the next morning did any body call at your house? - A. On the next day I did not see any body at my house, I was told they had been there; in consequence of what I had been informed, I went to

            , and there two persons were waiting for me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came there, who were the two persons that you saw? - A. The prisoner Hodges was one, the other person I have never seen since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you learn from Hodges, that he or the other person had called upon you? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you for what purpose he had called at your house? - A. The man that was with Hodges had completely the manner and appearance of a gentleman altogether: as soon as I was in the coffee-room, he said, Mr. Lodge, there was a most unpleasant affair happened to you in Russel-square last night; he said, this young man, meaning Hodges, is my cousin, he is in the greatest distress imaginable, because he must not go home to his father without returning his father his watch, which he was robbed of by the people who had your money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how that could be recovered? - A. He said, he understood by his cousin it was in the hands of these people; he turned to Hodges, and said, Cousin, where are you to go to redeem it from them; Hodges said, they had appointed to meet him at six o'clock at some place, I think, the Bear, in Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think there was Bow-street made use of? - A. Yes, I perfectly well remember that; he said, at the Brown-bear, or Black-bear, in Bow-street; the other man then said, I do not know what can be done in this case, I know you have been robbed; and he said to me, he has been robbed by the greatest villains on the earth; as to him, I can answer for him, I have known him from his infancy, and I do not doubt but you are as innocent; but it will be a dreadful thing if matters come to light, it will be our duty, with the greatest industry that is possible, to prevent it; and I must try at some means of getting his watch again; he then said to me, I am an officer in the 15th regiment of light dragoons, my name is Williams, and, said he, you know we military men do not abound with money, I have fourteen or fifteen pounds at home, and he turned round to Hodges, and said to him, what have you got; he took out some small notes; then the other man said, between your money and mine we may get your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200029"/>watch again; Hodges said I have so much; it was understood that they said they must have as much money of him as they had of me, thirty pounds; then the other man asked me, perhaps, said he, you will give some little assistance; I need not tell you I am ashamed to ask such a thing, but you see the particulars of it; I told him that I would.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, did you give them any thing at that time? - A. Yes, seven pounds; I went home to Bloomsbury-square, and brought seven pounds, and gave it to Hodges.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you returned, did you see any other persons that you might judge that they had been with Hodges or no? - A. As I went out of Bloomsbury-square, there was some little suspicion that excited my mind: I turned up King-street instead of going down Bloomsbury, I saw Hodges with two other persons I had not seen before, they parted, and I saw no more.</p>

               <p>Q. You went into the country after this? - A. I went on the 16th of August, and returned on the 3d week in September.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it happen, after your arrival in town, that you went to your sister's house in Hertford-street? - A. Yes, on the 17th of November; when I was at my sister's I was informed that somebody wanted me, I came away, I think, about a quarter before ten o'clock, I was going home; in turning towards Piccadilly, the prisoner Hodges came up to me, and asked me, by name, how I did; I looked at him, and did not at the moment recollect him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him from the Wednesday after the Whitsunday? - A. Never; I did not recollect him at the moment, I said so to him; he said, you remember the very unpleasant business that took place in Russell-square a few months ago; I believe I said, yes, I remember it too well; in a moment after he had said that, the prisoner Mahon came up.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the first time you recollect that you ever saw him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the other prisoner at that time? - A. The third man came up a little after; Mahon came up wringing his hands, and endeavouring to be crying.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say was the cause of that distress? - A. Before he said any thing that I could understand, the third man came up.</p>
               <p>Q. That was Rumball? - A. That was the first time I had ever seen him; he stopped at seeing us; I said, Sir, do you belong to this party; he said, yes, I do, putting on a fierce aspect, and my business in the party is, to see that justice is done to these two gentlemen, who are my particular friends; and if you want to know who I am, I am one of the Bow-street patrols, and if you do not act as you should do, my business is to carry you to Mr. Townshend, I suppose you know who I mean. Rumball said that; and if you refuse to settle this matter as you ought, I will carry you before Mr. Townshend; then Mahon, who seemed to be in distress, told me that Hodges was his brother-in-law, and that his father would not do any thing for him, he was a great profligate, and fallen upon him for support, and he was not able to support him; he said, I have a great affection and regard for him, I should like to assist him, but I cannot, I have done many things for him that I ought to be hanged for; we walked on, and Rumball was speaking extremely loud, in a threatening manner, it was a very light night, and about half past eight o'clock; I said, we will walk through the Park, and we will see what is to be done, and I will hear all you have to say; we went through the Park; in the Park the plan was opened, which was, that Hodges should be sent by his cousin to America, and that money was wanting; surely, said Mahon, you cannot grudge a little money for such a purpose; I asked him for what crime, and by what authority the money could be claimed; I was answered, that I had brought Hodges into the practise of unnatural crimes, and therefore I was bound to provide for him, that was the answer from Mahon. On Mahon saying, surely you cannot grudge a little money for such a purpose, Rumball came up, and said, you talk of a little money, not less than two hundred and fifty pounds will do it; I said, that two hundred and fifty pounds was a large sum of money, I could not get two hundred and fifty pounds immediately, it was impossible; we walked into Pall-Mall, Rumball went up to a centinel, and said, are any of our people here tonight; the centinel answered, no, that was in the Park; I having said that two hundred and fifty pounds was a great deal of money to raise, they said, it could not be done for less for the passage and the clothes; I said, in Pall-Mall, you shall have it; I was asked what I could give them then; I said, I had five pounds in my pocket, and if they would go home with me I would give them some more; I said, that five pounds is all I have at this moment.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not part with the five pounds that time? - A. No; we got into a coach at Charing-cross, they went down with me to St. Peter's-hill, where I have a lodging, and as we went along, it was agreed that they should come to me on Monday morning, I told them I would give them ten pounds more, at Doctors'-Commons, and the rest they should come for at a future time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go into your house at Doctors'-Commons? - A. No; I told them they should have the rest of the two hundred and fifty pounds if they came to me on Monday, I would contrive means to get it, or words to that purpose. I went into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200030"/>the house, they staid at the door; when I came out, I gave the five pound and the ten pound notes together, to Mahon, they were altogether at the time; they then left me; they had appointed to meet me at the College on the Monday at eleven o'clock, this was on Saturday.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Q. The consequence of which was, the officers were to be at your house the next day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the next day, what officers came to your house? - A. Taunton and Baker.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house did they come to you? - A. They came to an apartment in the Herald's-College; I had borrowed it for the purpose, as a convenient place to manage the matter: it was a small room, with a larger room behind, adjoining it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they bored some holes to see what was done? - A. Yes; and it was done so as to give them a command of what was done. At eleven o'clock, I saw Hodges coming across the Court-yard of the Herald's College, I went out to meet him; he came to me and said, my brother is here, do you wish to see him; I said, I understand your brother is the party most concerned in this business; he went then from me, and returned the second time, with Mahon and Rumball; they then came into this room, and the officers were in the adjoining room.</p>
               <p>Q. To observe what was done there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who addressed you first? - A. I think Rumball.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask for any thing? - A. No, I do not recollect that he asked for any thing; they sat down at the table; I said, I hope this unpleasant affair will be settled, and there will be no more using of ill language; I hope I shall hear no more of this; one and all said, no, certainly you shall hear no more of it; I then said, I can do it in no way but this; you know you had fifteen pounds last Saturday night; (Rumball said, yes;) I will give you a draft for one hundred and eighty-five pounds, which I had ready, in a fictitious name and place; I said, I have sent to a friend in Norfolk-street, and I will go and get fifty pounds of him, which will make it two hundred and fifty pounds, with the fifteen pounds you have had.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this conversation loud enough to be heard in the adjoining room? - A. I have no doubt but it was; I gave them this fictious draft which was to be paid the next day; we went out into the street and went into St. Paul's Church-yard, and there we took a coach, and when we got to Temple-bar just as we were coming through, I said I have parted with so much money upon a groundless occasion knowing that the Bow-street men were near, I saw them at the time; I said that man, meaning Hodges, knows I am perfectly innocent, though you have threatened me in this manner, if he chooses to declare it, to which Hodges made no answer, but Rumball said, Oh, if we are to have any more conversation upon it, we have not done with you, you shall have your d - d draft again, and you shall go to Bow-street; I answered, my friend without any trouble to you, we shall be there in a few minutes, and at that moment the officers came and opened the coach doors and came in.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you solemnly whether there was any foundation for that accusation made against you? - A. No, if there had I should not have stood in this place now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. On the 17th of November, was that the first time you saw either Mahon or Rumball? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you have described Mahon coming up to you wringing his hands and saying his distress was on account of his brother-in-law Hodges? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Saying that Hodges was ruined and must go out of his country, he asked your assistance; he knew some Bristol or Liverpool captain that would take him to America? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On that day was any money asked of you upon any other account, but for the purpose of assisting Hodges in leaving the country? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the evening was it that you attended these persons in Piccadilly? - A. About a quarter before eight.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you yourself proposed to take a walk through the Park? - A. Because Rumball was so noisy.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had gone through the Park, you took a hackney-coach at Charing-cross - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out of the coach in your way from Charing-cross to Doctors' Commons? - A. I should have mentioned that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of them get out of the coach? - A. I think twice or three time on purpose for buying a stamp, for the remainder of the 250 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you yourself get out of the coach for that purpose? - A. No, not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were at your lodgings on St. Peter's-hill you left them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went into the house yourself, and the door was shut? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many other persons in the house; who let you in? - A. A female servant let me in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the master of the house at home? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people live in that house? - A. I believe at the time Mr. Scott and his son were inhabitants of that house, and a female servant, but I dare say they were not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact you did not see them, nor did you make any enquiry for them? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200031"/>Q. How long did you stay in your house? - A. I believe not two minutes; as little time as I could get the note out of the bureau.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give them the precise sum of fifteen pounds? - A. I gave them the precise sum of fifteen pounds; I had a one pound or a two pound note in my pocket, and it was observed that I had more, upon which one of the prisoners, I believe Rumball, said, do not take his one or two pound note, fifteen pound is enough.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave them the fifteen pound, and the one or two pound you kept? - A. Just so.</p>
               <p>Q. The purpose for which you gave this fifteen pound was to enable Hodges to go to America; was that the purpose? - A. Certainly not; I knew from that moment that which I had never known before, and I strongly suspected that he was in collusion with those persons.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe from what we have learned from your Counsel, you had advanced a sum of money to liberate Hodges from his confinement? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before that? - A. I was attacked privately, about four or five days before that, by two persons, in company with a third, who called himself Captain of the Bow-street patrol, and who said they were twenty-two in number.</p>
               <p>Q. That was on the 12th of November? - A. The explanation is, that those two persons I first saw in Russell-square, and this third man, an elderly man, who called himself Captain, met me coming from the Heralds' Office; he said he wanted to save this man if he could, if not, I must be farther involved, for this reason, if Hodges be not sent out of the country, he will accuse these men, and he will call you as a witness against them; if he be not put out of the way, and if you do not furnish money for that purpose, we must necessarily accuse you, to prevent your coming evidence against them. - I do not know that it is necessary to go into all this.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason that was proposed to you? - A. To discharge Hodges; at the same time, these men said it must be done by Jew bail, which I desired to have an explanation of; I did not know what it meant.</p>
               <p>Q. What explanation was given to you? - A. They told me there were persons who lived by giving bail, and that they left their houses after bail was given, and were not to be found.</p>
               <p>Q. What sum of money were you to give to procure those persons? - A. One hundred pounds, and more.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did give an hundred pound, and more? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You believed the story that Hodges was really in custody at that time, and therefore you gave them one hundred pounds? - A. I did not know but he was regularly taken into custody, and the man who called himself Captain of the Bow-street patrol took a staff out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, between the 12th and the 17th go out to inquire whether the story was true? - A. I did not, and till the moment that Rumball told me in the street, by Piccadilly, and threatened me, if I did not do so and so, he would carry me to Mr. Townshend, I thought I was in the custody of these three Bow-street officers; from that moment I knew I was not, because no Bow-street patrol would talk so; I was then in more fears than one.</p>
               <p>Q. Your mind was then delivered from the fear of being in the custody of officers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I mean no imputation to you; there is not the least imputation on your character in all this? - A. I cannot help my feelings.</p>
               <p>Q. When you gave the ten pounds and the five pounds where were you? - A. At the door of the house where I have an apartment in Doctors' Commons.</p>
               <p>Q. Your servant was close at hand, if you chose to call her; how near was the watchman? - A. I do not know; I had not been in the house forty-eight hours at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Certainly there was a watchman near; you made yourself an appointment to meet them on Monday morning; did you communicate it to Sir

               <p>Q. Had you not an idea of bringing them there on Monday, for the purpose of having them taken up? - A. I had been tossed about in my mind, and hesitating whether it was possible, that if I could prevail upon them to take the fifteen pounds, and leave the matter there, whether I could prevail upon them not to call again; I expected each application would be the last.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell them to call on you on Monday morning, on purpose to have some persons there ready to take them up? - A. No, I gave them the money to get rid of them, knowing I should have the whole of the day to consider what was to be done.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. Q. On Saturday, the 17th, what length of time was consumed in this conversation? - A. About an hour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. From the time you had been at your sister's house to the time you arrived at your own lodgings, where you parted with fifteen pounds,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200032"/>you had no communication with any friend of your own? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to the house the only person you saw was a female servant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The master of the house and his son you did not see, therefore there was nobody in the house to whom you might with delicacy communicate the situation you were in? - A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. You were asked whether at the time you parted with this fifteen pounds you parted with it for them to call again, and to have persons ready to take them; I understood you that you parted with it under the impression of fear on your mind? - A. Yes, it was to get rid of them that night.</p>
               <p>Q. You were asked what was the reason that induced you, after you met these two men, to part with the money; whether it was to get Hodges out of the country, or for the purpose of protecting your character from an accusation of this sort against you? - A. No doubt that was my grand motive, to preserve my character from a dread of this sort.</p>
               <p>Q. And that continued to act upon you till you saw Sir

            ? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Rumball saying to you that he would take you to Mr. Townshend was the first time you discovered that you were not in the hands of Bow-street officers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been with them before Rumball said this? - A. I suppose something more than three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you gave the ten pound note and the five pound note, knowing yourself to be in the hand of impostors, and persons who represented themselves as Bow-street officers, under what impression of mind did you part with the money? - A. To be free from those things, and to have the next day to advise with my friends what was best to be done.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know what you were afraid would happen to you that night if you had not given them the money? - A. I had no alternative, either to give them the money or to take them into custody instantly, which I could not conveniently have done at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it under the apprehension that you would be carried before Townshend? - A. It was under the general apprehension which had lasted throughout, from a charge of that nature; upon that ground I engaged to give them fifteen pounds, and having the next day to consider what was best to be done.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were you placed by Mr. Lodge? - A. In a little room adjoining another, parted by two small folding doors.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the other room before you were placed in this room where you were? - A. Yes, these folding doors opened in there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the room where Mr. Lodge and the prisoners went in afterwards? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. When you placed yourselves, you and Baker, by the direction of Mr. Lodge, did you make any experiment by which you could see what passed in the room? - A. I bored holes in each of the pannels; I looked through one and Baker through the other.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you had bored the holes did Mr. Lodge and the prisoners go into that room? - A. They came in in about a quarter of an hour after we were there.</p>
               <p>Q. Then state what you heard pass, and what you saw there? - A. Mr. Lodge and the three prisoners came in; I saw them; those are the persons at the bar; they seated themselves down in a chair, and a conversation ensued; Mr. Lodge signified that he wanted to settle this disagreeable business, and he said to one of them, do you belong to Marlborough-street; Rumball (by his voice) answered, no, I belong to Bow-street, there are near five hundred of us under the direction of Sir Rich. Ford; Mr. Lodge then said, I have given you fifteen pounds, the answer was, yes, by Rumball; Mr. Lodge then proposed to give a draft, and to go to a friend of his in Norfolk-street, to borrow some money to make up two hundred and fifty pounds; they then agreed to walk to St. Paul's, and take a coach to go to Norfolk-street; they then left the room; Baker and me walked out after them; we followed them to where they took a coach, at a distance; they took a coach in St. Paul's church-yard, and we pursued them to the corner of Norfolk-street; then we immediately opened the doors and leaped into the coach, and took them all to Bow-street; I searched Rumball; on Rumball was found a watch and a gold chain; I saw Hodges searched, he had a watch; and Mahon had a chain and a seal, but no watch; I searched Mahon's lodgings on the following day, and found a hat, a veil, and some duplicates.</p>

             sworn. - I was sent for by Mr. Lias; I went up three pair of stairs, where he was at work; then he came down with me; I asked him if he had been robbing his master; he said, no, he rob his master, by no means; I searched his left-hand pocket, and found these silver filings, (produces them;) he said he was very sorry for it; he wanted his master to forgive him; I told him his master could not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. When I came from breakfast it was near ten o'clock; I had never sat down to file at the board; these four spoons I had left loose, they were what I had been working upon; I put them in my pocket, as I usually do, and met my master at the door; I took them into the other room; my master called me down; I did not hear the first time; on my not hearing, the man came up, and said I was wanted; when I came down, he said, I have a suspicion that you have got something in your pocket of your master's; they searched my pocket, and found those filings; I declare to God I never knew I had them; it must be the carelessness of his boys, who take up the filings in the spoons to carry into the accompting-house; they are often playing with the spoons, and carry the filings in them, and whether they had been taking up the filings I cannot say; I never touched a thing before I touched these spoons; I did not find them as I left them, they were one in another when I put them into my pocket; the filings must be in some of them. This is the truth, if I was never to stir; I have worked forty years in the business, and was never under confinement, nor never impeached in my life; I worked for Mr. Lias five years ago.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer: I have four duplicates which the prosecutrix delivered to me; she and I went round to the pawnbrokers, and found this property, which I produce. (The property identified by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. (To the prosecutrix.) Q. Mrs. Calverley, did not you know that these things were in pawn before you broke open the door; I hope you will not take a false oath; she knew at the time the things were pledged? - A. I did not; if I had known it, I would not have suffered you to have taken them out of the house; I am a poor woman, I have a lame husband to support.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. At the time this happened I had two children to support; I had a friend of the name of Jackson, who paid the rent for a considerable time; he went away, and left me with the children; I worked for Mr. Rose, in Bishopsgate-street, and the work was very slack, I could not get any work to support my children; she gave me leave to pledge the things, provided, when I received the money from my brother in the country, I took them out; she said, get them out as soon as you can; the very night that I pledged the blanket she said so. Mr. Rose is out of town, or he would have come and spoke for me; my husband died at the time he worked for Mr. Rose; Mrs. Calverley said, if I would pay her four pounds, she would not prosecute me, otherwise she would punish me, - if it was possible to have me transported she would, without I gave her four pounds; my friends told her they would pay the money for me as far as the things were worth; it was not in my power to raise four pounds; she made answer they would not take less than four pounds, as they had brought it so far; I have got three small children.</p>

               <p>Q. How far was he carrying it off? - A. About two yards from the place where the hat was, he was still in the shop; I got up, and caught hold of him by the collar, and asked him what he was at; he dropped the hat, and began crying; I called out to Miss Swallow, my master's sister, who was in the next parlour; she locked both doors, and went up stairs to call a gentleman; at the time she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200036"/>was gone, he asked me to speak as well as I could for him; I held the boy till the gentleman came down; then he secured him till I went and fetched a constable; I am certain that is the boy, and this is my master's hat.</p>

               <p>Q. (To Procter.) Are you sure you saw the boy take the hat from where it was? - A. I am sure I saw him take it.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there any iron rails fixed to your house? - A. Yes, there were, on the 30th of January last; I was not at home at the time they were taken; they were there when I went out, which was about five o'clock in the evening, and when I returned, I had not been at home above ten minutes before Mrs. Thompson went to the door with a candle, and she missed the rails, and when I came to the door I found they were gone. While we were looking at the railing, there was a person came past, who is a witness, and from her information I went to the house <rs id="t18050220-39-deflabel234" type="occupation">kept by the prisoner, Cureton, an old iron-shop</rs>

I then took a candle, and insisted upon searching, as she denied having received any property; I looked round the shop, and the back place; I asked her if there was any other place; she then said to her son, go down stairs, and shew the gentleman; the son went with me down stairs, and when I was down stairs I conceived that I heard the rattling of iron bars. Upon that I immediately ran up stairs, and found Cureton coming from the side of the counter in the shop; it gave me suspicion that she was doing something there that was not right; I took the candle, and began to examine by the counter, and I pulled out several bags and baskets, and behind the whole there laid the irons all of a row; I then saw my railing; I then began to be warm, and I told her I certainly would punish her, if it was in my power; I got them away as fast as possible, and gave her in charge of the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know your rails again? - A. Yes; I found four, they are particular railing, and they are particularly painted.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer: In consequence of information that I received I went and secured Paterson, and brought him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the prosecutor.) What do you know of the man? - A. The constable had taken him to the watch-house; when I came to the watch-house about twelve o'clock, I did not know who he was, nor that he was taken up on my charge; after he was searched by the constable, he turned himself to Cureton, and said, what money did you give for them, - did not you say you gave seven shillings and sixpence; I will not be positive whether it was to the prisoner Cureton, or her son; I went out, and when I came in again the prisoner Paterson met me at the door, and said to me, Mr. Thompson, do not give charge of me, my dear fellow, I will do any thing in the world for you, I am a stone-mason, - I will put the railing down again, and I will put the stones to rights, if you will forgive me, I am sorry for what I have done; I said, no, I would prosecute him as far as the law would go; I asked him how he could think of taking them away; he replied that he did not know what he was doing of.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You never told us a word about this at first, till you were asked by my Lord. - When you first saw this man you did not tell him it would be better to tell the truth? - A. No, nothing like it.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard that he is a <rs id="t18050220-39-deflabel235" type="occupation">stone-mason</rs>

                        targets="t18050220-39-defend407 t18050220-39-deflabel235"/>? - A. I understood so.</p>
               <p>Q. He said he would put the railing and the stones to rights? - A. Yes, he did, over and over.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know these rails by some mark? - A. I can swear to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they different rails from all others? - A. There is not one in fifty like them.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you never saw any like them? - A. There are none like them in the neighbourhood; I know the neighbourhood very well, I have been there twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to Mrs. Cureton, she told you that which you have not told us, namely, that whoever brought these rails, brought them while she was in bed and sick, and she knew nothing at all about it? - A. She said she was in the other room.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not told us any thing about that - you bring new lights on the subject every minute. She said she was in the other room, and a man had thrown them in - she said so, did not she? - A. The son said that the mother received it at the time she was in the other room, and did not know what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she say, that when they were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200038"/>thrown in, she was in the other room, and very ill in bed? - A. She might, but it is a very little room, it is altogether like one; she might see as she lay in bed what passed in the other room.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see her in bed - you saw the bed-room? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing her to be lying in bed there, could she see what passed in the other room? - A. She might see if she would; if you covered her over she could not.</p>
               <p>Q. What is there particular in your railing that you know it by? - A. It is a particular railing, it screws into the wood-work, and fastens in the iron; I can swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Chinery.) Were you present - did you hear any thing pass between the prisoner and the prosecutor? - A. I heard Paterson beg very hard to Mr. Thompson not to make a charge of it, and he would refit the stones and railing; Mr. Thompson said he would prosecute as far as the law would allow; I took this bar, and it fitted the hole in the wood and the stone.</p>
               <p>Paterson's defence. I would have sooner given fifty pounds than it should have happened; I am as innocent of the crime as a child unborn.</p>
               <p>Cureton left her defence to her Counsel, and called five witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>
               <p>Paterson called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they both continue in your employment down to the 28th of January? - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. On that evening did Mr.

                  </persName>
             bring in any bag of feathers into your warehouse? - A. He came and gave some information, but did not bring the feathers; I saw him on the 29th, when he sent the bag of feathers by his porter; I believe one of the bags is the property of me and my partners; the feathers in these two bags were of various sorts, but principally Hudson's Bay feathers.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon this did you cause the prisoners to be apprehended? - A. Yes; I went with my solicitor on Wednesday to the Mansion-house, and on Thursday morning we had them apprehended at our warehouse; they were taken before the Lord-Mayor, and the bags likewise; after they were examined before the Lord-Mayor, Holmes said, I could not discover the loss; they found these there, and they were not taken down in stock, they were drivings.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these drivings in this paper? - A. Yes, they are worth a penny a pound, they are the mere refuse of the feathers; there is a larger refuse, called strippings, worth about the same value.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the feathers which you had before the Lord-Mayor, which Mr. Smith had brought you, at all like strippings or drivings? - A. Not at all; I should not hesitate giving two shillings a pound for them of any merchant, mixed as they are; Hudson's bay feathers are worth three shillings and threepence a pound, if they are not mixed.</p>
               <p>Q. After this examination before the Lord-Mayor, did you proceed to examine your stock to see if there was any deficiency? - A. Yes; we took stock on the 15th of January, and after the examination before the Lord-Mayor we took stock again, and the deficiency was between seventy and eighty pounds, but we deducted something from that, because a quantity had been cured - about twenty pounds, which is included in the first statement; then it makes the deficiency about fifty or sixty pounds. Mr. Smith brought us from forty to forty-five pounds, and a third at least, if not half, is Hudson's bay feathers, and we found a deficiency of twenty-seven pounds of Hudson's bay feathers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Drivings and strippings we understand to be the refuse of the feathers, and are never for sale - they are perquisites for the men? - A. I believe it is the case with some persons to allow it to the men, but we do not.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. I believe you keep a feather warehouse in Goswell-street? - A. Yes: On the evening of the 28th of January the prisoners at the bar brought two bags of feathers, and said they were drivings; when I looked at them I asked them if they were their perquisites; they said they were; I said, if it is a perquisite, it is a very good one; I said, what do you ask for them; they said, tenpence a pound; I knew Branbeed perfectly well, he worked at Messrs. Kent's, but the other I never saw in my life; I said, they are pretty good, I will give you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200039"/>nine-pence, the bargain was struck directly; we weighed them, the gross weight, with the bags, was fifty-six pounds, and then I said, what must we take off for the tare of the bags; Holmes said, I believe they must weigh ten pounds; I said, that is forty-six pounds, and forty-six pounds I paid for: I gave one pound fourteen shillings and sixpence to Holmes; he gave me change for a two pound note; I said, I am in a great hurry, I cannot empty them now; Holmes said, never mind bags, we have more bags than we know what to do with.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you suppose to be the value of them, when you bought them? - A. I looked upon it to be the perfect value of them at the time, from one bag, I never examined the other, I was in a great hurry to go out; I said, if they all answer to that I will give nine-pence a pound; I knew well that they were no drivings.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you give information to Messrs. Kent and Luck? - A. I was going to the other end of the town, but I thought it was necessary to go there first.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. These they said were drivings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew Branbeed before? - A. Yes; Holmes I had never seen; I have bought old drivings of Branbeed before, off old beds when he has come from gentlemen's houses.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a perquisite that is allowed? - A. I allow it to my men, some do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they come to dispose of it, as they told you? - A. I knew it was no drivings.</p>
               <p>Q. And, knowing this, you gave nothing near the value of them? - A. Quite the value, if they had been all like them I took out; when I came to examine them, I found Hudson's-Bay feathers in it.</p>
               <p>Q. You never opened the bag till after they were gone away, therefore, you took them, hoping they would turn out a better bargain? - A. I thought they were both alike, they said they were. (The bags of feathers produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. (To Prosecutor, looking at them.) Are they at all like drivings, or strippings? - A. They are not drivings nor strippings, the two samples are nearly of the same value; they are worth about two shillings a pound.</p>
               <p>Holmes left his defence to his Counsel.</p>
               <p>Branbeed's defence. When Mr. Holmes came to work at Mr. Kent's, he told me he agreed with him for a guinea a week, and he was to have the perquisites of the drivings from the feathers; I told him there was no such thing allowed since I had been there; he told me he agreed with him for it; I said, I was sure he was mistaken; about a fortnight after he had some, he asked me where I sold mine, that he allowed me; I told him at Mr.

               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to him about the White Horse? - A. No, he accosted me; I looked up the gateway, from that circumstance, I suppose.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

In the evening; I looked through the stable door, and watched him; he took a measure of corn in the sieve, and put it in the bag; it was a white bag; I saw him put oats in it; I went to my master's house to tell them to come; I saw him take the oats out of the bin; then I told the other boy; I went up to the stable with an excuse, and put some hay under Smiler; I felt the bag, and it felt like oats; I went and watched him after this, in the small-beer cellar; Kemp bid me good night; he went out in about half an hour, and came round the fields to the little shed, and uncovered it.</p>

             sworn. - On the 13th of this month in the evening, about half-past nine at night, she came into my house, the Goldsmiths' Arms, Bedfordbury, Covent Garden; a few days before that, she came into my house, about the same hour, and called for a pint of porter, and sat down in my house about half an hour or more; on her going away she said she could not drink all the beer; she would take what was remaining in the pot to No. 4, Turner's court, where she lived, and she would return the pot the next morning, about eight o'clock; the next morning she came in, and wanted half a pint of purl; I had no fire lighted, the young woman was then lighting it; she then said, as you have no fire, I will take it home and make it warm at my own apartment, and I will return the pots by and by; I gave her the half pint of purl, and took no more notice; I went over at the regular time to fetch my pots in, to this No. 4, and went to every apartment in the house, and no such person lived there then; on the 13th, a few days from that she came in the evening, and called for the pint of porter which I have mentioned; I knew the prisoner immediately; I

             the pint of porter and gave it her, and said, madam, you did not return those two pint pots which you had; yes, sir, says she, did not you get them; I said, how should I get them; she said she put them outside of the door, and very likely some other publican's servant had taken them away; I asked her to oblige me, and let me walk with her, to her apartment; she said, very well, I will go with you; after which I went into the parlour with a shilling's worth of brandy and water, and she absconded with the pot, though she was drinking her beer in the house; I went after her, and overtook her by the mouth of Turner's court; I then said to her, I will go with you and see if I can find my pots in the house; when she got into the court she did not know which way to turn, she stood a little time, and went into No. 1, I told her that was not the number she directed me to; here I live, says she, will you stop at the door till I go up stairs; I was a stranger in the neighbourhood; I kept close to the prisoner, and when she had got up a few stairs, I found a pint pot of mine on her; after finding the pot, she said, she would shew me where she sold the pots; as such I called upon my friend Mr. Perfect and he went with me and her, and by her direction I went to Akerman's house, an old iron-shop in Vine-street, Chandois-street, we went into Akerman's house, and enquired if he had any pots of Mr. Perfect's (he is a neighbour opposite to me) or Mr. White's, he was the publican I succeeded; he said he had no pots.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of Wilkins's? - A. Yes; two pint pots; after our persevering, he handed over two from behind the counter, the prisoner was present at the time; he said he had just received them from the prisoner, and gave her six-pence a pound for them; Mr. Wilkins's name was upon them both;

               <p>Q. You left the prisoner in the charge of Godsell? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Wilkins come with you to the prisoner's house? - A. Yes; when Mr. Wilkins came to Akerman's with me, he saw the man and the woman together, he told Akerman he could swear to that being his property, they said nothing; afterwards he took a candle and looked in the woman's face, he said he knew the woman and her friends, and as such would not prosecute; they remained in the hands of the constable, and were taken to the Magistrate; Mr. Wilkins was sent for by the Magistrate and bound over.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Wilkins said he would not prosecute, he knew her and her friends? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went to Akerman's you told her that your object was to take her as a witness; I ask you whether your object was not to prosecute the receiver and not the thief? - A. No, my object was to prosecute both.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. When you asked him if he had any pots, he immediately produced them? - A. He denied having them at first, after that he acknowledged to one; we after that searched more and found another.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they new? - A. They are the same as new.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing they were to be sold, they would be sold as second-hand pots? - A. They would be sold for the same as new, if a person was to succeed another.</p>
               <p>Q. They are not worth above a shilling? - A. I have not been in the habit of selling one, therefore I do not know.</p>

             sworn. - Mr. Forbes fetched me on the 13th of January, about nine o'clock at night; I went to Akerman's house, No. 2, Vine-street, Chandois-street, and in the parlour I saw two pint pots with the name of Wilkins on them; one old pint, half mutilated, and some solder melted down, and one as good as new; I asked the woman where she had got them; she made me no answer to that; she owned she had sold them for fivepence a piece; Akerman said he gave her sixpence a piece for them, and he begged for mercy, and hoped we would overlook it; while we were putting the things together, he absconded for about an hour, and his brother was in the parlour; I told the brother I understood the house belonged to him, and if he did not come back, he should stand in his shoes; his brother's wife then informed me, if I would not take her husband, she would go and see if she could find him, and he came back again. (Produces the pots.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are a constable? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Akerman before? - A. I had information of his house being a fence shop - a shop for buying swags.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is that? - A. Buying stolen property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did not the prisoner Akerman say that he had received them from Bethell, the other prisoner? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. And that he had bought them, and gave sixpence a piece for them, which he believed to be the value? - A. I cannot say that he said what was the value; he said that he gave sixpence a piece, and she said fivepence; his brother offered ten pounds to let him go. (The property identified by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>The prisoners did not say any thing in their defence.</p>
               <p>Bethell called three witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

She then said, you do not touch fire on Saturday, if you have a mind I will come and mind your fire; I said she might come; on Friday she stayed with me till very near eleven o'clock, and came on Saturday morning between eight and nine, and continued till half past five o'clock, and then she had her tea, and was going, she said, to a gentlewoman's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she paid any thing? - A. No; she said she would come back again at half past ten o'clock, if I would set up so long, and I sat up; I said to my little girl, after she was gone, Betsey, I wish you would get the shift, and I will mend it; she went into the shop, and could not find it; I told her it was very cold, and to get me my shawl, and she could not find the shawl; she said to me, have the other shawl, and when she went to get the other shawl it was gone; I said, it is very odd that what you looked for is gone. I got up in a passion, and looked on the line, and the first thing that I missed was a white bed-gown, and other articles; I know no person was in the place but this woman.</p>

             sworn. - I live with Mrs. Solomon: My mistress hung the shift over the back of the chair when she had done it, and when she told me to get it I could not find it, nor the shawl, and there was another shawl that my mistress lent me when I went to the dispensary with her, and that was gone; I saw the duplicates taken from her at the watch-house by the lantern-bearer, and he gave them to the constable; I was not present when the shawl was taken from her neck. (The property identified by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. (To the prosecutrix.) Q. You were to pay me half a crown from Thursday to Saturday? - A. No, it does not stand to reason I was to pay you that for two or three hours.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, as follows; -</p>
               <p>"My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, well knowing that it would not be in my power to speak in this awful place, but relying upon that humanity which is always shewn to a poor prisoner, I humbly lay my case before you, and I humbly hope to shew you that I am as innocent as a child unborn. I went some weeks ago into Mr. Solomon's shop to sell a few bad shillings, for which I got a penny; his wife was washing; she asked me if I knew any person that would wash a few things for her; I told her I went out to wash; I washed her clothes for her, and when I had done Mrs. Solomon begged that I would stay to stir the fire and snuff the candles; I was there on Friday, and staid till eleven o'clock at night; I then went on Saturday morning at eight o'clock, and staid all day. In the evening I told her I wanted to go to St. James's, and I told her I would thank her to pay me, which was half a crown; she promised to pay me half a crown, but told me to call the next day, as the never paid any money on her sabbath; I told her I wanted the money; she told me then to take a shift, which she gave me out of the shop, and to pawn it to pay myself, but I told her it would not pawn for half a crown; she then gave me a shawl, and the other shawl she lent me; I was stopped near a place where I was going to by her husband, and he said I had stole them; I leave it to your Lordship.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the prosecutrix.) Did you tell her to take the shawl and the shift? - A. No, I am certain I did not; I have a little girl that runs of my errands, and she knows I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Robins.) Did you hear any conversation about paying her for the work she had done? - A. My mistress said she would satisfy her when it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200046"/>done, she could not before; she then said it was only a few halfpence; she gave her threepence and a dinner that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when she went away - did you hear your mistress say she might take any thing to pay herself? - A. No, I am confident to the contrary.</p>

               <p>Q. Was your comrade there then? - A. No, he was gone, and the prisoner too; I inquired about the bundle, but I could not hear any thing about it at the alehouse. I went to the landlord, and from what he said to me I searched for the prisoner, and found him the next evening; he denied seeing any thing of the bundle; by persuasions I brought him up to the same public-house; he denied every thing; the constable took him into custody that evening, and the next morning at eleven o'clock he confessed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your things again? - A. The boot-tops and the spencer I got by the prisoner's directions; I found the spencer at Isaac's shop, near St. Giles's; the prisoner told me he flung the sword-belts away, and the boot-tops I found at a porter's that lives at a bottle warehouse.</p>
               <p>- ISAACS sworn. - Q. Look at the prisoner - did you ever see him before? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you purchase that spencer of any body? - A. I bought it of a man for a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. What man? - A. I could not take any notice of the man, I had a country-dealer in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times did this man come to your shop? - A. Twice; he asked me three shillings, and I bid him a shilling; I locked my door, and went up stairs, as I had a country-dealer there.</p>
               <p>Q. Although this man came twice, you took no notice of him? - A. I was in a hurry, I had a country-dealer, I was obliged to have my goods packed up for him immediately; I had no person in the house but myself, my wife was out.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the spencer? - A. The officer has got it.</p>

               <p>Q. Is there any private mark on them? - A. One has got my name on it, the other has not; I believe them both to be mine; they are both the same sort of boys hats that I lost that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in charge when you went to him? - A. Yes; the prisoner signified then that a woman gave them to him, and she was to give him something for pawning them.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the two hats? - A. Two shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming from my work with my tools on my shoulder; I met a woman that asked me to pawn these things, and she said she would give me a shilling, so I went into this pawnbroker's shop to pawn them, and he said he would not take any hats in to pawn.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you find them afterwards? - A. In Red-lion-street, about twenty minutes after I had lost them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner in the public-house? - A. Yes, when I first came in; she came in with a pie-man, whom she called her husband, she was in the house about an hour, and I staid in there an hour and a half; when I came out of the public-house, I saw her in Red-lion-street, she was at a stand, and two watchmen with her; I saw the candlesticks in her apron, and I marked them by desire of the watchmen.</p>
               <p>- sworn. - I am a constable: I was at the watch-house at the time when the prisoner was brought in.</p>
               <p>Q. When she came into the watch-house did you search her? - A. Yes; I found these six iron candlesticks in paper, and these seven shirts in her lap.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give any account of them? - A. The woman was very drunk, I believe she did not know what she was doing. (The candlesticks produced, and identified by the prosecutor).</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the woman? - A. No; I have heard she follows selling clothes in Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I knew nothing of the candlesticks no more than of my dying-day; I really did not know that I had them.</p>

             sworn. - I am a linen-
draper, No. 202, High-street, Shadwell.</p>


               <p>Q. Look at those stockings. - Do you know them? - A. I am sure I never sold them; I know they are mine, by my private mark; I missed these stockings and a few others at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes, I have known him some time; he came to my house frequently as a visitor, he called in as he was passing by; I have known him about a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what employ he was in at that time? - A. He was in a situation in Ratcliff-highway during some part of the time, but the latter part he has been out of a situation.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first discover these stockings at the house of Mrs. Watson, where the prisoner lodged? - A. On the Saturday night prior to the Monday morning he was apprehended: Mrs. Watson called upon me for me to tell her where to find the prisoner, and in the course of conversation I received the information.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How the stockings got from your shop you do not know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you to say, you have known this person a twelvemonth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you had a good opinion of him, else you would not have suffered him to have visited you? - A. About a month before he was taken up, I had a good opinion of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You have many cotton stockings in your shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had sold a great many before this time? - A. Not cotton stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. That had your private mark upon them? - A. I have not; I cannot swear for my wife, sometimes she serves; I dare say she will swear that she has not.</p>
               <p>Q. And sometimes somebody else? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It is no uncommon thing for you to sell them to your customers that deal with you, you deliver them over with your private mark? - A. These are different stockings, these have got a clock; I had but half a dozen pair of stockings of that make in the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. I see you have got the clock upon me now, but that will not do; will you swear that neither you nor your wife had not sold a pair of clock stockings prior to October? - A. I will not.</p>

               <p>Q. For what purpose did he come into your shop? - A. I had known him for some time, and he used frequently to call in and stop half an hour or an hour; when he had been in about five minutes, I had occasion to go out, but I returned in again in about five minutes, and then the prisoner was standing outside of the shop-door; when I went in my brother informed me something; I went to the prisoner, who was standing at the door, I took his hat off his head, and found ten shawls in the crown of his hat; I then sent for a constable, and had him taken into custody.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say any thing at the time? - A. He pleaded very much to me to let him go; he told me it was entirely distress that drove him to it. (Produces the property.)</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know them to be your's? - A. They are new shawls with my private mark on them; they were in my shop ten minutes before I left my shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You have known him some time? - A. I have, about two years.</p>
               <p>Q. You have know him in very good situations? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen these shawls? - A. I do believe I had seen these shawls ten minutes before I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not take your private mark off when you sell them? - A. I do not.</p>

               <p>Q. What were you employed about? - A. I had occasion to go behind some furniture for something, and I saw the prisoner take some shawls from a shelf in the shop, and he put them into the crown of his hat, and he went to the step of the door; as soon as my brother came in I told him; then my brother went up to him, and he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have been in the habit of buying shawls of different people, and likewise stockings; some gentlemen are here that will prove that I have bought both shawls and stockings of them.</p>

               <p>Q. What happened to you as you were going along together? - A. He seemed to keep behind me; I called to him to come up to me, as I had walked a little way before him; he said, aye, aye, I am coming, and when I looked round again, I did not see him; I called him by name, he did not answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bag tied up? - A. Yes; the next day after I heard he was hanging out at Rosemary-lane, and the next morning I found him at the Three Kings, in White's yard, Rosemary-lane; he had then a shirt and jacket of mine on his back.</p>
               <p>Q. What house did you take him into? - A. The Old Fountain, in Rosemary-lane; there I gave charge of him to the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing? - A. He said nothing in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to the prisoner? - A. No farther than I gave the description of the shirt and jacket, and when it was examined it had the particular marks on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you had not engaged him for a seaman? - A. I tendered him, but they would not accept him; they said he was a good for nothing old man.</p>

               <p>Q. Describe the manner in which you first observed her? - A. The next shop to Mr. Powdich's is a print shop; she went and looked into Mr. Powdich's shop-window, to see whether the young men were engaged, and seeing they were engaged, she took one of the pieces of print that were on the horse at the door, and put it under her cloak, and went round the corner of Middle-row with it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it? - A. About twelve o'clock; I went immediately down stairs into the shop, and told my brother; he immediately went after her; she was brought back almost immediately; my brother brought her back in about three minutes to Mr. Powdich's shop; I went over, and saw my brother open her cloak, and then she gave him the print.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what was said? - A. She said, provided they did not punish her, she was willing to make any recompense.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw her before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it is the same woman you saw taking the print? - A. Yes, there was no other person near Mr. Powdich's door; there were people looking at the print-shop next door, but not near Mr. Powdich's door that she looked in.</p>

I had no intention to take the barrow off the premises; it was of no use to me; I was out in the evening with some friends, before I came to Fulham; I stopped later than I should, I was tired, and went to sit down in the barrow in Mr. Howell's ground; I went to pitch it farther, as the people were coming in to get ready to go to market, and finding it cold there, I pushed it farther into the ground, and where there was no place to take it out; if I had meant to take the barrow, should not I have brought it out the same way as I went in, there being no other way; my husband's friends and the gardeners can make laws among themselves; if they like a person, they will give him any thing, but my husband's friends wish to send me out of the land, and the reason why I appeared in men's apparel (as has been stated by my husband's friends) is, that I being able to execute the work of a <rs id="t18050220-62-deflabel369" type="occupation">gardener</rs>

               <p>- DOYLE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Clifton.</p>
               <p>Q. You are shopman to Mr. Allenby, a linen draper in Fleet-street? - A. I am; on the 4th of February the prisoner at the bar accompanied with another person with a light countenance, and about the same size, he might be taller; they inquired if we sold silk handkerchiefs; to which I told them, no; they then said, do you sell Irish cloth; to which I answered in the affirmative, they then said they would call in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they purchase any thing then? - A. No; about six o'clock in the evening one of the men who had been with me in the morning (not the prisoner) called, and looked out a piece of Irish cloth, and fourteen yards of calico, and desired them to be sent to the Castle and Falcon, Aldersgate-street; and desired me not to be more than a quarter of an hour, for they were going away immediately in a post-chaise; I went with the goods myself, with the direction he gave, which was, Mr. Morgan, Castle and Falcon, Aldersgate-street; when I got to the Castle and Falcon, I met the prisoner at the bar in the passage; he said to me, you have got the parcel for my brother, Mr. Morgan, to which I answered, yes; he then said you must go back and fetch the other piece of Irish that he looked at, (holding out his hands to take the parcel); in consequence of that I hesitated about the delivery of the parcel; upon that he said, O you may deliver it at the bar, which I did, at the same time desiring the girl to take care of it till I returned; I then went out but I was not satisfied with the first message I had given, I returned and gave her a second caution, and I said, you are not to deliver it to any person that was with me, or any one else except myself, it is my property; I told her to keep it till I returned; in consequence of that I went home for the other piece of cloth, and on my return I found they were gone.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You left the prisoner at the Castle and Falcon, and when you returned the cloth was gone; and you did not see the prisoner? - A. No, and the parcel was gone; there were twenty-six yards of Irish cloth, at 4 s. 6 d. a yard, that makes 5 l. 17 s. and fourteen yards of printed calico, at 4 s. 6 d. a yard; it altogether came to 9 l.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You left that under the care of the bar-woman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And under her direction? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did either of them speak to you? - A. The man of a light complexion spoke to me, and said, Mr. Kay, there will be a parcel come for my brother (pointing to the prisoner) which you will be good enough to take care of; I answered him, it should be taken care of for him; but not being certain of the name in the first instance, I followed them, by saying, did you say Morgan? one of them answered, which I think was the prisoner; he said, yes; they were going into the coffee-room to take some brandy and water.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner at the bar hear what the other person said to you? - A. Yes, he must, they were close together; the prisoner at the bar shook his head in this way (describing it), as a person does when he arrives from a long journey, to adjust his hair.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have paid for the parcel? - A. I have promised to pay for it.</p>

No, I saw him three weeks after that at Pimlico; I said nothing to him; but went to the Bag of Nails, where he had slept a night or two till Mrs. Evans got the lodging ready: and I told the publican, my husband went and took him at a public-house; he was obliged to take him by the collar, he was unwilling to come.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I asked this lady for a lodging, she said she would get it ready on the Monday following; I had been to get work of Mr. Bramin, and if I could have got work of him, I should have gone to her lodging, but Mr. Clark, whom I was to work for, told me I might sleep with his boy; I never saw the place after the time I went away; I went back to her, and told her I would have come to her lodging but I had this offer; I am as innocent as a child unborn; when the child was examined at the Office, she had not a word to say but what the mother put in her mouth.</p>

            : On Friday, the 25th of January, I was standing in my master's shop, about a quarter past five in the evening; the prisoner at the bar came up to the shop; I had lit up one candle and went to get another, and the prisoner not seeing any body in the shop he took up a goose and put it under his jacket; with that I went after him, and when he saw me coming after him, he took to his heels and ran; I called out, stop thief; then he pulled out the goose from under his jacket and threw it from him; I am positive of the man, he was never out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he from the shop to where he was stopped by any body? - A. About twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him throw it away? - A. A young man picked it up, and gave it to the officer.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence, but called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar, Mary Mead? - A. Only from her coming to buy half a pound of candles, on the 5th of February, about nine o'clock in the evening; when she came in, she said she wanted half a pound of eights candles; I handed her the candles, and she gave me a seven-shilling piece; I carried the seven-shilling piece to my mistress, and I said to her, that woman is a strange customer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the seven-shilling piece? - A. I did not take particular notice of it; my mistress gave me four shillings, and five sixpences.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing remarkable about the shillings or sixpences? - A. One of the shillings was bent one way only, the others were flat, and the sixpences likewise; I gave the silver and a halfpenny to the prisoner, and half a pound of candles, which made up the seven-shilling piece; when she had got the candles, she said she never gave more than ninepence a pound for the candles; I said I could not sell them for less than elevenpence a pound; she took up one shilling and laid it down again; I took up the money, the four shillings and the five sixpences back again; upon her saying that, I supposed it to be the same; I did not look at it; I took it to my mistress; my mistress found the bad shilling; then I took the bad shilling back to her; I said she had changed one of my mistress's shillings; she began to stutter, and could not give me a plain answer; she was like as though she had an impediment in her speech.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with that shilling you brought from your mistress? - A. I laid it on the counter, and was sent out for an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know enough of that shilling, which you brought from your mistress the first time, bent as you described, and the shilling that your mistress complained of, how was that bent? - A. The shilling that I first gave her was bent one way only, whereas this was bent two ways; the officer has that shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. You fetched the constable did you? - A. Yes, his name is Kinnersley; he took her into the private room to search her; the constable called me, he thought he heard something fall from her; I looked, and I found a shilling by the right-hand corner of the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a shilling was it? - A. The same shilling that was passed on me, and was changed for my good one.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Was the good shilling found on this woman afterwards? - A. No, it was found in her mouth.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Do you know whether the four shillings are good or not? - A. My mistress looked at them particularly; I did not; I took them from her as good ones.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you take notice of them at all particularly? - A. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there any marks about any of your shillings? - A. Yes; one was a bent shilling, bent all one way.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the four shillings all good ones? - A. Yes, I am quite sure they were; and so were the sixpences; I saw Clayton take the change to her; the partition between the back room and shop is glass; he came back almost immediately to me, with four shillings and five sixpences.</p>

While he was gone, she told me she did not think it was a bad shilling; I told her it was, and that it was not the shilling that I gave her; she asked me to let her look at it, and I gave it to her, and she put it into her mouth, I observed two shillings in her mouth; and after she had put this shilling into her mouth she laid me down my own shilling again, and said, I do not think it is a bad one; I told her, no, that was not, for that was the shilling that I had given to her; then the officer came, and he saw it.</p>

               <p>- KINNERSLY sworn. - Q. Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a constable: I was sent for on the 5th of February, I went, and saw the prisoner in the shop, I was informed that she was a woman that passed bad money; I took her into a back room, I told her I must search her, I searched both her pockets; she stood with her left side towards the fire, and she put her left hand up to her mouth and chucked something into the fire, upon which, I heard the found of money; I immediately called for assistance, and Clayton came in, as there was no other person in the room but myself, I was positive there was money of some sort, either in the ashes or in the fire; Clayton looked in the ashes under the fire-place and could not peceive any thing; I said look in the fire, he found this shilling in it, and he took it out with the fire-tongs, and delivered it to me, I have had it in my custody ever since; I searched her every where but found no bad money: she had half-a-guinea, a seven-shilling-piece, and three-pence, and some soap, the money was good, and marked with a Y; she was very insolent and saucy at first, afterwards she behaved very well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Have you searched a great many for uttering bad money? - A. Yes, three before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find half-a-guinea, and a good many seven-shilling-pieces on their persons? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor will you ever in your life again. -</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Clayton.) Q. Is that the shilling that you took out of the fire? - A. It is; and it is the shilling that I took to my mistress the second time with the change.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Prosecutrix.) Q. Look at that shilling; Is that the shilling that was brought to you by the last witness? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Clayton.) Q. You know it by its colour, do not you? - A. I know it by taking it out of the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. The question is whether this is the shilling that you took to your mistress from the prisoner, and you know it by its colour? - A. I know it by its being bent.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know it by the colour? - A. It was not of this colour at first.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Kinnersly.) Q. Have you not got another shilling? - A. Yes; I should have produced it, but it was not called for; I received this from Clayton. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. (To Clayton.) Is that the shilling that you received from your mistress, being one of the four shillings? - A. That is the self-same shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Prosecutrix.) Look at that shilling, and tell me whether that is one of the four shillings that you gave to Clayton? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Mr. Franklin.) Q. Is that a good shilling? - A. That is doubtful.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. (Read in Court.) My Lord, and gentlemen of the Jury. Unfortunately situated as I am, in such a perilous situation, I have not the least fear or doubt of hearing the voice of the Jury say not guilty, instead of the contrary; you are, gentlemen of the Jury, to decide in my case, and that which I am charged with in my indictment you will see cannot be supported; namely, that I came into the prosecutrix's shop, to utter a bad shilling, knowing it to be so, when the contrary is the case, as hereafter I shall prove, by a fair representation of simple facts. On the evening stated in the indictment I went into the prosecutrix's shop to purchase some candles, for which I tendered a seven-shilling piece; the boy took it into the parlour; when the change was produced by the boy, I found that I was charged more for the candles than I could purchase them for elsewhere, the difference being only one penny, and the boy would not take any less than he asked for them by the pound. It is here to be observed, that I never refused any part of the change, nor, to the best of my recollection, had I any reason to do so; the prosecutrix came out of the parlour, and she said that I returned to her a shilling that she did not send out from the parlour to me, and she added that I was in the habit of so doing; I said, I would be very happy to have the charge investigated; upon which the prosecutrix sent for the constable; he declared it was all good; she ordered the constable to take and search me, and I, conscious of my innocence of the charge, readily submitted, the result of which was, that I had no bad money about me, nor any less money than the seven-shilling piece for the purchase of the candles,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200057"/>but there was a half-guinea and a seven-shilling piece found on me, which I had when I went into the prosecutor's shop, and which was returned to me as being good and lawful coin. Now, gentlemen, what case they could find to ground my indictment upon, I declare to God I know not. They should have had the whole of the change brought into Court, and you would have heard the result of its examination, to see whether any part of such change was bad; this is a material part of my defence. On my examination at the Mansion-House, I understood they intended to support the charge against me, though I am ignorant upon what ground. The constable said, that, during the time he was searching me, he heard something that jingled, or made a noise like money, in the fireplace, and he called the prosecutrix's boy to search for it; and between the constable and the boy they found or produced a piece of burnt metal of some sort, which they said was the same that I uttered to the prosecutrix, which was impossible, and which the following facts will contradict: for the change which I received from the prosecutrix she had returned to her, though she said it was not the same she sent out; but the transaction proved it otherwise, as she had the change examined by the constable, the consequence of which was, he said it was all good; and she had the full change previous to the finding of this piece of metal, that she, the prosecutrix, nor any one else could identify, and for which I am at present indicted for my life; my prosecutrix was satisfied that I had returned to her all the change, and it was good. Upon these facts, I rest assured you will find me not guilty, which an English Jury, I trust, will; and I, as in duty bound, shall ever pray.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me pick your pocket? - A. I saw you pick my pocket, and I saw you put it into your breast.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see my hand in your pocket? - A. I could not see behind me; I felt your hand in my pocket.</p>

             sworn. - Q. What do you know of this transaction? - A. I was coming up Tooley-street, about a quarter past three o'clock, and heard the cry of stop thief; the first man I met was the prisoner at the bar, at the corner of the White Horse, in Tothill-street; I pursued him, and when I got about twenty or thirty yards in the court, I saw him put his hand into his bosom and throw away a handkerchief into a green-grocer's shop; the woman of the shop picked it up immediately, and gave it to me over the hatchway; he was stopped, and the gentleman came up and claimed the handkerchief, and he asked me to get an officer; I went to Union-hall and brought an officer, and that gentleman gave charge of him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. Please your honour, I was coming over the bridge, on Thursday evening, about a quarter after three; I was going to meet a waggon with some flour, and saw the handkerchief lying on one of the seats on the bridge; I did not know who it belonged to any more than any gentleman who sits here; so soon as this gentleman saw me put it into my bosom, he sung out, stop thief; I am as innocent as either of the gentlemen of the Jury that sits round there; I am not guilty of any thing of the kind, I never did see who it belonged to, nor I never saw the gentleman's pocket.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a master smith; I have been these thirty years; I live at No. 77, High-street, Shadwell: On the 29th of January, about one o'clock in the day, I had been to see what my men were doing, and opposite to the White Hart, Queen-street, I saw a coal waggon first and a cart behind it; I saw the prisoner Clark take a sack of coals from the left side of the tail of the waggon and run across the way into the White Hart public-house; I went round to the front of the waggon to see who they belonged to, and saw Mr. Copous's name on it; I then saw Swift, he was beginning to tie up the rope a little tighter at the tail of the waggon; I then told Swift I had seen what was done and I would not pass it; he said he knew nothing of what had been done; I then went into the public-house and the first I saw was the prisoner Clark; he had just got rid of the sack, and was going to drink; I did not see the sack again, it was all instantly done; I said to him, my friend, I have seen what you have done, and I will not suffer it; he said, in answer, what have I done; I said, I saw you take a sack of coals out of the tail of that waggon and bring them into this house, to which he made no reply; the woman prisoner, Powell, as I supposed then, was the landlady of the house; she was near enough to hear what I had said to Clark; she stood at the left hand of the bar; I immediately turned round to her and said, madam, I have seen that man bring a sack of coals from the tail of that waggon now standing opposite the door, into this house, and I will not suffer it; I will go immediately and acquaint Mr. Copous? she said she knew nothing about any coals; upon that I immediately quitted the house, it was all momentarily done, I was not half a minute after Clark in the public-house, and the woman prisoner I found in the tap-room, standing still, she must have seen the coals; I then went to Mr. Copous's house and informed the clerk; his clerk went up with me immediately; we did not go into the house; the waggon and the cart had removed, but not out of sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Powell, the landlord of the house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You took no pains to see whether he was at home or not? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a passage through this house to an alley that leads to the wharf? - A. There is.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that Mrs. Powell must have seen the situation she was in, if she was there? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. But whether she was there when the coals were put down it is not possible for you to say? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. She was attending to different persons who were calling for liquor? - A. She was standing still.</p>
               <p>Q. There were several persons in the tap-room,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200059"/>it was her business to attend them? - A. I did not know she was the landlord's wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Why you do not understand the question; were there not a number of people in the taproom, and was it not her business to attend them? - A. I think I have got intellects; certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she standing at the time the waggoner deposited the coals; that you do not know? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you return to the house and search for any coals, as soon as any information was given? - A. I did nothing about it till Mr. Copous came up, about six o'clock in the evening.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner at the bar use to deliver to you his accounts once a fortnight? - A. Yes, of monies received by him, on account, to Mr. Copeland.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got his account-book? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it appear, on the 6th of October, that he received any money from Mr. Locke, of the sum of 5 l. 13 s. 8 d. is there any receipt of any money received from Mr. Locke? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the hand-writing of the prisoner? (shews him a paper) - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. You settled with him once a fortnight? - A. I do not; the cashier, Mr. Stephenson, receives the money, and I settle the accounts of the book.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. In the prisoner's book is there any account of any money received on the 6th of October? - A. There is none received on the 6th of October, but there is money paid by him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Is there any account of money received on the 5th of October? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you always ask him, when you settled, whether there was any money to be brought to account? - A. Yes, several times, and he always said, no.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. October 8th, whose hand writing is this, received six pounds? - A. That memorandum is my writing; this was an account of his own wages, and sundry expences paid by him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you constantly in the habit of asking him whether he had received any money, regularly every fortnight? - A. I cannot say that I did every time, but at sundry times I have done so.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first entertain any suspicion that he had received any money of Mr. Locke? - A. On his last settlement that we had on account of his wharfage; I asked him myself whether he had received any money for wharfage, in consequence of my sending the bill in, the man brought the receipt; he denied receiving the 5 l. 13 s. 8 d. of Mr. Locke; I had told him I should send round, and I did, and Mr. Locke came with his receipt; this was on the 19th of January, he mentioned one sum of Mr. Stapleton, and that is the only one he mentioned, and that was for wharfage.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you on that day happen to be in your shop when he came back from Mr. Hutchinson to your shop for some meat for him? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what he said? - A. I do not indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver to him, or was any meat delivered to him, to take to Mr. Hutchinson? - A. I cannot say, the business I do; I cannot say I am sure.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You do not know whether you sell a pound of meat in a week or not? - A. I only know I sell a great deal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You have a daughter that makes out your bills? - A. My daughter is the only person that makes out all my bills.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive from him, after he had been to Mr. Hutchinson's, (supposing he had been there) the sum of 17 s. 2 d.? - A. No, by no means.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You do not know that any meat at all was delivered to Mr. Hutchinson from the prisoner? - A. Oh, dear me, to be sure I do not; I should be very wrong if I said so I am sure; I declare I do not.</p>
               <p>- HUTCHINSON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Do you live in his Majesty's house at Kew? - A. I do; Mr. Newman is my butcher.</p>

               <p>Q. You have a bill in your hand which will tell you the date? - A. Yes; on the 12th of January.</p>
               <p>Q. You see the last article in that bill is dated the 12th of January? - A. That makes me remember that a shoulder of mutton was brought to me when he first brought the bill with the meat, it amounted to 11 s. 10 d. I ordered him to take the bill back and bring a receipt to the bill, the bill having no receipt, and to bring a shoulder of mutton, and include that in the bill; he came, I think, the next day, with the shoulder of mutton, and the bill as it now stands; when he brought the shoulder of mutton, that was the day I paid him, and he brought the receipt that is now with it; I paid him 17 s. 10 d.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was it 17 s. 10 d. or 17 s. 2 d.? - A. 17 s. 10 d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. You have no recollection of this transaction except as you derive it from that bill - was this the last bill you ever paid? - A. This is the last bill I ever paid him; I recollect having some conversation with him; he brought the bill without a receipt the first time he brought it, and when I paid him, I paid him 17 s. 10 d. I told him I would not pay him without the receipt, and when he brought the receipt, I recollect paying it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. What age are you? - A. I am in my eighty-seventh year.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You assist in your father's business? - A. I do, I make out his bills.</p>
               <p>Q. Just look at that bill - is any part on that bill your hand-writing? - A. The three first articles, the 11 s. 10 d. is my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the last article 5 s. 4 d. for the shoulder of mutton your hand-writing? - A. It is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the words at the bottom of the receipt, paid, P. Newman, your hand-writing? - A. It is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner at the bar coming back to you for a shoulder of mutton? - A. I cannot say I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring you back 17 s. 2 d. or any other sum of money, from Mr. Hutchinson? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you mean to say that he brought you no part, not even the 11 s. 10 d.? - A. Not any.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you, either on that day, or on any other day, ask him any questions respecting the money from Mr. Hutchinson? - A. I asked him if Mr. Hutchinson had paid him any money, he said, no.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that after he had taken in that bill of 11 s. 10 d.? - A. I cannot say that I did ask him about that bill.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after the delivery of that bill was he taken up? - A. About a fortnight after; I do not remember having any conversation with him about it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You do not remember the shoulder of mutton being delivered to him? - A. I cannot say that I do.</p>
               <p>Q. You sent him out for orders, and when he came home you took minutes in your book of those orders? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got that book here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, in fact, you do not know of any of these things being delivered? - A. I believe them to be delivered.</p>
               <p>Q. This fact is clear, that the goods and the shoulder of mutton were delivered; whether delivered from your shop or another shop, that is another thing - Did you ever see the prisoner write? - A. I cannot swear to that writing, I have seen him write.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Prosecutor.) How soon did you discover this last bill of Mr. Hutchinson having been paid to the prisoner? - A. I should think in about two weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you question him about the subject? - A. Some trifle my son did, he never denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him it would be better if he would tell you? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. There is not sufficient evidence to go to a Jury upon the delivery of the articles themselves; there is no proof at all of any of the articles coming from their shop, only that they were delivered to Mr. Hutchinson by this person.</p>
               <p>Court. There is certainly a point which I do not take upon myself to decide in the Court; and though I should be clearly of your opinion, and in favour of the prisoner, yet it is a point of so much consequence to the public, perhaps the discussion of it may do a great deal of harm; I will take the opinion of the Jury upon that fact - the delivery of the goods.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. That is a fact, the delivery of the goods.</p>

I cannot describe the noise any other way than it was a little noise; I went to see what it was, and I observed a hand coming through a hole of the window; the window had been broken for a week before that, but the piece had been fastened with putty; I saw the same hand draw through the hole a snuffer tray: I immediately ran out and secured the prisoner.</p>

             sworn. - On the 30th of January I was in Rupert-street, as soon as I got into Rupert-street I heard the alarm of stop thief, I was coming out of St. Martin's lane into West-street.</p>

               <p>Q. When you heard the cry of stop thief, did you see any body? - A. There was one gentleman before me; I made towards the noise of the boy, and as I made towards him I saw a man crossing the street, he had something under his arm, I could not see then what it was, I mended my way towards him and kept him in my sight; he was running the same side as I was; as soon as I got up to him I laid hold of him; he had something under his arm, and when he found that I would not let him go, he threw the parcel on the flags.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw that, did you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep him fast? - A. I kept him fast for a little time, till at last he threw himself out of my arms.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any body come up while he was beating you? A gentleman that was behind me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who that gentleman was? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. How far up Rupert-street were you from Coventry-street - were you half way up from Coventry-street? - A. No, not so much as that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he coming up Coventry-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As soon as you got into Rupert-street, you have just said, that first you seized the prisoner, he struggled with you, he got away, and you then seized him a second time? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the witness Chaunt? - A. His wife came to me last night, and said that her husband was very uneasy about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation with Chaunt himself, at his own house? - A. I was there, and when I went there he told me himself, that he was the same day down enquiring for me, on the former part of the day; he said, we have been to day with the bill, and we have not found it; he said, if you come to morrow morning, before eight o'clock, and give me ten pounds and a pair of boots, as you are in the shoemaking line, I wish to make a flaw in the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that? - A. When we went with the officer to find the bill; he said, we know how to make a flaw in it, if not, his life lies in my hands; I said, I cannot positively say I shall be with you in the morning.</p>

Yes, and his wife did call last night; his wife was with me on Monday night, and last night his wife called about seven o'clock in the evening at my house; I was with him last night was a week, and then he said he should expect sixteen pounds, after that, he said he would take twelve pounds; he said the parish that he was taken in gives twelve pounds, and there was a forty pound reward; there were two people with me heard him say, that if he should be convicted he should be entitled to forty pounds; he said the boy saw nothing about it, nor knows nothing about it, it all lies to me.</p>
               <p>Q Are you sure that passed from him to you about the forty pounds and the twelve pounds? - A. Upon my oath; he cannot deny it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When did you first know any thing of Chaunt? - A. When the prisoner sent to me, and told me he was in trouble; that was the first time that I knew any thing about it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you offer to give him any thing? - A. No, it was his own words.</p>

               <p>Q. I want to know what you went after him first for? - A. To hear what the man had done, I was entirely a stranger to the business; then in invited me to come up there.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of the note with which she paid you? - A. I took notice of the note with which she paid me; it was quite a new one.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any marks by which you should know it again? - A. There was small writing on the back, but I did not particularly observe it; I did not look much where the writing was; there was K. B. between the Britannia and the two; it was signed Phillips.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the note? (handing it to her) - A. That is the note which I took of her.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with that note when you had taken it of the prisoner? - A. I put it into the till which we usually keep money in immediately; I saw it again on Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she come? - A. On the Saturday night the 22d of December, as is my usual custom, I took the money out of the till on Saturday night, and on Sunday morning Mr. Page discovered this to be a bad note.</p>

               <p>Q. You discovered on Sunday morning it was a bad note? - A. No, Mr. Page discovered it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to pass it to Mr. Lewis, you understanding it to be a bad one? - A. I keep a pocket book with notes for payment, I had put this with the rest and passed it without any intention.</p>
               <p>Q. You passed it to Mr. Lewis? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that on Sunday morning, your husband knew that it was a bad note? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200066"/>Q. This transaction took place between you and the prisoner on Saturday night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is generally the busiest night for pawnbrokers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q Therefore, of necessity, you take more money then than on other days? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. There is more money taken on Saturday in your house than on other days? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was not she looking at the same articles as the prisoner? - A. No, she was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say whether she was in company with her or not? - A. I do not know, they went out at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Some few minutes past before you took the note, you had no suspicion that it was a bad one, or else you would not have taken it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not write upon the note at the time you took it? - A. I did not; I made an observation that there was K. B. upon it and signed by the name of Philips.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a great many other bank-notes? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say this bank-note was never out of your possession, till you gave it to Mr. Lewis; do you mean to say that you are accurate in that? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. How came your husband to say it was a bad note? - A. I took the money out of the till on the Saturday night, and on Sunday it is our usual custom to look it over, I sat by when he looked over the cash, it was all put together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you make your husband your cashier? - A. No, I keep the money myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you collect your money every Saturday, or every night, or do you do it once a week? - A. We do not keep any account of the sale-shop, the pawnbroker's shop is kept separate.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you account with your husband oftener than once a week? - A. I never account with him at all, I keep it myself in general, and if he wants any I give it him.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he look over your money more than once a week? - A. More particularly on the Sunday, because he has more time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner been in your shop upon any accident happening to one of the wires of the ear-rings? - A. Yes, she brought it back; at the time they were sold they were supposed to be correct, and they were to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner, shortly after, in the same night, return and tell you one was a broken wire, and desire you to change it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q How long after? - A. Within a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she advance you some ready money to induce you to change the wire? - A. She gave me sixpennyworth of halfpence.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Had not you taken any other 2 l. note? - A. Upon my word I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put it with others? - A. Not till I looked at it.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you put it with the others? - A. There might be others, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bosanquet. Q. Was there any other 2 l. note whatever marked K.B. or signed Philips, in that part of the drawer in which you put that note? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no other note marked K.B. and signed Philips? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to give it to Mr. Lewis? - A. I gave it inadvertently; he purchased some things of me, and gave me a 5 l. note, for which I had to give him 3 l. 6 s. he said I should like to have your name upon it; Mr. Page came into the shop, and he said, be so good as to put your name upon it; then I desired his address, and W.P. was put upon the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the note? - A. This is the note; there is the W.P. that was marked by Mr. Page before it was given to Mr. Lewis.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to look at the front of the note, at the K.B; is that the note you took of the prisoner? - A. Yes, I think I could swear it.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. When did you discover that you had given this to Mr. Lewis? - A. Mr. Page discovered it the same evening, and was very angry; he was to have seen Mr. Bliss, the Inspector of the Bank, the next morning, and was going to give him this note; Mr. Page took every pains that was in his power to get the note again.</p>

               <p>Q. What said the prisoner upon Mrs. Page saying that she had paid her a 2 l. note? - A. She said first that she had paid her a 2 l. note, and afterwards said that she did not, but that she paid her in money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing more particularly pass in the shop at that time? - A. Not particularly, that I recollect; she was then taken to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you came to the Office did any thing pass between you and her that was material? - A. When she was in the coach, she cried and seemed very much agitated; she said once that she would never say any thing against Holt; when she was at Bow-street I went up to one of the officers, for him to go somewhere, and she said, when you take me to the bar at the Old Bailey, you will cut just as good a figure with me there as you did with Mr. Holt; it was me that helped to get Mr. Holt clear; I spoke to Mr. Pecker and some of the other witnesses, and instructed them what to say. I went away then for one of the officers that had not come down. When I went up again she said, you are Mr. Bliss, are you, of the Bank? if I am a Bank prisoner I will be kept well, and have a woman to wait upon me.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it before this day in December that you had seen Mr. Page? - A. He applied to me about the 26th of October, and from that to the 30th, I had been with him several times.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave him some advice, I do not ask you what that advice was? - A. I gave him some advice, and he gave me a 2 l. note.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What time in the evening was it when you went to the prisoner's house? - A. It was in the evening, just at candlelight.</p>
               <p>Q. What state of mind was the woman in at the time she was apprehended? - A. She seemed very uneasy, and very much agitated; she cried, and made the most violent noise, she and her little girl; I said to Crocker, I believe she does it to alarm somebody that is at the door; I desired him to take her into the back room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she appear to be quite collected, or did she seem to have had some drink after dinner? - A. She was very much agitated; she said so many things that were real facts and truths, that she was certainly collected, or else she could not have said so many things as she did say.</p>
               <p>Q. Had her agitation the appearance of having drank too much after dinner, or was it occasioned by the officers searching her? - A. I cannot say that her agitation had the appearance of having drank after dinner; I should rather think it was from her apprehension, and from the officer searching her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember in the morning saying to her, now you are sober, give me an account - Did you make any observation to her of her being sober the next morning? - A. I thought at first the woman appeared as though she had drank something; she seemed agitated and cried.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she kept from liquor, or was it desired by you and the officer that liquor should be kept from her? - A. I desired that she might have a good bed; I desired her to have every thing that was proper.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not she brandy by your order? - A. I said that every thing she wanted she was to have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you desire that she should have spirits; aye or no? - A. Upon my life I do not recollect that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any? - A. The woman seemed ill, and if she asked for any I should have had no particular objection to her having that or any thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she not some spirits at Bow-street, before you had any conversation with her? - A. I do not know; I desired her to have a comfortable bed prepared, and every thing that was proper for a woman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Did it strike you that her agitation was the effect of having had too much liquor, or in consequence of her being searched? - A. I do assure you that I thought it was in consequence of her being searched, and her apprehension.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was she searched? - A. Yes, the officer searched her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing found upon her? - A. I believe not. (The note handed to Mr. Bliss.)</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200068"/>Q. Was this late or early in the evening of the 27th? - A. It was, I rather think, a little after eleven o'clock, just at the time we were going to shut up the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with that note - Is this the note? - A. This is the note I received for the pledge, on the 27th of October, here is the mark that I made on it, on Sunday morning, I know it to be the same, I had no other two pound note in the till at all.</p>
               <p>Q. That note which you received from her you put in the till? - A. Yes, I had it on Saturday night, and on Sunday morning, looking over my accounts, which is usual in pawn-brokers' shops, I discovered this note to be a bad one, and then I put the memorandum on it, and that was the only two pound note there was in the till.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you take no other in the course of the day? - A. I do not think that I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Giles. Q. In the course of the day you took notes, and put them away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was the last transaction that evening? - A. I do not believe that there was any other person came into the shop after her.</p>
               <p>Q. When you discovered it to be a bad one did you make any application to the Bank? - A. Yes, in the course of a day or two I applied to Mr. Bliss.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner afterwards, at any future time, come to your shop? - A. I do not know of my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that note, see if it has your initials at the back of it, and state to my Lord and the Jury how you came to put your initials upon it? - A. I was busy in the pawnbroker's shop; a few days after it was taken I came into the sale-shop for some change, and Mrs. Page had been dealing with a gentleman for some articles, and he wished change for a five-pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. That gentleman was Mr. Lewis? - A. Yes, he asked me to put my initials on the note, and accordingly I did so; I afterwards asked him his name and address to put on the five-pound note, which he gave to Mrs. Page.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the five-pound note which Mr. Lewis gave you? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see that two-pound note again? - A. On the 23d of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Who shewed it you? - A. I asked Mrs. Page for the cash, and on looking over the notes I discovered this to be a bad one; there had been one taken in the pawnbroker's shop the same evening, and I supposed that to be a bad one at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. When you discovered the note which you hold in your hand, did you give any directions to Mrs. Page? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What time of the day was it when your wife brought that note to you? - A. She did not bring it to me, I went out of one shop into the other.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not particularly occupied at the other shop? - A. Yes, I was; I came into the shop to get some silver at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to put down Mr. Lewis's address? - A. To know what I was about; I had time enough to write it, but I was in a hurry, and when I had done it, I immediately went into the other shop.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had known the note was bad you would have stopped it; at the time you gave Mr. Lewis the note you were not aware of the identity of the note? - A. I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. There were a great number of notes together? - A. I do not know how many there might be.</p>
               <p>Q. You made your observation upon it on the Sunday, and after the Sunday you did not know it again when it was put into the pocket book? - A. I returned it back to Mrs. Page, and she put it into the pocket-book on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. You only know it is the same note you gave to Mr. Lewis by the indorsement, but at the time you gave it you did not know it was the bad note, and your wife was with you at the time you gave it, and had the same opportunity of knowing it? - A. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. This woman pawned something on the 6th of October, did she give you a correct address? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that you were able to find out where she resided? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The duplicate remained with you after the things were redeemed, so that still you knew where to find her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On Saturday night the things were redeemed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many shopmen do you employ? - A. One shopman.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you supped at that time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told my Lord and the gentlemen of the Jury, that on the next morning you did not find any other two pound note, but how many other two pound notes you had on the same day you cannot tell? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot tell how many you had changed in the course of that day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor at night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time of taking the note you had no suspicion? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. She gave you the two shillings and sixpence in cash? - A. Yes, I had given her a one pound-note and the rest in change.</p>
               <p>Mr. Giles. Q. I was asking you whether this was not the last transaction that night? - A. I believe it to be the last transaction that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to the note that you marked with your initials, is that the note that you received in October? - A. It is the note that my wife received when I had the cash of her, and that was given to Mr. Lewis, that I marked with my initials.</p>
               <p>Q. That is another that you wrote the prisoner's name to? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. My friend asked you about a pocket-book; that was not your pocket-book? - A. It is the pocket-book that is kept in the sale-shop; it is generally in the care of Mrs. Page; she always takes care of it in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, before you signed that note, make any observation on it? - A. No, I was in a hurry, and went into the other shop after I had signed it.</p>
               <p>Q. With or without looking at it? - A. I did not take any notice of it, I did not look at it, I put my initials on it, and being in a hurry, I went into the other shop immediately.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200069"/>Q. Did you then observe it to be a bad note? - A. No, I was not aware of it, I did not think any thing about it, I only wrote my initials in a hurry, Mrs. Page had given him the change.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am not guilty, I never took any thing out in my life from Mr. Page; I took two gowns from one of his shopmen, on Saturday night, and I gave him a one pound note and he gave me a shilling, and as to the broach I never bought one of Mrs. Page, I bought two pair of ear rings; Mr. Bliss ordered me brandy, and behaved very ill to me indeed; he used me extremely ill, and told me I should be hanged, for Mr. Holt had given me the notes; I told him I never had them of him in my life.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I believe you live near Gloucester-street, Mary-le-bone? - A. Yes, I am a dyer.</p>
               <p>Q Do you know the prisoners at the bar? - A. Yes, they lived in <placeName id="t18050220-79-crimeloc465">St. John's Wood-row, Mary-le-bone-fields</placeName>

               <p>Q. They took a cottage of you? - A. Yes, about a fortnight after last Lady-day.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a cottage is it? - A. One room.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it elevated from the ground? - A. Yes, it consists of one room and a cellar underneath it; there are four windows, only one was stopped up by the prisoner and one door to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Towards Christmas last did you observe any thing about this cottage? - A. The Saturday before Christmas day I was walking in my garden, near the window that looks into my premises, and I saw him cutting white metal in the form of sixpences. On the 19th of January I was listening at the window and heard the prisoner at work; he was almost ready to go out, which he usually did every evening; he used to be at home at work all day and went out in the evening; I heard the prisoner count forty-one, what he did not say; I heard him say he thought some were not very passable; a young woman in the room answered she would pass them; I used to see this person, whom I call a young woman, coming there every evening, and in the evening the prisoners and this young woman used to take a walk, and sometimes they were out all night, that I learned from the children.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you yourself seen that young woman with the prisoner walking out of an evening? - A. I have seen them go out of an evening, and the woman at the bar with him.</p>
               <p>Q. That woman at the bar is the wife of the prisoner? - A. I believe she is, she passes as such.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing more before you gave the information? - A. The instant I heard him count forty-one I thought it was near the time he usually went out in an evening; I went down to Marlborough-street and gave the information, I then went with three officers to the house; they are here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are a dyer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The man prisoner took this little house of you: what distance is your house from that? - A. It may be three or four hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there many houses there? - A. Yes, there are a continuation of buildings in the row that comes from Gloucester-street, leading to Portman-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Had these people paid you any rent? - A. I received one pound from them.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that? - A. I cannot particularly call that to my mind.</p>
               <p>Q. He had been a good deal in arrears for rent to you? - A. There was half a year's rent due.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given him notice to quit? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you any quarrel with him about it? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. There was some rent due to you? - A. There was half a year's due.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. The first you observed of this was before Christmas; was there any body in company with you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it? - A. In the evening, about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. It was dark at that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were looking through the window where there was a light? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there not blinds against this window? - A. There was a child's coat, with holes in it, which hung up at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose there were window-shutters for security? - A. No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How many rooms are there in the house? - A. One room; the room under it is uninhabitable.</p>
               <p>Q. How many feet from the ground may the room be that they inhabited? - A. Six feet.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not convey a ladder there to look in at the window? - A. There is always a ladder of my own against the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you climbed up the ladder to look into this window? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner must have known of the ladder, it being always there? - A. I removed it if I wanted it, else it remained there; it was not on his premises.</p>
               <p>Q. It was against his house? - A. It was in my premises, in a garden that I keep myself; the ladder was in my garden that comes close to the back of the house; it was standing close to the side of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You looked through the window, notwithstanding the coat was against the window? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first communicate what you had first seen to any body? - A. I never communicated that to any body.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after Christmas was it that you communicated what you had seen to the officer? - A. On Saturday the 19th of January.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you suffered a fortnight or three weeks to elapse before you communicated it at the office? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no quarrel with the man before you went to the office? - A. I never had.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. The ladder is at the bottom of your garden? - A. Yes; there is a little place of my own, and the ladder leans against it.</p>
               <p>Q. The bottom of the ladder is fixed on your premises? - A. Yes; and leans against a place of my own, by the side of the prisoner's house.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You are a Police-officer of Marlborough-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the house of the prisoner at the bar? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it? - A. On the 19th of January, about half past seven o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. How many officers went with you? - A. Petherick, Lovett, Warren, and Hillier, the landlord of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose it must be dark at that time? - A. Very dark and wet.</p>
               <p>Q. No advantage of lamps at the back of the garden? - A. No, it was quite dark, and no lamps in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me, when you came to the house, how you placed yourselves? - A. When we came near the house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200071"/>I left the other officers and went with Hillier, who was to shew me the way.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to the house, did you see or hear any thing? - A. I went to the back of the house, there was a ladder placed against it; I went up the ladder to the window, which had a cloth or coat hanging before it, there was no shutter, only this thing in the inside, this was the only blind to hinder me from seeing into the room; I heard a noise of rubbing or filing, which I conceived to be so at that time, and I saw a shade of an arm passing backwards and forwards, I waited there till I was satisfied; I had a warrant to apprehend the man at the bar, I told my brother officers what I had seen; we went altogether to the house, I desired Petherick to go to the back of the house to watch there, while we attempted to force the door of the house; the first time we put our shoulders against the door and pushed it the woman screamed out, and the man jumped up, and cried out, who is there? the woman cried out, fetch the pistol; the man came immediately to the door, we kept still trying to force the door, we had forced it almost open, so that we could put our arms in; the man prisoner at the bar then said, he would blow our brains out if we attempted to come in at the door, he was standing with the pistol in his hand at the door; when we found we could not force the door, we took our cutlasses and cut the frame of the window away at the side of the door; he came to the window, and said, he would shoot any of us that came in; Lovett said, he might shoot if he liked, he could only kill one; I heard Petherick crying out at the back of the house, that if any body offered to come out of the window at the back of the house he would shoot them; I ran round to Petherick, and saw the window was open, I thought I could get easier admission there; I got on Petherick's shoulder, and got in at the window, and before I had got in at the window, the prisoner had fired his pistol through the front window where we had cut away the frame from the sash.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand he did it by the desire of somebody? - A. He fired it off without any intention of injuring any of us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you succeed in getting into the house? - A. I got into the room immediately, where he was standing; as soon as he fired off the pistol, he stooped down and unbolted the door; I got in and seized him, and the other officers came in; I hand-cuffed him immediately, and searched him.</p>
               <p>Q. On searching his person, what did you find? - A. Five sixpences folded up in a piece of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in a state, at that time, fit for common circulation? - A. We found one piece that was fit for circulation, and one blank, they were both loose in his pocket; these are the five that were in his pocket, folded up in that piece of paper, (produces them); they were then just as they are now.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in the same pocket? - A. Yes, altogether; only five were folded up, and these two were loose.</p>
               <p>Q. You found nothing else on his person? - A. In what state were his hands? - A. I did not observe any particular mark on them, his face and hands were dirty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the woman? - A. Lovett searched the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me what more you observed yourself? - A. The woman prisoner desired one of the children to pick up his hat that was laying on the ground; I observed a great number of blanks lying on the floor, I took the prisoner's hat and shook it, and in his hat I found these two other blanks, I did not pick up the blanks; I said to my brother officers, take care of the prisoners; and then, after all was right, and the prisoners secured, I searched the room, and found a small box of tools; and as soon as I began to search it, I found this bit of scouring-paper, and that blank lying on it, upon the tools, and in the box I found these tools: there are two punches, an awl, a piece of cork, and two pair of scissars.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these tools nearly altogether, or spread about the room? - A. They were all in a little open box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing more? - A. A pair of pliers, a file, and some more scouring-paper that had been a little used; the file had metal in its teeth as it has now; I found a little bag, and two pens, a small hammer, a dirty cloth, and some old gloves; and in the little box I found something, but I do not know what it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing more pass before your eyes? - A. I saw Lovett search the woman, but nothing particular passed then.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it you, or any of the other officers, that observed the woman throwing any thing out of the window? - A. That was Petherick.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it you that went in company with Petherick to the house of the prisoner the next day? - A. Yes; we went to make a further search.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find then? - A. I found under the stairs, under some tiles concealed, a bottle of aqua-fortis; the tiles were placed shelving against the wall, and between the tiles and the wall there was a vacancy, and there the bottle was put, and a little pot with blacking and a brush in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you tried it, so as to know that it is aqua-fortis? - A. It is burning stuff.</p>
               <p>Q. You were enabled to discover this bottle by the means of one of the prisoner's children? - A. I was; and I brought it to the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You have already told us, that at the time you went there it was dark? - A. Quite dark.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not surprized at a person presenting a pistol at the time you went? - A. No, I knew he would.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not give notice that you were Police-officers? - A. If we had told them that, they might have concealed what we found; we thought of bursting the door upon them; Lovett and Petherick told me what we were to expect.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not, at that time, find any aqua-fortis? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came before the Magistrate, you were told it would not do very well without that? - A. I was so informed, and I went again.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the aquafortis outside of the house, under the stairs that led to the room, which is open to the yard or garden at least? - A. It is a little place that I could just get into.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200072"/>Q. That is open to the garden? - A. It is.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you search the woman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me what you found on searching the woman? - A. I observed her sitting close by the fire, and something placed in her right hand, I seized her by the hand immediately, and on unclinching it I found some things which I have here, blank sixpences, more than fifty of them; I found nine or ten blanks on the ground, I found one that seemed to be a good sixpence in her pocket, that I found on her person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else on the premises? - A. I did some white powder.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that? - A. Cream of tartar, a file, and some scouring-paper, which I found upon the ground, it laid under the table.</p>
               <p>Q. What appearance had the teeth of the file at that time? - A. It had metal in its teeth, and it has now; and at the back part of the premises, upon the roof of a pig-sty near to the window, I found some clippings, and some more blanks.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go with Foy the next day? - A. No, that was Petherick.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you get into the house? - A. I did; I found three bad sixpences just by the man prisoner, as he sat in the chair, upon the floor, they seemed to be in three different states: one is more ready for circulation than the other, there is one that is fit, or very near fit, for circulation, I am not competent judge enough to say which.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You, I believe, have skill enough to give us an account of these different instruments? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. First of all, look at the scissars? - A. The blanks appear to have been cut out of a plate by these scissars.</p>
               <p>Q. The scissars are a fit instrument for that purpose? - A. They are; in this paper appear to be some clippings, which they call sissel; and here are several blanks which appear to have been just cut out, and these scissars would effect that purpose; the pliers would be necessary to hold the blanks during the process of filing, and preparing it for colour.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Does not that mark the money? - A. That would be taken off afterwards; here are two files which would be used in filing the surface and the edge; the teeth of one of the files are very large, and the other very fine, and is generally called a float; the sand-paper would be used to take out the scratches of the file; it appears to have been used; the cork would be used to take out the scratches of the sand-paper, and give it a complete polish; the sand-paper follows the file, and the cork follows the sand-paper. The blank in that state, after having gone through the process, would be fit for colouring.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any blanks there that have been coloured? - A. Here are several that have gone through that process, fit to be coloured.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any coloured? - A. Here is one in the paper which is complete and fit for circulation.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the five that Foy found? - A. These five are also fit for circulation.</p>
               <p>Q. You will be so good as to inform the Jury the use of the aqua-fortis? - A. After the blank is in this state it is put into pickle; the aqua-fortis being too strong of itself, it is lowered with a little water; the action of the aqua-fortis is to produce the silver upon the surface, all metal having a portion of silver in it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Is that aquafortis? - A. I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Explain the use of the cream of tartar? - A. After they are taken out of the pickle it is usual to boil them with an equal quantity of salt and cream of tartar, which brings the colour more to the surface and cements it; after having been boiled, they generally scour them with cream of tartar and throw them into cold water, and dry them with a linen cloth; the blacking is the only thing which takes off the brightness.</p>
               <p>Q. All the articles there found are the instruments necessary? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And would coin one of these sixpences? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Should they not be put into bran and dried over a fire? - A. Where there is a large quantity it dries them quicker than a linen cloth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Look at those five again? - A. These five appear to be perfectly finished.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you accuse these men of? - A. On the 22d of January I had strong suspicion that the prisoner Dorseter robbed me; I watched him once and saw him go into the two prisoners' stall, and I saw him come out twice: on the 23d I went out in the morning, on purpose to watch him, and went into the Crown public-house (which is opposite to the prisoners' stall), and called for a pint of beer; in about five minutes I saw the prisoner Dorseter come out of my shop and go into their stall; I immediately followed him and opened the door of the stall, and asked the prisoner Dorseter what he was doing there; (he was then in the act of loosening down his breeches, but on my appearance he shoved them up again;) he said he had come after a coat that was being mended; the prisoner Ellis was sitting on a board; he said he had got it, and Dorseter, after that, said it was at my house; I immediately put my hand here (the witness shewing) to Dorseter, and said, you have got something of mine; yes, master, he said, I have, I hope you will forgive me. I had made a signal to my wife and she sent the maid; I sent her for a constable to Marylebone; the constable searched Dorseter and found a handkerchief full of flour in his breeches, and a bag; this was the state it was found in; there were 6 pounds 6 ounces, but I did not weigh it myself; we took them to Marlborough-street, and they were all committed; we had a search-warrant, and we went to the prisoners' stall, and there we found some flour-bags empty, and some handkerchiefs in which had been flour, and there were two half-quartern loaves.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Clifton. Q. How long had Dorseter lived with you? - A. Three or four months.</p>
               <p>Q. You received a character with him? - A. No, he was a man that I brought home; I told him I was distressed for a man; I told him he might continue with me till I could get a country lad, or till I was suited with a man.</p>
               <p>Q. You watched him to the tailor's shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He said there it was the first time, and he hoped you would forgive him; what did you say to him to induce him so to say? - A. I did not say any thing; I said, you have got some property of mine here; he said, Yes, I hope you will forgive me. It was a handkerchief of flour.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to swear to that flour, flour is a very particular thing to swear to? - A. I think he got it from my house, I saw him come out of my house with it; and I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. So he might, and yet get the flour from the other end of the town. Has he not got a wife and three or four children? - A. I believe he has.</p>

In a box close to my bed-side; after, that she had occasion to go up stairs for some things necessary for me; she broke open a box, and took out half a guinea in gold, a pair of silver buckles, and a sheet; she gave the buckles to Mrs. Savage to sell them for her at Mr. Dunball's; she stole a silver spoon, a pound of sugar, a blue and white handkerchief, a black silk cloak, and a coat that was under the foot of our bed; we found that her husband wore that, and since that he has run away; there is a great deal of the property lost.

               <p>Prisoner. Q. (To the Witness.) I wish to ask him whether he saw me take it off the shafts? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been to Leadenhall for my friend; I lived at Mr. Wright's, a sheep's head shop, in Whitecross-street; and returning home, at the corner of the court, a man asked me to carry that cask; I carried it to the corner of Cornhill, and that man accused me of taking the cask.</p>
               <p>Court. He says he followed you and caught you, before you 
came to the end of Gracechurch-street.</p>


               <p>Jury. (To the witness.) Q. Did you lose sight of him before you took him? - A. No; when he jumped from the shafts, he kept in the road; I am sure it is the same man that took it from the shafts; there was no person passing by at the time.</p>

On the coals there lay a bundle of new brooms; the prisoner took one of the brooms, and with the handle began to dig in the coals; after digging some time the handle of the broom broke against the metal.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get any metal out? - A. I did at last, by the means of a shovel; it was buried about three feet deep.</p>
               <p>Q. When it was dug out did you know it? - A. I knew it to be the metal that was stolen from our warehouse, and I knew that we had that piece of metal in our warehouse that very day.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon this being dug out, and upon your knowing it again, what did the prisoner say? - A. He hoped that we would not take charge of him. We took both him and the metal.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This composition, which you call metal, is a mixture of copper and lead? - A. It is principally; it is called nail-metal, and is a composition well known by the trade; it is a pintal and brace for a rudder; we had two pintals for rudders in the warehouse at that time, both alike; we had them about a week.</p>
               <p>Q. You think the wicket was open; were the gates open or shut? - A. I rather think they were open; we have customers coming through them frequently at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Immediately you went to the house of the prisoner you charged him having received it of a person that stole it, and he did not believe you, and denied having received it of a person that had stolen it, but when you persisted in it he immediately descended down this trap door, as you call it, and got it for you. I suppose there was a promise that he should not be prosecuted if this was produced? - A. I certainly did make use of these words - that it would be the better for him if he gave it up.</p>
               <p>Q. And then, after you said it would be the better for him if he gave it up, and he having produced it, then your master entered this prosecution.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You say this was a coal-shed and an old-iron shop; was there any appearance of an old-iron shop? - A. Yes, there was some old iron in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any entrance into the cellar outside of the house? - A. Not that we could perceive.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of this piece of metal? - A. I think it is fifty-four pounds; it is worth a shilling a pound.</p>

Pengree and Grenfell, I saw two soldiers run out of their yard, and one of them had this copper thing on his shoulder, he made a stumble, and the copper thing made a rattle, they brushed round the carts, or else I would have taken them; I followed them to a place where they sold it, up a paved court, the first turning from Bread-street, I took Mr. Garland to the place afterwards; they staid in the house about eight or ten minutes, and came out without the metal; then I went and informed the people who belonged to the metal, and left my comrade at the door to watch that the metal was not brought out of the house; when I came back I found my comrade, Sibley, still watching.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed when you went into the house? - A. The gentleman belonging to the metal promised the man that he would forgive him if he would bring the metal to light, and that it should be the better for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what Mr. Garland said, when he first went in? - A. Yes; he challenged the man with having the metal, and he strictly denied it; when he promised him it would be better for him, then he lifted up the trap-door in the lower apartment, and we all went down with him; I saw the metal dug out of the coals.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was there any appearance of old iron in the shop? - A. Yes; when I was in the shop it had the appearance of an old iron shop; and there were potatoes and greens, an old iron, in the window.</p>

            , the witness; I recognized the whalebone to be my own manufactory immediately I saw it; it is my own work, I knew it directly I saw it. On seeing this whalebone I went to Thomas Martin, the defendant, and told him I wished him to go with me to the Mansion-house on particular business; I did not tell him for what; at that time I supposed him a respectable man, and did not wish to hurt his feelings; he told me he would go with me in about a quarter of an hour, that I think were his words, he was then at the King and Queen in Distaff-lane. He then went over into his warehouse, and told me he would be with me presently; he then came back again, and told me he would come to the Mansion-house in about a quarter of an hour. Finding him shuffling in that way I desired him to come directly; I went to the Mansion-house, and staid there about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, and not finding him there I came back again; I then went to the public-house, and not finding him there I went back again to the Mansion-house, and met with Mr. Read, the officer,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200079"/>and I brought Mr. Read with me to take him into custody, and he took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing in your presence at the time he was taken into custody? - A. In the presence of James Martyn he did; he owned having sold that bone to James Martyn.</p>

            ? - A. I do, I have known him about eighteen months.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what business he follows? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you met him frequently during that time? - A. Frequently, almost daily.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember meeting him on any occasion, and when, at the King and Queen public-house? - A. I do perfectly well, on the 13th of November, in Distaff-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the house you used? - A. Yes, and the house the defendant used. I went in the afternoon to take a pint of porter as usual; he said, I have got some whalebone to sell, and he immediately took a stick from underneath the bench from where he was sitting, and asked me to look at it; it was twisted up; I immediately took and untwisted the stick; he said, what is it worth; I said, is it all like this, as he said he had a parcel to sell, about half a hundred weight; he said he was no great judge of it himself; I told him if it was all like that, it might be worth a guinea, but I could not exactly tell till I had seen the bulk; he said it was too late that evening to see the bulk, but I might see it the next day at his warehouse opposite. Accordingly I thought no more of it that evening; nor the next day, but I met him the next day, and he said, now you may see the whalebone; I went with him over to the warehouse, and when I first saw it I was convinced of the circumstance; I said, is here fifty-six pounds; he put it in the scale, and it exactly weighed forty-eight pounds; I said, here is not so much as you said there was, it is not worth that, I will give you a pound-note for it; he said, I will take that, and I gave him a pound note for it; he said, if you will go over the way to the public-house with me, I will treat you with a shilling's worth of punch, and we went over the way; he said, I hope you will get plenty of money by it, for I have got plenty, I have got a seven-shilling piece by it; I told him I could not tell what I might get by it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of that you bought? - A. I suppose, fairly between the manufacturer and the dealer, about three pounds. I immediately went to the first person in the trade to inquire about it, and afterwards found out Mr. Delvar, and went to him the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to offer so little value for it? - A. I supposed it to be some part of my own stock till I took the outside strings off, as I have had various porters with me at times; when I found it was not my own stock, I thought it my duty to let the trade know. I then communicated to Mr. Delvar what had passed; I told him he had better come and see the whalebone, and there he said it was his whalebone, when he came the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember hearing the defendant say any thing at all about this, in respect of purchasing it? - A. I do not recollect that he said how he came by it; at the Mansion-house he said he bought it for me, he told the Lord-Mayor so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Do you remember, at the first time of his shewing it to you, whether he said he had bought some, or whether he could buy it? - A. He said he had it at the warehouse opposite.</p>
               <p>Q. This was at the public-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember whether there was any other person present? - A. There were neighbours; there were one or two; in fact, there was a gentleman who does business for me - my attorney was there.</p>
               <p>Q. The worst man in the world to shew such a thing before him, is it possible - there might be some of your neighbours there when you paid him? - A. I do not recollect that there were.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Mr. Delvar.) Q. Is that your property? - A. I believe that to be my property, I have no doubt, I will identify it; in the first place, it is my own manufactory, and worked by my own hands; in the next place, when I saw this bone at Mr. James Martyn's warehouse, I knew it to be mine by the length; every half dozen and every half pound I have divided, so that there is an equal quantity of sticks to every half dozen; I have not the least hesitation whatever in saying, they are my property.</p>
