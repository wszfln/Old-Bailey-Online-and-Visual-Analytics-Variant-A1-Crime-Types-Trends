            . I am beadle of Edmonton. On the 8th of November I heard Mrs. Prior's house had been broken open - it is in the parish of Edmonton, and in Middlesex; next morning, the 9th, I was going from town to Edmonton, and saw the prisoner - I knew him before: after seeing me he turned round, and went on fast - I turned my horse to go after him, and he ran away; I followed, and overtook him - he had a bundle: I asked what he had got in it- he said it was nothing to me, or something to that effect; I told him a great many houses had been robbed at Edmonton lately, and I thought he might have some of the property - he made no answer; I asked for the bundle - he gave it up to me: I took it out of his hand - I opened it, and found some articles in it; I took the bundle home, and sent for Mrs. Prior - I have the same articles now; I asked how he came by the property - he said it was no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090005"/>thing to me, but when I got about a mile on the road I asked him again how he came by it - he said a gentleman met him and asked him to carry it for him; I asked where he was going to carry it to - he said to Shoreditch church, and he was to give him a shilling for his trouble; I afterwards took off his hat, and found a table-cloth marked

On the 3rd of November, my master having a very large party to dinner, I was waiting at table, by his orders; the prisoner came to his house at seven o'clock in the evening, to ask about a footman's place - I told him master was engaged, and could not be seen, and to come next morning before nine o'clock - he then went away; I did not see him again that evening; an alarm was given about ten o'clock that night, and I missed a cloak of Mr.

I centainly went after this situation, for I had been out of one two months - I lived in Staffordshire with Mr. Dobson, a Magistrate, but my wages were so low I could not support my wife and two children - I heard of Mr. Williams' situation from his late footman, whom I met at Hatton-garden office for assaulting his master - the Policeman threw a coat over to me, and asked me to go and pawn it for 1l. for the footman to pay his fine; I did so, and gave him the pound - he had promised to give me 1s., but said he had not got it, and if I would call in Sussex-street in the course of the day he would give it to me - I went to the station-house where he had gone; they said he was gone to lodge at the Red Lion - I found he did not lodge there; I returned to the station-house and waited there - he came and said he had not got it, but would give it to the Policeman when he got his wages; he said his situation might suit me, and I went at seven o'clock to the house by appointment - I pulled off my hat in the hall, and asked if a footman was wanted; they said Yes, but I could not see the gentleman as he was at dinner - I said I would call again; I got a friend to write me a note to take there - I saw the servant; a lady told me to look in again for an answer; I went again at nine o'clock, and asked for the answer - the servant opened the door, and went up stairs, leaving the door open; a female came up to me, and said,"You can't have an answer, Mr. Williams is engaged with company;" I went out leaving the door open as it was before - when I was taken I only had a few halfpence in my possession.</p>

            . I live at No. 4, Brunswick-street, very nearly opposite the prosecutor's. On Sunday evening, the 31st of October, I happened to be at the window, about half-past seven o'clock, and saw several people about Dawes' premises - it was bright moon-light; I afterwards thought I saw a light in the top front room - I thought it was a dark lantern, as it moved about in different directions, and seeing the reflection of it on the walls like a sun, I came out of my house, went, and alarmed Mr. Ball, my neighbour; we both came out with Penn, a lodger of his - when we came out, I saw the prisoner open Dawes' door, and come out; he walked on about two doors, and Ball spoke to him - he was walking on then; Ball said,"Halloo! Stop! who are you?" he immediately set off running - I pursued him with Ball, and we were in the road even with him, but about three yards off him; he turned round Cambridge - street - three persons attempted to stop him there - he turned back and said to us, "Have you got him?" I said No; I laid hold of him and said, "Now we have;" he had not been out of my sight one minute - we took him; he then took something in his hand and flung it over the wall in Little Cambridge-street, into the gardens of Wevmouth - terrance - we gave him in charge of Herrington, the Policeman; we took him back to the house, and left him in charge of several people; some stopped in the shop below, and some went up to view the premises - I did not go up; the door was ajar - it shuts with a spring lock- the premises below did not appear at all in disorder - I left him in the shop, and went to find another constable; I am sure he is the man who came out of Mr. Dawes' house, and I took him; I never lost sight of him during the whole time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You seem very positive? A. I am so; I had never seen him before, to my recollection - I might be twelve or fourteen yards from the house; it was very moon-light - I believe the moon was full: I have always said I was sure he was the moon, and that I never lost sight of him - he was apprehended about fifty or sixty yards from the house; he had only made one turning -Dawes lives in Brunswick-street; he was taken in Little Cambridge-street, which runs across Brunswick-street - when he turned the corner I was on a level with him, sideways: I was in the road, and he on the payement; I am positive I never lost sight of him - I went with the Policeman to the gardens the same evening; I had seen the movement of his hand, as if something was flung, but saw nothing go from his hand - we could find nothing; we looked next day, and found about an inch and a half of candle - I did not state this to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not asked before the Magistrate if any thing was found, and did you not say you could find nothing? A. I did not say so - he was searched immediately on his apprehension; he could not open the door with a piece of candle.</p>

            . On the evening of the 31st of October I was called by Rawle, went across the road, and saw Dawes' door open, and the prisoner come out; I hallooed out, "Halloo, stop! who are you?" he mumbled something, walked about two doors rather sharply, and then took to running; I pursued, and never lost sight of him - I took him into the custody; the evidence of the last witness is perfectly correct - I went into the house, and found every thing in confusign up stairs, the drawers open, and the contents scattered and rumpled about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You swear you have no doubt of his person? A. Not the least - I did not observe any body else running at that time: the street appeared very clear at that moment - the prisoner turned back towards us, and said, "Have you got him?" I had been in doors all the evening, and had not observed whether it was a dark evening; there was a good light in the street.</p>

Do you see him?" instantly pulled out his watch, and went towards Dawes'house; I said, "That is a signal - look to Dawes' door;" I immediately went towards the door, and the prisoner came out - Ball said, "Who are you? and what are you?" the man directly took to his heels, and turned short round Little Cambridge-street, running - he immediately after turned round, and came towards me, saying, "Have you got him?" Yes (said I) d-n me, I think we have;" directly he saw I was going to take him, he turned again; three persons in Weymouth-terrace put their hands out - he turned again, and we secured him; I lost sight of him as he turned the corner, but believe the prisoner to be the man.</p>

C. on it as my initials; I left my purse at the foot of the bed, is my room, about five o'clock - I went up stairs again about seven, and the purse was not there; the prisoner was a servant in the house, and it was her duty to attempt to that room - the bed was turned down then, but not at five o'clock; I searched for my purse, but it was gone - in the evening of the next day I saw the prisoner in the presence of Mrs. Lynam; she was dressed with her bonnet on, ready to go out - she told Mrs. Lynam she was ready to go, and asked for her wages; Mrs. Lynam said it was at her pleasure, she might go if she liked, but without her wages - she went down stairs, and I told Mrs. Lynam of the loss of my purse; I was afterwards present at the station-house, and saw the prisoner's box brought there - it was locked: I saw it opened with one of her own keys, which she gave to the Policeman; I saw four sovereigns, a half-sovereign, and four half-crowns found in her box altogether - the sovereign marked A.

            . I am a Policeman. I was sent for about two o'clock in the morning, and the prisoner was brought up to me, charged with robbing the porsecutor, who found the three 5l. notes in the bed, in my presence - he denied having any money about him, but at the station-house, in the lining of his jacket, I found three sovereigns and a sixpence; he had said he had no money, either of his own, or any body elses.</p>

               <p>MRS. MANN. The parlour is part of the dwelling-house- I swear this note is ours; I know it by the endorsement, and here are the intials T. M. at the back, which we always make on notes; the T.M. is my daughter's writing: Shaw's name is also on it, in her writing - I saw her write it when she received it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not tell me, down in the parlour, that you did not know whether you put the note into the pocket-book or no, as there was a cheque with it? A. I did not - there was a cheque with it, which was left - that and the note were rolled up together, and put into the pocket-book and into the desk; I did not say I did not know whether I had put it into the pocketbook or the desk, or any such thing - I said, as there was a cheque with it, it could not drop out without the cheque dropping also.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mistress said she did not know the number of the note. Witness. No, I do not; I said I should stop the note at the Bank, and should be sure to find the thief, and she said, "I hope you will."</p>
               <p>JANE MANN. This is the note my mother received from Mr. Shaw; I have written " Shaw, T. M. 30," on it, by which I know it - it is the note she put into the pocketbook and into the desk.</p>

On Thursday morning, the 4th of November, I was in bed, and about four o'clock a man came into my father's yard, and said the timber was adrift- my father being ill, I got up, and attended to it; I went back, and after going out I went round the square, and met this young man - he asked the time; I told him, then went to the chandler's shop, and asked for a candle - the Policeman came and took me - he took a knife from me, which I had had four months, and it was all over rust; I had taken it the day before to cut a rope - I am quite innocent.</p>
               <p>Cotton's Defence. I was looking for work about a quarter-past five o'clock, and met the Policeman - he told me to go about my business, and at night he came and took me; he said he saw me drop the hams, which he could not see, unless he looked through the houses.</p>

Bank notes, and a silver snuff-box - they were all in the drawer, which was locked, and I found it still locked; there was no appearance of violence on it, but my keys hung up on a nail in the kitchen, in sight; I also missed a silk scarf and a yellow silk shawl from other drawers, and a pincushion - I immediately went to find the prisoner out, and his brother and my brother-in-law also, as they were all together; I could not find the prisoner, but saw his brother, who declared he knew nothing about it - we had his apartment searched, and his mother's, but found nothing; I advertised the property, and in about nine weeks I saw at Queen-square, the table-spoons, silver fork, snuff-box, pincushion, scarf, and tortoisesbell comb.</p>

I searched the prisoner's lodgings, near the Blind school, at Lambeth, and found the pincushion - he was present, and endeavoured to wrench it from my hand; I then searched, and found two receipts for coals - when I went into his room I asked if he knew Lisson-grove; he said he did not - I asked if he knew Mr. Lewer of Lisson-grove; he said he did not - I showed him the Hue and Cry, and said."I am sure you are the man, for here you are described;" and I knew him before, having bad him in custody - he said he had very important business to transact, and could not go with me; I said he must, and put the handcuffs on, but he said he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090013"/>would go quiet, and I took them off - on the road he said,"I know all about it, when did you see Mr. Lewer, he is my brother-in-law;" that is all he said then - in the evening a girl was taken, and the ear-rings found in her ears, the scarf on her shoulders, and the duplicate of the other property found in her pocket; she came to see him, and was taken into custody.</p>

            . This is my pin-cushion - it has the chain-pier at Brighton on it; these are my ear-rings - this tortoiseshell-comb, scarf, snuff-box, table-spoon, fork, and salt-seller, are all mine; the property is worth near 30l. without the money - the prisoner is no relation of mine; I have been brought up with him, and looked on him as a brother almost, and have been very kind to him - my house is in the parish of St. Marylebone; I have seen the notes at the Bank - I am certain they were in the drawer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - I am now called upon for my defence for the crime of which I stand indicted for at this bar, but before I enter fully on the subject of my defence, I trust your Lordship and Gentletlemen of the Jury will pardon all such observation I feel induced to make, standing at the bar in my present critical situation. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, you are now in possession of the evidence, pro and con, but when you turn your eyes round, and view an own sister giving evidence against her brother, where she is the sole instrument of crime herself, becomes an unnatural feeling, and presses hard within my own bosom, when it becomes my duty to open the eyes of an open Court of Justice - the scene and lif of a sister, whose situation of life, at this present moment, ought to place her character without blemish or impunity, but when I reverse the scene, its nought but a real dissipated life; her character, from the nearest tie of nature, cannot rebnt my testimony - still, at the same moment I consider myself too much of a man to throw any blast on the character of an individual for the sake of public justice, or to screen the action of guilt. On the 5th of November, 1830, I was apprehended, and fully committed on the charge as per indictment; the property found in pledge undoubtedly belonged to my sister and brother-in-law, but was given to me by my sister in order to pledge, she not having the money I solicited of her at the present moment; here I became fully committed, consequently, my Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, you being in full possession of the evidence on trial, with fortitude and resignation I await a verdict from a Jury of my country.</p>

I then asked where she lived - she said at No. 23, Great Almonry; I took her there, and found in the room she took me to, in a bundle under the bed, all the property except a cotton dress - I had said if she would produce the property it would be better for her.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you know Mr. White, who keeps a shop near yours? A. Yes, nearly opposite; the Bell public-house is next door but one to me- I did not perceive that the prisoner was intoxicated; he might have been so without my observing it - the sound I heard was more like a person falling against the window, than it being starred; I have a show-glass, and the inside pane of that was also broken; the watch could have been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090015"/>taken without breaking that - the watch hung on a brass rail in a row: the pane was nearly all broken to pieces - a window is starred very gently: this was a loud crash - I was not aware that a watch had been gone till the prisoner presented it; I have found that he lives with his parents in Ratcliff-highway, a very short distance from me - he is a journeyman cabinet-maker; I was rather confused at the moment, and did not perceive whether any part of his person was cut.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The show-glass was broken? A. Yes - the watches hung between the window and the windowsash, which is only to keep the dust from the goods, and slides; the space between the two sashes is about fifteen inches - the outer window being broken would be sufficient to get the goods; they were both broken at the same time.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was on duty on the 30th of October in Ratcliff-highway, at half-past ten o'clock, and heard a rattling of glass - I was ten yards from the spot; I ran down as fast as I could, and when I came up to Horne's window, he had the prisoner by the collar; I saw the watch in the prisoner's right-hand - he delivered it to Mr. Horne, who gave him in charge; I took him to the watch-house - Horne brought the watch to the station, and delivered it to serjeant Morgan, who gave it to me - on the road to the watch-house I asked the prisoner the reason he did such a barefaced trick as to break a window in that kind of way; I did not make him either threat or promise- he said he had done what he meant - that he meant to break the window and take the watch, but did not say for what reason.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you there at the beginning of it? A. I did not see him break the window - I heard the glass rattle; he did not appear the least in liquor when I took him to the watch-house; I swear that from his conversation, and his walking so quietly with me all the way; he never resisted in the least - he was in my care for I suppose a quarter of an hour, while I was taking him to the watch-house, and did not appear the least intoxicated, while in my care; nobody was present when I had this conversation with him - the prosecutor did not accompany us to the watch-house; he said he meant to break the window and take the watch, but did not say whether he meant to thieve it, or to do it out of spite, or what.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure he did not say he meant to break the window, but not to break the watch? A. No, he said to break the window and take the watch - he did not speak loud; I cannot swear he had not drank any thing, but he appeared to be sober while walking with me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you had property of more value exposed in your window? A. This was the highest priced watch; there were other goods there - the officer came up in a minute; the prisoner was standing on the pavement - I never saw him on the ground, nor did I see him get up.</p>

            . I live next door to Mr. Horne. I was standing in my shop, and heard the crash of the broken glass - I ran to the door; some persons were collected, but not a great many - I saw the prisoner among others; he was extending the watch in his hand, saying,"I am the man, I am the man," repeatedly, and he went on towards Mr. Horne's door immediately, and very eagerly returned Mr. Horne's watch - his conduct appeared very strange to me; I should rather have taken him almost for a madman from the way he spoke - he did not appear in possession of his faculties, far from it.</p>
               <p>SARAH PURSER. I am bar-maid at the Bell, at the corner of Ratcliffe-highway, one door from Mr. Horne's. On the evening of the 30th of October, the prisoner came into the house between nine and ten o'clock - he was drunk then; he had half a glass of gin at our house - his mother came and took the rest away from him.</p>

On the 23rd of November, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, she came in and requested to be shown some silks, which I showed her - she purchased two yards, eight or nine yards of merino, and two or three of calico, which came to about 14s.; there were other articles on the counter - the shop was crowded with customers; while I was showing the silks I saw her putting something under her cloak - I then noticed her more particularly, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090016"/>communicated my suspicions to Mr. Roope; after cutting off the silk I requested her to step to the other side of the counter to look at the merino, and observed the end of some silk laying on the ground; it was not off the same piece as she had bought - I drew it to me, and found it had no communication with the counter, and as such the roll must be under her cloak; she passed to the other side of the counter to look at the merinos - I did not disturb her till she had bought the other things; I then sent another young man round to see if he could see the end of it on the ground - he saw the end of it on the floor and took hold of it; he pulled it, and she was holding the roll under her cloak - he said, "What is this?" she seemed conscience struck that she had been doing wrong; she said nothing - we took her up stairs to the parlour; she held the piece of silk all the while; another young man went for an officer, and in the parlour she offered to pay the value of the silk if we would not send for an officer - the officer came, and she was taken into custody with the silk; she had not got the things she had bought under her cloak - she had them in a parcel; we estimate the silk at fifty yards, at 3s. a yard - it would contain about fifty-seven yards; it is worth 7l. at least, and belongs to Mr.

I was fetched to the shop between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, and saw the prisoner up stairs with Mr. Roope- this piece of silk laid on the table before them, when I went into the room; the prisoner said she did not take the silk in the act of stealing, and begged Mr. Roope not to give her into custody - I took her, and in the way to the watch-house she said she got it from another young man who was at a shop at Knightsbridge; she did not know whether he was at Knightsbridge now, or in some part of Holborn - she mentioned his name, but I cannot recollect it; I told her I would go to Holborn to inquire after him at every shop there - she then said he might be in some part of the City; she said she had it that afternoon from him - she did not say he kept a shop, but that she often made up things for him; I asked if she had any thing in her house then, to see if she could find him out by - she said not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did she not say she was to make it into cloaks? A. Not in my presence till she got to Queen-square - the name was Berkinstall; I went to her lodging, found she was a dress-maker, and found pieces of silk there.</p>

               <p>Q. On your oath did you tell the Magistrate you had seen it on the counter before she came in? A. I did not - I was asked when I had seen it last, and did not recollect, but I since recollect seeing it on the counter; I believe I said I might have seen it that day or two days before - I have talked this over with the other shopmen, but it is not from what they said that I now swear I saw it before.</p>


               <p>COURT. Q. Do you swear you yourself observed the private mark on it before the prisoner was apprehended? A. I do - I had seen the silk so often with the mark on it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How came you not to be able to tell the Magistrate it was on the counter? A. I did not recollect it so well then, but on the young men explaining to me, I now recollect perfectly well seeing it - I did not like to give rash evidence, and said I had seen it within two or three days; I thought that better than to particularize any time - I did not then recollect seeing it on the counter.</p>

             is written on the back of it, in the prisoner's hand-writing- here is another cheque, dated the 17th of October, 1828, for 15l. - I gave that to the prisoner on the 17th of October; his name is endorsed on it, and it is payable to him - the Bank have charged me with it: here is another for 10l., dated the 15th of December, payable to him - I gave him that, and his name is on the back, in his own handwriting; the whole of this book (producing it) is in the prisoner's hand-writing - it is the book in which he entered the small payments he made for me; he added them up every week, including his salary, and on Saturdays he went to the other end of the book, where there is a cash account; on one side he debited to me for the payments, and it was his duty on the other side to give me credit for these cheques. On the 3rd of July, 1828, there is no entry on the credit side - on the 17th of October there is 5l. entered- it has been 15l.; the figure I is evidently scratched out, and the adding up at the bottom only reckons it as 5l.; on the 15th of December, 1828, there is no entry at all - the sum cast up is correct according to the entry.</p>
               <p>Q. By comparing the other cheques with the entries do you find they are not entered to any other date? A. They are not accounted for in any place whatever - on the 23rd of October, this year, I determined to charge the prisoner with this offence; I had discovered it only a day or two before - I did not hold out either threat or promise to him; I took the book which he kept in my hand, and asked if he was aware of the omissions he had made in the sums in my account; he said, "No, I may have omitted by mistake to give credit for a sum;" I said, "Did you by mistake also<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090018"/>scratch out the figures in this account?" which I pointed out - he said No: I said, "I have carefully examined your accounts, and find a deficiency to the amount of 300l. - what have you done with the money?" he said, "I must have spent it;" I said, "Have you not got it?" he said, "No, but if you will not prosecute I will insure my life for it;" I said insuring his life was nothing to me, for he knew it could not be done under the full value - I asked if he had any cause for the conduct he had pursued- he said No, that I had always treated him in the most gentlemanly manner; that is what passed, as near as possible, but I was very unwell at the time - I said all I wanted was my money, if he had not spent it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He did not say whether he had spent it in your concerns, or his own? A. I asked how he had spent it - he said he supposed it must be in supporting his father and mother; I did not recollect that before, and there may be many other things I do not think of - he has been in my employ since the 25th of March, 1824.</p>
               <p>Q. Your sons, I understand, are grown up, and able to fill his situation? A. No, I have no sons - I have nephews; he was only a copying clerk - I trusted him with my money, but not to do business for my clients; I made an entry in my book every time I paid him money - he kept his own accounts; I checked the disbursements every week; the running account should have been settled at the end of each year, but I did not settle it, nor appoint any body to do it - he added them up at the end of the year; I can tell they are not right, by comparing my own book with his, which I have done - I have compared a great many items in his presence; he balanced the accounts every year, but unfortunately I did not examine them with his - I have since examined his book; I produced the books to him in my office, and asked if he could explain them - he said No; Mr. Ainger was present - he represents himself to be a single man, and I believe he is so; his book stood open in the room he sat in - it was open to every body; I believed him honest, and must take blame to myself for not checking his book with him every year - I might have done it every week for what he knew; I contented myself with examining the disbursements - an omission may have taken place without culpability; his name is on the back of every cheque, which intimates that he has received the money - it is the custom of the Bank of England to require it; one of the cheques is dated the 15th of December - I am obliged to select any three that happen to come together; I have three others in this year - the cheques do not return to me except when I have my book made up; I might not have it made up till a good deal of 1829 had passed, but I cannot say when it was made up - I did not balance his book at the end of 1828.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not your pass-book shew whether the cheque had been received? A. No, the Bank do not enter their cheques with dates and numbers, but merely the name of the page and the sum; I had given the prisoner notice when I discovered this, but he had not left - I did not mean to keep him more than a month, but kept him all the long vacation, that he might not leave without getting a place; he did very little in the long vacation - I produced the cheques before the Magistrate, to show there could be no mistake; I drew one cheque on the 2nd of July, and another on the 3rd - he has credited me for the one on the 2nd, but not on the 3rd; I think a person looking carelessly at the book would not notice the erasure; every body in the office could have access to the book.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could it have been the least possible advantage to a stranger to scratch out that figure? A. Not the least, besides it is added up as only five in his figures at the bottom.</p>
               <p>A JUROR. Q. Part of these sums are ticked off in the book, but not all, can you explain that? A. That has been done since the prisoner was apprehended; the sums paid him by cheques are checked off for me to look out the cheques - the sum erased is not ticked, that being charged.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL DENNIS. I am a clerk in the drawing-office at the Bank. This cheque, dated the 3rd of July, has been through my hands; when a cheque is brought to the Bank it is customary to ask the person to write his name on the back - I recollect the prisoner coming several times, but not presenting any particular cheque; when a person writes his name on it I give him an order on the tellers, if he wants cash - I did so for this cheque; this is the order(looking at it) if he had wanted notes I should have paid them myself.</p>
               <p>- FISH. I paid this order - it is entered in my book as paid on the 3rd of July.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you recollect whether you paid it or not? A. I have no distinct recollection of it, but the entry is a sufficient proof to me; I paid it in cash.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to S. DENNIS. Q. Was there any suspicion about the transaction? A. Certainly not, or I should have inquired about it; the pass-books are made up when required by the parties - the prosecutor's book I find was made up on the 5th of March, 1829; we return the cheques with the book - Mr. Nicoll could have had it made up at any time.</p>

            . I am an architect, and live in Doughty-street - I am related to Mr. Nicoll. On the 23rd of October last I was at his office; the prisoner was there- neither of us held out either threat or promise to him; I walked into the office with Mr. Nicoll, with the book of disbursements and receipts, and stated to Mr. Kemp that he had been looking over all the accounts for some time, and was very much shocked to find there were omissions in the sums he had received, and additions to the sums disbursed - he said he thought there must be some mistake- Mr. Nicoll said, "Then we will go into particulars;" he began at the first error or alteration he had discovered;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090019"/>Kemp at first said he could not tell how it happened, but at last, as they began to multiply, his recollection was worse, and on coming to the alteration of the 15l., he became much more agitated, and was evidently unable to answer how it was to be accounted for; Mr. Nicoll pressed him to answer - I said I thought it not worth while to worry him any more, as he did not deny it, and he said "I cannot deny it;" he asked Mr. Nicoll what was the total amount of alterations and things of that sort he had discovered - Mr. Nicoll said nearly or upwards of 300l.; I asked what had become of the money - he said he could not account for it, he supposed some of it had been spent on his mother; I think he only named his mother: Mr. Nicoll asked if he had any thing left - he said he had not, that what he had in his pocket was all he had in the world; he offered to reinstate it if Mr. Nicoll would not prosecute - not having friends to advance the money, he would insure his life; Mr. Nicoll replied that was worth nothing, and was no security; the rest of the conversation was merely his entreating Mr. Nicoll to forego the prosecution - he afterwards came to me in the room, and requested me to intercede with Mr. Nicoll not to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did you mean by requesting Mr. Nicoll not to worry him? A. It was evidently very unpleasant to him calling over one amount after another: Mr. Nicoll, on the day he first discovered this deficiency, requested me to accompany him to the office next morning - he did not tell me to take notice of what the prisoner said; we are in the habit of talking confidentially about our pursuits - whether the prisoner said, "I admit it, (or) I cannot deny it, (or) it is of no use to deny it," I cannot say; I went to notice the whole proceedings - nothing was said about my being a witness - Mr. Nicoll had not determined on prosecuting: I knew if he did prosecute I should be a witness - Mr. Nicoll's cash-book was on the table; it was the discrepancy between that and the prisoner's book that he called his attention to - the prisoner was given into custody within half an hour; there was no other book required to be produced - I had known for six months that Mr. Nicoll had determined to part with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. From 1828 down to November, 1830, if he had been conscious of any fraud, was there any thing to prevent his absconding from the charge? A. Nothing.</p>

               <p>MR. CARRINGTON. Q. Did the prisoner apply for the production of any other book whatever? A. Not at all; it appeared to me that all the books connected with the subject were produced.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Peachey, and have known Wagstaff two or three years, and knew he belonged to a brass-founder's in our street - he brought these decanters to us for sale on the 24th of November, at half-past eight o'clock in the morning; I received them from him - I asked him if they were his master's property; he had before brought glass decanters to us - he said his master had bought them at Pellatt and Green's sale, and he sold them on his master's account; he asked 24s. for them - I gave him 22s.; they were claimed three or four days after - Wagstaff used to give his master's name as Stodart, but I have found it is Handy: Mr. Peachey buys and sells glass.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean that when he brought the decanters you did not know his name as well as his master's? A. Yes; I knew what his name was -I knew the house he came from; it was Handy's a brassfounder's.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you at the time he brought them, know his master's name was Handy? A. Yes, but on account of delicacy, I put them in the name he gave, which is not unusual - I do not know Martin or his father.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 30th of November, I apprehended Martin, at Mr. Moody's Great Sutton-street, Clerkenwell - he denied all knowledge of the charge; I found Wagstaff the same day, at Handy's, a brass-founder, in Goswell-street - I told him I took him on account of receiving some decanters from Mr. Pellatt's shop; he at first denied it - I did not make him any promise or threat; I took him over to Peachey's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090020"/>- they said he was the person who had pawned them- I took him to Mr. Pellatt's, and then to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure you have told us all he said? A. Respecting this indictment I have; he said an hour after that he had received the decanters from Martin to pledge, but never said for Martin's father - he never said on whose account he was to pawn them, or that he supposed them to belong to Martin's father, or that Martin represented his father to be a glass-cutter; I have told you all he said, to the best of my recollection - Lock, the witness, was present; he said that at Mr. Pellatt's - I do not recollect saying that nothing passed till I got him to the Compter; I swear I have not said so - I did not state where the conversation was in my examination in chief, because I was not asked, and that concerns another case; there are other decanters - what he said concerned the case altogether; I did not know whether I had a right to name it - I have seen his father, but do not know his business.</p>

            . I am quite positive of these being the decanters which were stolen on the 24th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you swear to a pair before the Alderman, and afterwards find you were wrong? A. They are not in this indictment - they did belong to Mr. Pellatt; I made a mistake with regard to them, but nothing else.</p>

               <p>Wagstaff. When Martin gave them to me I took them to pawn for 16s. - he said they would lend that; another gentleman came behind the counter and offered me 1l. for them - I said he should have them for 22s.</p>
               <p>DANIEL STEPTO. He did ask for 16s. on them in pledge, but another person in our shop took them up and said he would not mind giving 1l. for them - he was very willing to sell them.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How came you to offer to buy property of a boy who told you his master wished to pawn them for 16s.? A. He left the shop for ten minutes, to consult his master, as he said - he came back and said the money would be of great service to pay a bill; we should have sold them for 30s., as they are not a pair exactly - we could not sell them for two guineas as second-hand.</p>
               <p>Wagstaff's Defence. When Harrison took me, he asked if I knew Martin - I denied all knowledge of him, as I never knew him by any name but George; he took me to Peachey's, then to a public-house, found the ticket on me, and said there, if I would confess it would be better for me.</p>

            . I am constable of Enfield. I received information on the 25th of November, in consequence of which I went with Watkins to the road near Mr. Mellish's farm-yard - about five o'clock the prisoner came up, and we stopped him; he had a bag of wheat at his back, in a basket - this stocking of wheat was round one of his thighs, and this other stocking round the other, and this bag of wheat was tied before him under his smockfrock; we took him to the watch-house - I said I should search him; he said it was of no use, he would give it up, and he did so - I said, "Have you any at home?" he said, "No nothing but a few potatoes;" we went to his house at Ponder's-end, and found about three bushels more of wheat - I have brought a sample of it, and there were eight or nine sacks of potatoes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. What rent did you owe? A. 4l. 3s. - I think the goods might have fetched about 1l. more if they had been well sold; I had seen the prisoner before - he had been there twice for money; he did not say that if I would pay 2s. 6d. a day for the man in possession, the goods should be left there till the time for selling them; or that they would be impounded at his residence to save further expence - he said they would not fetch the money, and he would impound them at his house- they were not new goods; I had had one bed about two years, but had not weighed it - when I spoke of 10lbs. of feathers being taken out, it was a mere guess; the prisoner might have sold all the goods if he had chosen.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not give himself up? A. Yes - I called on him the evening before, and he asked if I would take any thing; I did - he had an opportunity of making away with these things; they were at his place for two days - I do not know what the expences would have come to, but the goods he sold amounted to 2l. 5s.</p>

Yes, they would; I do not know what the expences were - I had not the bill of them; I am 2l. 1s. 6d. in my landlord's debt now - I did see some feathers about the room, and the bed had been cut open; I had not known the prisoner before - I did not know that he had been and dunned my wife.</p>

            . I have no doubt this is my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there a button to the side pocket of your coat? A. Yes, but it was not buttoned; I had a guinea in that pocket - I had not gone out of the house before the prisoners came to me; I am certain I could not drop this parcel, which contained - lb. of gold, without missing it, but I did not miss it till I got to Bunhill-row; I had no handkerchief in that pocket - I do not recollect stopping in going home; I have no partner.</p>

               <p>Watts. He never mentioned about a guinea before; he went out, and left me in care of his umbrella. Witness. That is not true - I had no umbrella, and did not go out.</p>
               <p>Miller's Defence. We did not know who these things belonged to; we staid a quarter of an hour in the public-house - the reason I gave three different accounts was because another officer stopped me.</p>

On Friday morning, the 29th, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was out, and saw Sullivan coming across the marshes, about half a mile from the prosecutor's ware-house - he had a small loaf and a piece of cheese in his hand; Greenbough was standing near Mr. Hudson's hedge, waiting for Sullivan, as I suppose - Sullivan gave him a slice of bread and cheese, and they proceeded on to Mr. Lambert's gate; I waited about five minutes, when I saw Moore in a green bodied cart - he passed my cart, and went on to the other two prisoners; I then saw Moore and Sullivan drag a bag out of a ditch, but what it contained I could not tell - I proceeded on towards Blackwall, and saw Moore coming in his cart to meet me, but he turned aside on the grass plot that I might not see what was in the cart; I had not passed above four hundred yards when Moore turned his cart again, and took in a second bag, which Greenbough brought out on his shoulder, but I did not see from whence he brought it; Sullivan took it from him, and put it into the cart - it appeared to be heavy; I gave information to the Police.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What time was this? A. Between ten and eleven o'clock; I suppose there was abundance of time to have got a cart - I have seen the horse to-day, and he appears to be blind.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. In consequence of information I stopped the cart, on the 29th of October, with my brother officer; about a quarter of a mile before we met the cart, Moore, who was driving, turned, and went very near half a mile - we went in chase of him, and overtook him; we found this bag of nails in the cart, and some bed-ticking over them - I got into the cart, and Moore drove to the station-house; in going along he put his hand into the bag, and said, "I should like to see what they are, and how soon an innocent man may be brought into trouble;" as we were taking him to the office the following night, he said he knew Sullivan, but did not know the other, only by his dress.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe he gave what direction he could, as to finding Sullivan? A. Yes, and he said he had seen him two or three times - that he came to his house and employed him to take these things; I did not know Moore - he took out two or three nails from the bag when he put his hand in, and I told him to leave them alone - I weighed them; there are 474 lbs.</p>

            . I live opposite the prosecutor's shop. On the 4th of November, some time after four o'clock in the afternoon. I saw the prisoner and another lad near the prosecutor's door; I watched them, and saw the other lad, who seemed older than the prisoner, take the boots from the side of the door - he did not go into the shop; he gave them to the prisoner, who had been close by when he took them - the prisoner walked away, and the other followed him; I gave an alarm, and saw them taken; they had not gone far from the house.</p>

I slept at the Basing-house three or four nights, and was there that Saturday night - I went into the tap-room between five and six o'clock; I saw the prosecutor laying asleep - I afterwards saw the prisoner take hold of the prosecutor to carry him out; I do not recollect there had been any mention of a coach - they carried him out, brought him back, and said they would have nothing more to do with him; they had been absent two or three minutes - they brought him back by his legs and arms, and said they would have nothing more to do with him, he was so tipsy; I did not hear the prosecutor speak to them - I saw the landlady come in; the prosecutor seemed to be quite stupidly drunk - a Policeman took him away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he so drunk he did not know what he did? A. He appeared so to me; he was very drunk.</p>

            . I keep the Basing-house. On the 30th of October I saw the prosecutor there - I remonstrated with the coachman for leaving him, and desired a person to assist him, as he was too drunk to be taken off the coach; I recollect his sending for the coach - I did not hear him charge any one with robbing him; Wilson changed a 5s. piece with me, but I think it was before the coach was sent for - I understand it was for 1s. to pay for the coach, and 4d. for a quartern of gin for fetching it; I suppose this was in allusion to a circumstance that occurred the night before, when a man fetched a coach, and the person it was got for had walked off, and the man was taken to the watch-house for fetching it, because he had not the 1s. to pay for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you known Wilson before? A. I had frequently employed him, and always thought him honest - he has frequently taken out parcels; the gin was had - I do not know whether the prosecutor had any of it; after the prisoner had left the house I heard something fall, and went into the tap-room - I saw the prosecutor laying on the floor; it did appear by the marks on his face, as if he had fallen off the coach - he did not complain to me that he had been robbed; it was from Sanctuary's information that I thought it my duty to have the Policeman, and to send him out of the house - I should say he was as drunk as a man could be.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see the bundle? A. No - I think he did not inquire for any.</p>

            , and took him to the station-house - the landlady of the Basing-house gave me a description of the two prisoners, and I went in pursuit of them; I found Clark at the King's Arms, in the tap-room - I told him I wanted him on suspicion of robbing a man at the Basing-house; he told me he knew nothing about it, and had not been there - I found on him 6s. 6d. in silver, 6d. worth of halfpence, a stock, and two letters, one directed to Colonel Rowan, and the other to Ferguson; on the way to the station-house, Clark told me he had picked up part of it in his coach - I took Wilsonat the Grapes, in Old-street-road; I told him it was on suspicion of robbing a man at the Basing-house - he said he knew nothing about it, and had not been there; in going along he put his hand into his pocket, as if to get something out of it - I held one of his hands, and told my brother officer to hold the other, which he did; we took him to the station-house, and found on him half a crown, two shillings, two sixpences, and a hat-guard, which was taken from his coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is this a Policeman's stock? A. It is not one belonging to the force - our stocks are leather; I am not a countryman of the prosecutor's - he did not make any charge of being robbed when I took him, the landlady did; I have been a Policeman near twelve months - when we got Wilson to the station, he told me half an hour afterwards that the money was his, and he got it by work; he said he had been out of work a long time, and had got a little work - he did not tell me that he got it from Mr. Storey, that I know of.</p>

The prosecutor came there at two o'clock, on the 30th of October - he called for a pint of beer; I took it to him in the tap-room - I found he was very much in liquor, and had a great mind to take it back again; his face was cut, and had plaister on it - he said the Cambridge coach had overturned, wounded him, and broken two gentlemen's thighs; he said he had letters in his pocket to go to the Duke of Wellington - he then asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090029"/>to go to the privy, and when he came back he said he had been robbed; I said, "How do you make that out?" he said he had lost 10s. in a paper, all the money he had, he had dropped down the privy; he told me to go and find it - I said he might go and find it, but I sent a man with a lantern, who found a shilling, and said that was all he could find; I said how could that he, when it was all in paper - I then went to the prosecutor, and said, "I don't like your conduct, I will thank you to pay me for the beer out of that shilling;" he then pulled out 3s. from his pocket, and I said to him, "How could you tell me you had no more money?" Guiver then came up with his coach; I said to the prosecutor, "You had better get up"- he said, "You have robbed me, and now want to kick me out of the house;" he was got on the coach, and offered the coachman 1s., which he would not take - he then offered 1s. 0 1/2d., and he would not take that, as the fare was 1s. 6d. - he, however, got up somehow, and went off.</p>

            . I came up with my coach, and saw the prosecutor very tipsy - I assisted him on my coach; I had great difficulty in getting him up, and should not have taken him but for Mr. Wood; his conduct was very bad, and very annoying to a female on the coach- I told him to be a little circumspect or I would order him off the coach; he had paid his fare 1s. 6d. - he offered 1s. first; he was assisted off the coach, but he was not on the ground long before he sat down on it - I set him down at the Basing-house, as he was so tipsy I thought there would be some danger in getting him over the stones - he had a bundle.</p>

A few minutes before twelve; it was light enough for me to observe the features of the prisoner and the prosecutor - the prosecutor was under a wall, not in the gutter: I asked the prisoner why he did not assist him - I believe he was forcing him back instead of helping him up; his arms were round his middle, and while I was there I saw his hand move to his pocket - he might have moved his hand in the most innocent manner.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable of the Hampstead district. I was on duty, and came up to the prosecutor; he was on the footpath, and the prisoner was stooping down with his arm round his waist - I said,"What are you doing with that gentleman?" he said,"Going to get him up;" I said, "Why not take hold of his arm, as this gentleman is doing?" the prisoner then let go his hold and stood up - I thought he had been robbing him; I searched him and found a crown, a half-crown, 3s. 6d. in silver, and 6d. in copper, in the right-hand pocket of his top coat - he did not, in my judgment, appear to be giving him assistance; I thought he was robbing him - the prosecutor's pocket had been turned out, and the watch pulled as far as the handle would admit; the prisoner ran away, but I took him again in Albany-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you say you thought the prisoner was robbing the prosecutor, had he not his hands under his arm-pits? A. No, round his waist - I found the whole of this money in the same top coat pocket; when we lifted the prosecutor up, he said he had been robbed, but did not say of how much - I found Mr. Ball there; the prisoner might have robbed the prosecutor before, but I thought he was trying to get his watch; I do not know that any thing was taken after I got up.</p>

On the 23rd of October my wife left me in the house - I left about a quarter-past six o'clock; I double-locked the door, and put the key into my pocket - there is only one door into the court - the window was fastened; it is a sash-window, with outside shutters - I returned about ten that night; I was the first that returned, and had the key - I found the door wide open; nothing was the matter with the lock - it appeared to have been unlocked; I got a light, and missed a wooden clock, which hung in front of the door, and a pedestal off the mantel-piece - there is no passage to the house; I am sure they were safe when I went out - nothing more was disturbed; I saw the property again at Lambeth-street about the 23rd of November - I rent the house, and have no lodgers.</p>

            . I am Mr. Radnor's shop-boy. The prisoner is the person who pawned this cloak on the 4th of November - master took it in; I never saw the prisoner before, but am sure it was him; I saw him again before the Mayor of Windsor, and am certain of him - I was hanging some things at the door when he came in; it was between nine and ten o'clock in the morning - he stayed in the shop about ten minutes; I was hanging up things all the time - I saw master take the cloak in, as I went behind the counter for something to hang up while he was there - I saw him take the cloak out of his bundle, in which he had got a black coat and a shirt; he offered the shirt, but master would not take it in as it was dirty - he put the cloak on the counter; master looked at it and lent him 6s. - he doubled it up, and put it under the counter; I afterwards took it from there, and put it back after it was booked - I took it up stairs next morning; it was still folded up - I should know it again.</p>
               <p>GEORGE RADNOR re-examined. The cloak was pawned in the morning, but I cannot say at what time I took it in; Cale was there at the time; I do not recollect what he was doing, nor what the prisoner had the cloak in - it was put under the counter, then booked, put there again, and taken up stairs next day; this is the cloak.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 5th of November, about six o'clock in the evening, the prosecutor was brought to me by a member of the Corporation, who stated the case, and in about a quarter of an hour I took Crawley with me to Oat-lane, which is between Wood-street and Noble-street; I saw Cresswell and some other lads standing together - I told Crawley to go and see if one of them was the lad who took the box; he went, and pointed out Cresswell - Cresswell called me by name, and said the box was all right; I had known him for some time- I believe he had been out of employ some time; I told him he was charged with stealing it - he said he would take me to where the box was; I then said he ought to have known better, as the boy was motherless - I then took him to the Cooper's Arms, Silver-street, and searched him, but found nothing relating to the case; he then said he did not know the name of the man who had got the box, but that he lived down Cow-cross - I went with him to Cow-cross; he there pointed out Olliff, who was standing with others at the end of Rose-alley, Cow-cross - I had never seen him before; I told him I wanted him about the box he had bought that morning - he said if I would come up the alley he would tell me all about it; I went into his house - he told me it was his house, and took me to a room on the ground floor; Cresswell and Crawley were both with me, and another officer: when I got into the room I told Olliff we had come respecting a box which Cresswell had taken from Crawley that morning, and that Cresswell told me he (Olliff) had given him 2s. for the box and its contents; I said, "I must have this property found, if possible; it belongs to a motherless boy, and you ought to have known better than to have given that money for these articles;" he said they were worth nothing, that he had sold them again for 3s. 6d. - I asked to whom he sold them, for I meant to find them if I could; he said he had sold them to a man he did not know, but would take me to him - he then accused Cresswell of having deceived him, and pointing to Cresswell, he said, "That man came to me this morning, and told me he had just left his place, and wanted to sell this box and contents;" Cresswell denied that, and said, "You know when I brought the box you asked me if I was touted" - I asked him for an explanation of that, and he said it meant being watched, and that Olliff told him he would buy any thing at any time, but that an old woman sat at the end of the court, who would lag any one - lag means transport; Olliff accused Cresswell of deceiving him altogether, and said he should not have bought it if he had not considered it his property - Cresswell then said the box was under the bed, pointing to it; I should not have observed it, unless I had searched for it - Cresswell pulled out the box; Crawley said it had been locked, but I found it broken open, and some sticks lay by the grate as if they had come off it; it had been broken by the hinges, and the lock taken off - I asked Crawley how he knew the box; he said it had a crack at the bottom, near the front - I found that correct; I told Olliff I should take him in charge for receiving the box, knowing it to have been stolen: he said if I would allow him he would take me to the person to whom he had sold the contents for 3s. 6d. - I took him to the Compter, searched him there, and found on his person 19s. 6d.; he said it was the produce of a donkey he had sold, and at the Compter he said, would I suffer him to go to Hoggisland, where the man lived, who he had sold the property to, (it is near the House of Correction) - he did not know the man's name, but said he was the driver of a cart.</p>
               <p>Olliff's Defence, (written.) I was coming along Turnmill-street, Cow-cross; I had got my cart with me, when the prisoner at the bar called after me, saying, "I have left my place; I have got my box and clothes with me; I don't like to go home at present - let me leave them at your house; "I paid no attention to him - he stopped outside, until I had settled some business for my day's work; he then came to me, and asked me if I would buy some of his clothes, saying, that he wanted some money, and could not go home - I replied "They are of no use to me, not being fit for my work;" but pressing me hard, and pleading he had no money and nothing to eat all day, considering the property his own, I gave him what he asked, 2s., he brought the things into my house, but could not find the key; he then broke it open, took the box away, and left it at a baker's shop, which he said was his aunt's - I saw him shortly after, and he told me that he was going on-board a ship; if I liked I could go to his aunt's and get the box for my own use - I called there and stated the case, they delivered me the box; soon after an officer came.</p>

On the 9th of November, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was in Guildhall-yard; it being Lord Mayor's day a great many persons were assembled, but the crowd was not very great where I was standing - I had been into Aldermanbury, and am positive my handkerchief was safe in <placeName id="t18301209-55-crimeloc321">Guildhall-yard</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090035"/>you to Guildhall? A. I had been to Aldermanbury on business; I heard a great noise in King-street, and went to see what it was - there was a considerable crowd in Guildhall-yard, but not where I stood; there was no other person about him at the time - there was nobody behind me but him; my turning round did not cause the handkerchief to go from me, for I turned in a contrary direction, which would have loosened it instead of tightening it - there were perhaps a thousand persons about Guildhall-yard, but none of them are here; the Magistrate said it was not necessary.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor swears false, for I did not take it out of his pocket - I picked it up from the ground, held it up, and asked who it belonged to; the prosecutor caught hold of me, and said it was his, and took it from me a good while before he took me into the office.</p>
               <p>MR. PAINE. I did not hear him ask to whom it belonged - he could not have done so without my hearing it; nor was there time for him to do so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How happened it that nobody went into the office who saw the transaction? A. A great many went in, who offered to give evidence, but the Magistrate said it was not necessary - two boys were in the yard who appeared to be the prisoner's companions.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on the 22nd of November, in Foster-lane, behind the New Post-office, where I was on duty, about seven o'clock in the evening, and heard a cry of Stop thief! - I ran down and saw him running from Cary-lane; I took hold of him - the people who were passing said he had stolen a gentleman's handkerchief; I brought him back into Cary-lane, and Mr. Cops was holding up the handkerchief - he said, "He has robbed me of my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090036"/>handkerchief, and I have also taken this one from his pocket;" I myself found an old handkerchief on him, which I gave him back - he said the other two did not belong to him; Cops said this to him directly I brought him back - the prisoner said nothing more.</p>

               <p>MR. COPS. I do not swear he is the person who took the handkerchief from me, but I can conscientiously swear he is the person I seized, and found in possession of the three handkerchiefs; but two days after I would not positively swear to him - he is the person I saw in Tyrrell's custody, and that is the man I had seized and found in possession of the handkerchief, I have no doubt; I said at Guildhall, I believed the handkerchief was my property, but had no positive mark on it - I believed it to be mine; I had one the same as that a minute or two before.</p>

            . On the 13th of November, between nine and ten o'clock, I took a hackney-chariot in Piccadilly; the prisoner drove it - a friend was with me; we drove to No. 2, <placeName id="t18301209-61-crimeloc354">Bolton-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where did Douglass get the purse? A. He took it off the coach - when I missed the purse I had all the straw taken out; the prisoner assisted - I did not tell him what I was searching for, till after the straw was out; I was looking for it to pay the prisoner - I gave him 2s.; I am married - I had a lady with me, a friend of mine, who is now out of town: the prisoner demanded more, but I would not give him more than 2s. - I said I would not let it rest there; my husband is on the continent, on a journey.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you this money for your own use. A. Yes; I had the management of it - I have money independent of my husband, by settlement; it is money which comes to me as a separate allowance, by settlement.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is there any separate settlement by which you are entitled to receive and disburse money during you husband's life? A. Yes, perhaps there is, but I do not choose to say what it is - this was my own money; there has been a written settlement between us - it was not at the time of my marriage; this money was not settled on me by my husband: I shall not tell you who settled it - it has been settled about a year; I shall not tell you the name of the attorney who drew the settlement - I am living on terms of affection with my husband; this settlement was done, with his knowledge, by a friend - I left my husband three weeks ago on the continent; this was not part of the money my husband left me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you live upon this allowance? A. No- this was part of the allowance.</p>

            . I was at No. 2, Bolton-street, on the night the hackney-chariot came there with Mrs. Murray and a friend - the prisoner drove the chariot: I brought out the candle for the witness to search the coach; I helped to search - I found nothing on the first examination; the prisoner stood outside, quite unconcerned, and took no steps to find the money - he was on the point of going away, and demanded 3s. for being detained; Mrs. Murray said she was positive she had lost the money - I asked her if it was of consequence; she said she should not like to lose the purse - I got a Policeman; he got on the box, but could not find any thing - I then got on the box, and under a horse-cloth I found this purse, which Mrs. Murray claimed - I do not know exactly what was in it; the prisoner was taken to the station-house; I went there, and heard him admit taking it - he said, "I did take it, and am sorry for it."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. I am a clerk, living on my means - I am in no situation; I have been out of place about twelve months - I lived last with my sister in Bishopsgate within; I had searched the straw - the Policeman who searched the box before me, is not here; I asked if he had searched it; he told me he had, and could find nothing - he then went away.</p>

            . I am an officer. A little before ten o'clock on the Saturday night, I got into the prisoner's chariot to look for the purse - I saw Ferrers get on the box, and he said he had found the purse; I took the prisoner to the station-house - he said he had put it up on the box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure he did not say, "I took it, and am sorry for it?" A. He said, "I am sorry for it, I put it there;" I knew the other Policeman had searched - this is the purse; there is 5s. in it.(Purse produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This man was the last who got on my box - he said, "I have got it;" I never saw it till this moment - I know no more about it than a child; I never had sight of it - that is the man who got on my box, and he must have put it there.</p>
               <p>JURY to MRS. MURRAY. Q. Was the prisoner see non the box from the time the Policeman went up to the box till Ferrers did? A. I do not know indeed - I had not seen him on the box after he got off.</p>
               <p>Five witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

I presume, mixed corn, sufficient, I should say, to bait the horses on their return home; I then went with the officer to Marylebone Police-office and got a search warrant - we then went to the <placeName id="t18301209-62-crimeloc363">Swan inn at Bayswater</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You state his stay in London depends on the purchase of your commodities? A. Yes, but the market ends before the day - he might stay till five o'clock; I do not measure the provender he has to take to town - it is left to his own discretion; I should think he has been two years in my service, it may be more; the Swan inn is a place of very considerable resort for carts and waggons - the ostler has a great deal to do; he said he might have helped him - I never was in the yard before, but I have no doubt it was the property of the landlord; there were a number of corn sacks in the loft - I think the bran should not have been taken into the loft; it was up in a corner - I saw it through a hole in the stable; I had not seen the ostler before, to my knowledge - I believe I have related every thing that took place with the officer and the ostler in my presence; Surgood is married, but has no family.</p>

            . I am a saddler. I was asked to watch the van - I was waiting close by the Swan, and saw Surgood come up with it; I saw Ingledon cross the road from the van, with a truss of hay on his shoulder, but I did not see how he got it - he took it down the yard by the side of the Swan, and put it on a crib in the yard, where it was afterwards found - Surgood followed over, with a sack full of something on his shoulder, and in about ten minutes Ingledon went over to the van again, and brought out a sack, which appeared a new one, full, out of the front of the van: Surgood then went and put some hay on the shafts, on the front of the van, and tied the tarpauling down over it - I told Webster, the officer, what I had seen; I afterwards went to search the premises with the officer, and found the hay where I had seen it left, with the sticks in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was this in open day? A. Yes, it was about ten minutes before nine o'clock, and it is a public highway: there was no concealment that I am aware of; I was there with Mr. Stevens, and what he has stated is correct.</p>

            . I am an officer. I have heard the account the last witness has given; what he has stated is correct - I went to execute the search-warrant; I saw Ingledon at the door - I knew him, and he knew me; I called him, and asked what Mr. Stevens' carter had left that morning - he said he believed a little hay, and he thought there was some loose corn also in the stable; I said I wished to see the hay, and he took us to it - I untied it, and asked him whether any thing else had been left; he said No, not that he knew of - I am sure he said that; we went into the stable, and looked through the hole; Perrence said, "I believe that to be the sack;" Ingledon made no answer, but went and got a ladder - there were no means of getting to the loft without a ladder; we got up, and found the sack of bran - Ingledon said he did not know how it came there, nor who it belonged to - I am sure I asked him if he knew how it came there, and he said No; I took him and the articles into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not Mr. Stevens with you? A. Yes; I heard him asked if he had detailed all that passed, and he said Yes - I have stated more, but it is correct; I could see the sack from below, and so could any one - there were certainly many places in which it might have been put where it could not be seen; it was a public stable, into which any one might go - it is an inn which carries on a great deal of business, but I think the ostler could not forget what had been left in so short a time; the van stopped at a quarter to nine o'clock, and we went again at past eleven - it was not past twelve; the master of the inn came to us - we were there twenty-five minutes or half an hour.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. As near as you can guess, what time elapsed from your seeing the van unloaded to your search?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090039"/>A. I think an hour and three quarters, as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Surgood. I have been upwards of seven years with Mr. Stevens, as a regular servant, and have witnesses to prove it; he makes a memorandum of the time we are with him.</p>
               <p>MR. STEVENS. He may have been so.</p>
               <p>Surgood's Defence. What I brought from home I fed my horses with, from twenty minutes after eight o'clock to near eleven; what they did not eat I took further on, and what they do not eat at all I take home - I am uncertain what time I shall stay; I have waited six or eight hours in town - I have known Mr. Stevens to buy three loads, and I have to go and fetch them: when my horses are knocked up I am obliged to stop three or four hours at the Swan, because he overloads his horses, so that they cannot get home - he has taken the bait from me when I got home.</p>
               <p>Ingledon's Defence. This man was in the habit of calling on his way to town, and leaving the provender, taking what he wants till he returns, which is sometimes at six o'clock at night; others are in the habit of leaving provender there - when the officer inquired of me I said he had been there, but I did not know whether he had left any thing; I looked and said Yes, he has, and pointed it out among other provender of other men's - how the bran and corn came there I cannot tell.</p>

I saw in one corner of the desk these ten chinchilla skins - I asked him what they were; he said they were skins he had found in another part of the warehouse, and he had put them there for security, intending to give them to Mr. Palmer the warehouse-keeper, but he had forgotten to do so; I desired him to lock the desk, and give the key to Mr. Palmer - there were two hales of skins at the further end of the same warehouse; I took him to the dock-office - Mr. Palmer afterwards unlocked the desk and took the skins out; he said he lived at No. 5, Robinhood-court, St. Olaves; - I went there with another officer, and in a drawer in that house.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you any judge of these sort of skins? A. No; some appear darker than others, but they are packed in a different manner in the bales - I believe the prisoner has been in the service of the company from its establishment; I do not know that there had been any person to inspect the bales of skins that day, or the day before - if there had, they would have been attended by some of the persons in the docks; if any of the skins had fallen out, it was the prisoner's duty to have given them to the ware-house-keeper immediately - I do not know that any crime would have been imputed to him if he had kept them two or three days; I would as soon have suspected myself as I would him - I told him I had found these skins at his lodging; he said those found in his drawer had been given him by a person whose name he mentioned, who had been in England, but was gone to America - I think it is not possible he could have overlooked the returning of the skins he had picked up.</p>

No - I cannot say when the bales had come to the ware-house; it was about the 5th of October, I think, as near as I can guess - I believe they had been inspected by persons who had come for that purpose, and the bales would certianly be opened to show them; I was in the dock about three weeks before he was - he had had a good character; it is possible some of the skins might have been left out which he might take up with a view to return them; his son died last night.</p>

            . I am warehouse-keeper of the warehouse D. I have compared these skins with those in the bale - they appear to me to be the same; if the prisoner had found any he should have reported it to me immediately, or to have had them repacked - he had an excellent character.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know he has lost his son? A. I am told he has - he certainly did not do his duty with respect to these skins; I have known him sixteen or eighteen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090040"/>years - he has always had a most excellent character; there are perhaps a thousand men employed there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not surrender the key of my desk? A. Certainly you did, after you were in custody, and you said that when looking for me or Mr. Salmon to get men to effect a delivery, you had got the skins which had fallen from a bale.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On Sunday, the 28th of November, I met the prisoner coming through Duke-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields, about nine o'clock at night, with a bundle under his arm - I stopped him, and found it was wood; I asked where he got it - he said from the Five-fields, Chelsea, that he worked for Mr. Cubitt, and the foreman gave it him - in going along he looked round, and said, "There is no one here but you and I - I took it, let me go, and I will give you a sovereign to-morrow."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I suppose you told this to the Magistrate? A. No, but it is the truth - I am rather slight in my memory, but I am brought here to tell the truth - the Magistrate did not ask me if I had any more to say; they filled up the commitment, and said that would do - the prisoner told the inspector at the station that he found the wood by Buckingham-gate - I should have told that if I had had time.</p>

On the 15th of November the two prisoners brought in four books, and offered them for sale - they said they had been their uncle's, who had died, and left them to their mother - I saw they were four odd volumes, and asked what they had done with the others; they said they were worn out, and they had sold them for waste-paper - I detained the books, and told them to fetch their mother; I went out to tell a Policeman to follow them, but they had got out of sight; they appeared to me to stop and talk with two young men, but I could not be positive - they were taken next day, and I was sent for.</p>

Corbet then looked at her, and said, "Mary, the mug wants washing out that I have got in my hand;" they then said if they came at ten o'clock at night would it do - I said No; they went out sideways, and said they would come at nine o'clock in the morning; when they were gone I missed four yards or four yards and a half of jean, which I had just before- I saw them in custody the next day; I have not the least doubt of their persons - I have not seen the article since.</p>

               <p>Davis. Q. Did you see me among the three men? A. I cannot swear to any of them till I saw you with the truss; you made no resistance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. What time was this? A. Half-past six o'clock; it was dark - that is a great thoroughfare; there were other persons - I cannot tell where the carter was at the time the truss fell; I cannot say it did not fall by accident, or that the persons I afterwards saw with it were those I first saw with the cart- the third person got away; they had got thirty or forty yards from where I saw the truss fall when I took them.</p>

            . I am a constable of Tower-ward. I took the prisoner on the 25th of October, at the Coopers' Arms; the servant came to me - I told him I must take him for a robbery at that house; he said he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to MRS. LEE. Q. Is your house in the City? A. Part of it is; the part where you committed the robbery in is in the City - I swear you are the person who took the lodging that night; I lighted you up stairs - your bed did not appear tumbled; you came to the bar several times that evening - you wore a jacket, and appeared rather in liquor.</p>

               <p>Prisoner to JAMES LIVICK. Q. Can you swear I am the person who gave you your watch and money? A. I do swear it positively; there are tiles sloping down from the windows - I identified you at the Mausion-house; it was quite light in the morning.</p>

A. my bailiff attends to that - I never inquired about his character; I am a good deal in town, and seldom attend to the men - he always kept the key of the corn that was given out for the horses; the bailiff placed the corn in a particular bin, of which he kept the key - I believe the prisoner was going to Finsbury-square, with a load of hay, that morning; I believe his wages were about 18s. a week - it was 15s. or 16s., and he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090048"/>was allowed 6d. a day to spend, and I generally tell my bailiff to give him a guinea at Christmas to make him comfortable; I did not threaten or promise him at all, but said I was astonished he could be guilty of such a thing.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is a certain quantity of corn put into the bin for the horses? A. These two sacks he took himself from the waggon; he told me himself he took them and put them into the bin on the Thursday afternoon - when I went down to Hendon I had my corn measured, and after deducting a proper allowance for the horses, there were two bushels and a half deficient.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q. Can you take on yourself to say whether the horses had their corn that morning, or whether it was for them? A. I know nothing about it, but if they had had it there was that deficiency - he was not allowed to take the corn with him instead of feeding them in the stable, and I never knew it done.</p>

            . I am an officer. About half-past eight o'clock in the morning of the 4th of December, I saw the two prisoners at the Black Cap, at Camden-town- there were four persons together, and a cart loaded with hay; I watched, and walked by them to the end of Park-street, which is about fifty yards - suspecting something, I waited a few minutes, and saw one of the four, I believe Hardwick, get out of the cart; I saw him pull up a sack of something from between two trusses of hay; it appeared about half full - he delivered it into the hands of Rutherford, the ostler, who was close at the side of the cart, and received it from his hands - he then went up the passage with the sack on his back; I ran as quick as I could, and just as he put it down off his back, at the corner of the building - I said, "What have you got here?" I then said, "Who does it belong to?" he said he did not know; I asked him what it was, and he said he did not know - I caught hold of the sack, and said,"Then I must know;" I brought it back to the cart, he walking before me - I then said, "Where is the carter?" and just at that time Hardwick came out of the public-house door; Rutherford said, "This is him;" I said to Hardwick, "Is this your corn?" he said, "Yes, it is;" I then said, "What was you going to do with it?" he said, "I was going to give it to my horses - they have not had any for these eight days, and as I was going to town I thought it would do them good;" I said, "What, all this, impossible! - here are at least two bushels of it;" I then untied the suck, in the presence of both the prisoners, put my hand down, and brought oats from the bottom of it - it was all corn; I tied it up, pulled out my staff, and said, "My name is Webster - I belong to Lambeth-street Office, and you must both consider yourselves in custody," and begged they would not go away; I asked somebody to go and get another officer, as I had from one hundred to one hundred and fifty people round me, hooting and hissing me; Rutherford said,</p>
               <p>"I shall not wait for you - I shall go about my business;" he then went to the right side of the horses, took some hay from the cart, and began to feed the horses - I saw a man who I knew, and gave him the corn to take care of; during this time Hardwick walked up the passage - I followed him as quick as I could; I got looking into the different buildings for him, and in what I believe to be the stable, I saw a cask, with the head out - it was half full of clover chaff, mixed with a few oats; I came out of the building, and saw Hardwick coming out of the passage, towards me - I took him down to the bottom, and three or four Policemen came; I gave them both in charge - I then went to look for the corn, and the man I left with it said it was gone; somebody had taken it - I immediately ran up the passage, and within six paces of the stable where I had seen the cask, a man ran out with an empty sack on his shoulder - he got on a high wall, over some timber, and made his escape; I went back, examined the cask, and found it filled up with oats - I was examining the stable, and looking at the corn (the Policemen had let Rutherford go) - he came running up the passage after me, and said, "You have no business here - you have got no warrant;" he took me by the collar, and said, "If you don't go I will knock you down;" I said I knew perfectly well what I was doing - I then came out, and a young man said to Rutherford, "Knock him down - knock the b-r down;" I brought him down the passage again - Mr. Butt, the publican, said, "Don't take any notice of that man; he is only a busy meddling man - go to your horses, and take no notice of him:" I put my hand on Butt, and said, "Don't you meddle with me;" he said,"If you put your hand on me I will knock you down;" the ostler stood behind the cart - I said to the Policeman,"Take that man into custody;" he said he would not go; I took hold of him myself, and gave him to the Policeman- I said to Hardwick, "Now, wherever you are going with the hay, I will go with you;" I gave him into custody at last, then went to inform Sir

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not you know it is very common for persons on a journey to leave packages at inns? A. Very - I do not consider this was the case here; chaff is very rarely given to horses alone at inns - the oats laid by themselves; there was not sufficient time to mix them; I am not certain that it was Hardwick who delivered the sack from the cart - I believe the corn found to be the same as I had given the man to mind; he is an old man, and I do not believe he saw it taken away - he is not here; he kept his eyes on me all the while - he said he did not know who took it, and which way he was gone; Rutherford certainly could have absconded - he followed me to interrupt me from going to the cask.</p>

               <p>Hardwick's Defence. When I got to Battle-bridge, Sir Charles Flower got out of the carriage, and asked how I came to do so - I told him that they had had no corn for eight days, and I was going to leave it at the Black Cap, to give it them when I returned; the bailiff can prove they had no corn for eight days - he told me to take two sacks into the stable.</p>

            . I am post-mistress of Staines.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. At what time? A. About half-past four o'clock - my daughter assists me in the office, but was not in the office that evening; I was in the office from the time the bags were received till a quarter or twenty minutes to nine o'clock, and then only went into the parlour adjoining to get a crust of bread and cheese - I returned again into the office; I took the bag up stairs with me at night, and gave it to the guard in the morning - my daughter was at work in the parlour, and was not in the office at all that night; I remember the night, because I weighed two packets, and I received a letter from the Post-office about this in about a week I think - I have no servant; there is a key to the bag at Chertsey, and another at my office.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. Did you return from the parlour into the office? A. I did, and remained there till I sealed the London bag with the office seal - Giles unlocked the Chertsey bag with my key; I took the bag up stairs, and delivered it to the guard in the morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Why did you thank them for their kindness if you was thrown in the mud? A. I was so surrounded with mud, if I had moved I should have been covered - I did not like to charge them with it; they walked as far as Plummer's-row, about thirty houses, after that - I was not aware that they had robbed me; I saw no watchman to inform of it - I had not presence of mind to return to the public-house; I am quite satisfied I had 18s. in my purse - this was a night-house; I was neither drunk nor sober - I had the rum and shrub because I felt cold, and am subject to take cold, and had no great coat; I was not violent at the watch-house, and did not want to fight the prisoners - I was quiet there; 14s. was found on Hart.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What sort of a night was it - was the court lighted with gas? A. No - I could hardly see my hand before me in the court.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 15th of November, about a quarter or twenty minutes past two o'clock, I saw two persons run down King-street, and at the corner of Battie-street I stopped the two prisoners - that is about thirty yards from King-street; there is a court half-way down King-street - I stopped at the end of King-street; I suppose they saw me, and ran down the court - I think it is Well-court; I heard one say to the other, "Through this court" - they ran through it; it leads into Battie-street - I made for Battie-street, and at the corner of Battie-street, seeing them running at that hour in the morning, I took them into custody, with the assistance of a brother officer, and in a minute or a minute and a half, I saw the prosecutor - he came up while I was asking why they were running, and stated that he had been robbed by two men; I said I had stopped two - he immediately identified them as the persons who had robbed him; I searched them, and found 11s. 6d. in silver, and 8d. in copper, on Hart - I was present when a sixpence was found on Lee; my brother-officer and Elliott brought the purse up about two minutes after I took them, just as the prosecutor came up; and said he had picked it up at the corner of Greenfield-street, Commercial-road, which is across the Commercial-road, on the opposite side - a person coming from the court I saw them in, would not be in Greenfield-street, but I did not see them till they ran out of the Commercial-road, into King-street; they could pass Greenfield-street, between that and where the robbery was committed - the prosecutor claimed the purse; he was certainly not sober - he had been drinking, but was quite capable of taking care of himself, and know what passed.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there any money in the purse? A. No - 12s. 8d. was found altogether on the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the prosecutor in such a state that he might easily mistake a man? A. If there was no gas-light there, there was one very near to where he was robbed, which I should think, is about sixty yards from Morris' house, the Yorkshire Grey; he pointed the place out to me - there is a light within ten or twelve yards of it; it was not a very dark night - I have seen it lighter; it was not moonlight; I will not swear the men I first saw running were the prisoners - they were running towards me.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the morning of the 15th I was in Greenfield-street, Commercial-road I heard a shuffling and sort of running noise, which excited my suspicion; it proceeded from the Commercial-road - I did not see the persons till I came up to them in Battie-street- the place where I heard the noise is in a straight direction from the spot the prosecutor describes himself to have been robbed; I saw no other person there, nor any person running - I lost the sound all at once; when I came up to the top of Greenfield-street, I found the purse laying under a lamp, at the corner of Greenfield-street and the Commercial-road - I took it up, and have it here; immediately on taking it up I heard a noise in Battie-street, like five or six persons talking - I went there, and found the prisoners in custody; the prosecutor came up at the same time - I saw them searched; sixpence was found on Lee, and 11s. 6d. and 8d. on Hart - the prosecutor was evidently the worse for liquor, but quite capable of taking care of himself; he claimed the purse immediately he saw it - I asked the colour, and he told me before I showed it to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There was no silver in the purse?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090051"/>A. No; the prosecutor might certainly make a mistake in the person of a man.</p>
               <p>Hart's Defence. I met Lee in Ratcliff-highway - we were going home, and as we went along we were taken into custody by two Policemen - the gentleman came up, and said, "These men have robbed me of a watch, seals, and 2l.;" at the station-house he said he had lost 24s., but not his watch; he afterwards said it was 26s.; he said this in the Policemen's presence and at the station he said,"Are you two Jews?" I said Yes - he said, "Come out of doors, and I will fight you;" the Policeman brought him away and said, "You must not fight here;" he said,"You d-d rascals, I will do any thing to you."</p>
               <p>ROBERT CAMPPEN. The prosecutor said he had no doubt, had it not been for his guard his watch would have been gone, and that he had lost about 1l.; he did not challenge them to fight at all. nor did I interfere to prevent it- I never left them together out of my presence.</p>

About half-past seven o'clock in the morning in question, I examined Riley's premises, and found an opening where they said there had been a window; I afterwards saw the glass in the yard, partly broken - there had been six squares in lead; it appeared to have been taken out altogether - it had been nailed in with small brads; it fitted the hole - it would require very little force to get it out; it was about five feet five inches from the ground - I could not get in there without standing on something; neither of the prisoners could get in from the ground - this is a corner house, and all the houses there have yards to them; I apprehended the prisoners in about an hour, at their father's house; the back of his house is but a few yards from the back of the prosecutrix's premises; they could get over the fence of their father's yard, and I traced steps from there into three different yards - the fences are board, six feet high; there were footmarks on the dirt in each yard, of feet without shoes or stockings; I could see the marks of the toes and heels - I could not tell whether there had been one or more persons; the father let me in; he was not dressed - I spoke to him, then went into the next house, which was empty, and there found a bell; the back door was open, the front one shut, but not fast; I went up stairs in the father's house, and saw both the prisoners dressed, except their stockings and shoes; neither of them had slippers on at that time - the eldest put on slippers afterwards, and they found a pair for the other before he left.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say before the Magistrate that they had no stockings on, but the eldest had slippers on, (looking at his deponition.) A. They have taken me down to say so - neither of them had slippers on when I went up.</p>

            . I am an inspector of a Police division. The prisoners were brought to the station on Friday, the 3rd of December, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning; nothing was said to induce them to confess any thing -Joseph cried very much, and said to the other, "You know you knocked me up this morning at four o'clock, to go and steal these things." or words to that effect - the other said, "It was you got in at the window;" I asked John what could have induced him to commit the robbery; he said he did not know, and seemed quite careless about it -I asked if they had had any food that morning, they appeared in so wretched a state, I thought they were starving - John said he had had a little bit of bread; I asked how many brothers and sisters he had - he said, "There sisters and one other brother;" they were charged with stealing six aprons and a gown.</p>
               <p>MRS. RILEY. This is my bell - I know it by a mark on it; there is a piece broken off the iron spring, which was done to make it fit - I saw it last about eleven o'clock at night; I found the casement of the window in the yard, about one o'clock - I had seen the premises fastened that night.</p>

            . I am a special constable. On Tuesday, the 2nd of November I was at the Horse Guards, and saw the prisoner with two more, standing behind the prosecutor - I watched him, having suspicion; the prosecutor went with the mob - the prisoner turned on his left and the other two on the right; I went and asked the prosecutor if he had lost any thing; he said."Yes, a blue handkerchief" - I turned round and saw the prisoner in Kennerly's custody - I found this blue handkerchief in his trousers pocket, which the prosecutor claimed.</p>

On the 8th of December I was desired by my father to conceal myself in one of the warehouses, about four o'clock in the afternoon, so that a person coming in would not see me; the prisoner had access to the warehouse - I saw her come into the long room, and bring up a lot of old work, which she had the superintendence of; I saw her put it down - she then walked round the room once, then came to the front counter, and took a fur tippet from there - she directly went out of the warehouse, carrying the tippet before her in her hand; she had no cloak on - my brother Edward came into the warehouse in about five minutes; I then came from my place, and informed him what had taken place.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Has your father any partner? A. No; the warehouse was not kept locked - every body had access to it; there was a great deal of property about - the prisoner had an excellent character.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090053"/>GEORGE KNIGHT SMITH.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Would your mark be left on it if you sold it? A. Yes - we sell retail if a person happens to come into the warehouse, which may happen, but my business is wholesale; she would not be justified in taking it out - the mark is on the skin; I swear this was not sold, for it is a very peculiar one in point of colour, and has been in the warehouse all the season.</p>

I said Yes; he then said he would help me, and that a gentleman had left some money to be distributed among aged people who had seen better days; he came next day, the 8th, and said "You see I have thought of you" - I thanked him; he said, "You must go to the Feoffees office in the Temple, to receive 4l." - I thanked him very kindly; he wrote me a note, and called me Mister -I told him not to call me Mister; he gave me the note, and went as far as the New Post-office with me, then tapped me on the shoulder, told me to go through Foster-lane, and make the greatest speed I could - I went and did make haste; I had left my wife at home and did not lock the door - I went to the Temple, but did not get the 4l.; when I came home my watch was gone - I have not seen it since.</p>

            . I am a porter to the prosecutors. On the 27th of November I had been to the Sun Fire-office with some things, and when I came back I saw the prisoner inside the shop door, with the portfolio in his hand; there was somebody in care of the shop - he had not been laid hold of; I asked what he was going to do with the portfolio - he said he was going to look at it; he was near the door, which opens close to the counter - there was nothing but stamps in the portfolio; I took hold of him - Mr. Irons then came from the other end of the shop; I told him this person had got the portfolio - he then put it on the counter - I said he had said he took it to look at: Mr. Irons sent for an officer, who had it delivered to him, I think.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the officer come? A. Yes, and heard all that passed - I never saw music in the shop; Mr. Irons is not here - he was serving a customer.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the prisoner was waiting till Mr. Irons had done with the customer and then to ask for what he wanted, you cannot say? A. No. - he made no attempt to run away; no other property of ours was found on him - the shop door was partly open when I came in; it is the same sort of portfolio as paper would be kept in - nobody could tell there were stamps in it.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for, and took charge of him with the portfolio - some of the stamps are cut and some not; I only found three halfpence on the prisoner - he had a great coat on his arm; he said he had a wife and four children, and he went down on his knees for forgiveness; Mr. Irons, Mr. Bull, and Mr. Lodge were in the shop when I went in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The stamps were all in the book? A. Yes, he had taken none out - if I had not been at the shop before I should not have known it contained stamps.</p>
               <p>MR. STEPHENS. This is the portfolio - it did not lay on the counter when I left the shop; it laid on the bench of the window, behind the counter - he could get it by reaching over the counter, without going round.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you tell whether it might not have been moved in your absence? A. No - the door opens against the counter, but it must be closed again before he could reach the stamps; he might certainly have got out of the door if he had had time - the shop is a long one; a man could buy 1d. worth of paper at our shop.</p>

On the Thursday morning before the 23rd of November, I saw the prisoner at my house, between eleven and twelve o'clock; I had known him fifteen or sixteen years - he asked me if I would buy a looking-glass; I said I was not in want of one - he pressed me very much to look at it, and said it belonged to a friend of his who wanted money, and asked if he should show it to me; I said if he came that way I had no objection to look at it - he brought it in about a quarter of an hour; he said the person wanted 50s. for it - I offered him 2l. for it: he went away, returned in about a quarter of an hour, and said the person said if I could not give more I should have it - I paid him, and put it up directly; on the Saturday the prosecutor came to my house and saw it - I gave it up to Eagles, the officer; I have known the prisoner sixteen or eighteen years, and thought him an honest, hard-working man.</p>

            . I am a music-copier, and live at No. 68, Davies-street, Oxford-street. On the 12th of No<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090057"/>vember I met Betraun; we were in King-street, and saw the prisoner and two others following the Earl of Winchelsea, and near the corner of Bow-street I saw one of the prisoner's companions go and take up the stap of his Lordship's coat pocket, and take out a red handkerchief; it was under a gas-lamp - he gave it to the prisoner: they ran off - I ran and took the prisoner; he struggled and Betraun came up - the prisoner threw down the handkerchief.</p>

             GUNNELL. I am a Police-officer. On the 15th of November I saw the prisoner in Berwick-street, Soho; he had a book concealed under his arm - he was standing at a shop window; I watched him, and saw him go into a bookseller's - he came out again: I went into the shop, and asked his business - I followed him to another book-shop, and went in, while he was offering this book for sale: I asked him how he came by it - he said he bought it at the corner of Frederick-street, Hampstead-road, seven months before, and had given 3s. for it; I took him, and found the prosecutor's name in it - he afterwards told me that he took it from the prosecutor's shop in the morning, when he took some boots there - I had not made him any promise or threat.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Who stole these things? A. I did, Sir; I had been in the habit of stealing things for about a month before that - not longer, though I had been in the employ of a jeweller for three years - I am sorry to say I stole a good deal; I have sold to about four other persons, who all keep shops as the prisoner does; I was found out on the 1st of November, when my master missed different things - I had stolen nothing that day, but I had on the Saturday before; on the Tuesday I was taken to Marlborough-street - I named all the persons to whom I had sold stolen goods, and the prisoner among the rest, and on the Friday I saw him there; the Magistrate let him go to appear on his own recognizance, but I was not present then - I never was examined as a witness against him, and he never knew what I had to say, that I know of; I went into his shop like another customer - I mentioned Chelsea, but did not say I was a silversmith or jeweller there; the first article I recollect carrying to him was a swivel of jeweller's gold, not such gold as sovereigns are made of - it is a paler gold; it was about the fourth time I saw him that I said I lived at Chelsea.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you apprenticed to your master? A. No - I went decently dressed to the prisoner.</p>

I told him of several different things, and, among the rest, of a chain; I described the boy, and begged he would let me know what he had bought of him, as every thing he had sold him was mine; he said he had bought nothing of him that he knew of, and said, "What does he say he sold me? you are welcome to look, if there is any thing of yours you may have it;" I told him of a silver chain, with double loops - he denied having had it, and I have never seen it since; I then mentioned a coral-drop which he had purchased - he drew a drawer out, and I found it; I then said he had got some black work - he took out a box, containing some black work, and I found some of mine in it; I looked into a cup of gold, and found two pieces of gold drops, some cuttings, and some silver wire - I found these three gold watch-key loops, and these gold cuttings in a wooden bowl, or cup, in his window, covered with a number of other things and cuttings - I identified the different articles, and as I did so, he said of almost every one of them,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090058"/>"That is not your's, I am sure;" he almost denied every thing distinctly - what I did identify were rolled up in a paper, and given to the officer; he was taken to Marlborough-street, and remanded by Mr. Conant.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you been unfortunate in business? A. Yes - I understand the prisoner has married a Mrs. Wolfe, who was a creditor of mine; I went through the Insolvent Debtor's Court, but I was remanded for ten months through the inattention of my attorney, I may say; I believe it was said, "Because the said prisoner has fraudulently made away with part of his property, let him he remanded for ten months" - I remember being at the Police-office on the 9th of November; I was in want of money that day, and have been all my life - I would not think of compounding a felony;

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you know either of the other men? A. I should know one of them if I was to fall in with him - I did not know either of the prisoners, to my knowledge; I only know the other man by walking behind him and the prisoners for near half a mile that evening - I do not know that I had ever seen that other man before; the prisoners said the other person had employed them to carry the things, and this man said, "Let me go, I will run after them," but I did not let him go because he had the property about him; I did not then know the prosecutor had been robbed - I noticed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090059"/>a gown among the property, and I said I thought it belonged to a person who had lately been robbed; they were about a mile from the prosecutor's - I found this trunk at their lodgings.</p>

I remember the prosecutor and the prisoner being at my house - they had a quartern of gin, and a small glass of brandy; the prosecutor first took out some silver to pay for it, and then he took out a purse with a quantity of gold in it - he wanted me to change a sovereign; I said as he had silver I would not - he put it into his purse and put the purse into his left-hand trousers pocket; they went away together.</p>

On that Wednesday evening I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner, about ten minutes before twelve o'clock: they were coming up Ratcliff-highway, and the prosecutor was upbraiding her for not letting him go - when he saw me, he said "Officer, I must throw myself under your protection, this woman won't let me go;" she had hold of his clothes -I said, "You had better go about your business, and let this man alone;" I asked him where he wanted to go - he said"To Old Gravel-lane;" I said I would show him the way - she followed; and said "Just let me speak to him" - and she whispered something in his ear, but she did not do any thing then; he got on to the corner of a turning, and said to me "Will you have a glass of grog?" I then saw that he was in liquor - he pulled out a leather purse, and said"You think I am deceiving you; but I have money" - and he shook the purse; I took him over the bridge, and he said "Will you see me on board my ship?" I said, "I can't, unless you go to the inspector and ask his leave: if you go there and are in liquor they will send you to the watch-house" - he felt horrified at that, and said "I will go by myself" - I said "Go on, and if I meet the woman I will turn her back" - I did not meet her - after the prosecutor had shown me his purse, he put it into his pocket and buttoned it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it dark when he showed it you? A. It was under a lamp; the way we went, and I returned, was the only way to get over the bridge; I did not meet the prisoner - it is a place of great thoroughfare but not much frequented by women of the town.</p>

            . I am inspector of Police. The prosecutor was brought to the watch-house a little after twelve o'clock at night in a state of intoxication - he said he had been robbed; I searched him, found 8s. in his right hand pocket, and some halfpence in his left - he said he had lost eighteen or twenty sovereigns; I took him before the Magistrate in the morning - he there said he had been robbed by a woman; but in the first instance he had accused our man - the following evening the prisoner was brought in; I asked if she had deposited any money - she said several times she had not; but after telling her where she had deposited it, she said "My sister died and left it me."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then the prosecutor had charged a man with it the first night? A. Yes, a man named Haggerty.</p>

               <p>JOHN TUCKER. On the 2nd of December, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner at <placeName id="t18301209-120-crimeloc691">Uxbridge</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you seen that person? A. No - I had drank a pint or two of beer; I was sober I believe - I had not been drunk, and dancing in the public-house; I had been dancing, and no one else - there was some music; my clothes were on - I did not see the prisoner in the house; I did not give her gin there - I swear that I did not lift up her petticoats, nor touch her at all; she ran against me in front of the house.</p>

On the 9th of November I wore the articles stated, and on the 10th, at six o'clock, they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090063"/>were taken - Sughrue had certainly slept there, and went away at that time in the morning; when I went to rise I had not a single thing to put on - the prisoner was a most intimate acquaintance of Sughrue's; I went to her house in Kent-street, Borough - I saw her sister, who said she was out; I said I had been robbed - she said she had it in her noddle, and I did not go the right way about it; the prisoner was afterwards taken, and at the station-house she said she did not steal them, she had pawned them, and she supposed, as a receiver, she should have fourteen years of it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you any shopman? A. I have not now, because I was obliged to discharge him - I ought to have been aware if the shopman had sold any thing to the prisoner, as it ought to have been entered in his book; I sent him away because he was connected with the prisoner - I had reason to doubt his honesty; he may have sold articles to the prisoner - I have been at the bazaar, but never saw such saucepans as these there; they sold cast iron saucepans - I complained to the merchants in the City that these were too heavy, and they made wrought iron ones - they have sold enamelled<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090065"/>saucepans there; they were forwarded to me, and I was told they came from the bazaar, but they were cast iron - Batty, the shopman I discharged, is in court now; I think I dismissed him about a month ago - it was the same day as I gave the prisoner into custody; I came home and dismissed him in five minutes - I did not subject him to any search; I called him up to a room privately, and said I did not wish to expose him, but I had discovered some property at Whyte's; I told him to leave my house, or in one hour I would not answer for his not being in Newgate - he had been with me about nine years, and the prisoner about two years and a half; I have a customer named Calkam - I do not remember sending the prisoner to him; Mr. Calkam did complain of what in his estimation was an overcharge, I think it was ten pounds, more or less, a trifle, and upon investigation I believe about seven pounds were found to be an error - the recollection I have of the transaction is, that the prisoner stated Mr. Calkam had made an objection to the charge, and upon investigation great portion of it was found to be an error; and I believe the observation I made to the prisoner was, "It is a sad pity this error has arisen, but I think the best way will be for you to go and state that it is your error in making out the bill;" it was on ascertaining the error that I advised that - I remember there was some conversation, and the purport of it was, "I think you had better say it was your mistake, that the business may be settled;" if the error had not been detected the money would have gone into my pocket of course, but if it had been detected by me it would have been returned - it certainly was my business to investigate how the error took place; the prisoner told me be had married a woman with three children, and he had had one since - the only article which I recollect that he offered to account for was a tea-tray in his kitchen, which he offered to show me the bill of, and I did not take that; he had some papers, and I think one was a bill of the Carron company.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these bills and say if you did not claim as your property some articles for which these are the bills of parcels? A. I have looked at them, and I select some bills, which as far as my memory serves, I did see in searching his drawer or desk - the other bills I have no knowledge of; but, Sir, there is not one individual article which is stated in any one of those invoices, which I took up and said was my property - I do not recollect any one article which I claimed as mine for which he produced an invoice; we are continually selling tea-pots of the same metal as these, and all these other articles, but then the book will prove the transaction - I have the cash-book here, which was kept by the shopman whom I dismissed; my own mark is not erased from articles when we sell them - the prisoner's wife and children were at his house; I should think the youngest child to be twelve or fifteen months old.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long have you been a trader in the City of London? A. Twenty-four years - I have occasionally had one, two, or three shops; I have carried on an extensive business, and I believe have been well known - I had no quarrel with the prisoner to induce me to go to his house and lay a false accusation against him; I had two or three times had some conversation with him about debts received - I had reason enough in my own mind to turn Batty away; I am not in the habit of making out accounts, and therefore I presume the clerk made out Mr. Calkam's account - I make up the books, and they make abstracts from them - the error must have been my own; I have done business with Mr. Calkam since - the officer brought away from the prisoner's some screws, and some little trifles which I could not swear to, but they are not in the indictment; two of these tea-pots have my mark on them - this cock has no mark on it, but it is a particular article; the prisoner did not offer to produce invoices of any of the articles I brought away - he did not account for the receipt stamps; here is a flush ring for a water-closet which I had made for me - these things were all in my shop while the prisoner was there, and he had daily access to them.</p>

            . I am an officer of Union-hall. I went with Mr. Marriott to search the prisoner's lodgings; I found the articles mentioned in the indictment, and I have them with me - Mr. Marriott looked carefully and cautiously over the things, and I told him to be very particular; there were some things from which the marks had been erased - some of them were brought away and some left; what were brought away are put down in the indictment - there were four tea-pots; the place was not at all like a shop - there were four rooms and a kitchen; these articles were in the kitchen and different parts of the house.</p>
               <p>MR. MARRIOTT. These are the articles found at the prisoner's house - this tea-pot and this canister have my marks on them; these two tea-pots are so scratched that there is no discovering the mark - this is the German saucepan; I never saw such a one till I had them made of wrought iron - those from the bazaar were all cast iron; this is the cock of a pattern I had made for myself - I do not know that I ever saw such a one in any other person's possession; it is manufactured at Birmingham or Woolverhampton, to my own pattern - these are the receipt stamps; they are engraved from a plate of my own, and were in a drawer in my counting-house, which is open to my clerk and myself - these have never been issued by me; they are the writing of different persons - this one is "Received of Mr. Whyte (the prisoner) the sum of 3l., on account of bill delivered. E. and C. Steele." - I never had any dealings with a person of that name; here is another, "Received of Mr. Whyte the sum of 5l., for one quarter's rent of a house in Kennington-street, due at Christmas last. B. Stevens." here is another of a Mr. Burton, and some others - these could never have been given on my account; I never had any such dealings with any such persons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has not Mr. Weiss such articles as these flush rings? A. I never saw any of these things have a spring to them; my foreman suggested the propriety of having them made as this is, and I had them made so - I never saw any like these; I have not the facsimile stamp here of these receipts. [Here the witness pointed out the private-marks on several of the goods.]</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you known him before? A. No; I never saw him before - they were pawned at night; I cannot speak positively as to whether any one else was in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090066"/>the shop - I think it was seven o'clock or half-past seven; I partly remember his dress - I cannot say whether he had a coat and breeches on; I think my employer was in the shop, engaged in some part of the business; there were other persons in the shop - there are customers in the shop nearly all day; there might have been four or five in the shop - he was in the shop five or six minutes; it was a wet night, and he was wrapped up in a camblet cloak - I saw him at Guildhall and at Union-hall; the Magistrate desired me to look at him.</p>

Twell has authority to order goods if I am not in the way; he generally signs as for me - he would not exceed his authority by writing it in this form, but I think it should be more full; if an article is wanted he has authority, in my absence, to write an order for it in my name, but not to employ any other person to write it - we generally write our orders "Send per bearer (or) per bearer;" such orders as these are common in our business.</p>

He desired the stock to be sold for Mrs. Temperance Creed - he came afterwards with this lady, and, by his actions, I considered him as identifying her as Mrs. Creed, and as such I attended her to the books of the Bank; he did not say, every time he came, "This lady is Mrs. Creed," but it was natural to presume that she wanted no second introduction, having been introduced once - when Mr. Jenkins introduced her to me she was accompanied by the prisoner.</p>

He did on the 9th of July; I went with them from my station at the Bank to the transfer books of the 3 per cent. consols, under the letter C. in the transfer-office - the stock receipt was signed by the lady, and handed to the Bank clerk - the book, containing the transfer, was turned round, and she signed it in the place where transfers usually are signed - the clerk affixed his signature to it, as he had done to the stock receipt, and I signed my name as witness to the identity of the prisoner's signing; which is required by the Bank - I did it of my own accord, that is the usual course; here is the transfer (looking at it) - here is my signature and the signature of the lady I identified that day - she was the same lady who had been present on similar transactions; the prisoner accompanied her, to the best of my recollection, every time - he was present on the 9th of July during the performance of the transaction: I retired back to the rotunda, and to the best of my recollection the lady<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090068"/>stopped at my desk to receive the money - I was present when the money was paid to her by my partner, Mr.

            ; I do not think the prisoner was present then; the lady appeared a middle aged woman, from forty to forty-five, but she might be fifty; her complexion was not florid at all; her whole carriage together was genteel - there were no signs of infirmity whatever in her walk - she had a dark full dress on, and to the best of my recollection, it was silk - she wore a very large bonnet, and a black veil, thickly laced; and her veil was on almost every occasion down - I remember no transaction in which that veil was raised.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. I presume you have known the prisoner some time? A. Yes, seven years, if not eight; he has been a clerk in the Bank all that time - I believe he has been there twenty-two years; I always understood that the Bank clerks' salaries were progressively raised; he always bore a good character, to the best of my judgment.</p>
               <p>Q. If a person had stock to transfer, the regular course is to have a power of attorney, if they cannot attend themselves? A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known instances where a person unable to attend, has comissioned a friend to do the business without a power of attorney? A. I never heard of a transfer being effected at the Bank without a power of attorney, unless the parties themselves were present; I certainly once witnessed a woman sign for another person, but it was discovered immediately that it was wrong - that was a case of dividend; it was discovered before the signature was complete; the right woman was present, but not being able to write had requested this woman to sign her name for her. Consols close for the July dividend about the 2nd or 3rd of June - the person holding the stock at the time of shutting, receives the dividend due; Mrs. Creed would be entitled to receive the dividend which had accrued on the stock, at any time she chose to come for it - I did not know Mrs. Temperance Creed, and am certain Mr. Jenkins did not - I cannot answer for the late Mr. Jenkins; a party receiving a dividend goes to the desk signs the book and a paper, both of which state the sum received, and the amount, in respect of which it is received, it is specified in both, and the amount of dividend is specified in both - nothing is specified in the book but the capital, the name of the person, and the dividend, except the figures; the figures specifying the amount, would usually catch the eye - but it would require a practised eye to notice it; they are prominent enough to be seen.</p>
               <p>MR. BULLOCK. Q. Are you in the habit of attending parties to receive dividends? A. I am; this is the dividend-book - (looking at it); the name of the party, and the sum, is on one side of the book, and the amount of stock and dividends of on the other - there is always a sheet of blotting paper between the two leaves, which is down at the time the party signs; the blotting paper is between the name and the amount - it is removed at the end of about six months.</p>
               <p>Q. A party signing on the left side would not necessarily see the amount of stock and dividend on the right, when the blotting paper is down? A. No, but they are not permited to sign the book till they make their claim -I understood Mr. Adolphus' question to allude particularly to the warrant.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. By making their claim, you mean mentioning the sum? A. Yes; the clerk asks the persons name, and the amount of stock - and if they agree, he pays the dividend.</p>
               <p>MR. BULLOCK. Q. Is it necessary for the amount to be given by the persons themselves, or sometimes by the broker, or person who attends? A. Sometimes by the party, and sometimes by the person who attends.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the transfer-office of the 3 per cent. consols, and have been so for nine years - I have known the prisoner as a clerk in the Bank about twenty years; in July last, I remember his coming with a lady to make a transfer of consols - Mr. Lane accompanied them; Mr. Lane asked if the transfer was ready - the book was then turned round, and the party representing herself to be Temperance Creed, signed it, after having signed the receipt; I do not mean that on this occasion the lady said she was Temperance Creed - I took that for granted, she being with the broker, Mr. Lane, or somebody for her, had bespoke a transfer in the name of Temperance Creed that morning - this is the transfer-book; I saw the female sign it - here is my signature as witness to the transaction; Lane has signed it as witness to the identity - after signing this they went towards the 3 per cent. dividend office; the dividends were in the course of payment on the 9th of July - the parties might if they pleased receive their dividends on that occasion; the lady appeared about forty years of age - I had seen her six or seven times before, and to the best of my recollection, she was always accompanied by the prisoner, and always identified by Mr. Lane; she always came for the purpose of transferring stock, and always wore a bonnet with a black veil, which was generally down - I do not remember it ever being up; I have examined the Bank books to ascertain of there was more than one account in consols in July in the name of Temperance Creed - there is only one.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. On what day do you begin to pay your dividends? A. Bankers are paid on the 6th or 7th if a Sunday does not intervene - we generally begin to pay the public on the 8th; there is generally a great press of people the first few days, and they have a long time to wait.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Of course the prisoner was aware that you knew his person? A. Yes; I believe he attended his duty at the Bank till he was charged with this - but he was not in my office; it was not part of his duty to attend in the consol-office - the lady always transferred stock in the name of Temperance Creed.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you give the dates of these transactions? A. On the 7th of August 1827, 500l. 3 per cent. consols; 15th of February 1828, 250l. - 16th May, 150l.; 9th October, 250l. - 25th November, 300l.; 22nd April 1829, 200l. - 25th August, 300l.; 15th January 1830, 150l. -9th July, 115l.; all these transfers were made by the same lady - the dividends are payable twice a year; and the attention of the stockholder would be called twice a year to the diminution of the capital.</p>

            . I keep an oil-warehouse in the Kent-road - the prisoner is my nephew; Mrs. Temperance Creed was my sister - she died on the 24th of September last; she lived in Wentworth-place, Mile-end-road - had she lived two months longer, she would have been eighty-three years old; she stooped with age - she could walk tolerably well with an arm; she appeared to be quite the age she was - her face was furrowed with age; I saw her shortly before her death - she never wore a veil; (looking at the transfer) I was perfectly acquainted with her hand-writing - the signature to this transfer is not her hand-writing. I, the prisoner, and Rebecca Goode, are left lier executors - I communicated with the prisoner respecting her property in the Bank; I asked him if the Bank books had been searched - he said they had; and that there was 1,650l. standing in the name of Temperance Creed - he did not mention the stock; I knew it was 3 per cents. - he gave me this information about the beginning of November; he was to apply to a broker for the purpose of having it sold out on the 19th of November -I was not present, and he did not himself tell me what he had done respecting it; his brother called on me - I went about the beginning of November. to Mr. Hawkins, a stock-broker, with the prisoner, merely to inquire the price of stocks; we came to no determination that morning whether we would sell or not - the prisoner never gave the broker any directions in my presence, nor did he himself communicate to me any directions he had given; I received the information from his brother - (looking at three letters) these are the prisoner's hand-writing; he called on me on the 18th, and said the broker had made some mistake, and the sale must be delayed till the following week on the 26th; and early in the morning of the 28th, I received this letter by a private hand (read).</p>

               <p>MR. COLES. In consequence of receiving this letter, I went to see him the same evening, and told him there had been so much delay in the business, that Mrs. Goode was resolutely determined to have the matter settled by fair means or foul, and if it was not settled, I apprehended unpleasant consequences would ensue; I then asked if he would give me a power of attorney for the next day, which was Saturday, delegating some person to act in his stead - after some hesitation, he said he would give one; he then paused a little while, and said, "I will supersede the necessity of a power of attorney, because I will be at the Bank on Monday morning" - nothing more was said; he was taken into custody on the Saturday evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You mention a will under which you derive some property; when does that will bear date? A. I do not exactly know - it might be made nine or ten years ago (the probate was here produced).</p>
               <p>Q. I see here is named a sum of 1,300l.; that I presume is in trust? A. Yes; it is 1300l. stock - it was all to sink in the residue of her property, for the purposes of her will; that 1300l. was left her before marriage, independent of her husband - it is now in possession of two gentlemen; it was her property, she could do what she liked with it - that sum is still existing; it stands in the names of her trustees - I knew she had a very good income; I supposed about 400l. or 500l. a year - she knew I had undergone losses, and she has given me sums of money out of her surplus income, for the last six or seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot tell where she got it from? A. Yes, I can - she was of an acute, clear, and intelligent mind; I believe she was not always careful about reading papers before she signed them - I presume she always exercised common prudence and discretion in the management of her affairs; the prisoner was in her confidence - (Mr. Fenn here produced the dividend book of 1827, and two dividend warrants) I believe these two devidend warrants to be in her hand-writing; they are dated June and July, 1830 - there is no doubt of the signature being her writing.</p>
               <p>JOHN HODSON. I belong to the audit-office, and have brought some consol dividend warrants from there - (read) one for 2,047l. 16s. 9d., dated the 5th of January, 1827, dividend 30l. 14s. 1d.; July the 5th, 1827, the same amount - January, 1828, 1547l. 3s. 9d., interest 23l. 4s. 1d.; July, 1828, 1320l. 16s. 9d., interest 19l. 16s. 3d. - 5th of January, 1829, 770l. 16s. 9d., interest 11l. 11s. 3d.; 5th of July, 1829, 570l. 16s. 9d., interest 8l. 11s. 3d.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the dividend-office at the Bank. I know Mrs. Creed's person - she was in the habit of receiving her dividends at my desk every half year, and always came with the prisoner; the book is handed to the party coming for dividends to sign on one side - the same course is pursued if a Bank clerk comes with them, we usually ask for the sum; but if I was going into another office and asked for a dividend for a friend, I might turn to the book, observe the sum and number, and ask the clerk to give me a warrant of that number.</p>

             re-examined. I have examined the Bank books to see what sum was standing in the name of Temperance Creed, in October last - it was 5l. 16s. 9d. 3 per cent consols.(The Transfer was here read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - it is my unfortunate situation to be placed as a criminal, charged with an offence which attacks my life, prosecuted by so near a relation as the brother of my own father, for whom, in any situation of life, I should have looked to for support and assistance; I am placed in this unhappy predicament in consequence of conduct which may have been imprudent, but was never intended criminal. My aunt, as you have heard, placed great confidence in me, and she informed me from time to time of her being obliged to sell stock to accommodate her poor relations, and she was desirous of having the transfer effected by a friend of hers, without the expence of a power of attorney, which would be an additional burden on the person she wished to oblige; she always expressed her confident hope that the sum she advanced would be paid, her intention being in such case to replace the stock - she had a mind fresh and vigorous; she always received her dividends with a clear knowledge of the sums - after the last transaction she assured me she had replaced the stock, and in consequence of that I made the declaration I did to my uncle, after her death; were she alive I should have no difficulty in establishing this fact, by her evidence - as it is, I must have it to your good sense and merciful consideration. Gentlemen, it has come to your knowledge that I was in the Bank more than thirty years, with an increasing salary and good private character; had I ever been conscious of any guilt, I must have known that after my aunt's death, the discovery was certain - yet I remained two months without absconding; I am here to meet justice, which I have no doubt I shall find at your hands, on a fair and merciful consideration of my case.</p>

On Sunday, the 10th of October, I was in the neighbourhood of Wardour-street, and a little after four o'clock in the afternoon I came down Berwick-street, and found a riot had commenced at the bottom of <placeName id="t18301209-138-crimeloc787">Peter-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What was the riot? A. Two women were fighting, and several others seemed to have been fighting - they had been in a commotion; I only saw the two women fighting - I swear the prisoner was setting them on; he was not endeavouring to part them - he struck one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, was he not endeavouring to rescue one from the other? A. Not at that time - what he might be doing after I cannot say; I did not see him attempt to take one from the other - I do not recollect whether I told the Magistrate I saw him strike one of them; she was a stout woman - I have not brought her here; I have since understood one of them was his sister - the other officer did not stay there till I was beaten; I cannot say whether the person who gave the prisoner into Mace's charge is here - I have brought nobody here; I had not seen the prisoner commit any offence, or strike any body till Mace attempted to take him - I had seen him strike one of the women when I was attempting to part them; that was a quarter of an hour before I was injured - when I came down Wardour-street Mace was there; that was the last time I went there - when I went into the crowd I saw the prisoner; he was not doing any thing then, and I did not attempt to take him - when he was given into my charge I had not seen him do any thing to the person who gave him in charge - I am not aware whether he struck Mace or not; he received a violent blow in the eye in attempting to take him - who gave it I cannot swear; I defended myself with my staff, by striking their hands - so many blows were aimed at me by the party round, I was obliged to defend myself.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. You did not offer violence to anybody till Mace and yourself were struck? A. Not the slightest.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. There had been two or three hundred people? A. Yes, the last time; I had gone away a quarter of an hour before, part of the former mob had dispersed - there was a bustle when I returned, but they were not fighting; I did not hear any shouting.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they were not rioting? A. No; I should think if we had had officers enough we might have dispersed them peaceably, and no accident have happened - I told Mace there was a great disturbance, and we both went together; when we got to the corner, opposite Martin's house, there was a mob; I went into the heart of it, among them, to see what was the matter - I was not aware who had been fighting at that time; they were moving about and raising a sort of clamour about some one - what I do not know; there were a good many voices, but not very loud or vociferous - the party, whoever he was, told Mace and me to take the prisoner in charge, and pointed him out; he did not then say what he charged him with - Mace immediately attempted to take him, and received a blow in the eye; I then sprung forward to seize the man who had given the blow - three or four struck me, and knocked me down, and then the prisoner attacked me; as I got up I saw several coming on me - I struck their hands, which were uplifted, and then the prisoner sprung forward and struck me on the head; I was defending myself then.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long might you have been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090072"/>on the ground? A. About a minute - I got up as soon as I could, and had to find my hat; I had not myself seen the prisoner offer violence to anybody.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say a man who was bloody desired you to take the prisoner for assaulting him, you attempted to take him, and then he and another struck you? A.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw the prisoner strike some man? A. I saw him strike Sim, and before that saw him strike a man - that was not in the Policeman's presence; there were too many shoving about for me to tell which hand he struck the Policeman with - I was about five yards from him; I have seen the person who gave him in charge several times - I never quarrelled with the prisoner; I was not a Policeman at that time - I had been one, and was turned out for taking a man's cape by mistake, by my serjeant's advice, as I was going on duty; I have been reinstated since - one of the women who were fighting was the prisoner's sister; I knew the other well, but am not related to her - I do not think she has any certain place to live in; I saw her last about a month ago - the prisoner was endeavouring to get his sister from the women when they were fighting.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. The prosecutor was carried to my house between four and five o'clock on the day in question, perfectly insensible, with a wound two or three inches long at the back of his head, quite down to the bone; it was a dreadful wound - it was bleeding profusely; I got the skin together, sewed it up, and by that time he became sensible and complained of great pain on the left side, not bearing to be moved - he evinced all the symptoms of broken ribs; his skull was not fractured - the integuments were devided to the bone; he was labouring under concussion of the brain - he is entirely recovered now.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Can you at all fix the time, when the first blow was given, when the man was given in charge? A. No, but think it was an hour and a half before - I saw no blows given in the intermediate time; some of the people had gone away, but not all - the place had never become quiet, not without two or three or four of them quarrelling; I saw no fighting from the time the prisoner gave the man the blow till he was going to be taken into custody - the prisoner had gone into a house, or somewhere; I cannot say how long he had been absent.</p>

            . I live at the corner of Walker's-court, Peter-street. On the 10th of October I was sitting in my parlour, and heard a terrible noise; I ran out, about five o'clock, and as soon as I got out I saw the Policeman laying down and a man standing to pull him over - I said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090073"/>"What, do you want to kill the man?" as soon as he saw me he ran away - I pursued; he made a hit at me with the staff - I put up my left arm, and as soon as he saw me he said, "I am very sorry Mr. Nott, I did not know it was you; I won't hit you."</p>
               <p>Q. Who was this? A. The man who hit the Policeman - I saw him take the Policeman's truncheon, and strike him - he had hold of the Policeman round the waist, wrenched the truncheon out of his hand, and hit him; the prisoner is not the man who hit the Policeman, I will swear that positively; if it was the last word I had to say the man I saw strike him was not the prisoner; I did not see the Policeman knocked down; he was down - I saw the man take the truncheon from the Policeman's hand; I took hold of him, and tried to get him away from the Policeman - he ran off, and held up the truncheon.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. What are you? A. A tripeman; there was no more disturbance than there is every Sunday - I did not see the prisoner there; I cannot swear he was not there - on my solemn oath, he is not the man who went away with the truncheon, and afterwards threw it down; the man's name is Doherty - he is the prisoner's brother; he has been a pot-boy - he is rather bigger than the prisoner, I think; I never knew he was his brother before - I had seen him many times before; I did not see him throw the truncheon down - I did not see the prisoner there; I have known him about there for the last twelve months, but never spoke to him - he is not the man who struck the Policeman - I have never been a publican; I never kept the Barley Mow - I did not attend before the Magistrate; I knew he was in custody, but did not know it was for a capital offence - I thought it was only an assault.</p>
               <p>- GIBBONS. I live in Green-court, Peter-street; my husband is a marble-mason. On the Sunday morning in question I went to tea with a friend at a green grocer's, in Peter-street - I heard a noise, and went out, between four and five o'clock; I saw the Policeman Mace trying to take the prisoner into custody - the mob hallooed out "He shan't go," and rescued him from Mace; I saw the prisoner make his escape up Berwick-street, and on that another man took a staff from the prosecutor - he was knocked down first, then the man wrenched the staff out of his hand, and gave him a blow; I am sure the prisoner was away before that; I have known his person three years - I saw him run away before Sim was struck; one of the crowd knocked Mace down - he got up again, and while he was getting up one of the mob rescued the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Then he had still hold of the prisoner, and the mob rescued him? A. Yes, and I saw him run up Berwick-street - I then saw a stouter man than the prisoner, in a short jacket, strike Sim; he knocked him down, and in attempting to get up, the staff was wrenched out of his hand; the person gave him a blow on the head, and ran off - Nott followed him; the prisoner wore a dark coat with skirts -Nott followed the man in the short jacket; I solemnly swear it was not the prisoner - I did not distinctly see the man's face, but I saw his dress.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Then Nott was close to you? A. I did not say so.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw Nott following the prisoner? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have said he followed the man who struck the blow; if you said that was the prisoner, is it a mistake? A. It was a mistake - it was a man in a round jacket.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. There was a great crowd? A. Yes, and a great noise; there were two or three hundred people - I was on the the step of the door, and above the crowd, so that I could see them; I heard them say the Policeman was killed - he laid there for dead: I heard somebody say"Kill the bl-y Police!" and I was quite shocked; I was not in the road, but standing at the door - it was not the prisoner that struck the blow.</p>

            . I live in New-street, near Peter-street. I was standing by the side of Sim at the time he was knocked down, so close, that when he fell he came against me - I saw a man strike him on the head, and knock him down with his own staff, which he pulled out of his hand; I should know the man again if I saw him - it was not the prisoner; I have seen the prisoner several times before, and knew him - I should know him from one hundred men- on my oath he did not strike the Policeman any more than I did; I saw him in New-street a few minutes before it happened - it was some minutes before the Policeman was knocked down: he stood at my door, which is but a minute's walk from the place, and I saw him afterwards.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Were you near Mrs. Gibbons? A. No - there was a great crowd, and I could not notice every body; I first saw the prisoner at my own door, a few minutes before the Policeman was struck - I came out, and stood in the street, the same as another; I often go and stand there on Sunday evenings - I saw Mrs. Gibbons in the crowd, and Nott too; I saw him cross the street - I put my hands on his shoulder, and begged him not to follow the man, or he would get knocked down; I saw the staff in the man's hand - I did notice that he threw it down; I should know him again if I saw him - I cannot say what coat he wore; I have not spoken to the prisoner since - his wife desired me to come here.</p>

            . I am a plasterer - I live in Stacey-street. I remember the affray in Peter-street; I was standing outside Martin's public-house, between four and five o'clock, about three yards from the row; I saw Mace knocked down, and then Sim, and while he was down the staff was taken from him, and as he rose he was struck on the back of the head with it - the prisoner's brother is the person who did it; I knew him before, and am quite sure of it - I knew the prisoner before, and am positive it was not him.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. How long have you been acquainted with the prisoner? A. As long as I can recollect - he is a lithographic printer; I assisted to carry the Policeman to the doctor - I did not see the man carry the staff away; I was taken up as one of the rioters - I was there about a quarter of an hour, but was not taking part in it; the man was dressed in a white short jacket.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is the prisoner less than the brother? A. No, the brother is bigger - he resembles him a little in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090074"/>the face; his nose is rather on one side - the prisoner lived in Mead's-court, not above one hundred yards off - he left that house about a week after the row; both the brother and the mother went away.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Was not the prisoner's brother taken into custody with you? A. Yes; the prisoner was taken a good time after we came out of prison - I was taken directly I had carried the man to the doctor's, and discharged in about a week.</p>

I and Cosgrove were coming through Berwick-street into Peter-street, and saw the prisoner at the same time coming into Peter-street - my friend and him got into a quarrel about something, and my friend gave the prisoner in charge to a Policeman; I think it was Sim; it was the one who got cut on the head; I did not see the man knocked down - the prisoner and my friend got quarrelling in the street; both called the Police - I was trying to separate them, but before I could get assistance to get them asunder the Policeman was struck - at the time the Policeman was struck, the prisoner and my friend were struggling on the ground; I could not part them; they were not out of my sight before that; when I got them apart there were four men carrying the Policeman to the doctor's.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Herring, the owner of the van - I was by the van when Tindall went to deliver the goods; I saw his coat on the seat - I saw the two prisoners pass the van, and am certain of them; they came back again - I crossed over the way to speak to a customer, and while there the two prisoners came by on the same side as I was then on; I heard one say to the other, "Do you see that person in a cap?" I had a cap on - the other replied, "He has nothing to do with it:" they then crossed over to the side of the van - I saw Linsey take the coat off the seat; he was then on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090076"/>other side of the van, but I distinctly saw him take it and give it to the other - they both ran away; I pursued, overtook Linsey and secured him - Freak got away, and while I was waiting for an officer, three or four minutes after, he came back, and was going to walk by as if he knew nothing of the matter, and I gave him in charge; he had not got the coat then - I am certain of his person.</p>
               <p>Linsey. Q. Was I walking or running when you took me? A. Running - you were smoking a pipe when you passed the van, before the coat was taken, but not when I took you.</p>
               <p>Freak. At the time I was passing between the van and where he laid hold of the other prisoner, it was very dark; I was passing ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after - he collared me, and said, "You have got it:" I said,"What do you collar me for?" he said he had lost a coat, and that I took it - I said, "Well, put me under the gateway and send for an officer;" does it stand to reason that I should come by after taking the coat? it is impossible to distinguish a person in such a street as that.</p>
               <p>Witness. I had light enough to distinguish him; I had had three views of them and have not the slightest  doubt of them - Freak threatened my life, going to the watch-house, and called me by a name which I cannot mention, saying what he would do when at liberty.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. What was the fence composed of? A. Brick-work, and a door-way, that door was found closed - the persons who entered the tool-house did not go that way, they went across a ploughed field and then into the garden.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you see foot marks at the back of the premises? A. Yes, of two persons - there is a ploughed field and a grass field at the back, and then an entrance into the garden; the door of the tool-house is at the back of the premises, and the footsteps were traced down the garden - the tool-house door was drawn too, but not locked; I pushed that open, and saw the lock hanging to the inner door, and the onions were gone; it had been secure on the Sunday - the onions had not been cut off, but drawn from the ties; I got a search-warrant, and went to Scate's house about eleven o'clock; we found the onions behind the shutter, in a suck - this prisoner did not lodge at Scate's, but Wilson, who has escaped, did - the prisoner and Scate were both apprehended, but the bill was thrown out against Scate - these are the onions, and these are my ties - this is the sack the onions were in.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 5th of December, about four o'clock, my brother came into my room, and lit a candle at the rush-light I had burning - I was awake, but did not speak to him; my husband was fast asleep - I then thought I heard two persons in the house - I came down and saw Perry and Wilson there; they had some onions - they were picking off the ties, and putting them into a sack, which was afterwards taken by the officer - I said to my brother, "For goodness sake, what have you been after?"- he told me to go to bed again; I think my brother said they went after the apples, but they were gone, and they had brought the onions.</p>

            , a pawnbroker, in Gray's-Inn-lane; but I did live at Mr. Board's, in Shoreditch. I believe the prisoner pawned some carpet there in March or April, which I think was claimed by Mr. Butcher about two months afterwards - it was pawned in the name of Naggs, and to the best of my recollection the prisoner is the person who pawned it; I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>MR. BOARDS. I have the carpet which was pawned in the name of

             - I was in the shop, and know the prisoner is the person who pawned it; I can speak positively to him - 1s. 6d. was lent on it; I think it was about one yard and a half long.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BUTCHER. This is my carpet - we do not sell such small quantities, except once in two or three years, for bed-rooms - we have sold none since March.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you sold any before March? A. Not of this pattern - I swear positively this has not been sold; it was made at Kidderminster - the manufacturer is an extensive dealer - he sends to another house besides me, but I do not think this carpet has been sent there; I have no private-mark on it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to MR. BOARDS. Q. I observed you took some time to look at the prisoner? A. I do not know that I did - I had seen him at the office; it was on the 23rd of March that he pawned this; I have a perfect recollection of his person - I am sure I have seen him more than once; I cannot swear whether it was evening or morning, but I think I could undertake to swear he had a fustian coat on - I am almost certain of that; I swear the prisoner pawned the carpets.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is the last line on this duplicate? A. No. 9, Vincent-street, and L. for lodger - it is not because I see the name of Naggs on the duplicates that I swear to the prisoner; I know him so well I could not be mistaken in his name - I believe he had a fustian coat on, but I am not positive; I cannot tell whether it was in the day time or the evening.</p>
               <p>MR. BUTCHER. These have never been sold nor been in wear - they are remnants for bedside pieces; here is one I can swear to more particularly - I had it made to my own taste; it did not answer, and was thrown aside.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not you swear to the other as positively as a man could swear to them? A. Yes, but I said there was another house had it, and this is a pattern not likely to be sent to the other house; I sent the pattern to Kidderminster, and the manufacturer might have made it.</p>

I took the prisoner in Old Nichol-street, Shoreditch - on the 20th of November there was a fire and he came to see it; I told him I had received information that he had absconded from Mr. Butcher, in consequence of some carpeting - he made no reply, but made a little resistance; he did not get out of my hands - I found no duplicate on him, only some halfpence.</p>
               <p>MR. BUTCHER. This is my carpet.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What is the name of your firm? A. Halfhide and Co., but I have no partner - my son manages the business, but has no share in it; I never allowed him to pawn any goods, but I have pardoned him for it, upon a promise that he would not do it again; I said before Mr. Metcalf that I was aware a fork had been pawned by the prisoner - he never left my employ; I took him from the board; I have heard that he has worked for Mr. Metcalf - I gave a seal to Mr. Metcalf to do, and he gave it to my own man to do it; I will not swear that Mr. Metcalf, Jun. did not tell me the prisoner worked for his father as well as for me, but I have no knowledge that he did - I do not know whether Mr. Metcalf is in business for himself or not - they are in opposition to Mr. Strongitharm, in Pall-mall; my house is at the other end of the street; I did not know the prisoner was working for Mr. Metcalf - he was to work for me only; I only knew it by seeing his book when he was taken up -I have no recollection of knowing it from Mr. Metcalf: the prisoner had lived with me about thirteen years - he was a good workman, and would have been of value to any one who employed him - the prisoner's uncle has been employed in my house for fifty years - I have given him seals to engrave, partly for amusement; he was principally supported by me - I was brought up with him, and had it not been so, I should not have taken the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Did you ever commission him to pawn any thing? A. No; I had no communication with Mr. Metcalf till I found something out - I had no knowledge of his going into Mr. Metcalf's employ.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner as long as I can remember; he came to me some time ago, making a communication about some fancy stones - I think it was some time in October; he said he had a few fancies to sell - I said if they were worth any thing, I would buy them of him; he wanted 1l. or a guinea for them - I said I had no objection to give him that; he then brought six fancies - I just looked at them, but I can scarcely swear whether they had impressions with them or no - they were common place sort of things, but I bought them; I mentioned to him, that a year or two since, I was over at his house, and bought a book-case, and in the drawer were a number of what we call working impressions - I said, "They are of no use to you, will you let me have them;" he said"There is one I should not like to part with, the others you may have if you like," and I had them; there were three or four dozen of them - the stones I bought of the prisoner went out of my hands into the hand of Mr. Jones, Mr. Halfhide's jeweller; I have seen six stones, which I believe were the same I gave to be set; I gave them to the officer - to the best of my knowledge, they were the same I gave to be set; I gave an indefinite order to mount them in good mountings - they were of ideal value.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. But you would not take upon yourself to swear to them, I should think? A. No; I should think no one could without a private mark - the prisoner has occasionally worked for me and my father; I never mentioned it, but either the prosecutor or his son, said, "I suppose it will be Brown from Halfhide's, and Metcalf from Strongitharm's" - the prosecutor and the officer were present at the time; my father and I are in opposition to Mr. Strongitharm - I remember the prosecutor speaking in reference to some spoons off which the crest had been removed; he said he had no objection to his pawning, so long as he brought things back - the prisoner has worked for my father for a number of years, to my knowledge; he has occasionally given him work to do - he has borne an honest character.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was this declaration respecting pawning, after the prisoner was in custody on this very charge? A. Yes, he was alluding to a spoon, and when he saw the crest was filed off, he said he could have no intention of returning that - and what he said about,"Brown from Halfnide's, and Metcalf from Strongitharm's," was said in my shop - the prisoner was employed at Mr. Halfhide's constantly, but at his leisure hours he might do a job occasionally; he might have done two arms in the course of last year for me - he did more for my father; I do not know how many - I know my father has often said, Brown has got so and so.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 28th of October, I took the prisoner at the prosecutor's shop; I produced to him this card of impressions, and asked what he had done with the stones which made them; he said he had sold them to Mr. Metcalf a fortnight or three weeks before - I searched him in the shop, and found in his breeches pocket, a cornelian stone, with the figure of Hope on it; I had made him no threat or promise - I took him to the office, and then searched his lodging in Newman-street, in consequence of information I received from Mr. Halfhide - I found a woman who acknowledged herself to be his wife, but I had not seen them together; I found at his lodgings the duplicates of the property which has been produced, and some others.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you find the duplicate of the tablefork? A. Yes, and of the seal-setting on the same duplicate, pawned for 1l. on the 4th of August, 1829; I also found the four duplicates of the articles pawned at Mr. Lawton's -I have the six seals and an eye-glass, which I received from Mr. Metcalf; these seals exactly correspond with these impressions.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then the prisoner told you at once he had sold these stones to Mr. Metcalf? A. Yes; I did not know Mr. Metcalf at that time - I never saw the prisoner at his lodgings, nor the woman and him together; I did not ask the prisoner whether he had engraven these things himself.</p>
               <p>MR. METCALF re-examined. These six seals are the same as I received from the jeweller to whom I gave the stones to set - and, to the best of my belief, these impressions correspond with these seals; they appear so to do, but I think some have been taken since they were mounted, and some before - these two seem to be taken before they were mounted, they appear to tally; two stones can be engraven so nearly alike, as to give the same impression - the impressions appear like these stones, but I could not say they came from them, unless I were to take an impression and examine them with an eye-glass, and then they might be so imitated that I could not tell - I have no reason to doubt that these are the stones I gave to be mounted, but I could not swear to these; they were away for a week or ten days - here are seven impressions on this card, and six of them correspond with these stones; I have known the prisoner many years - he lived in Castle-street, Leicester-square, and then he said he lived in Newman-street; I understood from himself that he was married; I do not know whether he had any children.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not Newman-street a street in which a great many artists live? A. I do not know - there is nothing to prevent the jeweller who set these stones from being here; there was nothing clandestine in the prisoners dealing with me - I gave them to the same man to set who works for Mr. Halfhide; there are a great many of these impressions in the trade.</p>
               <p>MR. HALFHIDE. I sent the officer to his house in Newman-street - it is a house of my own, and he lived there; the woman was his wife - she had been a servant of mine, and married from my house; these are the impressions from the stones which were taken from me, and these are the stones - they are some very fine ones, which I bought a great many years ago; I have no doubt in the world of their being mine, no more than I have of being here - this seal ferrule is mine; I came to town, and charged the prisoner with stealing the stones - he denied it; I did not hold out any promise or threat to him - I told him I knew he had sold these stones, and where he had sold them; he then said he had taken them - this other seal was found in his pocket; this duplicate of the fork was found in an old pocket in the house in Newman-street - this silver lid is mine, and this book; I valued these stones at 6s. 6d. each, which is a low price; I never gave him any power, authority, or commission to pawn or sell any one of these things.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is that spoon in the state in which it was? A. No; there was a crest on it and a coronet, but they are filed off - I had applied to a pawnbroker before, and they said they would not take in a spoon with a crest and coronet on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was any one present when he told you about these stones? A. No, not at first, but he confessed it before the officer; the impressions on these stones are private-marks - they were done by the prisoner's uncle; it is so difficult a thing to do the same work on two stones, that I do not think it quite possible; there may be hundreds of impressions of a leaf similar to this, but not like it - there may be imitations, but not fac similes; I believe no man could imitate one of these, and place them before me, without my being able to see the difference - I differ from Mr. Metcalf in that respect; I do not know that he can see better than I, though he is a young man - his father has been a great many years in business; here is no private-mark on this seal but the work, and here is a bull's head on this one, which cannot be seen with the naked eye - I have no private-mark on any of them.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Can you put a mark on a cornelian stone? A. Yes - there is a particular manner in which artists view seals, so as to know them; it is very difficult to do two things alike - I had a spoon-fork like this, with a crest on it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence The spoon-fork and lid are not Mr. Halfhide's; they were given to me, and he was fully aware of what I had done with them twelve months ago- he said he would not have prosecuted me if he had not had a jealousy that I worked for others; I am indebted to him, and he stated a few weeks ago that he would either arrest or prosecute me - if he arrested me, he said he supposed I should take the benefit of the Act; these impressions have been in my possession for years - some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090082"/>I had from Mr. Aspin's, and a brother of mine, who worked there, collected them; I have done some of them myself - I have done work at my own house, and sat up nights and nights together, and even worked on Sundays, that the prosecutor's work might be finished; I remember eighteen months ago a stone was broken, and I worked on the Sunday to do another, and went with him to take it home - it is through maliciousness that he has got up this prosecution, because I had worked for other people; my uncle worked at the same shop before he went apprentice, and for the last two years my uncle being infirm and hard of hearing, I have done work for him unknown to my employer; Mr. Halfhide has been in the habit of looking out little stones for my uncle to engrave - I have done dozens and dozens, which have gone to India.</p>

            . This money was mine - there were thirteen penny-pieces, and twenty-two halfpence, which I had put on the counter, in a little shop in <placeName id="t18301209-152-crimeloc864">Essex-street, Battle-bridge</placeName>

On the 15th of November I went out about eight yards from the shop - I saw the prisoner come up the street, and turn into the shop; I stooped down, and saw him draw his hand from the place where the money was - I was going in, and he came out; when he had got a few yards I called Master! he then ran down a street; a person I spoke to ran after him, and gave him in charge of the Policeman - he was brought back, and I asked him to give me my money; he said he would see me d-d first.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. By virtue of your oath, who left that money on the table? A. I did - I did not swear that my mother took it out of the till, and left it on the table; I had gone to the next door but one; I did not say I ad left the house in care of a neighbour.</p>

On the 30th of October, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I saw a man and woman in the shop - the prisoner served them with a piece of cheese; I passed by them, and saw the woman had a half-crown laying on the counter - I went to the door and heard the half-crown taken, and change given, but I did not hear it drop into the till - I turned back; the prisoner was shutting the till - I saw his right hand was closed, and I judged the half-crown was in it; he went to the back of the shop, and took up a book - I asked what he was looking for, he said he was looking for an entry - I said I would look for that, and told him to go and serve a customer; he still had his right-hand closed - he could not serve, and he put his hand into his inner coat pocket, and took it out open - I called him and another young man into the parlour, and asked him to allow me to put my hand into his coat pocket, which I did, and found this half-crown in it - it was his duty to put the money immediately into the till; he ought never to put it into his pocket.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Where is the till? A. We have two; the one he ought to have put this into is farthest from the door: he then went to the desk, was turning the book over, and looking for some entries he had no business with; money that is taken is never entered there - I will not swear I said, "You have a half-crown," but I think I did; I believe I told him he deserved to be kicked out, and he ought to be ashamed to rob me in that manner - I cannot swear I did not order him to leave my house; he said his boxes could be searched, and there was nothing there of mine.</p>

            . I received the four half-crowns, and put them into the till, between eight and half-past eight o'clock in the morning, while the prisoner was at breakfast; I staid in the shop about ten minutes, till he returned, and then I went to my breakfast - we were then both called in, and asked what money we had.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you examine the till before you put them in? A. I took all the money out, and left nothing but these four half-crowns, one shilling, and one sixpence; the prisoner has never given change when the till could not provide the change - that has never happened; I have never returned when I could not get change, and got it from the prisoner - no customer came while I was in the shop.</p>

            . I left my place on the Saturday night before the Monday on which this happened, and when out of place I lodge where the prisoner does - I was there when the prosecutor complained of being robbed; I was in bed with a had knee - he did not go out of the house; he stood at the door - he came in again, and I asked what he had been robbed of; he said 5s. - there were a great many words between him and the prisoner; he said he would give her blows if she did not return the money, and if she would give him 6s. he would let her go - I suppose he staid in the house near an hour before the officer was called; he returned to the house again said if we could make him up 6s. he would liberate the prisoner, and was very sorry for having her locked up - he said he wanted to stop there all night, and wanted to lay down on the fire-side carpet.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What sort of a house is this? A. I believe it is a house for the reception of men and women -I never knew any harm of it.</p>

On Tuesday, the 7th of December, I was in the neighbourhood of the House of Lords; I left Scotland-yard between one and two o'clock, and staid there about two hours - the prisoner came and stood by the pillar where they usually dismount to go into the House of Lords; when he had stood there about half an hour, he came over to where I and another man were standing, and asked us if the Duke of Wellington had gone in yet, and said, he wanted to speak to him; I said, "This is a very unlikely place for you to speak to the Duke of Wellington" - he said "I would make him speak to me, if I was to see him;" he then said, he was sent by the Almighty to take away the heads of the land - I told him, the Duke was gone into the house; he then asked, did I think what time he would be out - I said, I could not tell; a few minutes after that the Duke's horse and servant came down - I told him, that was the Duke's horse and man, if he wanted to see him to speak to him; the servant rode up and down for some time, till he was called - he then drew over near to us, where the gentlemen come down from the House of Lords; a cloak was handed to the servant, and he went away - the prisoner came over to me again, and told me he would wait till next day, and if he did not meet the Duke of Wellington, he would meet some others of the heads of the house - I then accompanied him as far as the Strand, and in parting, he said he should be there next day at eleven o'clock, and I should see him execute his order - I went into the Secretary of State's office, and gave information of such a person coming; I kept walking up and down next morning to look for him, but did not see him.</p>

I was there on the 8th of December, and saw the prisoner a little after ten o'clock walking up and down the colonade, which is the principal door at which the Peers enter; he kept walking up and down for about half an hour, and was then joined by another person who instantly after left him, and he took his station under the colonade, by the door leading to the King's entrance -I was within the door of the Peer's entrance about the time he took his station, and when Mr. Gilbert arrived and came on duty, I told him what I had observed, and pointed the prisoner out; Mr. Gilbert went out and spoke to him, but what passed between them I cannot say - I saw Mr. Gilbert take him by the collar; the prisoner instantly took a pistol out of his pocket; Mr. Gilbert retreated a little, appeared rather alarmed, and ran down the colonade, saying the man had got a pistol - I instantly rushed through the doors and followed the prisoner, when he had got about half way down the colonade.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he going after Gilbert? A. At the time, when he got half-way down the colonade, he made a sudden stop, turned round, and went into the road; I followed him - Kingsbury came towards him for the purpose of endeavouring to secure him, and when Kingsbury was within about a yard of him, he (the prisoner) levelled the pistol at him, in a direct line, as far as I could judge, to his head; Kingsbury had not touched him at that time - the prisoner then snapped the pistol, and a spark arose from the concussion of the flint against the pan; he was then taken into custody by myself and two more - it was a screw barrelled pistol; I saw it unscrewed, and there was a ball in it - we succeeded in throwing him on the ground, and while on the ground a knife was taken out of his left-hand great coat pocket; he was then taken into the coffee-room at the House of Lords, and given into the custody of the Black Rod, Sir

            . I am deputy-marshal of the King's household. On the 8th of December I was going to the House of Lords, on duty, and saw the prisoner there - I had seen him at the house on the Tuesday night, for a few minutes; when I came in the morning, Stoll informed me he had been there - he came again about a quarter to twelve o'clock, when I was at the house; I went out, seeing him through the glass - I asked what he wanted there, and who he was waiting for; he said he was waiting for a friend of his - I asked if his friend was the groom he had been seen talking to in the morning - (I had not myself seen that) he said it was not; I asked who it was he was waiting for- he said it was a person of more consequence, or words to that effect; I told him I did not like his appearance, and should take him into custody - he asked me by what authority I took him into custody - I collared him with my left-hand, for the purpose of taking him into the house, and after I collared him he took out the pistol, and levelled it at me; I was dressed in plain clothes, for I had not time to put on my uniform - when he asked by what authority I collared him I told him I was a King's officer, and he told me to show my authority; I made no reply, but collared him - he had his hands in his great coat pocket at that time, and he took the pistol from the right-hand pocket; he levelled it at me - I cannot say exactly at what part; I heard the pistol snap - I turned my head, and loosed him of course; I saw either the sparks or flash of the pistol, I cannot say which, because my back was towards him - I was dragging him into the house: on my loosing him he walked leisurely into the middle of the street, opposite to where the Peers are sat down - I called to Kingsbury and the witness to take him; when Kingsbury came up to my assistance, he ran up to the prisoner, and was going to assist me to take him; as soon as Kingsbury saw the pistol he drew back for a moment - the prisoner still had the pistol in his hand; Kingsbury and the witness closed in upon him, and got him down - he had presented the pistol at Kingsbury, and pulled the trigger; I saw the sparks - he must have cocked it again; when I saw the sparks Kingsbury closed in upon him, and Bryant got him behind - they got him down on the ground, and while we had him down Kingsbury wrenched the pistol from his hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You cannot remember the transaction very well, I should think? A. Yes, I can; I did not run away - I only ran about ten yards from these two men.</p>
               <p>Q. Storr says the prisoner ran after you? A. No such thing, for he did not go ten yards; I saw the pistol examined at Clerkenwell, but not before - there was a ball and flint in it; I will not say whether there was any thing else in it - Ruthven, the Bow-street officer, examined it; I was by his side, and merely looked at the ball, to see if it fitted the ball which he had in his pocket; he did not turn it up to see if there was any powder in it - he screwed it up again; I did not see him examine for powder.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You mean you do not know whether he examined to see for powder? A. No; I saw him take the ball out, and try another which he had in his pocket - I saw the pistol snapped, and saw sparks; I did not observe any smoke - I must be about half a yard from it when he snapped it at me; I was at arms length - I saw no smoke at either time.</p>

On Wednesday, the 8th of December, about twelve o'clcok, I saw the prisoner there - I did not see him do any thing with the pistol; I heard Mr. Gilbert call out to stop him: I saw the prisoner, and attempted to stop him - I got within a quarter of a yard of him, and he snapped the pistol against my cheek; there were sparks from the flint - the pistol did not go off; I received no hurt - I afterwards saw him searched, and a knife found in his pocket; the pistol was taken from his hand - I did not examine it myself then.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How near was the pistol to your cheek? A. About an inch; I had run up to stop him, but did not touch him before he snapped the pistol, nor did I say any thing to him - he was walking very fast towards me, but I walked faster than him, and to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say the pistol was close to your cheek? A. It snapped against my cheek; it was within a few inches of me - I saw no smoke.</p>
               <p>Q. If any smoke had flashed up out of it, must you not have seen it? A. I must; I examined the pistol at Clerkenwell, and found a ball in it, but did not see any powder in it at all - I only examined the ball; I saw Mr. Gilbert pull the ball out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If there had been powder must you not have discovered it? A. Yes; there was none - the barrel unscrews close to where the powder would be.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. The ball rests on a concave surface? A. Yes; the apperture through which the powder is admitted is very small - there might be powder in it without my seeing it; I only looked to see if there was a ball.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you to say, if there had been powder you must have discovered it? A. I did not examine - I only saw the ball taken out; the chamber for the powder under the cup was examined at Clerkenwell: I saw no powder - if there had been any I think I must have seen it; I cannot say whether there was any or not.</p>

            . On Wednesday last, about twelve o'clock, I was at the drawing-room window, of No. 1, Palace-yard. I saw the prisoner and another person standing near the steps, at the entrance to the House of Lords - I saw one of the two (not the prisoner) step back, and immediately the prisoner presented at him a pistol, which flashed in the pan; he presented it at the other person, who was then apparently receding from him.</p>
               <p>Q. By flashing in the pan do you mean that there was more than sparks, or the appearance of powder? A. There was a slight discharge of powder; I then saw two men approach the prisoner rapidly, and saw nothing further, for I ran immediately down stairs, and crossed the road to their assistance - I found the same two men there; it was one of those had snapped the pistol; I assisted to take the prisoner into the House of Lords - he talked very incoherently,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090090"/>and stated that he had a commission for the destruction of the heads of the land, referring at the same time to his pocket-book, as containing that commission, or some letters which would give an explanation of his conduct - I was at Clerkenwell when the pistol was examined; I saw it unscrewed and the ball taken out, but there was no examination made as to whether it contained powder.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You was there, I suppose, from beginning to end. till the pistol was taken away? A. Yes, except while I crossed the road - I cannot say there was powder in the pistol; it was pointed at Mr. Gilbert when I saw it flash - I saw nobody at that moment, except Gilbert and the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a principal officer of Bow-street. The prisoner was given into my charge on Wednesday last, but not the pistol; I found that in Mr. Gilbert's possession, and believe he has it now.</p>
               <p>MR. GILBERT. I have produced the pistol here to-day in the same state as I took it from the prisoner, except that Ruthven unscrewed it at Clerkenwell; I took it from Kingsbury, when he had hold of the prisoner - he had just taken it out of his hand when he was down; I saw Ruthven unscrew it, to see if a key would fit - it was returned to me, and I have had it ever since; we did not search all the prisoner's pockets at the time; Ruthven found the key in his pocket with some ball.</p>

             (unscrewing the pistol). There is powder in it now.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could any portion of the powder have escaped? A. It appears, by the paper it has been wrapped in, that some has escaped - here is some in the paper now; here is the knife (producing a sort of carving knife).</p>
               <p>Q. Might not some portion of the powder have escaped from the pan as well? A. Certainly, some portion has escaped from the pan - after the pan was opened it would fall out of the barrel into the pan, through the touch-hole; immediately on the prisoner's being put into my custody I put him into a coach, and took him to the House of Correction - I searched him, and in his right-hand waistcoat pocket I found this pistol key, two bullets, some powder in a paper, and a Prophetic Almanack - the claspknife and almanack were in his right-hand breeches pocket - the key fits the pistol; I opened it with it.</p>
               <p>MR. GILBERT. The large knife produced I took from his left-hand coat pocket naked, not in a case.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the pistol examined previous to your giving it to Ruthven? A. No, I did not open it; I had no key.</p>
               <p>The prisoner (who had frequently interrupted the witness, and conducted himself in a wild and incoherent manner) being called on for his defence, stated, as near as could be understood, as follows: - "I have nothing to say - I did what I was commissioned to do by God Ahnighty, and if I had done what I was commissioned to do, every man would have trembled at my presence; it is ten years since God gave me the commission - I went to Baltimore to get a commission, but by the providence of God I did not succeed; I left there, and while I was in the ship the idea came into my head that punishment would meet the inhabitants of the whole earth - I found the hand of God upon me in the vessel; I asked the captain to direct the ship to go back - he asked what I meant, and would not; God Almighty, by a miracle, all at once changed the wind, and it was obliged to return, I went to the city, and gave myself out to be a prophet to warn them all of the approaching destruction; I came home to this country - it wore off, but it would not let me be quite; I came to London a few months ago, determined to preach to the people, and tell them of the judgment of God - I saw death staring me in the face, and I pledged myself to Almighty God that I would then go and preach to the people if he would spare me, and I would put my order into execution; if I had gone to the head Magistrate of the City, and put an end to his life every man would have trembled at my presence: it is shocking to think that the fifteen thousand souls who fell at Waterloo, who that Glorious Being came down and spilt his precions blood for, should be all demned if I had not seen a spot in the sun which has never been seen since the creation of the world, and it is a sure sign that the son of God is coming."</p>

             re-examined. I conceive a pistol of this sort may be loaded at the touch-hole - there is some portion of powder in the paper, and in the pistol; I do not think what now remains would be sufficient to discharge the ball with any effect - I examined it on the Saturday following; it might have been loaded at the time, and the powder have escaped in the intermediate time; Mr. Gilbert held it quite upright in his hand - I put the key in, unscrewed it, and found the ball.</p>

I am the prisoner's cousin, and have known him from a child - he has been a seafaring man; I have lost sight of him a great many years - the last time I saw him was about the 26th of October - he called at my house, and spoke to me about visions; he said he had recently come from Amercia - that he had been sent with a mission to preach repentance; he told me he had been put in prison some years since in Baltimore, for attemting to preach with a sword in his hand, and I believe threatening to destroy the authorities there - he told me that in his passage home this time the Lord had wrought a miracle, and changed the wind when he wished the captain to put back - he spoke of visions which he had seen, but I cannot recollect the particulars; he said he was afraid to stay in Ireland for fear of his life - I asked why, he said the country people would attack him on account of his once having had property in tithes - he asked for a Bible, and wished to preach to me, and said something<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090091"/>about his guardian having robbed him - his guardian is now dead, but I believe him to have been a strictly honourable man in every respect; I felt alarmed, and did all I possibly could to pacify him - he offered me no violence; I have conversed with him twice within thirteen years - he was always incoherent; my father was a captain in the merchant-service, and took him first to sea - he was his second mate when he was twenty-one years old; I was a child at that time, but I recollect hearing of his changing a watch of his father's for an old rusty gun - I have heard some account of his attempting to fire at his father, but I was quite young then; he has a sister now in the Cork Lunatic Asylum, and his brother died raving made in a lunatic asylum somewhere near Cork - the last time I saw him I spoke in very strong terms to my father to write to his relations that they should have some care taken of him -I did not think him safe to be at large; I had said I thought him insame many years ago - I should say he is decidedly insane, and I think it a family disease.</p>

            . I am a wine-merchant, and live in Howard-street, Norfolk-street, Strand - I was born at Cork; I have not seen the prisoner for eight years till to-day. About eight years ago, I was surprised at his suddenly telling me that he had seen visions, and I think he said he had seen two visions, one was while he was on ship-board, in America, but I cannot recollect the particulars; as well as I can recollect the purport of it was that the world was coming to an end - he was generally thought to be of unsound mind after he came from sea - he kept talking of visions, and fancying a conspiracy on his family, to rob him of his property - this was about eight years ago; his guardian's character was such as not to admit a belief that what the prisoner said was true- I believe him to be decidedly insane - he was certainly insane on the point of seeing visions, and being the victim of a conspiracy.</p>
               <p>MR. MCMURDO. We consider delusions a very common test of insanity; and that of a man's family conspiring against him is one of the most common, and what we are apt to regard as a test of an unsound state of mind.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. You first saw him flourishing the pistols in the air, and using incoherent expressions? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am inspector of the Westminster division of the Police. I searched the prisoner's apartment, and found in a box a blunderbuss not loaded, a canister of powder for 1lb., a quantity of bullets and swan shot, a few gun flints, and some pistol flints - I also found a bundle of papers, not prints: there was nobody in the room - he has a daughter sixteen years old, but no wife.</p>
               <p>JOHN BATHO. The prisoner lodged in my house, No. 7, Broadway, Westminster; the apartment searched belonged to him, he has one daughter - he had been in a very unsettled state of mind before this; I have known him about three months - I live in the house myself; about six weeks ago, he came down on a Monday morning when he usually pays his rent, he fell down on his knees three times in my shop, and talked incoherently, as he has done to day; I observed the same conduct two or three times since - he has not appeared to me at all in his right mind for the last six weeks; one night, about six weeks ago, I heard a quarrel up stairs between his daughter and himself, and repeated cries of murder from her - I went up and endeavoured to pacify him; she had offended him, but in what way I cannot say; she told me he had been beating her, and put my hand to her head to feel a blow he had inflicted - I had seen no provocation on her part towards him; this ill treatment occurred about twice, to my knowledge - but the day after this happened she left home and did not return; I consider his mind overpowered by Religion.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. What I have to say is, I cried out"Rose green Loretto, her green flags rise up:" that is,"Blessed mother Loretto, mother of our church, and goddess above rise up" - I said nothing else till the man arrested me, and I fired at him in defence of her name; she is our goddess, and every body that does not believe in her cannot be saved - the law of God must not be broken, and if they do not believe in her, that will become their condemnation; it is useless for them to be ignorant and live in darkness - she is the light from Heaven that is bestowed that the world should not be so dark; all nations will worship her, it is the will of God, and the will of God must be done, and will be done - I fired in defence of that holy name; I would have fired at him, or any body, in defence of that holy name - I molested nobody; no heretic that does not believe on her, will ever see the light of Heaven - I leave it all to Almighty God; God knows the best.</p>
               <p>The prisoner had interrupted the witnesses several times during the trial with the same sort of language, and whenever insanity was alluded to he always declared that he was "always in his senses."</p>
               <p>MR. MCMURDO. I am surgeon of Newgate. I have examined the prisoner three or four times; I have seen him daily while he has been in the prison- I have no doubt at all of his being in a state of extreme insanity.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. This incoherent manner does not appear put on, but a real disordered state of intellect? A. It does- I always found him in the same state.</p>
               <p>DR. MILLER. I accompanied Mr. McMurdo to see the prisoner last Saturday - I did not anticipate being called as a witness, but from what I saw of him that day, I conclude he is of unsound mind, and that is my opinion now; I have not the least doubt of his being insane.</p>
               <p>THOMAS LOMATH. I heard the report of the pistol; it made a very loud report.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was in the execution of my duty as a Christian to destroy that man, and the honour of my church, because he is rotten and blind - that holy name, there is no other God but her.</p>

On the 5th of November, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was at the shop door, and saw the prisoner standing opposite a pair of trousers which hung outside the window, and looking at them; he walked a little way down the street when he saw me looking at him, and shortly after I saw him again in the same place - I turned away, looked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090093"/>again, and saw him going down the street; I missed the trousers, and followed him - he walked down the street, and when he turned he ran as hard as he could; I ran after him, calling Stop thief! - he endeavoured to throw the trousers over a wall; they fell on the pavement - I picked them up, and gave them to the officer; I saw him throw them down - I followed and took him in Anchor-street. Spitalfields, and collared him; I told him I wanted him to go with me - he said, "What have I done?" I said, "You have stolen a pair of trousers;" he said, "I have stolen no trousers" - he began wrestling with me, and threw me down in the mud; I kept hold of him - we were both down; I saw a Policeman and gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to ask him where they hung. Witness. On an iron rail over the shop window - my head was turned when they were taken; I saw a young woman pass while he stood there, and he spoke to her -I lost sight of him twice; some boys told me which way you were gone - I went, and saw you walking as if nothing had happened; when I took you over two boys said you were not the man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see the trousers go out of his hand? A. I did - I am confident he is the man; he had a stick in his hand, and wore a jacket - I am confident of his features; I did not take him a quarter of a mile off - he could walk there in three minutes.</p>

            . I was coming up Knights-bridge, and met the prosecutor holding the prisoner - he gave him in charge for stealing a portmanteau, which he had left in the shop; I searched, but found nothing on him - he met a man on the road, who laughed at him: he said that man might be in the same situation as himself, and if he did steal it, nobody knew his circumstances better than himself.</p>

            . I am a saddler, and live in Oxford-street. I was at the Coach and Horses on the 5th of December - I went in at twenty minutes past five o'clock, and in a few minutes Barton and the prisoner came in; I saw them drinking together - Barton was very much intoxicated; he fell asleep about ten minutes after, calling for a pint of half-and - half, and I saw the prisoner put his left hand into Barton's left-hand waistcoat pocket - he took out some money; I could not see what - I went out for an officer, and brought Fisher in with me; I told him the prosecutor had just been robbed - he asked where the man was who had robbed him; I pointed to the prisoner, and said I believed he had the money then in his left hand - the Policeman found in his left hand a sovereign, two half-crowns, and a sixpence; this was as near half-past five o'clock as possible.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long were you absent looking for the Policeman? A. About a minute; the pri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090094"/>soner said he took it with the whole and sole intention of delivering it into the landlord's hands; he said that when it was found in his hand - he said nothing when he took it out, but I said, "You have just robbed that man," and he made no answer - he had time to put the money into his pocket while I was away; he could not have escaped conveniently, because I scarcely got outside before I met a Policeman; there might be seven or eight people in the house - the prosecutor sat next the fire-place, the prisoner next, and I next to him; others were in a better situation for seeing it than me, if they had looked, but nobody saw it; I can swear no rum was called for.</p>

            . I am a journeyman shoemaker, and live at No. 22, Goswell-street. On the 9th of December I was in Fleet-street, and saw the prisoner with a companion, trying two or three person's pockets who stood at a picture-shop window - Sweet was looking at that window; it is exactly opposite St. Bride's church - I saw the prisoner put his hand into Sweet's pocket, take the handkerchief out, and put it into the flap of his trousers; he and his companion both walked away together - (I should know his companion, he was taken and discharged); I immediately told Sweet to feel in his pocket, and he missed his handkerchief; he and I followed the prisoner - I collared him four or five doors from the print-shop, and charged him with it; he denied it, and said he had no handkerchief- I put my hand into the flap of his breeches, and took it from there; Sweet claimed it - I am positive it was the handkerchief I had seen him take from Sweet: I took him and his companion to the watch-house-they were both together; I gave the handkerchief to the officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You say you saw me pick the man's pocket - of course you must know which pocket I took it out of? A. I think it was from the left-hand pocket, but cannot be certain; he was close to the pockets - I did not say at the watch-house that I saw the other take it and give it to you.</p>

               <p>Q. How was it you did not take me instantly? A. I wanted to tell Sweet first; you walked away while I was telling him - I took you within two or three doors of Fleet-market, four or five doors or more from the picture-shop.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. How many person were about at the time? A. I did not see any person except the one to whom I gave the sword-stick - I believe when I got up there were two or three persons; none of them are here - in two or three minutes, I suppose, there were a dozen, but no one was near me till the Policeman came up; my friend is not here - the Policeman took the sword-stick from the man I gave it to: I believe he was a bricklayer - I believe one of the Policemen saw the beginning of the transaction; I was sober - I suppose the theatre closed about a quarter-past twelve o'clock; I then went to an oyster-shop, but had nothing to drink there - I do not know the name of the street; I am a stranger in town - I suppose I staid there an hour; I have the watch-guard on now which he was trying to break - the prisoner appeared to be drunk when he was taken; I did not make an observation about his being drunk before he struck me - no one was with him; I have not seen the purse since; I did not see any one near him at the time - there were plenty there in two or three minutes; I charged him with attempting to take my watch and purse before I got to the watch-house; I had seen my purse safe about two minutes before, as I had met a Policeman, and asked him to direct me to Somer's-town, and he did - I took my purse out to give him some silver, but I had none; I then put it in again safe.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable, and was on duty near Turnstile. I heard the cry of Police! went to the spot, and found Mr. Hodges rising from the ground- I saw the prisoner draw the sheath from his stick; he broke it, threw one piece away, and approached him with the other piece - they fell, and I came up and took the prisoner, while he lay on Mr. Hodges; I took charge of him- the prosecutor did not say the attempt at that moment: I took the prisoner to the watch-house, but found no money; a great many people had collected, and I gave him to my brother officer - in going along Great Queen-street; the prosecutor said he had robbed him of his purse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then he said nothing about his attempting to rob him at the time? A. He said he was going to take his watch away - when I came up to the place there were a dozen or near two dozen of common girls; there were three or four round at the time I came up - there were several round; I did not see the prisoner searched - I examined the place where the scuffle occurred after the prosecutor said he had lost his purse; there were some girls about the place - I saw the prosecutor rising from the ground, and the prisoner take the sword-sheath; the prisoner had an opportunity of handing away the purse if he had taken it - there were several persons round who attempted to hustle me off; I do not cousider that the prisoner was any more drunk than I am at this present time;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090098"/>he pretended to he drunk - several people followed us, and a great many staid.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I met the prosecutor at Turnstile, and he asked me the way to Somers' - town- I went and showed him part of the way; this was about two o'clock in the morning - he pulled out his purse, and said, "I have no silver, or I would give you something;" I said it was not required; I bade him good night, and soon after I heard Police! called - I went up, and took the prisoner from my brother officer - I took him to the watch-house, and searched him, but could find nothing but a few half-pence and some silver; there was a mob when I came up.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were any other persons near enough to take the purse from him? A. Yes, there was, from the prisoner or the prosecutor - they touched them: I believe the prisoner was let out afterwards, but I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going along Holborn, near Little Turnstile - the prosecutor said something to me about my being tipsy; I cannot recollect the words he said, but I turned round, and said if I was, it was not at his expence - he then gave me a slap on the face; I knocked him down, and in rising I saw he was drawing a sword-stick; I grasped at it, and broke it - he closed, and we fell.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was present when the prisoner was taken; I was informed he was bailed out on the Sunday, but I was not there - there was no charge made against him that night; it was by my orders that the prisoner and the prosecutor were taken to the watch-house, for being fighting in the street - they were both detained; this young gentleman was going about with a sword in his hand - he came to me, and said."Policeman, shake hands, I like the Police force, and the system too;" I then heard, Police! called, and ran up to the place - it was by my orders the prisoner and he were sent to the watch-house; the prosecutor never charged him with attempting to rob him till an hour and a half after they were in the watch-house; I heard they were let out on bail - the prosecutor was let out the same morning.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you at Turnstile at the time? A. Not at the first attack; I was a reserved man at the station-house, but was sent out patroling - it was between Turnstile and Holborn that I saw the parties; it was by my orders both of them were taken - there was a common woman of the town there; this young gentleman said,"This man knocked me down, and we had a fight;" I did not come up till the mob had gathered - I am not an inspector or superior officer, I am only a private Policeman; these others are my equals - they had seen more of the transaction; they had not got hold of the prisoner at the time I came up - there is another officer coming here; we considered that the best way was to take them to the station.</p>

            . I am a letter-press printer, in the employ of Vizetelly and Branston. I bailed the prisoner, and he remained at my house till six or seven o'clock on the Sunday evening; on the Monday morning, at half-past nine, I had occasion to go out - on my return he was waiting at my house, and said to me, "Come, young fellow, or we shall be too late," and we went to the Police-office; I have known him two years - he has been an honest young man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he keep good hours? A. Yes; when I have known him he always was at work at his regular time; I had seen him up to nine o'clock on that Saturday evening, when we were paid, and then we parted - I know where he went to; I did not go to Turnstile - I was in bed about twelve o'clock; the amount of the bail I gave was 20l. - that was before the inspector, who is not here; the inspector read the charge over to me, and it was for disorderly conduct in the street, and a street fight or row, I will not be positive which; he was not charged with felony at the time of bail.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL HODGES re-examined. Q. When was the first time you said you had been robbed of your purse? A. In five or ten minutes - the moment I missed it; I stated it when I got to the watch-house, and the prisoner was searched immediately - the inspector put me in a little room by the side, came and spoke to me, and then let me out on bail; I told the inspector I had been robbed, and he ordered the prisoner to be searched - I signed my hand to a paper.</p>

               <p>- Pocock. I am a Policeman.

               <p>SAMUEL HODGES re-examined. I have no recollection of seeing Pocock at all - I saw Carlisle, and asked him the road, and took out my purse; I put it safe back, and buttoned the pocket up - I was not drunk; I had been sitting five hours in the theatre, and then went to the oyster-shop, but I did not drink any thing, upon my oath.</p>

The prisoner came to their shop on the 10th of November, and had a cloak on her arm, which I suspected she had stolen from the door; I looked, and missed one - she then put it on a stool; I served her with what she wanted, and she took the cloak and went out - I followed her six or seven yards from the door; I then examined the cloak, and found it was my employer's - I asked her how she got it; she said a woman gave it her to carry - I had never seen her before; this is the cloak.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the prosecutor's shop, which is not five minutes walk from my lodging, to get some silk and some calico to finish my work - I came out and was crossing the road, when I recollected I wanted some black silk; I went back to the shop, and before I got to the window a woman asked me to carry the cloak to No. 12, Eyre-street-hill; I was going that way in a minute; I went into the shop, bought the silk, took up the cloak, and was coming out, not knowing it to be stolen- is it likely I should have gone and stolen the cloak in a public street, then go in, lay it down before the eyes of the shopman, take it up, and come out again with it?</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. What did I say to you? A. You said you had lately come from sea, and had 4l. 15s. in your captain's hands, and you would give me two sovereigns; you said you were running after the man that stole the shawl, but there was no one near you; there was no one in the street but you - there had been some rioting just before, and the people followed them.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM WHEATLEY. I am an officer. On the 3rd of December I saw the prisoner carrying these planes in Brick-lane, Spitalfields: I asked where he got them; he said from a sawyer, who had borrowed them of his master. and he was going to take them back - I took him to see if it were right; he told me of different people, but could not find any one - the next day I found the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BRYAN. These planes are mine. I lost them from <placeName id="t18301209-207-crimeloc1157">Essex-street, Whitechapel</placeName>

            . I am a constable. On the Saturday in question, I saw the two prisoners in company, in Jermyn-street, near the building where this affair took place, I think it was about seven o'clock - they were walking and standing about, and a third person was at a distance; in a day or two afterwards, I heard the men had lost their too's. and went to the pawnbroker's and found these saws- this one was claimed by Cook, but he is sick, and could not attend.</p>
               <p>Holmes. Q. Did you see us in Jermyn-street? A. Yes, on the day of the robbery, and I took you ten days afterwards.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am a police-constable. On Thursday, the 25th of November, about five o'clock in the evening, I was on duty in Lamb's Conduit-street - I saw the prosecutor opposite me, on the left-hand side: there were three persons with him; one in front, and the other two had hold of each of his arms: the prisoner was one, and he had hold of his left arm - I had seen the prosecutor two or three times, and knew where he lived; I saw him at Miss Hall's door, and the prisoner struggling with him: the prisoner then ran away, and two other persons, who I believe were the persons I had previously seen with him -I followed the prisoner into Theobald's-road, and Great James-street; I there saw him put out his hand to a person, whe looked back; he then escaped down Red Lion-street; the prisoner ran on, and I stopped him in Chapel-street - I had not lost sight of him from the time I saw him at Miss Hall's door; I had noticed the person who had hold of the prosecutor's arm had a black mark of courtplaister on his temple, and when I took the prisoner I saw he had it on his temple; when I took the prisoner he struck me on the breast, and told me to keep off - I seized another man shorter than him at the same time, but was obliged to let him go - I took the prisoner to Miss Hall's door, and as soon as the prosecutor saw him he said, "That is the man who robbed me of my watch;" the prisoner denied all knowledge of it; the gas-lamps were not lighted - there was a light from an oil-shop and a linen-draper's, about twenty yards off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then the prosecutor swore positively to him? A. Yes; he said."That is the man who robbed me:" he did not say then that his memory was quite gone - I seized two men, one with each hand; they had both run from the place: my attention was partly directed to the other man; I am a little short in my memory- I cannot say how the third man was dressed: I first saw the prisoner at the corner of Great Ormond-street - they were then opposite a light, and I saw the black patch on his face; it was not because I saw the prisoner had a black patch at the station-house that I swear to him - I saw it at first; they were then about twenty doors from Miss Hall's- I did not notice the other men; I noticed the prisoner attentively - I believe I should have known him without the black patch; I found on the prisoner 2l. 14s. 3 1/2d., a penknife, and a head of a pin with a stone set in silver; I believe it is a brooch: he told me he was returning from his work - I asked where he lived; he said in Pitt-street, but he did not tell me who his master was, nor where he lived - I found nothing belonging to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you notice the prisoner before he arrived at the door? A. Yes, by the light of the oilshop.</p>

            . I live in Duke-street. On the 25th of November I was going to Miss Hall's, and saw John at the door, and several men about him; he had hold of one man by the coat or sleeve - I do not know which; I was alarmed, and said "What is the matter?" he said,"I have been robbed by three men; I don't know whether this is the one who robbed me, but he is one of them;" the man got from him, and ran off - I ran and cried Stop thief! I did not see the man's face, but he was a tall man, and had a great coat on: he ran from the door, and two joined him - I cannot speak to either of their persons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was rather dark? A. Yes; but there were lights burning in Mr. Kinton's shop, a grucer's opposite, and in an oil-shop next door - the gas was not lighted; I did not notice any patch on the man's face.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was returning from No. 34, Mecklenburgh-square, where I had been to put up some curtains, but the laths and brackets not being there, I could not finish them - I saw two or three persons talking very jocularly, and when I got to Miss Hall's door there was a cry of Stop thief! and two persons ran away; I pursued one of them down to Chapel-street, where the Policeman took me back to the door, and the old gentleman certainly said, "That is one of the parties;" I stated where I had been at work, and the inspector gave the officer a note to go there, and he found it was correct; I was taken to the office, where I told where I had been, and what I had been doing - One man stated that he knew me to be a thief, and all my companions had been transported; but this I deny in toto.</p>

I lost this property on the 31st of October - I had been robbed several times before; I put these things into a pocket-book, and put the pocket-book into the mattress of my bed - I do not know on what day they were taken, but they were safe on the 26th of October; I have reason to think they were taken on the 30th, but I did not miss them for three weeks after that - Randall is my son, and lived in my house; he was fourteen years old last June - he was not in the house immediately that I missed them, but I saw him come in the next day, and I wished him to leave the house; he usually lived in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask why you forbid him the house? A. He knew there was a reason for it, but he did not know I had discovered the loss; I told him I had lost them, and suspected him - he denied it at first, and then said, "Don't make such a bother about your things, you can get them back again;" I said, "How am I to get them back?" he said, "Go to Bill Page, and he will tell you all about it;" I have never found the things - the spoons were silver, and worth 2s. each, the gold ring 10s., and the aword-knot 4s.</p>

            . I was formerly a pot-boy. On the 31st of October I was out of employ, and am so now; I lodge in Little George-street, Westminster, and know Randall - I was standing against the Castle public-house, with the prisoner Morris, when Randall came up, and said he had some old silver to sell; he spoke to me first - Morris made answer, and said, "Oh, have you?" Randall said Yes, he had, but he did not know where to go and sell it; he had not got it with him then; I afterwards saw him give a parcel to the prisoner Simmons, and heard him say, in Simmons' hearing, that there were three silver spoons in it; Randall and Morris went along together with Simmons, till they came up to the Fighting Corks, which is not many minute's walk - I stood across the road, and Morris called me over; I remained outside the house.</p>

               <p>Q. What occasion was there for you to wait? A. I waited there till they came out; they all three came out together, and then Simmons went one way, Randall and Morris another; I saw the parcel delivered to Simmons before they went into the public-house, but never saw what was in it; Morris is a person who jobbed about - I had known him about three months; I did not know Randall had stolen the things from his mother - he said he and another boy had stolen them from a person across the Park, and that he had stolen six of them; he did not mention his mother - he did not mention the name of the person from whom he had stolen them, but said it was a jeweller's shop, by some square - I made him no answer when he told me this; I gave information about it in about a fortnight, when his mother came to me and accused me about it - she apprehended me, and said I had bought the spoons, and that he had said he sold them to me for 3s. - I had not bought them, nor made any agreement to boy them; Randall was taken up that morning, Morris next day, and Simmons the day after.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090109"/>Cross-examined by MR. SMITH. Q. The mother accused you? A. Yes; I had never seen the spoons - the parcel was in brown paper, and what it contained I do not know, except that Randall told me it contained three spoons, and that he had stolen six, but three he had for himself, and three the other boy had; that one was almost worn through in the middle - Simmons was not by when he said that; I was to have none of the produce; I followed him to see what he sold them for - I did not see the money given, but he said he sold them for 2s. 6d.; I swear that; he gave him the money in the public-house; he told me so when he came out - I did not hear him tell Simmons he had stolen them; I only know that he bought them by what Randall said, and he showed me the 2s. 6d. - I am not swearing now.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You are speaking on your oath now? Witness. Yes, I am speaking what I saw, and what he told me.</p>
               <p>MR. SMITH. Q. Do you know that every thing you say now is sworn? A. Yes; I was a pot-boy about four months ago; I had been out of place about three months, when this happened - I had been jobbing about; I was never taken up, or charged with any offence before - I have been in custody till the present time, to give evidence - I was never convicted of any thing; I cannot say Simmous did not give him back the spoons, nor that they were Mrs. Randall's; he said he sold the three which he had, to Simmons.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I apprehended Simmons on the 27th of November, in Orchard-street -I did not then know where he lived; he was walking along Orchard-street - I had been looking after him before; I asked him if he had bought some silver spoons of three boys, at the Fighting Cocks, Dartmouth-street, and believe I said he had better tell the truth - I had a warrant, and went and searched his place, in Corbett's yard, Petticoat-lane - I found nothing there; I forgot to state that I took him from the watch-house to Tothillfields, to see Page, who was there; I asked Page if that was the man; he said, in his hearing, that it was; (I had heard Page's account before) - Page said, "You are the man who bought the spoons at the Fighting Cocks, Dartmouth-street;" Simmons said, "You had better look at me again, and be sure that you don't swear wrong;" he persevered in it - Simmons said, Page would swear wrong, and denied it - I have not found any of the stolen things; Simmons was in the watch-house when I went to his place; I saw his daughter there - he had directed me to that place as his - I did not apprehend the other prisoners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He did not hesitate in the slightest degree to tell you where he lived? A. No; I found his daughter and two or three of his children there; they did not object to my searching, but behaved particularly civil - he has a large family; I knew nothing of him except seeing him about Pye-street, and Duck-lane on his business.</p>

In July last the prisoner and his wife came to lodge at my house: he had no conversation with me respecting my property till about two months after that - I took him to lodge there for protection, it be - a lonely situation, and I had no man-servant; he asked me if I had any articles of value, as it was a had neighbourhood, winter was coming on, and there might be robbers-I said I had a gold watch and a few trinkets; I had given them apartments free of rent, for the purpose of protecting my house - a short time after I told him I had the watch and trinkets, he said if I would inform Mrs. Price of my affairs, as to my property, she could give evidence in case of a robbery - I did so according to his desire: the prisoner afterwards said he thought my jewellery and trinkets would be safe in the well under the carpet in the drawing-room, which is on the ground floor - the carpet conceals the well; I had talked to him at different times about my valuables, and on Thursday, the 21st of October, the prisoner put them into a hole in the garden; I first mentioned that place to him - he said he would dig the hole, and put them there; I went with him to hide them in the hole in the garden, between six and seven o'clock in the morning; he placed them in the hole himself - he put all the articles stated in the indictment into the hole; the value of the whole together was very near, if not quite, 400l.; one of the sets was presented to me by an old friend on my marriage, and I do not know what that cost; I sent my maidservant out of the house while we put them into the hole; Price had desired me to send her out of the way while he put them there, that there might be no witness to know of it - mine is a detatched house; the garden is walled round- there are no houses that could overlook the hole in the garden, I should suppose not: I suppose the nearest house<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090110"/>is about as far off as a very strong person might throw a stone - this was on the morning of the 21st of October; the prisoner went out that evening, saying there were thieves about - he returned, and said he was shot at; I had heard no shot - he had been out a few minutes; I do not know whether he had been in the garden or where; he said there must be somebody about in the garden, and I said that in the morning he and I must search for the property - this was about seven o'clock in the evening of Thursday, the 21st of October; when he came in, I went with him to the side of the house which looked over the garden, but neither saw or heard any body moving about the garden - he went with me, and fired a pistol out of the window; I heard nobody exclaim that they were wounded, nor saw any body - the garden wall must be six feet high; it was a middling night; the garden is about the length of this Court, or longer - if there had been any robbers I must have seen them: next morning, the 22nd, I went with the prisoner's wife to look in the garden for my property; the hole appeared as we had left it - his wife dug up the mould for me, and dug out the box, but the jewellery was all gone except this little article (producing a locket set with fine brilliants) - this was left behind, covered up in this little case.</p>
               <p>Q. A person taking the things out in a hurry might have overlooked that? A. It was tumbled in hay, and in a small red leather case - it is worth 60l.; I had asked the prisoner the night before to go into the garden with me in the morning, and he said it was proper to go, but when I asked for him to go next morning he was gone to town, and I sent for his wife; he had asked me the value of my property, and I said it was some hundreds - he came home that afternoon about one o'clock; I said to him "The property is all gone" - he laughed, and said he must go back to town; he staid an hour, walked all about the garden, and said it was very probable the property was on the premises; the house is in the middle of the garden: he then went back to town, returned in the evening, and asked a man to sit up all night with him in the house, and suggested to me that it was necessary for them to sit up to fire pistols, and they fired pistols all night - they fired, as near as I can judge, about twenty times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any body dead about the premises in the morning? A. No - I told him next morning it was very miserable to live there, and I thought I should go away; he said I ought not to go, for if I did he would go away, and I ought to stay, and not be frightened away - he said on the following evening that it was pretty certain the property was about the premises, and if he found it I should be under an obligation to him; he offered me the keys of his boxes to be searched when he came in from town at one o'clock on Friday - I had not charged him with any robbery, not given him the least him of it; I did not search his boxes - I had not the least suspicion of him at that time. On Sunday morning, the 24th of October, about ten o'clock, I was in the garden with him - he was searching for the property among the trees, and found a case of very valuable jewels, worth about 70l., hid in the ivy-tree; I have not brought it here - it is as large as my hand - he called to me, "Look there!" and took it out of the ivy - I could reach it; we had talked a good deal about my loss in the interval; I had said I was afraid it never would be necovered, and it would put me to an expence to take steps - I have got no more of it back; that still missing is worth from 200l. to 300l. -Ledbetter, the officer, was sent for, to whom I described what had occurred; he desired the prisoner to come to Bow-street to give an account of it, and the Magistrate held him to bail.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. The prisoner pointed out the jewel-case in the tree? A. Yes - I had not seen it before, and should not have seen it; it was quite concealed - it would be impossible for a person who did not know it was there, to find it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HURCOMB. Q. Who fires the pistols off at your house now? A. I have left a man named Arthur Maggs to take care of it; he tells me he never has occasion to fire, but I do not live there now, I live at Brompton; I left the house two days after the robbery - the prisoner fired pistols almost every night after the robbery, but I understand none have been fired since he left; there was no firing before he came to live there -I am timid, but Barnwell, whom I bought the house of, lived in it with his wife and family before the prisoner came - I went there in August, 1828; I have been divorced twelve years and more - I lived in the house some years since I have been separated from my husband; I know Akers, he is the carpenter - I employed him at the time of this accident; when the prisoner said he had been fired at, I went up stairs with him, and looked out of the window, it was about seven o'clock in the evening - we had no particular alarm that night, but I was under constant apprehension; this was the night of the day the property was deposited in the garden - it was gone next morning; Mr. Price desired the servant should be sent out while the things were buried - he sent her to the Post-office, and I sent her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send her to the Post-office to ask for a letter for A. B.? A. No, Price did - I had shewed him a brooch with my father's hair in it, and he saw the outside of the rest of the things; he advised their being put under the carpet - it was not my advice.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear he did not recommend you to place them at your banker's? A. He mentioned that people put property into banker's hands by way of security; I told him I had no banker - he did not advise me to send them to a man who did not exist.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not, supposing you had a banker, recommend you to send the things? A. I have said as plain as I could speak that he said property was safe in banker's hands, but my saying I had none, stopped the conversation; he said if I had a banker it would be proper to send them there - I think this was on Thursday evening, the 21st of October, when he went out, and said he had been shot at.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that it was when you talked of putting them into the well in the drawing-room? A. I cannot say, to be certain, when it was; he proposed putting them into the well in the drawing-room - I cannot say in what room I was in when he proposed it, for we were continually talking about the well; I first told him there was a well there - it could not be seen; he spoke about alterations in the house, and I said, "Here is part of this house you would know nothing about," and I might have said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090111"/>some weeks before that the well was a secret good place for any property; he proposed to put them there on the evening they were put there; I might have proposed it a month before - the carpet was drawn over the place after they were put there, and there was a heavy chest of drawers near the place; I believe he put a tack or two in the boards - I do not know of his borrowing a screw-driver to get the boards up; I was present when they were taken out - there were a few small nails to be taken out; there seemed no difficulty in getting them up - when he put them into the well he packed them up in paper and hay, and sealed them; my bed-room, the dining-room and drawing-room are all on the ground floor - both the dining and bed rooms command a view of the hole in the garden; the entrance to Price's apartment is on the other side of the house - his sleeping room is over my bed-room, but does not look on the garden; my maid-servant slept pretty near me, on the ground floor, and close against the drawing-room - she slept in a passage between the drawing and bed-rooms.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not frequently in the habit of alarming Price at night, calling him up, expressing your alarm of thieves being in the house, and requesting him to come and stay with you? A. He came to me the first serious alarm himself, and said he thought there were thieves about - that was three or four four weeks before this, and after that I sometimes called him up: Akers did not sleep in the house on the night the robbery was supposed to have taken place - I am quite positive of that; he was there that day, I believe; he was in the garden when the prisoner found the case in the ivy - he was not at work there; it was Sunday - he had come to make an excuse for not coming to set up the night before, as Price had desired him; I opened the case in the presence of Akers and the prisoner, when it was found - I swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the things were put into the garden, had you any workmen about the premises? A. I had Akers, but nobody else that day - I believe not; I am pretty sure Fox, the bricklayer, was not there - I will not swear it, but am pretty sure his work was done then; the prisoner had a key of the garden gate, and I had one- I had deprived my maid-servant of a key; she did not let the prisoner in and out - he let himself in and out; he usually went to town at seven o'clock in the morning- he left at eight the morning after the robbery; he usually returned about five, and often later - I did not have a fire lighted in the parlour after the things were deposited in the garden - I thought Price a designing man, but did not at first suspect him of this; he came to lodge with me in consequence of an advertisement which was inserted by my agent, Mr. Dyer. of Knightsbridge - it was headed, "Gratis;" it was stated in the advertisement that it was by way of protection, but that was my motive; I left it to Mr. Dyer to inquire into the prisoner's respectability - I went to Mr. Dyer after the robbery. the prisoner's wife said he should be there, but I thought it best not to meet him - they came to lodge there on the 22nd of June; I never lived alone in the cottage - Barnwell, his wife, and daughter lived there before; Mr. Robinson never lived there - I was formerly acquainted with Mr. Robinson, but he was never at the cottage; there was not a crim. con. trial about him, that was about Mr. Dunn - I was the wife of General Dyott; I believe he is now living - I was never in France with Mr. Robinson; I never travelled with him - he has lived in a house with me; persons have not been in the habit of coming backwards and forwards to my cottage - not since I lived there; Barnwell only left the house a few months before the prisoner came - no men were in the habit of coming there, except a carpenter or so, or an attorney on business - I never charged any other person with the felony; about a year and a half ago a good deal of my money was embezzled - received for my trustees; not stolen, but embezzled - I indicted a person named Eager for it: he was found guilty, and was six weeks in the House of Correction - I never made a charge of any kind against Clark, or any gardener; I missed some silver spoons, but charged nobody with that - they were not found; I did not go by the name of Miss Innes - I was for a short time, without any satisfactory reason, called Mrs. Egerton; I know no reason for it - it was very unwise advice; my accounts were never made out in the name of Innes - I pay ready money for almost every thing; I have very few accounts - I have printed my memoirs; I was never confined in any asylum as not being of sound mind - I had but one watch; I hardly ever used it - I think the prisoner has seen the watch; he did not abscond - he continued at the house after the charge, till he removed at the suggestion of a gentleman; I wished him to remove, but he continued there a fortnight - the Magistrate suggested that he should remove, and he did; he gave bail on this charge - he never advanced me a farthing; he has arrested me, but what for I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear he never paid for coals for you? A. I have not received the coal-merchant's bill - he persuaded me to let him order a chaldron of coals, but whether he paid for them I do not know; I never pawned my trinkets, except when my money was embezzled, and I was under the necessity of raising a little.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it before or after he was held to bail that he arrested you? A. After.</p>

            . I am an officer. In consequence of this transaction, I went down to make inquiries at the prosecutrix's house - the prisoner went to Bow-street, and was bailed there; I saw the place where the jewels were buried - the hole was at the bottom of the garden wall, so that no person could see where the jewels were deposited; no person in the adjacent houses could overlook the place.</p>
               <p>MRS. DYOTT re-examined. My income is 800l. a year. Prisoner's Defence My Lord and gentlemen of the Jury - The endeavours of my counsel I hope will convince you of my innocence of the offence - Gentlemen, nothing but malice has been the reason of her appearing on a charge so unfounded, which I hope to be able to prove by my friends, and restore my character which previous to this transaction was unsullied! when I consider I am the third or fourth person who have unfortunately been subject to similar inquiries to the one in question, nearly all of whom proved their innocence after having been subject to very heavy expences as myself, I hope to convince you Mrs. Dyott's character will not stand in the scale with my own, and I hope the Jury will prove her statement false and unfounded, after hearing my wit<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090112"/>nesses - I know nothing of the property; I never saw it- she cannot prove I ever saw it; I advised her to remove it to a banker's, and when she stated she had no banker, I can prove I advised her to lodge it in the custody of a pawnbroker, even if she paid interest, and she told me she paid 15 per cent. interest on it.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live at Parson's-green - I have lived there about nine years, and have some houses in the neighbourhood. I have worked for Mrs. Dyott, and was at work for her on Thursday, the 21st of October, on her premises, in the house - I am certain of the date; I did not hear of this robbery till the Sunday - I was watching at Mrs. Dyott's on the Friday night; it was after the property had been taken, I am quite sure - I was not watching there the night before(Thursday) I am quite sure; Friday was the only night; I was watching - nothing particular happened that night; pistols were fired off by Mrs. Dyott's wish several times - she wished pistols to be fired several times - I did not take off my clothes all night - I laid down on the bed; Mrs. Dyott called me up - she said nothing particular to me; she merely called Price - I heard her call him; he answered, and then I got up - Mrs. Dyott said she thought somebody was getting in at the drawing-room window; we were then on the ground floor, in Mrs. Dyott's bed-room - she bad removed her bed up stairs that evening; nothing else occurred - we went to examine, but saw nothing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. About what time of night was this? A. About half-past three o'clock in the morning, I think - the pistols were fired that persons might know there were people in the house.</p>
               <p>MR. HURCOMB. Q. Do you remember on Sunday being in the garden with Mrs. Dyott and the prisoner? A. Yes - she wished me to help to take down the ivy which grew by the wall; Price was taking it down at one end of the wall, and I at the other, as Mrs. Dyott wished to have the wall whitewashed - she said she thought it should be whitened, that by looking out of window they might see persons about the house; while Price was taking it down, Mrs. Dyott called me aside to explain what work I was to do next day - Price came up, and laid hold of a piece of ivy which I had left half down- he pulled it quite down, and there was the leather case in the ivy; I saw it found there - Price could not have put it there at that time, and I do not think that Mrs. Dyott could, unless she did it while I was away at the harbour, which is at the end of the wall, where Price was pulling it down; Mrs. Dyott said she was very glad she had got that, that was all she cared for, but there was another red morocco case, which she should like to get, but that was not of so much consequence - the locket in the red case had been found at that time; I was not called in to take care of the premises before the Friday.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How did you know the locket in the red case had been found? A. Mrs. Dyott mentioned it on the Sunday morning, while we were in the garden; she said there was another morocco case besides the one found - I have not the slightest notion who put the case in the ivy; Price had finished pulling the ivy down at his end - the case was found at the place I was at; I did not see it till he discovered it - I have known him three or four months; Mrs. Dyott asked me to watch the premises on Friday - that was the first and only time I sat up - Price and I were not in the same bed; he was in his own bed, not in the same room; he did not tell me of the robbery that night - I never heard of it till the Sunday; he never told me Mrs. Dyott had complained of losing her jewels - I never heard it from him, nor from Mrs. Dyott, nor the servant, till Sunday - that I swear; I never said I had any idea who robbed the premises - I have no recollection of having said so.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you never express any opinion about it? A. Never, I am quite sure.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Why tell me you did not recollect? on your oath, did you never tell any body you thought you knew who robbed the premises? A. I never said any such thing, nor that I did know who robbed Mrs. Dyott, nor that I and Price shared the plunder between us; I was in no public-house the night after the robbery- I was at the Royal Oak on Sunday; I have been there about three times - Moore keeps the house; I was drinking with him on the Sunday after the robbery, about eleven o'clock in the morning, and I think I left there about seven in the evening - we were not great friends; I was not drinking all the time - I should think we had three or four pots of beer, but no spirits; I was not altogether intoxicated - I was not perfectly sober; I am not certain whether I had four or five pints - I do not consider that I drank five pints altogether; I was rather elevated.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, on your oath, when you got a little elevated, did you not tell Moore something to this effect, that you and Price made a good night of it, and never made a better night than the night Mrs. Dyott was robbed? A. I only say I never said such a word, nor any thing of the kind, nor to that effect, nor did I mention the red morocco case to him, nor a red case, or red pocket book, nothing of the kind; we were not particular friends - I was not with him all the time; I did not talk with him about the robbery at all, to my knowledge - I said nothing to him about the robbery; I rather think I mentioned finding the case in the ivy.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, if you think it rather might be mentioned, how came you to swear that Mrs. Dyott's robbery was not mentioned? A. I cannot say - I rather think the jewelcase was mentioned; I am not certain of it - I did not know what the case contained; not when I was at the public-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Now recollect what you have said before; do you mean to assert, that at the time you might have mentioned the jewellery-case being found, you did not know what it contained? A. No, I did not know.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you mean to represent, that when Mrs. Dyott's box was handed to her, she did not open it to see if the jewels were gone or not? A. She took it in doors - she did not open it in my presence; she had taken it in before she spoke of the red morocco box being more valuable - she did not open it in the garden to see if the jewels were safe, nor even shake it; she took it in doors, then came back, and said there was another large morocco box, she should wish to have that found if she could; that the one lost was more valuable than that- she said she did not care much about that as long as she got the blue one, that was not of so much value; I under<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090113"/>stood the one not found to be the most valuable - it was after that I went to Moore's.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to swear you did not know the box contained jewels at the time you was at the public-house? A. I did not know what it contained; I have sworn she said the jewels were more valuable in one, than that which was not found, but I did not know what it contained, no more than what she said - she merely mentioned it in the garden; I heard her say something to that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember going a little further with Moore, and saying, what d - d fools you were to restore any part of the property? A. No; I swear nothing of that kind took place; I was not speaking to Moore about the jewel-box which we found - I never meationed it to him; I do not think I said a word about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you forget whether you spoke of it to Moore? A. I think I might forget: it was found about half-past ten, and I went to Moore's between eleven and twelve - it was not spoken about; it was not mentioned to my knowledge - I do not recollect speaking to him at all of Mrs. Dyott; I had never fired out of window before; I do not recollect telling him I had been up all night, firing out of window; I do not think I told him a word about it - I might have done so and forgot it; I am quite sure I never told him it had been a good night for me - I do not recollect talking to him about the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober enough to know what you was doing? A. Most likely not; I do not recollect at all - I was not sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not fix the quantity of beer drank at five pints in eight hours? A. It might be more; I am almost positive I never said any thing about its being a good night &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to repeat that you were so sober you never mentioned any thing of the kind, and could not without remembering it? A. Yes; I never did mention to him any thing about finding the box in the ivy, and firing out of window - I never did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was so flurried when called upon for my defence, I did not at that moment recollect it; but being provided with memorandums which I had written, I should feel particularly obliged to be allowed to state it in the presence of Mrs. Dyott, and she will not do me the injustice to say I did not wish her to act by my determination - about twelve o'clock on the Friday, Mrs. Dyott searched for the property; the maid-servant came to my office with a letter, who from I do not know, but understood it was from Mrs. Dyott - it intimated a wish that I should meet her at Mr. Dyer's, at Knightsbridge; I left my books loose on the desk, took the coach and went to Dyer's- he said Mrs. Dyott had just left, and advised me to recommend her to go to Bow-street; he said he was not aware that she had the property she reported to have lost, or he would have advised her to put it into his hands - I left him, intending to advise her to return with me to Bow-street; I went on Baston's coach, and overtook the maidservant at Queen's-elms, who had rode with me to Mr. Dyer's - I saw Mrs. Dyott, who repeated to me her loss; she spoke in a very careless manner, which induced me to believe she had not lost what she represented; I immediately offered her all my keys, to look at my rooms, if she suspected me - I, of course, knew she had lost them, from what I heard at Mr. Dyer's, and what she told me herself; she said he shad no suspicion of me, and refused to search- I stated that the next day was a Board-day, that I was very busy, and should be obliged to start very early in the morning of Friday, and it is said that betrayed my guilt; now I left at eight o'clock that morning, and left word with Akers to tell Mrs. Dyott I would be home in the middle of the day, and she did not wait for my coming home, but sent to me, as I have represented; I begged her to return with me to town, and go to Bow-street, for I would do my best to serve her; but in consequence of the expences she said she had incurred from the loss she repeated to your Lordships this morning, she said she did not care about it, for the thieves had got all they could have - she would not allow me to go to Bow-street; I was obliged to go to town to finish some reports, and on my return in the evening I found Akers had not left, but was to sit up the greater part of the night, and on Saturday morning, about eight o'clock, I rapped at Mrs. Dyott's bed-room door, and asked if it was her wish I should go to Bow-street and make some inquiry - she said No, it was not, and she would not give me authority to go; I went to the office, returned in the evening, and on Monday morning, before I left my bed-room, Akers called to see me about the limewhiting of the walls at the back of the house - I immediately accompanied him and Mrs. Dyott; (he had been on Saturday pulling down ivy,) the case was found on Sunday morning, and as soon as Mrs. Dyott had got the case, I never saw the contents - she took it herself from the ivybush and fell down in hysterics; I caught her in my arms, but she never let it fall out of her hand - she wished me to order an omnibus to call for her at two o'clock, and she took with her to Brompton a trunk - what it contained I do not know; I never saw it - she promised to return on the Monday, to search for some other things, as it was probable, having found one, she might find another; she never came, and on Tuesday the officers saw the premises - I went with them into the drawing-room, of my own accord; Ledbetter said it was a curious circumstance - I said it was, but I was perfectly innocent; he wished me to meet him at the office on the following day at twelve o'clock - I said I could not at that time, having business of importance to do; two o'clock was appointed, and at two I arrived, with the intention of seeing Mrs. Dyott, but I was surprised to find a statement made very much to my prejudice - I knew nothing about it; I remained on the premises for a week - perhaps your Lordships will ask Mrs. Dyott if I did not wish her to go to Bow-street for advice.</p>
               <p>MRS. DYOTT re-examined. I have attended to what the prisoner has stated - he told me after the robbery that it would be proper to make inquiry at a public-office; his wife had sent him the letter by my servant, and she proposed my meeting him at Mr. Dyer's, but I declined - I went to Mr. Dyer's immediately, and did not see him - he came to my house about one o'clock that day; I was a little overcome when the jewel-case was found, but did not go into hysterics; I am not hysterical.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner support you? A. He stood close to me at the time, and I was a little agitated.</p>

            . I was in Mrs. Dyott's service for thirteen months - I heard her and the prisoner talking about moving some valuables from the well in the room-drawing - I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090114"/>in the kitchen, they were in the hall, and I could distinctly hear what they said; I heard Mrs. Dyott say she thought they had better be put out in the summer-house; Price said, "Ma'am, I think they are safer where they are," and he told her she had better put them into her banker's hands - I am sure I heard that, and she said, "Oh, no; I think putting them into the pawnbroker's would be a great deal better;" this conversation was on the Sunday night before the robbery - they were put into the garden on the following Monday morning; I donot know that, but I was told so afterwards - I was sent to the Post-office rather before seven o'clock in the Monday morning; Mrs. Dyott sent me - she said, "Jane, go for this letter A.

Yes, he was in the house all that night; he never went out, and he was also there all Friday night - on both nights: I let him in and out; I had a key of the garden-gate, which I always kept myself - I used always to let the prisoner in and out; Mrs. Dyott had two keys for her own use, besides the one I had - Akers was at work in the kitchen on the Monday before the robbery; there was no other workman about the premises - he sometimes came to work at six o'clock, and sometimes at five; he was not in the house when I was sent to the Post-office - the door to the prisoner's part of the house was different from Mrs. Dyott's, but she used to have the doors of the house locked up by half-past five in the afternoon - the garden-gate leads to both entrances; if the prisoner went to the hole at the bottom of her garden the shortest way from his own door, he must get over a wooden partition, which is very high, by Mrs. Dyott's bed-room - her bed-room window is opposite it; he could not have got over that fence - he would have broken it down; it is slight like a verands.</p>

               <p>Q. Then, if he had gone at any time to that part of the garden he would have had to go from his own door all round by Mrs. Dyott's window? A. Yes, and then she must have seen him - he must pass her dining-room, drawing-room, and bed-room windows.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember whether between the Monday and Thursday, Mrs. Dyott had a fire made in the dining-room? A, Yes, she had one in the drawing-room and dining-room - she was in her bed-room the whole of the day; she did not say why she had the fire - she would not suffer me to go in there; it was not usual to have a fire in the dining-room - she used to sit in the kitchen before; I was there before the prisoner came to live there Mrs. Dyott was always afraid of thieves before they came - I am quite sure Akers was in the house on Thursday night, and I heard a noise that night with the glass door in the hall; I went, and told Mrs. Dyott - she desired Price not to go out; this was about one o'clock in the middle of the night - the noise was outside the house; Mrs. Price went into her own room when I told her - nobody was sleeping in that room; she changed her bed after Thursday night, and went up stairs - Akers was up, I, and all of us - Mrs. Dyott was up part of the night, and Mr. and Mrs. Price were up the whole night; I alarmed Mrs. Dyott at one o'clock - she then went up stairs; the window looked into the garden, I heard her desire Mr. Price to fire at that man - she had been looking out of window for some time - the whole evening - I was down in the hall, where my bed is; Price got up upon this alarm.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by his getting up; what did he do? A. He dressed himself, and was with Mrs. Dyott the whole night.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Price gone to bed before one o'clock? A. No, but I saw him dressing himself; he had gone to bed - he went to lay down on his bed, and Mrs. Dyott came after him again; I do not know whether Mrs. Price was in bed- I was not in the room; I saw her up after one o'clock: Price and Akers were up stairs watching the men about the premises - Mrs. Dyott said she saw three men, and pointed towards them; she said to Price, "There, I see three men plain; shoot at them;" on my oath I heard her say that; it was about an hour after Price was up - he shot at them, and she asked if she should see them dead tomorrow morning; he said he did not know - Price did not go out the whole night; Mrs. Dyott told him to fire through the glass if he saw any one - he lifted up the window to fire at the three men; I am sure Akers was in the house at the time; he fired once.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you quite sure he fired on the Thursday night, at the three men? A. Yes, I am quite sure.</p>
               <p>MR. HURCOMB. Q. Do you remember at what time Price left the house next morning? A. A little after seven o'clock - I was sent to the Post-office on the Monday: Mrs. Dyott sent me to Chelsea for some brocoli on the Friday morning, and when I came back she told me to go to Mr. Price, and she gave me a letter - that was about nine o'clock; I gave him the letter, and he came back to the cottage with me immediately - he took the coach, and stopped at Mr. Dyer's, at Knightsbridge; I went on, and Mr. Price overtook me - I went on to the cottage with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You have lived about thirteen months with Mrs. Dyott - have you ever seen any singularity of behaviour in her? A. I think she is a very bad woman, Sir; sometimes three or four gentlemen came to the house in the course of a day - they have staid there about an hour or two; she told me not to come into the room unless she called - Price had no key to the gate; some time before I went to my mistress she went by the name of Miss Innes; I never heard her answer to that name - my father served her with milk, and used to send her bills in that name; I know she went by that name in the village - it was four years ago; I have seen her walking about the house without any clothes on whatever, none at all.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is this as true, as that Akers was at the house all night on Thursday? A. Yes, I swear he was there all Thursday night; he was in the house two nights.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he there for on Thursday night? A. She said she was surrounded by thieves, and he had better stay- she gave him a pistol; she said this about five o'clock: he had been working there all day - I saw her give him the pistol, powder, and ball; she gave him, I should think,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090115"/>about 100 bullets; the powder was in a dram, a little tin box - I saw it opened, and saw the powder in it; she opened it before me - the bullets were not in any thing; Mr. Price gave him the bullets - Mrs. Dyott sat up all night making bullets; Mr. Price made them out of some shot - I saw him making them in his own kitchen; he had the shot in a small fire-shovel - there was about half a pound of shot; I and Mrs. Dyott were in the kitchen with him when he was making the bulltes; perhaps there was not so much shot as would fill that little thing (an ink-stand); I sat by looking at him - he made one hundred balls, I think - I did not count them; he made them out of not quite that thing full of shot; it was middling size shot - he made them on the Tuesday night before the Thursday; I saw him give the hundred balls to Akers - he said, "Akers you can take these balls, and if you hear any body you can fire;" Mrs. Dyott gave Akers the pistol - Price had a pistol himself; he threw himself on the bed on Thursday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Merely took a little nap in his clothes? A. Yes - I saw him get up and dress himself afterwards; he did not go to bed twice.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it he got up and dressed himself? you told his Lordship you were all up the whole night? A. Mrs. Dyott told him she was annoyed with thieves about one o'clock; Mrs. Dyott can see very well - I heard her point out the man to Price, and then he fired; it was about half-past one o'clock - it was getting rather lighter, light enough for him to have seen the three men; I am sure of it - I did not look out of window, but I know it was quite light; she could see them in the garden - she said she saw one with a smock-frock on; Price was looking out of window at the time - I do not know where Akers was when Price fired; he was in the house - I saw him there that night, and spoke to him; I have no doubt of his being there - I am sure he sat up both Thursday and Friday nights - Mrs. Dyott missed her things on Friday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, she made a dreadful fuss about her jewels in the house? A. Yes, I did not hear her make a fuss; I have sworn just now she did make a dreadful fuss.</p>
               <p>Q. Then did she make a terrible fuss about it on the Friday? A. Yes, she told both Price and Akers on the Friday that she had lost her jewels - I heard her tell them - they both said they were very sorry about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose Akers has sworn that he never heard Mr. Dyott had lost her jewels till Sunday morning, would he not have sworn what is not true? A. Yes. When my mistress sent me to the Post-office, she told me I need not hurry: Price was there that morning - I am sure it was not Thursday; it was Monday, for I went to my mother that morning - I could have quitted Mrs. Dyott with a week's notice, but her housekeeper was mistress over me.</p>
               <p>Q. But would you stop in the house with a bad woman that walked naked through the house? A. I did not see her before - it was about two months ago; it was after the robbery - the robbery was about a month ago.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is it true or not that you have seen your mistress walk naked through the house since the robbery? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Be careful now - when did you see her walking naked since the robbery? A. A fortnight before I left; it was in her bed-room in her house at Walham-green - it was about a month ago; it was after the robbery - it is longer than a month ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Two months? A. Not so long as that - I do not know what month it was in; a month is four weeks; she walked up and down stairs naked, all through the house; every body could see her - Mr. Price could see her if he came in, and the gentlemen who called, if they came; she walked even without her shift, in cold weather.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long after the robbery did you leave her? A. About three weeks after.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear she staid three weeks in the house after the robbery? A. No, she went away on the Sunday morning, but she came backwards and forwards, and changed her clothes, and put on clean ones.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that what you mean by walking naked? A. And then she went up-stairs in the same state - I was left to take are of the house when she left; Mr. Price remained there - he and Mrs. Price must have seen this; Mrs. Price was at home all day - I never mentioned to any body that I had seen her walking naked - not before I came here; Yes I did, I mentioned it to Mr. Smyth, the prisoner's solicitor, about three nights ago - I live with my father and mother; I never mentioned it to them, nor to any body but Mr. Smyth, and Mr. and Mrs. Price - I do not know how many times I have seen her walk naked; it was not half a dozen times - Mrs. Price never saw it, for she never went into any apartment unless I was with her, and Mrs. Dyott never went so before Mrs. Price - sometimes she undressed in the drawing-room, and sometimes in the dining-room.</p>
               <p>Q. That was not walking about the house naked? A. No; she would go into the garden - she did not go there quite naked; she went up-stairs from the lower part of the house quite naked; Akers was not in the house when she did it - I never told him of it: I told Mr. and Mrs. Price of it several times - I saw her every morning, and when I saw her I told Mrs. Price; I saw Mrs. Dyott walking naked every morning for the last two months I was with her; this was for two months running - I did not tell Akers of it till the last day or two; I had mentioned it to him within the last day or two.</p>

            . I am a carpenter and joiner. In October last I opened a beer shop at Fulham, on a Sunday in October; six or seven weeks, ago Akers came there, about eleven o'clock in the morning; I had not heard of this robbery till he came - he staid till about nine o'clock in the evening; he and I had a pint or two of beer -I am not allowed to draw in the time of service, and he drank by himself afterwards - I have known him three or four years, and have worked with him: he said to me, "I have made a good thing of it," and said he had been at work at our old shop, Mrs. Dyott's; he said, "We were d - d fools not to take the one away that we left behind some ivy;" he called it a box, and said it was left behind some ivy against the wall - I am sure he said, We; he said Price and he were there together at night - that he went out and fired a pistol in the air, and then ran back and told Mrs. Dyott that some robbers out there had fired at him - he had been talking of himself and Price; I am sure he said, "We were d - d fools not to take away the box left behind the ivy, as well as the rest" - and said it was worth 60l.</p>

               <p>MR. HURCOMB. Q. You have left Fulham now? A. No, my wife is there now - I have lived at Sheen, in Berks; I did not go away from there, leaving my wife and family chargeable to the parish, for I had no wife then, nor have I done so since - I have not been there for these five years.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS, Q. You left your wife at Fulham? A. Yes, to-day; I have not been to Newbury these three years - I have worked at Fulham these five years, but have been home once.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. Between six and seven o'clock in the morning I saw the prisoner in conversation with another young man, coming down White Lion-street, Pentonville, about a quarter of a mile from Ward's shop, Smith crossed knocked at a street-door, and asked if they wanted buy lemons; the other kept the same side of the way - the prisoner was not admitted to the house; I went up and asked what he had got under his great coat - he said a pair of shoes; they were a sort of half-boots - I asked him how they came in his possession; he said he brought them of a man at Hornsey, that the man carried a bag, and he gave 5s. 8d. for them - I took him to the station-house: no lemons were found on him - seeing the other man had another pair of boots under the breast of his coat, I went back for him, but he got away - the prosecutor lost two pairs; I found out Emery, who claimed them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. There was nobody with me? A. I saw them both talking together, each having a pair of boots.</p>

            . On the 7th of December, about a quarter before seven o'clock, I was on duty as a private patrol of St. Leonard, Shoreditch - at the corner of Union-street, leading towards Kingsland, I saw Spurling wheeling a barrow - Jacobs was walking alongside of him; I crossed over, and asked what they had got there - they said, "Some iron:" I asked where they brought it from - they said,"From Kingsland, from Mr. Perry's marine-store shop;" I said they must go with me to the watch-house, and while I was talking to them, Jacobs slipped two shovels from behind his back - I put them into the barrow, and with the assistance of the Policeman, took them to the station: the shovels have not been claimed - I was present when Fullwood saw the iron at the office, and claimed it; I was sure that Perry did not keep an iron shop at Kingsland.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Spurling's Defence. I went down to my father's to do some work; I was coming up and happened to see the barrow in the road - Jacobs said, "Will you give me a help along with it?" I did not know but it was his property, and wheeled it for him - Smith said, "What have you here?" I said, "Iron;" he said, "I can't let you go;" I said, "Well, I may as well go, it is not my property."</p>

               <p>Witness. I think it was about eight - I lent him 5s. on it; he said he brought it from his sister, and gave me the direction, No. 4, Bath-street, in the name of

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going along Kingsland-road, at a quarter before six o'clock, and met a man, who gave me the rug to pawn at Miller's for 6s. - I thought he said 3s., which I asked; but when I went to him and gave him the 3s., he said I was to have had 6s. - he went with me to get it out again, and sent me to Burgess'; they would only lend 5s. - I came out and gave the man the ticket and money; he then sent me to pawn the carpet - the prosecutor said the rug bad a string tied to it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BIRD. There was a string tied round it when the prisoner brought it - the carpet is now at our shop.</p>

The prisoner was in my employ for seven months and twenty-one days - I had a good character with him from a respectable house in Bond-street. On the 6th of December I had discharged him, and was about to pay his salary - he said he would take his trunk, and call in half an hour for his salary; I had suspicion of him, and called him up into the drawing-room - I put rather forcible question to him; I certainly said he had better state all about it - I found I could get nothing from him, and called in a Policeman; the key of his box was found; after a short time, the Policeman opened it in his presence - a pair of ladies silk mittens were found, which I conceived to be mine, but cannot positively swear to them; they are worth 3s. - I thought it useless to search the box further at the house, and sent it to the Police-station; I was present there when it was searched; the two pair of silk stockings, and three odds ones were found in it - they are black, spotted with white; I have three stockings corresponding with the three odd ones; they are a peculiar stocking, and I can say decidedly they are mine - the pair are very fine, and not general in the trade, but I will not swear to them; the odd one I will swear to.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. Do not you know that the prisoner has been able to save a little money at his former place? A. I am not aware of it - I have heard of it since the prosecution; I have since heard from a relation that be has a little money in the stocks - I have seventeen persons in my shop; I know nothing about the prisoner giving any offence to the cook about any gruel; I know of no dispute between him and the young men in the shop about the cook - if he was ill, gruel would have been allowed; he may have been sent out on errands just before he left; I first saw his portmanteau when it was brought into my drawing-room by Mr. Rutherford, who has been twenty years in my house; it was locked - the key was not to be found, but the prisoner at last produced it; I know nothing of its being left down stairs open for four hours - I know nothing of the box having been searched before; when he was brought into the drawing-room it was sometime before the key could be found; I swear to the odd stocking - they are not a common manufacture, but very uncommon and peculiar; I think there is not another pair in England like one of these - I had only one pair of that pattern, and it was made to my own peculiar idea.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not other persons have put them into his box? A. How is it possible for me to say, when I do not know where his box was?</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I took the prisoner - the box was brought to the station-house by a porter; these two pairs and three odd stockings were found in it - they appear to be the fellows of these produced by the prosecutor; the prisoner produced the key of the box, and I opened it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of the stockings being in my portmanteau - it was in the kitchen, exposed to all the house, from six o'clock in the evening till nine at night, as I was sent out by Mr. Rutherford; the box was opened three times before it was taken to the station-house - once it was opened by the porter, as he said Mr. Rutherford wished to open my things; I opened it - he examined it, said there was nothing belonging to him, and seemed satisfied; he went up stairs to fetch my money, as I supposed; he then came down, and said Mr. Rohertshaw wished to look it over - I took it up into the drawing-room to Mr. Robertshaw - he stepped up to me, and said I had been robbing him; he opened my box - he and the foreman examined it, and found nothing but the mittens; he then ordered the foreman to go for an officer - he gave me in charge, and I was taken to the station-house, the porter carrying the portmanteau - when brought to the station-house they examined it, and found the stockings; I knew nothing of their being in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090118"/>portmanteau - it was exposed to every body in the house, and I and my fellow-servants were not living comfortbly together.</p>
               <p>MR. ROBERTSHAW re-examined. I only found the mittens - the officer has not stated where he found the stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the box opened before be produced the key to the Policeman? A. I consider not, for the things were particularly smooth, and he desired the Policeman to keep them smooth.</p>
               <p>JOHN HOWARD re-examined. I found the stockings at the station-house; they were in the sleeves of one of the prisoner's coats in the portmanteau; I was in the drawing-room all the while that the portmanteau was open - I unlocked it myself; there was no hesitation in bringing it forward while I was there: the portmanteau opens in the middle - his clothes were in the upper division, but the coat was not the first thing: the trousers were on the top of them - I know nothing of the portmanteau being opened before I searched it; the things were smooth, and did not appear to have been meddled with - I locked the box myself, after examining it in the drawing-room, and put the key into my own pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor's porter is here, and he knows my fellow-servants were not on good terms with me.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's porter. I believe the prisoner and his fellow-servants were not on good terms - I know nothing of the box being down in the kitchen before he left.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do not you know it was down in the kitchen all the time? A. I know it was in the passage just as you were leaving, and Mr. Rutherford said, "Whose is that?" the prisoner said, "It is my portmanteau;" that is all I know - this was about ten o'clock at night; I had been out all day, and had not seen it before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do not you know that Mr. Rutherford and I had it open in the counting-house, and all the things out, before it went into the drawing-room? A. This is the first I have heard of that - he did not always agree with his fellow-servants; I have lived there about three months - I never knew his box to be left open; I considered him very reserved and close, and not likely to leave his box open, and never knew him leave the key about.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. ROBERTSHAW. Q. Were the stockings kept in a place which the prisoner had access to? A. They were kept in the window, and must have been taken when he undid the nuts of the shutters in the morning; I should certainly have missed them.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for, and took the prisoner and these two pieces of ribbon - as I went up to them I saw one piece on the counter, and Mr. Davies was in the act of taking the other from Ann: Ann said she had picked them up from the shop floor - I took them to the station.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. About what size shop is the prisoner's? A. A small shop - he appeared to sell waddings and skins for muffs, but the whole was in a very confused state; when I went in the first time the skins were on the left-hand side, and he produced them openly to me; they were drab, which is a common colour in the trade - my brother's name was not on the skins; a stranger might have bought them innocently.</p>

               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. You never sell them in this state? A. No; I can speak decidedly, with respect to the drab skin - that is not strained; they are worth 20s.; the prisoner never was on our premises, nor saw our men.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A lady came to my shop on the 9th of October, and wished me to make a pair of kid gloves to her size; I had not got a skin which would do, and on the 10th I set off at seven o'clock in the morning to go to Mr. Arnold's to buy a coloured skin for the purpose of making a pair of gloves, to be ready by the Monday - when I got to Oxford-street I had a wish to go and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090121"/>see the park, but went into a public-house, and had a glass of gin and water - when I had been there some time, who should come in but a young person named Insel - we were rather surprised to see each other, and I said, "What brings you here?" he said, "I and King have been to

I have not seen him these three years; there is no truth in what he has stated- a young man brought a parcel one Sunday morning in October to go in my parcel to Torrington - I do not know what it contained; I do not know the young man's name.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. These onions had been transferred from one part to another? A. Yes - he was employed to carry onions for sale, but he never took any to sell without my direction; I have generally been on the premises when he has loaded his cart - I have sometimes been in London, and he has brought the cart to me, but I prepare my own goods for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090122"/>market in a particular manner, and when they have been loaded he takes them - the shed was at the back of my premises.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have no doubt the onions were yours? A. No; I saw them at one o'clock, and saw them on the cart at five, in the same sack - the prisoner had 12s. a week, and 1s. a night when he went to market.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. About ten minutes before twelve o'clock, I was at the turnpick-gate, and saw the two prisoner come out of the toll-house - an officer asked me it it was all right; I said, yes - it was Eves' brother, and knowing him, I had no suspicion of him; he was very much in liquor, and could scarcely stand - I then went up my beat, returned, and saw the door open; I went and said to the prosecutor, "Charles, you will lose your shirt" - I saw the back door was open; he then looked and missed his property - we went to several places, and on coming back found the prisoners in custody; they were taken to the watch-house, and Eves threw this key, two or three little bits of paper, 2d. and a bad shilling on the table; he caught up the key again to put it into his pocket; the prosecutor said, "Put that down, it is mine."</p>

            . I am an officer. I was on duty ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before eleven o'clock, and saw the two prisoners coming along the Commercial-road arm-in-arm and seriously talking together; I stood on one side to try to hear what they said - when they came up to me, they silenced their discourse, and crossed to another beat; I saw no more of them till about twelve o'clock, when I saw Gough on the foot-path at the end of the Cannon-street-road - I walked by him, returned, and said, "It is a cold night;" he said, "Yes; will you have a drop of gin?""No, thank you," said I - I then saw Eves on the other side, talking to some girl; Gough said, "I will take good care he shall not go with that girl;" and he went and spoke to him - Eves then left the girl, and they went on together; I followed them to a public-house door, they knocked, but the publican refused to draw any more liquor - I then went and said, I wished him to open the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090123"/>door; we went in, and the prisoner asked what I would take - I said, "A small glass of rum;" and they had a pint of porter and some gin - Eves said to Gough, "You must pay for this;" Gough put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a wooden box, he took something out of it, and put it into his right-hand trousers pocket - he shut the box again, and Eves laid down 9 1/2d.; the publican said there was another halfpenny wanted - Gough paid the other half-penny, and handed the box to Eves; Eves said, "I shall not be done, put them back again;" Gough then put a brooch and a pin into the box - It was a twisted pin as far as the centre part of it, and the brooch had a kind of stone in it; they were in a box-wood coloured snuff-box, rather brown, and a little the worse for wear - Eves again said, "I shall not be done, there is some more;" Gough then put his hand into his pocket, took out a watch-key, put that into the box, and Eves had the box - I am sure there was a watch-key, pin, and brooch, in the box; but this is not the key, I did not see this key at all; that was a long smooth key - I afterwards took them, and when we were at the watch-house, I was ordered to search Eves, he said he would not be searched - he threw this key on the table and took it up again; the prosecutor said, "That is my property, I will swear to it;" Eves twice attempted to run away from me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long was it before you apprehended them? A. I suppose three quarters of an hour - we went to the Commercial-road, and they went, away; I merely went to the public-house for information not for the sake of the rum - I would drink vinegar or turpentine for information; they were not long in my company - there was no attempt at concealment; I had not known them before - the toll-house is not on my beat; Eves was much the worse for liquor.</p>

            . My snuff-box was a dark brown, something of a box-wood colour - it contained two pins, a brooch, and two keys; the brooch was an old fashioned one, with three letters on it - this is very much like one of the keys; I had kept it in the box because it had lost its ring.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you were on the most friendly terms with Eves? A. Yes; his brother is one of the superintendents of the trust, and it would have been his duty to be there at half-past five or six o'clock the next morning - I went to sleep about eleven, and was awoke about ten minutes before twelve; this robbery must have been between eleven and twelve - I have seen many other keys like this, and I will not swear to this; I have seen no other property - it was Sunday night, and the shops were not open.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Have you seen many such keys without a ring? A. No.</p>
               <p>Eves' Defence. I know nothing of the business; the Policeman is quite mistaken in saying it was a wooden box- it was a tin tobacco-box, and the articles in it were the brooch out of my shirt, the ring off my finger, and the key, which I put into the box for safety.</p>

            . I am a master mariner, and live at No. 5, Johnson-street, Old Gravel-lane. On Sunday night, the 5th of December, I saw the two prisoners going into Mr. Ireland's, at the Crown and Dolphin, at the corner of Cannon-street-road. soon after ten o'clock - they sat drinking in the tap-room, and I went into the bar, which commands a view of the two entrances; I was there till near twelve o'clock, and during that time I never saw Eves go out till he went out for good, which was between a quarter to twelve and twelve - I saw Gough go out twice during the time; he was absent but a short time - I saw him come in again each time; perhaps he was out about five minutes - the reason they left was, Mr. Ireland was desirous of getting rid of them. as Eves was very much in liquor - he could scarcely stand; he stood twenty minutes or half an hour at the bar - I am quite positive Eves did not go out.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Saturday evening, the 27th of November, I saw the prisoners standing near the White Horse, where they generally assemble together: they had some books, and knowing there were some stolen, I watched them, and saw them taking them about for sale; I got a man to assist me, and I went and took two books from Fitkin, and while I was taking a third book from Tuston's hat. Fitkin ran away - I pursued and took him in the top room of a house - I then went to Tuston's house, who came with me very willingly; Grimes was the first who had offered the books for sale - I afterwards found the prosecutor in Scotland-yard.</p>

On the 7th of December, about ten o'clock in the morning, I had 13l. 4s. in silver in a bag - there was one crown-piece, upwards of twenty half-crowns, more than one hundred shillings, and more than twenty sixpences - I gave the bag to my lad to take to a place where I generally send my silver - he put it at the furthest end of the counter, from the door; I saw the prisoner about ten o'clock that morning - he came immediately the lad had gone down stairs; he asked for 1lb. of sausages - I served him with them; he gave me 1s., and I put 8d. in copper, which was the change, into the meat scale, but he did not take it up - he was at that time standing within reach of the bag- he left the shop without his change; a woman came in before he left - she stood about three yards from where the bag of silver was; the lad came into the shop while she was there, and the bag of silver was missed; I ran out to look for the man, and when I returned, the woman was still there, and they said had been there all the time - no other person but the prisoner and the woman came into the shop after the bag of money was put down till it was missed - I could not find the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe you found the man afterwards by his coming to your shop to ask you if you accused him of taking any property of yours? A. Yes, he came with another person, and I charged him with it - he asked if I had any charge against him; I gave him in charge - he was let go, and came of his own accord to the office next day, but I understood there was some guarantee for his appearing; the woman was not searched - another man surrendered; I did not describe him as a tall man - I did not say so to Mr. Lamonte; the prisoner said he worked at the engine, at the London-docks - I went there, and Heatley was taken, as he worked at the engine.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's service. On the 7th of December he gave me a bag of money - I laid it on the end of the counter; there was a scale about a foot from it - there was no one there but my master; I went into the cellar for a piece of beef - I returned in five minutes: my master told me to take the bag, and it was gone - there was only one woman in the shop, two or three yards from where the bag had been; my master went out, and the woman remained till he returned. On the evening of the 8th of December the prisoner came to the shop, said he had heard that master had been robbed, and that he was the man who had been in the shop at the time; I told him my master was not at home, but he would be in half an hour - he went out, and returned at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was after your master had been making inquiries at the London-docks? A. Yes, and a man named Heatley had surrendered.</p>

The prisoner came to me on the evening of the 8th, and I said, "You are the man who I suspect has robbed me;" I reminded him about his change - he said he had taken up a sixpence and three halfpence, but I had no sixpence, for I had the minute before, put every bit of silver I had into the bag; I am positive his change was in copper.</p>

On the 10th of December, I went with Deverell to the prisoner's house, in William-street - I saw the prisoner's wife there, and I found in a drawer, a new gown of Norwich crape; a new table-cloth, a piece of linen, and two silver spoons, under the bed; the table-cloth was not made, and a new jacket and trousers which had not been worn - I went to the prisoner and told him his wife said he had taken these things out of pawn, and they appeared to be tarnished - he said they had been out; I asked him where, but he would not tell me - he said he supposed his wife had told me; he said he had paid his rent that day.</p>

            . I am a slop-seller. Some months ago the prisoner ordered a frock and a pair of trousers at my shop - they were made in about a fortnight, but he did not call for about a month, and he said he would not take them then, he would call soon; on Tuesday, the 7th of December, he came in the morning, and requested to have 2s. back, of 4s. which he had left as earnest - I let him have the 2s., and in the evening he came again and paid me 12s., which was the balance that was due to me; that was about seven o'clock in the evening, and he had called in the morning between nine and eleven.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You will not swear it might not have been eleven o'clock? A. I will not swear one way or the other - I had to go out of town, and to be in Oxford-street at twelve o'clock; I started about eleven from home - I know he called before eleven.</p>

            . I am headborough of Shadwell. On the 8th of December I took the prisoner, in the prosecutor's shop - the prosecutor charged him with stealing the bag; I took him to the watch-house - when we were there, he said he had taken the 6d. and 1 1/2d.; I put some questions about the pawnbroker, which he declined to answer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you found him working at the docks? A. Yes, occasionally - I was loath to lock him up, and I left him with a friend or two while I went to make further inquiries - I let him go that night, and he came to the office next day of his own accord; before we parted that night I took a share of a pot of porter, and I believe there was a quartern of gin between six of us - Mr. Lamonte was present; the prisoner said Mr. Hows had given him trouble enough, and if he did not pay for it he would - I let him out because I had been to Mr. Hows, and he had received information that Samuel Heatley was the person who had committed the robbery: I knew where to find him, but Mr. Hows then came and said he was not the man, it was the prisoner he thought; we then parted- I went to the prisoner's house, and his wife said he had been to the shop, and I advised Mr. Hows not to press the charge - I then went to the public-house where the prisoner and his friends were, and I said, if he and his friends would answer in the sum of 20l. I would let him go; I took no regular bail - he came and delivered himself up the next morning; I ascertained that he was well known.</p>

On Tuesday morning last I went and fetched the jacket and trousers from a clothes-shop opposite Gould's-hill - he measured me for them three or four months ago, and I paid him 4s. off, and on Tuesday morning I asked him to let me have 2s. off the 4s., and he did so - when I had sold the things I have mentioned I went and paid him for the the jacket and trousers; I paid him 12s. - his name is Dowditch, or some such name; he knows my name, and has it in his book.

            . I am a corn-dealer, and live in Chichester-place, St. Pancras. On the Monday before the 10th of December, Smith the prisoner, called to inquire the price of malt between eleven and one o'clock; he went away - Hare then came to ask if I was a buyer of malt; Smith then came and brought a sack of malt which they both said they had found by the coach rank at Islington; I saw on the sack "Henry Hole, Edmonton," marked in red letters - I told them they had better go to the person whose name it bore, and tell him they had found it; they said they thought they should not get paid if they went, and asked me to pay their expences; I said, "Then write, or I will write for you, to save all trouble;" I took a piece of paper and wrote in their presence, and gave the letter to a man who came in on business - they saw what I did, and said they thought it was the best thing that could be done; they left the malt with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You wrote by their desire? A. Yes, and Mr. Jones came to town; the prisoners called frequently after I had written, to know if I had had an answer - and when Mr. Jones did come, I sent to the White Hart and one of the prisoners was there - he came directly, and the other soon after; I know the prisoners to be hackney coachmen - there was nothing to prevent their cutting the name out of the sack</p>

I cannot say exactly; I followed after the prisoner directly -I told her she had robbed me, and I took her by the arm, called the Policeman, and gave her in charge; she denied it - I told the Policeman, in her presence, that she had taken a sovereign and a half of mine.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I took the prisoner on the night in question; the prosecutor stated that he had lost a sovereign and half; I asked her what money she had in her pocket; she took out some halfpence and a sixpence, and said that was all she had about her I took her and searched her, and on unlacing her stays, a piece of paper dropped; I took it up, this is it - it is printed paper, and a sovereign and a half were in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I picked it up at my feet, wrapped up in the paper, I did not know what it was, but being distressed I put it inside my stays.</p>

             re-examined. Q. You say you were intoxicated; now were your clothes in such a state that this might have fallen from your breeches pocket on the ground? A. No, my Lord, my clothes were not down at all, and that pocket was not unbuttoned; I was not so intoxicated as to be uncertain about it; it was about one o'clock in the morning - I had been at work from the dinner time before; I am aware that this is a very serious charge, but it was not possible for me to have dropped it.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS FEATHERSTONE. The prosecutor was a little in liquor, but he seemed quite collected, and walked pretty well; he was in a state to know what he was about.</p>
               <p>JURY to W. ABEL. Q. Was your sixpence in the same pocket with the sovereign and a half? A. No, it was not, I am sure; I did not open that pocket at all - when I saw her, I put my hand into that pocket, felt the money safe, and buttoned it again.</p>

The case has been submitted to the consideration of several of the judges, who unanimously resolved that the conviction was proper; and Mr. Justice Bosanquet informed the Court that the point had been decided by three Judges at the Old Bailey.</p>
