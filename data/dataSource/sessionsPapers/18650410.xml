I am a driller, and lived in December at 1, England Cottages, Millwall—I had known James Barber and his wife—I had worked with him, but was not doing so at that time—on Saturday, 3d December, I left off work about 4 o'clock, at the shipbuilding yard, Millwall Iron-works—I had a glass of wine, but that was all the drink I bad that night or day—I saw Mr. Barber about 11 o'clock opposite the Glengall public-house, which is about one hundred yards from where I live, and the same distance from his own house—I went looking for two men at the club-house, and afterwards went to Barber's lodging—it was then getting on for 12 o'clock—I saw Mrs. Barber at 4, Cahir-street, and walked with Mr. and Mrs. Barber to Mrs. McGeehan's, in Kingsbridge-place—we found a person named</p>

               <p>Conolly there, who also was known to me—I remained there twenty minutes or half an hour, and left to go home about half—past 12, as near as I can guess—Mr. and Mrs. Barber left at the same time, but not Conolly—we had to pass the turning to Kingsbridge—place to go to their house—there is a pillar post letter—box at the corner of the turning to England Cottages—it is just opposite the Ironmongers' Arms—I walked with them as far as the pillar post letter—box, and then stopped to shake hands—I noticed two policemen standing on the pavement opposite the pillar letter—box—one of them, the prisoner, crossed the road alone, came up to me, looked me in the face, gave me a chuck in the neck, and said, "What are you doing here at this time of night?"—there had been no noise or disturbance on our part to call for his interference, I was only shaking hands—Barber said that if he was doing his duty, or something like that, he would not carry on like that—he turned me rather round—the other man then came across the street, and Mrs. Barber shouted, "James, run"—they were in contact when the other man, William Brown, lauded on the pavement, and as soon as she shouted the other policeman said, "I will soon do for you, "and struck her on the temple with his baton—he was tried in the other Court for that assault—I caught Mrs. Barber in my arms, and the blood came on to my sleeve—Barber ran five or six steps backwards, as far as the dealer's shop, and the two policemen were making at him—they had their truncheons in their hands—I saw him run away and the constables after him—Mrs. Barber shouted a second time, "James, run, or they will murder you"—he ran, and the two policemen made after him, one saying to the other, "Now, mate, stick to me"—I went into my house, and Mrs. Barber rushed out of my arms and said she would follow James, or they would murder him—after I had been indoors Rome time, I went out to Mrs. McGeehan's—it had just gone 1 o'clock when I got there—I found Mr. and Mrs. Barber there—I noticed that Mr. Barber's hand was swelled—I think it was his left hand—he said that be should—not be able to work—his watch was broken and the—hands wore bent, it had stopped at four minutes to 1 o'clock.</p>

Humphreys and Morgan were acting in the matter at that time—Barber got a summons, but I did not—I did not go to the police-court more than once about a summons for myself—it was after Barber had been tried that I first knew the Marquis by sight, and Brown was tried the next day—I had given evidence in Barber's case—I have had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. altogether from the Court—I lost about four shillings a day every day I was there—that was more than five days; nearly three times five.</p>

I am a boiler-maker—in December last, I lived with my wife at 4, Cahir-street, Mill wall—I worked at Northfleet, at Mr. Charles Mare's yard, contracting for the caulking of ships, with my mate—on Saturday, 3d December, I left work about 4 o'clock—I had some men at work under me, and went to a public-house to pay them on leaving work—I had a glass of sherry to drink there, and before I left Northfleet I went to the Dover Castle, the club-house of the boiler-makers—I there had a bottle of ginger-beer—I am a teetotaller, and had no intoxicating liquor that night—when I got home, at half-past 4 o'clock, I saw Mrs. Barber—I, had a furnished room taken for her at Northfleet, as she was in bad health;—she came up with me to Millwall—we got there between 7 and 8—we left when the 6 o'clock train arrived, and went to 4, Cahir-street—I cannot say how long I remained there with my wife—I had a little business to transact, and went out to look for three men in the employment—I saw Patrick Smith at a little after 8—it was about half an hour after my tea—he was coming down past the Glengall—I then went home and saw my wife, and in three quarters of an hour or an hour left the house with Smith—we went down to his house, and I think he went in—I then went into the Ironmongers' Arms to look for two men to go to employment in North-fleet, and some more men came and asked for me—I then went home and found my wife there, and Mrs. Mc Geehan—Mr. Cannon is the landlord of the house—he was not there, and I do not think Mrs. Reid was there—Smith came to the house after I went there, and my wife and I, Mrs. McGeehan, and Smith went out, and walked down to Mrs. McGeehan's, No. 8, Kingabridge-place—no one else was there but Mrs. McGeehan and Conolly, my mate—we were consulting there about a little affair for an hour and a half or thereabouts—Smith and my wife came out with me, leaving Conolly behind—it was then between 12 and 1 o'clock—we had to cross the end of the street in which Smith lives, to go home—when we got to the pillar letter-box we stopped—we were quite sober, and there was not the slightest noise made by me or my wife—I noticed two police-constables on the other side of the street, the prisoner was one, he crossed over, looked in Patrick Smith's face and hit him in the neck with his</p>

               <p>hand—I could not catch the words he said as I am a little deaf, but it was something about the night, and he struck him on the face with his open hand—I told him he was not doing his duty or he would not do that, as he was a peaceable, quiet man—he turned about and struck me on the mouth and I struck him back again, and gave it him very hot too, and he deserved it and no mistake—the other policeman then came across the street, that was William Brown, who was tried here in January and got fourteen days. (<hi rend="italic">See page</hi> 233)—he bad his truncheon drawn and made at me—my wife told me to run or they would kill me—Brown then stepped past Smith and struck her on the temple deliberately with that baton that he carries—before I began to run I went four or five yards backwards, facing the two policemen—I was fighting a good retreat for four or five yards—I was not slack—I ran straight home for fear they should get me down and give me a benefit—Mr. Cannon, the master of the house let me in, and ray wife came in about three or four minutes after<lb/>wards dabbled all over with blood, her shawl and her chemise—the blood had been flowing from her temple—she told me to go for a doctor—she was bleeding like a cow which had been stuck—I took a stick and left the house, the policemen were then close to the door with their truncheons in their hands—they made blows at me and struck me over the kidneys and broke my watch—the man on the left-hand side, Brown, struck me also and I struck him—I was not three seconds from him; I had to defend myself, I let no man strike me and I not strike him back—I knocked him down and he richly deserved it—he got two months' for it and I got fourteen days—I think the prisoner made the best of his way out of my road in case he should get the same—I then went to Mrs. McGeehan's, Kingsbridge-place, my wife came there shortly afterwards—after I ran away the first time I saw Patrick Smith at Mrs. McGeehan's—I was excited and do not know what time that was—my watch was going before the blow which broke the glass, it could not have gone after the glass was broken for the bands and face were knocked in; she stopped at four minutes to one—she was a six-guinea watch—I think Patrick Smith, when he was at Mrs. McGeehan's, saw the hand on which I had the blow—I went with my wife in a cab to Poplar hospital and she was taken back to Mrs. McGeehan's in a cab—I left her there and went back on Sunday morning to my work at Northfleet, she was very bad at that time—Mr. Serjeant dressed the cut but she was under medical treatment before that—some time in the follow<lb/>ing week I think, I went with Mr. Morgan to the police-court to get a summons on the part of my wife against the police-constable—I did not get one and I did not go again—I do not know whether a summons was granted after Sir R. Mayne had been written to—next time I went to the police-court I was examined as a witness on a charge against Brown for assaulting my wife, after which I was charged with assaulting Brown—this man did not know me till he saw me going up to give evidence for my wife and then he came forward against me and charged me, but I own to it I do not deny what I have done—I had had no words or quarrel with my wife that evening—I never followed her with a stick or a poker, threatening to strike her with it—she said nothing in my hearing about "You murdering brute"—that is a fabrication these gentlemen have made up themselves—I was too kind to my wife to quarrel with her, for she was not in a state of health to quarrel with, she was under Mr. Debenham—I did not strike her at all—I braver heard that I had struck her till the trial at this Court.</p>

I am one of the late house-surgeons at St. Mary's Hospital—on 28th December, the boy Jacobs was brought there, and placed under my care—he was suffering from gunshot wounds in the right shoulder, and the right side of the face, and one shot in the right flank, on the right side—there were about twenty-five shots altogether, I think—I removed some of the shots—there are some of them in now—some will stop in always—there was a shot near the eye, but it had gone round the eye, and had not injured it—it is not extricated; he has it there now, it will be no injury to him—the shot in the side was not dangerous; it was very superficial—the shots were thickest about the right ear, and there I could not find that one shot was closer than half or three quarters of an inch to another—his eyes were bruised, and his nose was bruised on the bridge.</p>

                  </hi>. Until lately I was in partnership with my brother, Joseph Adnam, and carried on business as spice merchants in Maiden-lane—the prisoner was in our service as traveller—he received a salary of 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—his duties were to take orders and receive monies, and account to me for them—he used to remit a certain amount in the course of the week, and at the end of the journey he made up his book, and handed over the balance—he made use of a portion of the money to pay his expenses, and for his salary during the journey—in June 1864, I received a letter from a customer in the country—I believe the prisoner was then on his journey—when be came home I told him that I had received a letter from Messrs. Walters and Co. of Bristo I, stating that they had paid him an account for which I had applied to them—he said he had received the amount—I asked him if there were others—he said, "Yes, there were two or three others, "and either my brother or I requested him to give us a list—this is the list (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I can't exactly say when I received that from him, but I should think it must have been in October—he had pre<lb/>viously told me he thought the amounts he had received were between 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when he handed me this list I said, "This much exceeds the sum you told me, this represents about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,"—I asked him to give me a perfect list of the sums he had received—after he gave me that list he continued in the same position, so far as regards the collection of money, but afterwards he represented Messrs. Hicks—I still allowed him to collect my debts—after he left me to go to Messrs. Hicks, I ascertained that that list was not com<lb/>plete—this list contains a statement of the amounts which the prisoner had to collect upon his last journey—the writing on the left-hand side, where the amounts are debited, is a clerk's writing, and it was the prisoner's duty to enter what he collected on the right-hand side—Mr. Carter's name is down as a debtor to the. firm for 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on the opposite side there is an entry of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the prisoner's writing as received on 31st May, 1864, but that was really paid in a prior journey, and on 31st May he received 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Mr. Stone is put down as a debtor for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there does not appear to have been anything collected there—the name of William Candy is down for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and nothing received—I have looked through his book—I do not find any entries of money having been paid by Mr. Stone or Mr. Candy—it was the prisoner's duty to enter the sums received</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What was the prisoner first of all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He came as an engineer, about eleven years since—he continued in that capacity between two and three years, then a Mr. Hawkins, a traveller, left and the prisoner was placed in his situation—he took four quarterly journeys to the West of England—he had about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to collect each journey—we first gave him 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and then 35<hi rend="italic">a.</hi>—he was also to have a present of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at Christmas—we paid his expenses—I remember his complaining to me of not having enough for his journeys and expenses, and Calling rather behind—I can't say that that was the first time of his falling behind, because there was a falling behind before be commenced as traveller—he married a second time—I took a mortgage of his wife's property—I found that he was about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. behind—we were told the mortgage was worth about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that there was about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. coming to him—I don't know what the property consisted of—he had received 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after he had given this security he continued on with me and my brother—our profits did not keep increasing while he was traveller; they kept about the same—he kept receiving about the same amount each quarter—my brother and I ceased our partnership in December last year—the prisoner then continued on with me for some time, until he went to Mr. Hick's, who carries on a similar business—I knew where to find the prisoner—I did not always find him right and regular in his tran<lb/>sactions; sometimes there were deficiencies—I did not always call his attention to all the names in the list—I did to some—I used to say why has so and so not paid—I can't swear that I did that with respect to these three sums.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Windmill public-house, in the New-cut Lambeth—I know all the prisoners—they used my house—on Monday, 6th March, I saw Campbell with one of these pistols in his possession—he was showing it—I saw White sometime afterwards join him, and in the course of the day I saw Roberts, or <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi>, as I call him—I saw Campbell showing him a revolver—Campbell asked me to buy one, but I said I did not want one—next day Campbell left two in my charge—I lent him 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on them till next morning, when he said he had a customer for them—he returned me the money next morning, and took them away—they were pistols of a similar description to these—I had seen the prisoners almost every day previous to the 6th of March—I had not seen Roberts for weeks before—the others I had seen almost every day—they are living in the street—Campbell and Collins were in and out of my house all the evening of Saturday, 4th March—I have no doubt that Collins was in my house on the 6th; I could not swear it—I did not see any pistols in his charge.</p>

Q.</hi> What position was the prisoner in, was he the only clerk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was an assistant; he was not exactly a clerk—there was no one else to help him—he assisted me—he sold everything that was asked for, but he had no management of the business—I was never absent more than one day at a time—no one lives in the house but the housekeeper—if I was away the prisoner would manage in my absence for me—I have never been away for three days together—I would not swear I have not been away two days—the letters were always left until I came back, to the best of my judgment, I believed so, I expected so—the prisoner has never opened letters for me that I am aware of—I remember his father coming during the week that he stayed away—I told his father that I was very sorry for him; I did feel sorry—he did not bring the boy back with him then; he did the fol<lb/>lowing week—the prisoner engaged himself as fifteen years old to me—I felt very sorry for him; I don't remember crying—I did not tell his father that I did not restrict him in anything, because I restricted him in opening the letters—I live in the country—I may have been away two days, but not frequently; never been away more—I should have expected the letters to remain if I had stayed away a week—I did not find that he opened my letters for me; certainly not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commercial traveller—the prisoner is my son—he had been into one or two employments before this and always con<lb/>ducted himself satisfactorily—I remember going to Mrs. Rose's on 16th February—she told me what had taken place, and she was sorry to say that my son had proved inattentive to business, and she was afraid he had got hold of some bad company—she also told me that he had used some money of her's previously, and paid it to her when he could; on one or two occa<lb/>sions; but she said he was a youth she was very fond of, he was an intelligent lad, and she talked to hint, and he cried to her, and she cried with him; she also Said she should be sorry to see his prospects damaged in life—she told me that he had full power to act in the business the same as she did herself, and she placed no restriction in his way, because she had full confidence in him—not a word was said about letters, but she told me this, that she for<lb/>gave him what be had done, and I told her that I did not wish her to lose the money, I would pay her what deficiency there was—she said she did not wish that—I said, "When he comes back I hope you will keep a watch on him"—he was not well at that time, and I took him back on the Monday—Mrs. Rose then called a policeman and gave him in charge—she said she had given him full power to collect all moneys and to manage the business the same as she did herself.</p>

I am the daughter of James Piper, a butcher, of Brentford and Isleworth—on 13th March, about one in the day, a man came in and asked for change for a half-crown—I gave it to him in silver and he left—after that another man came in for a biscuit, and paid me with two half<lb/>pence—the prisoner afterwards came in and asked me for two biscuits—he gave me a half-sovereign, and I went into the parlour for change—one of the other men followed me from the street into the parlour—that was the man for whom I had changed the half-crown—he said, "He <hi rend="italic">don't</hi> want any change now"—I had got the change ready then—he followed me back into the shop and said a second time, "He does not want change"—I put the half-sovereign on the counter, and the prisoner said, "I want change, "and put the half-sovereign again into my hand with the head uppermost—another customer then came in, and I gave the prisoner 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver and fourpence in copper—the prisoner and the man for whom I had changed the half-crown went out together—I then turned the half-sovereign over, and saw on the other side the Prince of Wales' feathers—I ran after the prisoner and saw him running away with the other man—I took the coin to my uncle, Thomas Piper.</p>

I told him I could not attend to him then, but if he came round to my aunt's in the Bethnal-green-road in the afternoon, I would see what I could do for him"—he said that Reynolds came to his aunt's, and gave him a parcel to take in to pledge at Mr. Shefford's—I asked what he got on them—he said he got 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on them, but he only gave Rey<lb/>nolds 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of it, and the ticket, which Reynolds destroyed—I asked him whether he thought they were honestly come by—he said, "Well, when I was in the pawnbroker's, I thought there was something wrong about them, but as I was there I thought I might as well leave them"—I took him into custody.</p>

               <p>him down and both wheels passed over him—I was then about fifteen yards from him—the van was about three yards from the edge of the kerbstone, on the north side—that was the wrong side—the old man was put in a cab and sent to the hospital—I followed the van; it was stopped between twenty and thirty yards off—I said to the prisoner, "You must be a madman to run over that poor fellow when you had all the road to yourself, "pointing to the road, which is fifty feet wide, and there was nothing but a cab there—he made no answer—he did not get down willingly—I said, "You had better get down and see about the poor man, "and he got down—he was going at least eight miles an hour—they seemed to me two good horses and they were going as fast as he could make them.</p>

               <p>I then shoved the door and went in, and saw the man Barrett (Jeffery) titling on a bench—Brewerton was standing in the centre of the shop, and Mrs. Brewerton near him—I said, "Barrett and Brewerton, you must con<lb/>sider you selves in custody for being concerned with others in several jewel robberies in the City and the Strand"—at the time I took Jeffery by the collar, Moss took Brewerton, and a violent struggle took place between them—another officer arrived, and at that time I saw Jeffery pass something to Mrs. Brewerton—she turned round and ran upstairs, followed by Mrs. Jeffery—I gave Jeffery into Ranger's custody, and followed quickly behind the women upstairs—before I could reach the top, Mrs. Brewerton turned aside into the room on the left and locked the door; Mrs. Jeffery went to the right—I knocked at the door where Brewerton went in, and said, "Open the door quickly; "not receiving any answer, I burst it open, and saw her with her right hand putting something in her pocket, taking at the same time something off the mantel-shelf with her left hand and putting it towards her pocket—I said, "What have you got there?"—she said, "Nothing"—I went to take hold of her hand, and she caught me by my hair and my whiskers, and held me in that position until the arrival of Sergeant Moss, who released me—she struggled violently—a sergeant in uniform came up, and he and Moss held her hands while I took from her pocket these four or five parcels (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) containing gold chains—they were in a piece of old newspaper then—they are all gold chains; most of them new—there were some pieces of broken chain also; they appear pieces of new chain broken up—all I produce now I took from Mrs. Brewerton—I also found a purse containing spade guineas and half guineas, six 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, some pieces of chain, and four rings—this is the purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I also found this small box on the drawers in the room—it contained some lockets, a piece of chain, and another guinea, and two receipts for money paid into the London and Westminster Bank; one for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "18th January, 1865, received from Mr. William Henry Jeffery 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sterling, to the credit of his deposit-account at the London and Westminster Bank;" 23d January, received from Mr. William Henry Jeffery 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. &amp;c."—I have six 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes here—the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was found at the other house—we then conveyed the prisoners to the station, and pro<lb/>ceeded to 13, Ely-terrace, Bow-road—I knocked at the door, Mrs. Caseley put her head out at the window, and said, "Who are you?"—I knew her at that time by the name of "Casey "only—I said, "We are police-officers; open the door" hearing a bustle in the house, and no one coming to open the door, I burst it open—Moss was close to me at the time—I rushed up<lb/>stairs followed by him, and saw the woman Caseley run out of a small room at the back into the front-room, where I found the man Caseley—at that moment Brannan came up, and I left him in charge of the two Caseleys in the front-room, and went into the back-room, where I saw Mrs. Caseley come from—in searching that room we found this box locked (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Moss took a poker and broke it open—I lifted the lid and saw a quantity of watches and chains, fifty-two gold watches, and one silver watch, gold coin to the amount of 196<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, and a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I mentioned at the police-court that it was 246<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but that includes the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—the money was all in this bag, as it is now; it was taken to the station, untied, and counted in the presence of the superintendent—it has been in Mr. Durkin's pos<lb/>session ever since—we tied a piece of rope round the box and took it to the station—there was a large quantity of gold chains in it—the jewellery and money in the box is all in reference to this robbery—we found another box</p>

               <p>containing a large quantity of property, but not connected with this case—on searching the bed I found this life-preserver under the pillow, and down<lb/>stairs, in the same house, we found a jemmy, and a lot of skeleton-keys—the revolver I found in Caseley's room, in the box—I also found a number of caps and bullets and other things, and a false beard and moustache—most of the skeleton-keys were downstairs in the kitchen—there were also some screw-drivers found—I have produced all the things found in the house, with reference to this case—I took Thomas Caseley to the station with Sergeant Moss—on our way he said, "What robberies are you going to buff to me, as I can prove where I was at the time of Johnson's robbery, and the shawl robbery; I was doing time; I am right for Walker's"—I said, "Who are the others?"—he mentioned the names of two others—he said, if I allowed him to give evidence he would tell me all about it—I told him I should make no promises; that was an after consideration.</p>

Crossley's office, on the first-floor front, which is over Mr. Walker's shop, and compared the marks that were on the door—they appeared recent—the marks were on the door-post, as if the jemmy had been pressed as a lever to force open the lock of the door; it was tried in three places—the marks corresponded with the jemmy exactly.</p>

Johnson's burglary—I found a quantity of jewellery in your possession, which has been identified as Mr. Johnson's property—I did not find it then—you said to your wife, "Give me those things that Billy gave you"—I did not know they belonged to Mr. Johnson then—I have heard your other name; it is "Tom, the madman"—we heard that wherever we found Bar<lb/>rett, we should find "Tom, the madman, "which was you—that is a nick<lb/>name you are known by amongst the thieves—I can't say you have not been at work since you were discharged from the convict-gate, up to the time you were charged with Mr. Walker's burglary—you did not say that you</p>

I am a carver and gilder, and live at 16, Turner-street, Stepuey—about twenty-five minutes past 12 on 31st March I was in Whitechapel passing Plough-alley, when the prisoner threw his arms round me—a lad about fourteen came up and raised my over coat several times, and attempted to take my watch and chain—I threw the prisoner on his back—he called for assistance and some one said, "Hit him"—in the struggle the prisoner's cap fell off—I picked it up, and handed it to the constable—I do not know what became of the boy—I have not seen him since—the prisoner got away and ran down Plough-court into the arms of a policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Messrs. Herbert, jewellers, of Newman-street, Oxford-street—on the afternoon of 12th February I took some gold to the flatting mills at Clerkenwell—I was bringing it back in the evening at twenty minutes or half-past 7—when I was nearly at the top of Newman-street, I saw three men, the prisoner, and another man were standing near Newman's yard, and a tall man with a light coat on was standing in Newman's yard—when I got near the man who was standing down the Mews he said, "Here, George, is this St. Ann's Court"—I did not answer him, and he made a rush at me, and caught me by the coat—I tried to cry out "Murder!" but could not; he then caught me tighter—I had a strap over my shoulder, with a bag under my left arm, containing thirty<lb/>seven ounces of gold, four crucibles, an account-book, and a tin case—the prisoner and the other man then shut one of the gates at the end of the Mews, and then they ran down to me, and the prisoner cut the strap which</p>

               <p>was across ray shoulder, but I do not know who got the bag; he also cut my coat and my shirt—the other man then threw me down with great violence on the stones; he lifted me off the ground—I was stunned; and when I got up they had gone—I went to my master's shop and told the foreman—I can speak positively to the prisoner—I did not see him again till 31st January, when I picked him out from eight other people at Old-street station.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived some time back at 1, Providence-place, Market-street, London-road, and am a widow—I remember one of the prisoners calling on me on. Lord Mayor's day last year—that was 9th November—it was the one by the name of "Carrotty Fred"—it now seems his name is Wilkinson—it might have been the beginning of the week of 9th November—he called once or twice, if not three times—he asked me if iny son was in—I said, "No"—my son's name is Thomas Edward Evershed—he said he wanted to see my son; he wanted him to do some work with the horse and cart—he said he wanted it for Mr. Bennoch—he came again,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186504100071"/>
               <p>and my son was not in then—he said he wanted him to go and do some work for him, and be mentioned <hi rend="italic">Velvet Ned</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Bill Barrett</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Scotty</hi>, and after that he came again—the prisoners are very differently attired now to what they were—I see <hi rend="italic">Velvet Ned</hi> here now; be is the one nearest to me (<hi rend="italic">Brewerton</hi>)—I don't know Caseley—there is <hi rend="italic">Carrotty Fred</hi>, 1; <hi rend="italic">Scotty</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Brown</hi>) 2; and Barrett (<hi rend="italic">Jeffery</hi>,) 3—I think on the Monday or Tuesday following Lord Mayor's-day, Wilkinson came and said they had got the silk; that he went inside and packed the silk up, and the others were outside; and he said if he had not been short of money be would not have done it, for they were almost quarrelling with him—my son had a horse and cart.</p>

A.</hi> In Providence-place, Market-street—I am quite sure about that—I was not living at 4, Salisbury<lb/>place, Walworth New-town—I have only lived there four weeks—my son never lived there—my grandson lives with me, and did on 8th November, at 1, Providence-place—I lived with my son to take care of his wife, who was dying, and she did die—I was there in November—I was there for four or five weeks—my son does not go by any other name than Evershed that I am aware of—he did not go by the name of Gront—he has been convicted of felony, and has got ten years' penal servitude—he got that at the Sessions on 6th February (<hi rend="italic">Set Vol. lxi., page</hi> 111)—I don't know the date of the offence with which he was charged—I think it was in December—it was not at the time I was in hishouse that he was accused of it—I knew nothing of it—Alfred Evershed is my grandson—I remember histaking a sovereign once off the mantelpiece—I took it away from him—he had it in his pocket—I spoke to the police about this matter a week after the Sessions, which were on 6th February—I called on Mr. Potter, and I met him at the Clerkenwell Sessions-house, and he asked me where I lived, and I told him I was going to move, and I would tell him next time I saw him—I met him, I believe, the next day—he said, "Good morning" and said, "Well, I met Hurley yesterday in the Mile End-road"—I said, "I wanted to see him"—he is one of the prisoners—Mr. Potter said, "Why did not you come up for your friend as you ought to have done?" meaning my son; "he has had a bad name; he ought to have twenty yean instead of ten"—I said, "Oh, has he? If that is so, I will tell you who has done them," and I gave him the names of these prisoners—at that time there was a horse and cart in the possession of the police belonging to my son—there was also a watch and chain and one ring—I have got back all the things since—I know a person who went by the name of "Hannah"—I was never accused of receiving stolen goods from her—I dare say she is where she lived before—she lived in John-street, in the "Cut"—I was in business—we bought lead and melted it, and sold it again—there was not a burglary at that place after I left, as I know of; I am quite sure of that—my son was never accused of breaking into the place we had formerly lived at—I never sent my grandson to Wilkinson to tell him my son was taken up—he knew where Wilkinson lived; he could go on his own account without me sending him—Velvet Ned mentioned Mr. Bennoch's name when he came and asked for my son—he said he wanted a cart to go to Bennoch's in Wood-street—it was in con<lb/>templation weeks before they did it—I think it it was on the Monday or Tuesday after 9th November that he came, and said he had got the silk, and he packed it up, and he was saying how much it would realize, and how much they would sell it a yard, and the quantity of it—I don't think that was the next day or the next day but one after 8th November—I don't</p>

I live in Millfield-lane, Highgate—on the night of the 14th of January I examined my house before going to bed—it was about half-past twelve—the house was secured in the regular way—the windows were fastened, all the doors were looked and bolted on the inside—about half past three in the morning I heard ray front-door bell ring and heard cries of "Police"—I hastened up and called my sons and we went down to give assistance—I found that the dressing-room had been entered by the window, the dining-room ransacked and a quantity of things removed—a cash-box had been broken open and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver taken from it—a clock had been removed from the man<lb/>tel-piece—I went into the garden and saw two constables with two men named Grant and Northgate in custody.</p>

My wife was in the bar on this evening—I think the size of the bar is about eighteen feet by four—we were very busy indeed—if my wife was at one end of the bar serving she could scarcely hear what passed between me and any other person at the other end, if any one was hallooing.</p>

I have for some time been pot<lb/>boy at the Golden Anchor—I have known the prisoner about four or five years, known him to speak to, and known him well—I called him Seraphin—on the night of 26th December, between six and seven o'clock I was serving in the bagatellc-room—there were no Italians in the bagatelle-room—there were a great many Italians in the tap-room—I saw no others but Italians in the tup-room—there had been a little dancing there in the early part of the evening, about an hour and half before—it is called the dancing-room—I went from the bar and passed from the bagatelle-room into the tap-room—at that time I saw the prisoner there—I also saw a man who is called <hi rend="italic">John, Gregorio's</hi> brother, his proper name is Giovanni Mogni—he does not play an organ; he is a frame-maker—there is a man named John who plays an organ; that is a different man—when I went in Giovanni Mogni told me to go back or else I should catch it as well us the others—the prisoner heard it; he might have beard it, he did not speak it soft, he spoke loud—I did not say anything to that, I went back—I asked him first, what for, I had done nothing—he said, "Go back, don't be a fool" and I went back into the bagatelle-room—I made a communication to the persons who were in the bagatelle-room, and in consequence of what they said to me I went out into the yard—I got out of the window—the window was open, it remained open—I got some sticks from the brew-house, kitchen and cellar, I dare say there were five or</p>

               <p>know at the same trade as the Italians—the Italians don't always dance there; they do sometimes, when they want to I suppose—the Italians do not as a general rule use the bagatelle-room—the English play bagatelle, they enjoy themselves when they want to, I suppose—the cupboard is in the bagatelle-room and the staircase is at the bottom of it—you can get from the cupboard to the staircase; it leads to the kitchen and up into the bar by the half-door and so on to Saffron-hill or Castle-street, or any part you like—this was <hi rend="italic">Boxing</hi>-night; they boxed me very well too—I had not been making myself rather happy; I was too hard at work that night, too busy—I had not been very thirsty in the early part of the day—I had not been drinking—I had taken nothing—I had taken my beer; I am allowed three pints a day—I had no more on <hi rend="italic">Boxing</hi>-night than any other day—I had not had my three pints at this time, I had only had two, they did me out of the other—I did not have any supper—I know Fawell the policeman—he does not come to our house often, never—he had not been in the house that evening, not before the row; I am quite sure about that—I did not see him or hear that he was there—if he had been there I dare say I should have seen him; I am in and out of the bar all the night—of course I have seen him in the house, but not that day—he does not use the house—he was there last Saturday, he brought me my paper, my subpoena—the tap-room is not a dancing-room, they do dance there when they want to—the young ladies from the neighbourhood dance there when they want to—the Italians were all in that room—I did not see them breaking up the benches, but when I came out of the hospital I saw they had been broken up—it was me who supplied the English in the bagatelle-room with their weapons—I had never done such a thing before—they were nicely convenient.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You anticipated a row, and so you thought you would give the English the means of a good stand-up fight; that was the history of it, was it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; a woman came in and said there was seventeen of them with knives in their hands the night before this—that was a Mrs. Stewart—I don't know whether she is here—after I had supplied the English with the weapons, they did not go to the tap-room door in a body of six or eight and call out to the Italians to come out to them—I mean to say that did not occur; they were all sitting down there; nothing of the kind occurred—I saw Mrs. King fall<lb/>ing—I did not see who struck her; I said so before—I did not see anybody strike her—I daren't say who it was; I saw some one's arm up—I have no doubt she was struck, from the way she fell—I did not see anybody strike her—I did not see who it was done it—I said before the Magistrate that it was not Seraphini who struck her; that was what I told you before—I don't know whether it was Seraphini who struck her—(<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition being read stated: "I saw one of them knock Mrs. King down, it was not the prisoner done that"</hi>)—I know I said that; I said so before, at the first trial—I was not examined before the Coroner, only at the Police-court—I heard Mrs. King say at the Police-court that it was Seraphini that did it; after that when I was examined here on the first trial, I said, "I saw one of them knock her down; I don't know which it was—I can't say it was the prisoner, I don't know"—I say so now; I say I don't know who it was done it—I saw some one's hand up to knock her down, but I don't know whose it was—I saw her falling, and I saw some one's arm up—I did not see any thing but the arm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you saw nothing but the arm, how are you able to say it was not Seraphini? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I say I don't know who it was done it—it might have been Seraphini, or it might have been some one else—there was a lot morn behind</p>

               <p>him; anybody else might have reached over his shoulder—I saw the arm go back—there were about twelve or fourteen altogether; not all coming in at the same time, all behind him, and up he went and stabbed me in the room and the door was shut, and the others were all shut out; they turned back—the others did not know he was in the room—I don't know that I ever said before to-day that I used the words, "This man stabbed me"—I daren't answer whether I did or not—I did not hear that Fawell said I did, and pointed the prisoner out—I did say it—I think this is the first time I have mentioned it; I don't know if I mentioned it before or no—I don't think I have mentioned before the fact of the prisoner being brought to my bedside—I don't know who brought him to my bedside; he was there when I looked round—he was not the only person brought; there was a lot more there—I was not asked to say which of them it was—I don't know whether he was the only Italian—I had known him so well that I am sure he was the person who was brought to my bedside—I did not see any other Italian—MR. Baldock said, "You listen to me"—he was reading a paper, what I said—he said, "Listen to this, Rebbeck, hear what the doctor says; you are dying, "and they they took him away—he said nothing else—I pointed out the prisoner myself—he was standing at the side of my bed—Baldock was not close to him; he was at the other side with the doctor—Baldock was one side of the doctor, and the prisoner the other, close to my bedside, look<lb/>ing over the bed, and when I looked up I saw him—he was looking down, and when I said, "That is the man, "he held his head back—I remember Gregorio Mogni being before the Magistrate—I was examined as a witness there.</p>

               <p>see any of them—I was then immediately stabbed—I had got right up to the door, because I had hold of the lock with my hand—the door was par<lb/>tially open and I had hold of the door, so that my body would be presented face to face to the man who was entering.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then except your own physical power there was nothing to prevent the whole of the Italians from rushing in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. King and Mr. Mellership were standing behind the door—they did not all rush to the door—the others were sitting down in the room singing a song—I was stabbed in the side here (<hi rend="italic">pointing to his right side</hi>) between the eighth and ninth ribs, I believe—I struck the prisoner with the broom-handle—when he pulled the knife out, I laid hold of the broom—handle and hit him in the head, and he ran at me again and I fell in the room and the door was shut—I went back into the room—the door closes with a spring—it is not a swing—door which opens either inwards or outwards; it opens inwards and closes of itself with a spring.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you mean by saying this, I cannot quite make it out, "I said to King, 'Open the door and let them come in one at a time,' "did you say that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I said we were bound to do them, to beat them—I thought that was the best way to beat them—we were prepared with broomsticks and other articles of a similar description in our own defence—I can't say whether all of us were armed; I am sure I was—I don't know that Rebbeck had brought us arms; some one did; I don't say Rebbeck; I can't say who did—some one gave me a stick, but who I can't say—some one brought in some sticks, and laid them on the bagatelle-board, and I took one up, I can't speak for others—I can't say whether the others were armed or not.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You did say to King, "Open the door and let them cone in one at a time?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—that is quite right—that was before Seraphini had come in at all—I believe King did open the door—I am sure he did, a little way, and Seraphini came in and the door was shut; King shut it immediately—whether it was opened again I can't say, my eyes were upon Seraphini—what he did afterwards I can't say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then your version of the story is, not that the door was pushed open by Seraphini and the people outside, but that King opened it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That I can't say—whether the door was pushed in or Seraphini was pushed in; I can't say; he came in one way or the other—I will swear Seraphini was the only man in the bagatelle-room—we took good care he should be the only man—we thought that was the only way to beat him—he would have beaten us if we had given him the slightest chance—we did not get him in, he was shoved in, or he came in at all events, and I hit him on the head, bat before that he made the thrust at Harrington—I told King to let them in one at a time, because when I was in the tap-room I saw there was a lot, so I thought I would let them in one at a time and beat them in detail—what was the motive of their coming into the room if they did not mean mischief?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You had seen the Italians in the tap-room breaking up benches? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had—I should think there were fourteen or fifteen Italians there—I told the people in the bagatelle-room what I had seen, and then I took hold of a weapon as soon as I got in; they laid across the bagatelle-board—I saw Mrs. King go out of the room, but she came tumbling back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see King open the door, or do you suppose that he opened it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was standing behind the door—I did say that he opened it, but I should not like to swear whether he did or not—it does not matter who opened the door—whether the door was pushed open or whether he opened it I don't positively know; it is a very hard thing to say—at the time Seraphini turned to go out of the room, Bannister was between him and the door, so that he should not get out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you able to say positively whether at that time any other Italian was in the room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am sure, if I was to fall dead on these steps this minute, there was not—I am telling no lie, if I am may God strike me dead—Seraphini was in the room when Harrington fell, and no other Italian—he struck Bannister, and Bannister rolled under the bagatelle-board, sayiug, "Look out, Painter"—they call me "George the painter."</p>

                  </hi>. On the evening of 26th December last I went to the Golden Anchor, between 6 and 7 o'clock—that was the first time I had been there that day—in consequence of something that was said to me at the bar I went into the bagatelle-room—I went from the bar. from the Castle-street entrance; that would be across the end of the bar and the bar<lb/>parlour—I know the half-hatch which is between the inside of the bar and the tap-room—a person in the tap-room could see me going across the bar into the bagatelle-room—I did not see Mrs. King go out—about three or four minutes after I had got into the bagatelle-room I saw the Italians rush towards the door to push it open—I mean the bagatelle-room-door leading to the tap-room, the west-door—they did not get further than the door—the door was thrown wide open, but Seraphini was the only one that got right into the room, the others got no further than the door—when the door was wide open the fight began at the door—the moment Seraphini got into the room the door was closed—he was the only Italian I saw in the room at the time, the others got no further than the door, and when the door was closed he was the only one in the room—I know no more, I made it my business to get out of the room—I was stabbed—I don't know who it was stabbed me—I was standing in between Rebbeck and Harrington—I can't say how I was with reference to Seraphini—we were standing all within about two or three feet of the door, very close together—I was stabbed in the right hand with ft knife—the knuckle was cut of the little finger—I have lost the use of my finger—I was knocked down—I laid first on the table and from there I think I fell under the bagatelle-table or close by—I spoke to Stanley and said, "Stanley I shall get out"—the prisoner was then in the room, he was being held down by King, or King had him in hand.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I will call your attention to what you said before the magistrate, "almost as soon as I got in, a number Italians, of whom the prisoner is one, rushed in; "have you no idea now, why you were not called? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If I was not called in, it was not my fault, I was outside—the Italians rushed to the door, the door was wide open and the fight was against the door, perhaps it may be in the room or it may be out of the room, it was at the door—a number of Italians rushed to the door but the door was closed, and when I got up off the ground Seraphini was the only one in the room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it true that a number of Italians, of whom the prisoner was one, rushed into the roem? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They rushed to the door and tried to get in but they did not—I said they rushed to the door, I think that was what</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186504100102"/>
               <p>I said in my first evidence—the door was thrown open and the fight began at the door; that was where all the mischief was done—I stated that before the magistrate, Mr. D'Eynconrt.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not say to a policeman that you doubted whether it was Seraphini, and did not the policeman say to you something of this kind, "Oh, d—it, you <hi rend="italic">funk</hi>, do you?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that was said to me at the Police-court; it might have been by a policeman in private clothes, I was in Bagnigge Wells-road, and there were several others, policemen I fancy, one of them said to me, "Well, Bannister, I think you are <hi rend="italic">funking</hi> on this case, you are afraid of the knife, but it don't matter what you say, Stanley knows all that you have got to say."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What bad you said before that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had said nothing—I had said nothing to any policeman, nor to the magistrate—I did express a doubt whether the prisoner was one of those who first came up—I can't say exactly when I first expressed that doubt—I have said it I think several times—I have said to several that I was not exactly sure, because I thought at that time two or three of the Italians were so much alike, I did not exactly know one from the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you expressed that doubt before the man in plain clothes, whom you thought was a policeman, said this to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To tell you the truth I did not care much about speaking to policemen; it might have been a policeman in private clothes; before he spoke to me I had not expressed the doubt I now mention, to anybody; I think that was the first person I spoke to, and that was the second or third morning after the affair.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it after you had been examined, and made the statement, that I have read to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Before; it was not said in the presence of policemen, only those in plain clothes—I think it was in Bagnigge-wells-road; at least, it was close against the Police-court—there were no policemen near that I am aware of—I had come from the hospital, and was going towards the Police-court, and I met with some gentlemen, as I thought they were, they might have been policemen; they spoke to me, and said, "Good morning, Bannister"—I said. "Good morning, "and they said to me, "How is this case going on?"—I said, "I don't know, "and one of them, <hi rend="italic">chaffing</hi>, said, "Oh, I think by what I hear, you are funking a bit on it, but it don't matter; we have got the witness Stanley; he knows all about it, don't he?"—I said, "I think he does; he is a young friend that spoke up for me"—I have never seen those persons since—I expressed the doubt as to whether Seraphini was the person, long before I went to the Police-court, to my mother and several others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you say you expressed a doubt whether the prisoner was one of the persons, are we to understand that you have a doubt in your own mind whether he was or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I have a very great doubt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>in the hand"—she said, "Who stabbed you? and I said, "I don't exactly know"—she went over to a public-house opposite our place, and some one told her about it, and that Seraphim was locked up for the case, and she said, "Was it Seraphini stabbed you or not? "and I said, "I am not sure whether it was Seraphini or not"—that was what I said before the Magistrate; that was the only doubt I spoke of, because I could not say which man it was—I know I was stabbed, but I can't say who it was thai stabbed me—I saw Seraphini in the room; I have no doubt whatever about that; he was the only Italian in the room when I got up off the ground—I saw no other Italian but him in the room that night—I saw him at the time I saw a number of Italians at the door—I have not the least doubt about that; I saw him at the door then—that was not when I was looking over the dwarf-door—I was in the bagatelle-room within about a foot, or two feet, of the door when it was thrown open, and he passed in—I saw who was in the passage, because the door was thrown wide open, and the light from the centre of the bagatelle-room shone right on their faces—they were prevented coming into the room—I think they were knocked back by two or three English chaps; there was Stanley and young Raffell, I think they were the two that used the sticks, and I had a stick, and we kept them back the tat way we could.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you able explain how it was that Seraphini managed to get into the room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think there were only two or three of us when the was first pushed open, and the English chaps were a little bit timid or frightened, and ran away, to left the door, and allowed them to push into the room, and I think when they found we had sticks, and two or three had cracks on the head, they stopped a bit—I don't know whether I was exa-mined before the magistrate the same morning that I had the conversation with the persons in plain clothes in Bagnigge-well's-road, but it was after wards, and I was then bound over to appear at this Court—I attended here it the last trial on my subpoena ready to be called; why I was not called I do not know.</p>

When Harrington spoke of the man who had wounded him, he said it was either the man with the black or dark moustache, I am not positive which—my opinion is that he said black, but I should not like to to be certain whether he said dark or black—i have not always stated that he said black; I think he did, but I will not be positive—I know Gregorio now; I do not know whether he wore a moustache—I saw him with a moustache when he came to the police-station, but I was told he had not a moustache when the offence was committed—several persons on Saffron-hill told me so—I saw him at the station-house with a mous<lb/>tache, when he was there with Mr. Negretti—I have not got the date; it was not uutil after the conviction of the prisoner—I should think it was about a week or a fortnight after the first trial—it was a dark moustache—I did not lose the paper that I produced to Harrington, I gave it to the solicitor, and the clerk took it—I do not know who employed the solicitor; I swear that—I have heard, but I do not know of my own knowledge—I heard that Mr. Shaw the Magistrate, and he handed them to the clerk, and he laid them on the table as being of no value—Sergeant Baldock had drawn out that paper—he wrote it down—I have stated to-day that when Harrington said it was the man with the dark or black moustache, the prisoner said nothing—he said nothing until he said, "I do not understand English writing"—he never opened his mouth to my knowledge—I never heard him speak before that—he uttered no ejaculation, not the slightest—he appeared very much hurt, as far as that he hung down his head, and appeared to feel his position, and never looked up—he said nothing, and uttered no ejaculation, I am quite sure about that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you mean by saying before the magistrate, "I saw Rebbeck following the prisoner into the bagatelle-room?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was from the tap-room door, when we went through the two doors; I do not mean after we broke the door open; previous to that; Rebbeck told me he had been stabbed—he was going into the bagatelle-room as I stated, following the pri<lb/>soner as I supposed—when he stated that he had been stabbed we went in at one door and pushed the other door open—Rebbeck stood in the tap-room</p>

               <p>by my side—I did state before the magistrate that I saw Rebbeck following the prisoner into the bagatelle-room; he pointed a man out; a man was pointed out to me who I believe to be the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are supposed to have said, (if you made any mistake correct it), that when you got in the tap-room, the tap-room door was closed, and further that the bagatelle-room door was not open as far as you know till Elliott broke it open? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, when I went in after I had got the assist<lb/>ance of Elliott I met Rebbeck in the tap-room, he said, "Mr. Fawell, I am stabbed"—I said, "By whom?"—he said, "By that man"—the tap-room door was opened, it was immediately closed again, we rushed through and burst the other door open and when we got in we found the prisoner in the custody of King and Mellership.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But as I understand you the door opening from the bagatelle-room was not open till Elliott broke it open? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I should judge not—I went from the tap-room into the bagatelle-room by pulling one door and pushing the other—I cannot tell whether Anybody opened it from the time the first door was closed, because we had to pull it open again to get the other door open; Elliott was in some part of the tap-room at the time; the man was pointed out to me, he must have been a very short distance from me; I cannot say whether he was in front or behind, we were all in confusion; there were about twenty people in the tap-room at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you quite sure that Elliott did force open the door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I followed clone upon him, and when I got into the room I saw the prisoner—I cannot say that anybody went through the door, although the door was partly open—I am quite sure that Elliott did open the door—I immediately followed him into the room and saw the prisoner held by Mr. King and Mellership.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you seen the prisoner before that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were so many in there—I do not know whether I saw the prisoner—he was the only man I saw in the room when he was pointed out—I saw several English people in the bagatelle-room besides the prisoner—I did not see Rebbeck there—I saw Bannister, Stanley, and several of the witnesses who have been examined.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You came in I suppose from the Saffron-hill entrance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I went at once to the door; there was nothing to delay my passage from the tap-room door to the bagatelle-room, more than getting through the squabble—there were a great number of Italians—it did not take Elliott an instant to break open the door—when I got in I found the prisoner in a stooping position in the hands of Mellership and King—I cannot say whether I had seen him before that or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you before that seen Rebbeck following any man into the room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He pointed a man out and said that he had been stabbed, that was in the tap-room, before we got into the bagatelle-room at all—he pointed to a man who was standing close to the door, in the tap-room; not in the passage, but in the tap-room—I do not know what became of that—I do not know whether it was the same man or not—he pointed out a man in the tap-room and that man was standing there.</p>

               <p>not get hold of him, there was such a fight in the room that it was impossible—I do not know what became of him—I did not see Rebbeck go into the bagatelle-room—when I got into the bagatelle-room I found the prisoner being held by two parties—it was in the tap-room that Rebbeck told me he had been stabbed, by the swing-door that comes from the bar—he pointed out one of the men that was there—I could hardly tell which one he meant, there was so many—he was nearest the door and I judged that was the one he meant—he was close to the door through which he went—I did not notice him at the time, for I was looking after myself as well as looking after him—I was very near the middle of the room when Rebbeck spoke to me about a yard or a yard and half from him—there were several persons be<lb/>tween me and him—he was a little way in the tap-room from the half-door, I should think about a foot or a foot and a half from the swing-door leading to the bar—the swing-door was open at that time—I do not remember seeing Rebbeck afterwards—I did not see him move—he moved in the tap-room, but I do not remember seeing him after we got into the bagatelle-room—he did move in the tap-room, he was putting his hand to his side in pain—I do not know what became of him then, he altered his position in the room; the pain caused him to do that I believe—the last place I saw him at before I went into the bagatelle-room was standing near the bagatelle-room door, behind me—he had moved then, he had got to the tap-room door—he moved from where I first saw him and got near the bagatelle-room, that was the last time I saw him—the last place I saw him at was close to the tap-room door, leading to the bagatelle-room—before that I saw him close to the swing-door, holding his hand to his side—it might not be much more than a minute between my seeing him there and seeing him at the tap-room door—I saw him move from the one place to the other—I do not recollect that he spoke to me again when he got nearer me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Listen to what you said before the Magistrate, and see if you can ex<lb/>plain it—"In going from the tap-room I saw Alfred Rebbeck following the prisoner into the bagatelle-room; the prisoner was going into the room by himself" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is correct—I suppose two or three minutes elapsed after I entered the tap-room with Elliott, before I got into the bagatelle-room; not more than two or three minutes, at the very outside, elapsed between Rebbeck telling me he had been stabbed and my taking the prisoner into custody—we got into the bagatelle-room as soon as we possibly could.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If the weapon was held in the right hand, and a back-handed blow was struck, would not there have been precisely the same effect as a forward blow with the left hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it would be hardly done so, considering the position of the wound—it extended towards the middle of the body—the wound was upwards and inwards, towards the middle line of the body—it was inside the body that the wound was upwards, it inclined towards the left, from the point to the end—it was a sort of wound that would be inflicted by a back-handed blow, used dagger-ways if done sideways—I judge that the wound was produced by a knife with a single edge, and this knife appears to have a single edge, except at the point—the wound was three-quarters of an inch long one way and half an inch from the angle; the vertical wound was smaller than the oblique one—I could not form any opinion as to the shape of it. but it appeared that the knife had passed in obliquely and had ed or straight—I could not form any opinion, except from the description of meeting of face to face, and that I infer from Rebbeck's</p>

                  </hi>. I am potman at the Bordessa—the morning after Boxing-day I found a knife in the urinal in the court-yard, between 9 and 10 o'clock—this is the knife (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it was shut—it was all covered with water from the urine.</p>

I am an artist and modeller—I know the witness Harriet Verge, by sight—I saw her examined here—she pointed out to me a place where it was said a knife was found—I took the measurement from that spot to the window of the bagatelle-room at the back of the Golden Anchor, which faces the ruins—I know the premises; I made a model of them—the distance was 130 feet, that was to the yard; there is a yard before you get to the window, and I should think it was twenty feet from the yard to the window; in all, the distance would be 150 feet; we could not measure close, on account of the timber and high planks in the yard.</p>

He pretended to buy four tubs, charging thirty-five shillings for them, when their real market value was five shillings, and promised me ten shillings. He also bought some iron weights and a measure, and defrauded Mr. Davis more or less, and promised to pay me for shutting my mouth. I wrote three or four thousand addresses for him at 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per thousand, but he never paid me a halfpenny. I quarrelled with him about money, and he told me if I came to a certain trial where he was charged with defrauding the London Parcels Delivery Company, he would pay all outstanding debts; but as soon as he got my services he broke faith with me, and did not pay me a halfpenny. He gave me the cheque to get changed, and I said, "I have got half what I ought to have, and I will keep it." He took me to Guildhall before Alderman Phillips, who told him he ought to pay me.

Zarn's—Weil and Mr. Zarn were in the counting-house—I told Weil that I was a detective, and I asked him where he got those prints from that he sold to Mr. Le Visconte, in Commercial-street, and also to Mr. Alba—he said he had bought and paid for them—I asked him where, but he would not tell me—I then asked him if he had bought any prints of either of Mr. Zarn's servants—he said, "No"—Drasda was then sent for—I told him I was a police-officer—I asked him if he had ever taken any prints home from his master's premises—he said, "Yes; I will tell the truth; I am very sorry; I have taken 500 hunting prints, and sold them to Well"—he said he sold them for 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a hundred—Weil said it was true:</p>

               <p>he had bought the prints and paid for them—I went to 28, Gloucester-street, Bloomsbury, Weil's lodgings, and there I found these 110 prints (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in a box, locked.</p>

I am a partner in the firm of Walker and Howell, of 40, Broad-street Buildings—I am accountant to the Liquidators of the Unity Bank—I produce the charter of that bank, dated 9th January, 1856—I have here the minutes of the appointment of the two defendants respectively—Mr. Terry was appointed manager on 18th August, 1857—there is no resolution on the minutes appointing him; there is only a reference to it, on 18th August—Mr. Burch had formerly been a clerk in the bank, and so had Mr. Terry; I think Mr. Terry was the accountant—Mr. Burch was appointed secretary on 23d January, 1861—he had acted in the capacity of secretary previous to that appointment—I produce the original transcript of the balance-sheet of 30th June, 1862, the balance-sheet, and the detailed balance-sheet; it is in Mr. Burch's writing—it shows a nett balance of profit on the half year of 3, 215<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have carefully gone through the books for the six months previously, and there had been no profit made—there had been a loss then from the commencement of the bank of 130,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is an item in the balance-sheet (No. 3) of 207,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of assets made up of bills discounted, loans to customers, &amp;c.—the bank had a customer of the name of Ollivier—he owed 419<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 30th of June, 1862—there were four dishonoured bills of Ollivier's for that amount—they were dishonoured in 1861—in the past-due bill-book these four bills are entered as past-due bills, and that is entered by Terry—op<lb/>posite there is the word "forgery, "but there is nothing to show when that word was written—on the back of one of the dishonoured bills there is a receipt for a dividend of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—that sum of 419<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was carried to the item of 207,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in the committee minute-book of the 19th of February, 1861, there is an entry in Burch's handwriting to the effect that Ollivier should be prosecuted for forgery—Mr. Alderman Mechi and several other of the directors were present when that resolution was passed—in the Board minute-book of the following March, there is an entry also in Burch's handwriting to the effect that the board had resolved to offer a reward of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the apprehension of Ollivier—there are twenty-four dishonoured bills of T. Harrison and Co. in 1860 and 1861, amounting to 3, 760<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and these are entered in the past-due bill account from the general ledger as past-due bills—five of these bills amounting to up wards of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. are accepted by a person named Brock—there was a bankruptcy dividend upon them in November, 1861, of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pound—that was the last dividend—the total dividend was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there are live other bills dishonoured by a Mr. Wright 1860, for upwards of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were four dividends paid</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On what theory is that deducted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The general ledger only gives the balance of current accounts after the overdrawn accounts have been deducted, or father all the sums which are drawn out are deducted from the account, and when customers draw money out of the Bank and have no funds they reduce their amount, so that the reduced amount only appears—all the overdrawn accounts are due to them also; but in consequence of the books not being balanced, or from some oversight, the amount of the balance has been copied instead of the debt, being an increase of 13, 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the overdrawn account is placed on the other side as an asset.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Hall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he owed the bank on 30th June, 1862, 3, 771<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on forty<lb/>three bills which I produce dishonoured, about the middle of 1861—the bank has since received 233<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a further sum of 208<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making altogether 562<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which has to be deducted from the 3, 771<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. now—that is included in item No. 3—the receipt for the dividend appears in the general ledger and in the past-due book; Hall did not pay any dividend before 30th June, but we received some small dividend from the acceptors which was afterwards carried into item No. 3.—the bank had also customers named Barclay and Co., they were indebted to the bank 1, 902<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on fourteen Bills Of Exchange which were dishonoured in 1860, that is not carried to No, 3, but a sum of 807<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was carried in—there was 1, 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due on bills after deducting dividends—the last dividend was received in November, 1861, 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Harper, and then a balance of 807<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was owing—Tiernan and Co. were also customers of the bank—they owed a balance of account in June, 1862—the amount of bills was 1, 540<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but in September, 1861 that current account was transferred to the credit of the past-due loan account on 2d December, 1861, leaving a balance of 929<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that was carried to the item of 207,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the bank had also a customer named Bunyard—he owed 5, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on dis<lb/>honoured bills and overdrawn account, that item is also included in the 207,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but some of those bills, which were running in June, 1862, have been met since—a deed of assignment was made by Bun-yard in November, 1861, for 5, 239<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in December, 1861, a sum of 966<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was advanced to Burn-yard by the bank, to replace two loans and a bill which had been dis<lb/>honoured—there is no mention in the minute-book of that loan of 966<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., nor is there any entry made of the deed of assignment, it has never been charged to the account, so it is an additional loss to the bank—Fowles and Co. were also customers of the bank, they were indebted in the sum of 437<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in dishonoured bills in June, 1862—those bills were dishonoured in 1859 and 1860—the names of Douglas and Co. appear as acceptors to two of them, who represented that they were forgeries—nothing was ever received On that account—Mr. Sterne was a customer of the bank—he owed in June, 1862, the sum of 2, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that included 1, 095<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on a dishonoured check—the bills due on this account, amounting to 1, 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., have since been all paid—the bills represented 1, 964<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but the acceptors met them—Knight was also a customer of the bank—he owed 2, 111<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in June, 1862—his draughts and bills were dishonoured principally in 1861, and they were exhibited in the Bankruptcy Court in February, 1862—Knight never paid any dividend, but</p>

               <p>the acceptors paid 1572. in dividends, the last of which 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid by Mr. Taylor, in November, 1864—those bills were entered in the general ledger under the head of past-due bills—Mr. Ingledew was also a customer of the bank—in June, 1859, he owed 3, 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., borrowed on the security of a ship, and on the 30th of June, 1862 he owed a balance of 183<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was carried to No. 3.—only 1, 816<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was received on the sale of the ship, leaving a balance of 183<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., no part of which has ever been received—the bank had customers named J. and A. King; they owed 949<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 30th June, 1862, the bank holding some deeds of property at Dullingham, but there is a dispute now about the title, that also has been carried to the item of 207,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—John Harris was a customer of the bank on 30th June; he owed 1, 370<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that was included in the 207,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was the balance of a larger sum, it was left to cover an overdrawn account created by overdrawing other small bills which were dishonoured and charged to the current account, and subsequently a loan was granted for the exact sum, the past-due bills being previously charged to the account—I find no entry of that transaction having been before the Directors—there was no new advance, merely a credit given to cover it—Mr. Harris was paying off his debt by instalments at the time the balance-sheet was published; 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. every fortnight or ten days—he did not fail till the middle of 1864—we received nearly 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. afterwards, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was received between January and May to reduce the 1, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the bank had also customers named Patteson and Miles, they owed 523<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which is carried into the item of 207,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—the 523<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the balance due upon dishonoured bills, which had been exhibited in the Court of Bankruptcy—since June, 1862, 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in reduction of the 523<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Jabez Wood was also a customer; he owed 1, 223<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in June, 1862, and that is all included in the 207,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—at that time Wood's running bills amounted to 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was a deed of assignment made by Wood to his creditors on the 4th of June, 1862—I produce the manuscript of the balance-sheet of June 30th, 1862, it is in Burch's handwriting—there is a more detailed sheet also in his handwriting—the former is an exact copy of the published balance-sheet; the latter is a copy of the totals, and was not published—accompanying the balance-sheet there is a report from the directors, dated 16th September, 1862 (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—the report is signed by the chairman and was adopted by the meeting—the other balance-sheets of the bank, from its commencement down to 1862 are now in Court—up to 1860, the past-due bills appeared as a separate item—on 30th June, 1859, the loss on bills discounted is 38,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—then there is a profit and loss, old account 1, 601<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., added making 39, 679<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the next balance-sheet is 30th June, 1860; the loss on bills discounted 39, 679<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is brougbt forward on the credit side, and there is a sum transferred from the profit and loss which appears to have been made in the trading in the previous half-year of 1, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as recommended by the report, leaving a balance of 38, 179<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in the next balance-sheet of 31st December, 1860, on the debtor side, the capital is brought forward 179, 195<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and there is an entry underneath, "Less amount written off on account of loss per bills, discounted as by last report 38, 119<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the balance-sheet;" sometimes it appears as" past-due bills, "and sometimes as" losses on bills discounted"—I find in December, 1857, "Past-due bills, 40, 559<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."on the credit side of the balance-sheet—there is a little * against the item and a note at the bottom, "of this amount the directors feel confident that 11,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. will be received"—the past-due bills on 30th June, 1858, is 37, 770<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that is without the note—on 31st December, 1858, the past due bills are 36, 863<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and it appears that the bank made a loss of 2, 615<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

               <p>it is brought forward on the credit side—it showed the true position of the bank, that it had made a loss—a dividend of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per share is recommended—I don't see that the report recommends the 38,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be written off, but it was written off and the reduced amount of capital is subsequently placed—I have looked at all the balance-sheets, and no such item appears in any of them down to 1862—on 25th January, 1861 there is a resolution stating that the loss as shown in previous balance-sheets was now written off the capital account—on the same day I see there is a resolution appointing Mr. Burch secretary—I found this paper among the papers of the bank; it appears to be a rough balance-sheet of December, 1860—it is in Mr. Burch's writing—it contains "losses on bills in suspense, chief office—old, 10, 585<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., ditto new, 3, 504<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—the words "old" and "new" are erased—both those items are carried into item No. 3 in the balance-sheet of June, 1862—there were dividends received on them in the meantime, but there is a difficulty in tracing them because the credits were not passed in the proper way—in round numbers, about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of dividend has been received altogether—Mr. Sykes was the manager of the west-end branch of the bank; Mr. Humphreys owed that branch a certain amount—the past-due bills at that branch amounted to 7, 790<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the overdrawn accounts came to 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—both these sums are included in the item of 207,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the balance-sheet of June, 1862, as issued by the head-office—there was a check for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid to Morgan in error, which is also included in the 207,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a lost 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note is included in the same item—in April, 1861, a remittance of 73<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was lost in its transmission from the head-office to the west-end branch, and that is also included in the 207,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the cash actually in band at the bank on the 30th of June, 1862, was 29, 680<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and uncleared checks 6, 245<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there was a deficiency of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>". in the cash on the 30th of June which turned out to be a bill received of Perls, of which an entry is made, "less error, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." to make the day-book balance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you give as the cash actually in hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> 29,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but these were uncleared cheques which had not been presented at the bankers, payable next day—the difference between the cash in hand and the bills, con<lb/>sisted of a dishonoured bill of Perls for 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a cheque which had been carried through from day to day on Coutts'—some of these books had to be marked, "Query forgery"—the small amounts were not cash in reality, the difference consisted of bills which were worthless, some as high as 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a cheque for 1, 095<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they are in the cash-article book—those were improper documents to take as cash, they were almost entirely worthless.</p>

               <p>trust-deed for the benefit of his creditors which was signed by Terry, for 5, 209<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am aware that Mr. Sterne has since made an arrangement with his creditors to pay twenty shillings in the pound; but the bank would not have any advantage from this arrangement, because they had already given him a full release—there has been a final loss of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have acted as accountant for Mr. Sterne—I believe the arrangement is a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> one, and will be carried out—when Mr. Terry was under examination before the liquidators, he explained that the reason why Mr. Sterne wished to have his account transferred to that of Mr. Terry was that he was in some dispute with his partner, and he was afraid the money would be attached if the account were kept in his own name-various payments have been made, since this balance-sheet was published, that would reduce the balance by 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. The item, No. 1, in the balance-sheets always appeared in the same way, so for as I can ascertain, but improperly so—the bank always debited themselves with a reserve-fund for losses—on the 14th of May there was a board-meeting, at which the list of overdrawn accounts was taken into consideration, and it was resolved that they should be scrutinized, and that such accounts as were considered irrecoverable should be written off, and proceedings taken to reduce the amount of the remainder—that was done, as appears by the minute of a subsequent board-meeting—in the balance-sheet of 30th April, 1857, here is, "Bills discounted, loans to customers, and other securities, 185, 253<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>"—I can only guess as to whether the post-due bills are included in that, there is no such item, but I believe 11,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for post-due bills is included in that—at that time Mr. Chambers was manager, and both the defendants were clerks under him—I believe that Mr. Chambers introduced Mr. Terry to the bank—(<hi rend="italic">Looking at the general ledger</hi>)—on 2d May, 1857, there were 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of past-due bills at the chief-office, and 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the branches—the bank paid 23, 648<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for preliminary expenses, the first year they commenced business—besides this, they made bad debts to the amount of 11,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and in the first two years their losses were over 38,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—at the time that Mr. Chambers resigned there was a large amount of bad bills in existence, but they had not then arrived at maturity—this 38,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was written off as bad debts on December 31st, 1860—33,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. appeared to have been lost while Mr. Chambers was manager—Alderman Mechi was the governor of the bank—in the first year the bank begin business, he borrowed 23, 863<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—he always paid the Bank of England rate of interest—a gentleman named Baylis was paid 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for promotion-money—that was included in the preliminary expenses—he was also to have had 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year as manager for life, but the matter was compromised for 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Alderman Mechi originally had a salary of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year as governor; but when the bank got into difficulties, he gave up the remuneration—MR. Eyre was an original director, Mr. Bower was not—at the first meeting I find the names of Tayloe, Stone, Eyre, Baylis, and Mechi—the names are incorporated in the charter—Mr. Hay ward was one—besides the 32, 528<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the loan to Mr. Mechi of 23,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Mr. Galand borrowed money—the bank never made a profit in any half-year, but most of the balance-sheets show a profit—by the first year's balance-sheet a profit was shown, of 2, 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but that included the past-due bills—nearly the whole of the subsequent half-year's balance-sheets showed profits, and those balance-sheets were published by the chairman and directors to the public—the directors received in fees altogether 2, 987<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and other sums intrusted to them by way of gratuities by the shareholders—there was one vote of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in addition to that—they were votes expressing confidence they drew</p>

               <p>the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out after the bank was closed—at that time, there was a general deficiency in the capital of the bank of 135,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but there was a period of about four years when they did not take anything, believing the bank to be in an unsound state—the interest upon the loan of 23,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. Alderman Mechi was debited to his account regularly; but there is an entry in the books showing that in September, 1863, eighteen months' interest was due upon this loan—Alderman Mechi's firm of Mechi and Bazin kept an account at the bank, but the Alderman himself had no private account—that account was overdrawn in January, 1862, the half-year to which this balance-sheet relates, to the amount of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that account was continually overdrawn—in March, 1856, a resolution was agreed to by the directors that no director should be allowed to overdraw his account—Mr. Bazin, Alderman Mechi's partner, had a private account at the Western branch, and during the year 1861 that account was sometimes overdrawn, and sometimes it was in credit—Mr. Bazin had an account at the West-end branch, which was overdrawn on two occasions—the firm of Mechi and Bazin also had a trade account with the Western branch, which was also occasionally overdrawn—Mr. Bazin also had loans from time to time from the bank to the amount of 3, 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on his own private account—Alderman Mechi also occasionally borrowed other sums besides the 23,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the bank—I should say about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at any one time—there were fifteen or twenty such borrowings of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and sometimes 720<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—sometimes the money went into his own account, and sometimes into MR. Bazin's—between September, 1859, and 5th August, 1862, the total amount borrowed by Mechi and Bazin was 7, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. over and above the 23,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he owed that enormous sum when he took the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. fees—Mr. Deputy Bower, another of the directors, also kept an account—he became a director in 1857—he borrowed money from the bank to the amount altogether of 44, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. between that period and 6th May, 1862—he did not have it all at one time, and he generally kept a large sum lying idle at the bank—Mr. Hay ward, another director, borrowed 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in February, 1860—Mr. Eyre was one of the directors from the beginning, and a bill of his for 1, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. seemed to have not been paid, and to have been passed through the accounts—I could not say whether it was a dishonoured bill—it was in November, 1859, included among the past-due bills, but it was ultimately paid—Mr. Eyre also had loans from the bank between June 19th, 1857, and July 1862, to the amount of 16,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but never more than 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at one time—Major Mulkern was one of the directors—he had loans to the amount of 4, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—his son also borrowed from the bank about 11,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—at the time of the balance-sheet of June 1862, the directors owed the bank about 26,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but 23, 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of this amount was owing by Alderman Mechi, and the firm of Mechi &amp; Bazin owed 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. besides—200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was owing by MR.

Mechi, Howard, Bower, and Mulkern were, present, and a letter was read from Mr. Turner, calling attention to the account of Levi, Heath, &amp; Co.—by the committee-book of 27th April, 1858, the solicitor was to furnish a quarterly report of all matters of business in his hands—Mr. Tayloe was the solicitor to the bank—he was not examined before the Lord Mayor—by the board minute-book of 21st May, 1858, I find, "Present, Messrs. Mechi, Bower, Eyre, Hayward, and Mulkern. Attention having been directed to the list of overdrawn accounts at the chief office, it was resolved that the list be sanctionized, and such as are irrecoverable be written off, and that appli<lb/>cation be made for payment of such as are above a month's standing and are recoverable"—on the 14th of July, 1858, there is a minute, "The report and balance-sheet to be presented to the shareholders at the second annual meeting, on the 16th mat, was discussed and decided on"—at this board meeting Alderman Mechi, Mr. Bower, Mr. Eyre, Mr. Mulkern, and Mr. Hayward were present—on the 7th January, 1859, the directors expressed a wish to have "a report from Mr. Tayloe of the matters in his hands concern<lb/>ing the old past due bills"—on 18th January, 1859, "The report and balance<lb/>sheet to be presented to the shareholders was discussed and decided on"—at the board meeting of 25th January, 1859, "The report was presented by MR.

Behrens, a customer of the West-end branch, had suspended payment"—it is right to mention that Mr. Behrens, who was a very large debtor, was placed in the list as good—on 18th October, 1861, here is an entry in the minute-book, "Loans and discounts were examined"—in the board-book of 28th February, 1862, here is, "The solicitor having reported that he had written to Mr. Frazi, resolved that immediate steps be taken for Mr. Frazi's apprehension"—in the same book, 10th April, 1862, here is, "Huggett, the detective's claim in Ollivier's matter was ordered for payment, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."; and on 28th April, 1862, "Resolved that the solicitor prepare a proper agreement, &amp;c. for the transfer of the business to the London and Westminster Bank, limited"—on 27th June hero is, "Present, Messrs.

(<hi rend="italic">No</hi>. 3) contained the past-due bills, &amp;c.—the defendants were arrested upon a warrant applied for by me on 2d September, 1864; I acted simply upon the instructions I received from the solicitors—the bank has paid all its creditors and depositors every farthing; I should say, altogether, about 250,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—about 200,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been paid to the depositors and creditors—13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been returned on each share, and I should say about another 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. will be returned, or a little less—that will make about 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a share, in round numbers—the investments in the chief offices and branches are developed in this balance-sheet at 24,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; they realized about 8, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., including 1500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received from the Railway Company for the Cannon-street premises—that shows a loss of about 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have heard Alderman Mechi state that he expected Perl's estate would realise 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pound.</p>

Mr. Giffard. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As to this sum of 38,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was written off, there is an entry of that in the books, as I understand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is—after it had been written off, it could not very well appear in any other way unless it appeared every time—the bank represented themselves as better off by 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., because they had to account on the opposite side for a less sum through reducing their capital; they had lost 38,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—if they had placed the capital at the correct amount, they would have had to account on the opposite side for the 38,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which had been lost; it would still have re-mained, but it would have remained as a loss, and would have shown the position of the bank—I only know the way in which Burch kept the books by different inquiries that I have made, not from himself; I have never asked him a question—I have seen all the rough day-books, and noticed the different handwritings—the defendants both went to the London and Middlesex Bank as soon as the Unity shut up—Terry did not remain there down to the time of this charge—the London and Middlesex Bank is being wound up now; I am winding it up—Burch remained there till the end of August, 1864; he was assisting the directors in winding it up—I first saw Mr. Eyre's memorandum at the Mansion-house, while he was being examined as a wit-ness in this prosecution—there are a great number of these weekly summaries or reports, all exactly in the same form—my attention has been called to this one of 24th June, 1862—the past-due bills there are put down at 12, 682<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that is put down to the left side; the balances at the right are the credit balances—there is a blank left opposite the investments—past-due bills would be an investment—interest on deposit-receipts would also be an investment—"bills discounted "appears in the debtor column; should understand that—if you did not see the heading" balance debtor and creditor, "very likely you might imagine there were no past-due bills; the first page represents the past-due bills as a blank, because during the week there happened to be no past-due bills, and this was a weekly statement—the other is the actual balance—I have not looked to as certain if the account is kept in the same way throughout in these weekly accounts—it is in blank here (<hi rend="italic">looking at another</hi>)—if there had been any additional past-due bills, they would have appeared there—in order to know what the debtor-balance referred to I should refer to the general ledger—there is a detailed statement</p>

"bills discounted, loans to customers, "&amp;c—I have all the detailed entries before me—the general ledger gives the past-due bills—from the date of the balance-sheet of 1857, down to the writing off of the item of 38,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that item always appeared either in the form of past-due bills or losses; and from the year 1860 no such item has appeared—there was a regular set of banker's books kept—if I was endeavouring to find out what bills were good and what were bad by the books, I should first ascertain when the bills were dishonoured, and trace them all out; the discount-ledger would show the original entries; and having found out when they were dishonoured, I should examine the past-due bills account, and see whether any final dividend had been received, and should then consider the balance that ought, to be written off as irrecoverable—if you wanted to ascertain the amount of cash in hand, you would refer to the general ledger and see what the balance was, according to the cash account, and then the cash in the cashiers' tills ought to agree with that amount, and if it did not, the cash-article</p>

               <p>book would make up the difference, if the entries were correct—the general ledger shows the position of the bank—not only the totals, but the past-due bills account was kept in detail in the Unity Bank; I have never seen it kept in detail in any other bank—in the past-due bills book and the general ledger all the particulars are given.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then that would give greater facilities for seeing what bills were past-due? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would—any one looking at the ledger would see what the state of things was—a detailed account is given in the general ledger of all these bills—in the balance-sheet they have copied the totals, and added them to the bills discounted—that is a mode of keeping them alive in the books without writing them off—they could not very well be written off without the sanction of the directors.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The general ledger, I suppose, consists of a good many volumes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are two volumes; one goes up to 1859, and the other, to the close of the bank—I believe the general ledger is written up every week, and sometimes twice a-week; it is in Mr. Burch's writing, posted up from the day-book—the amount of Bunyard's account, 41,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., includes renewals in many instances, over and over again—the discount ought to be larger on renewals—I think with respect to the two loans of 965<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 755<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., no in-tercet was charged—the note of discount in Bunyard's case was always the same—the rate of discount varied very much according to the class of customers—I see here is an instance; S. Bridgland is charged 3 percent, and the very next customer is charged 10, and the next 5, I should say the rate of discount to the directors was rather more favourable than to the other customers, but their bills were looked upon as better than the others; they were charged the bank rate, and others were charged higher—Harrison and Co. was charged an average rate of 7 1/2—the discount varies with the length a bill has to run; it ought to do so, at all events—I don't say that rule is always followed—a bad bill ought not to be discounted at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At all events it refers to this one? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the auditors would find the over-due bills included in the "bills discounted loans to cus<lb/>tomers, &amp;c, 207,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that item, unless an explanation was given to them as to how the figures were arrived at, would not have agreed with the books—they could not have compared them—it would not have agreed with the books unless it had included the over-due bills; so with the cash in hand, it must have included the documents I have referred to, to make up the 38,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>

John Joseph Mechi, Esq., Alderman. I was governor and chairman of the Unity Bank from 1856—I remember the two defendants entering the bank at its commencement—Mr. Terry entered the bank as chief accountant, and Mr. Burch was cashier—at that time Mr. George Chambers was the manager—I did not recommend the defendants for employment in the bank; neither of them—they were unknown to me previous to that time—they were selected as having the best testimonials out of about 150 from different banks—I remember Mr. Chambers retiring from the management in August, 57—I had a conversation at that time with Mr. Terry about his becoming the manager—I recommended him for the appointment, believing him to be then the best man for that position—the bank had at that time sustained a variety of losses in '57—I took steps to communicate to the shareholders the losses that the bank had sustained—at that time the bank was fully able to pay its depositors—it could not repay its capital to the proprietors, because a sum of money had been lost by Mr. Chamber's management equal to be<lb/>tween 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was, in fact, the cause of his dismissal or retirement—he was unsuccessful in discounting—upon Mr. Terry being appointed certain rules were made by the directors, and entered in the minute-book for the guidance of the manager—(<hi rend="italic">The minute of 19th January 1858, was here read, containing a recommendation from Mr. Eyre at to the duties of the manager, which recommendation was decided to be acted upon</hi>)—I believe that entry was written by Mr. Burch himself for the purpose of showing to Mr. Terry—from that time Mr. Burch fulfilled the duties of secretary, though the formal appointment was not made for some time after<lb/>wards—the secretary was always present at the board meetings—I have given directions to both the defendants with reference to the preparation of the balance-sheets—I requested them to make a true and faithful and uncoloured report of the state of affairs of the bank—it was the duty of the manager and the secretary to prepare the balance-sheets from the books, which the directors never interfered with—when they were made out they were pre<lb/>sented to the board, and the directors did not make any alteration in them or interfere with them in any manner, but merely ordered them to be printed—the directors examined them before they ordered them to be printed, by reading them, and seeing the details therein expressed—we took no steps to verify the items, but relied entirely on the manager and the secretary and the auditors—the whole of the accounts were submitted to the auditors prior to the balance-sheets coming to the directors—as a fact, we never tested the balance-sheets in any way by the books; we relied upon</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">continued</hi>). I recollect the balance-sheet of June, 1862, being placed before me, and that it showed a profit—I did not then know the bank was in difficulties—I believed the profit to have been truly realized, that the balance-sheet showed a true statement of the affairs of the bank, and that the three items in question, namely, 207, 668<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in respect of loans to customers, bills discounted, &amp;c.; 159, 392<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the amount due on current and other accounts; and 38, 715<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as cash in hand, were truly stated—I knew that overdue bills were comprised in the item 207, 668<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I also assumed they were placed at their proper value as the instruc<lb/>tions were given—there are overdue bills in every bank, but I certainly did not know that overdue bills that were forged were included in that item—The instructions given by the directors were that all the past-due bills were to be placed at their true value, making such allowance as was believed to be correct, as to the dividends that might be returnable on; them—I held 537 shares in the Unity Bank—the total number of the shares was 3,000, and I held more than a sixth of the whole capital of the bank—I recollect the failure of the Royal British Bank, and purchasing about that time a large number of the shares of the Unity Bank—it was then that I borrowed a considerable portion of the 23,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the bank to buy the shares; giving the bank at the same time ample security, independently of the shares themselves—that was done at the carnest request of the then manager, Mr. Chambers—there was a great panic at that time, and our bank was only four months old—I made all the circumstances of the loan known to the shareholders at the time—the secretary always attended the board and entered the minutes—loans and renewals of loans were brought under the attention of the directors, as were also discharges by the bank of debts due to the bank—the release to Bunyard of 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was totally unknown to us—I had no knowledge that Terry had given a release for that debt—it was never brought to the attention of the board while I was present—no entry of the 996<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. transaction with Bunyard was entered on the minutes or brought to my attention—I had told Terry I did not like the appearance of Bunyard, and that he must be very careful with respect to him—he said proper inquiries had been made, and that the securities were good. I think Perl's case was brought before us, and that Terry was authorized to take a composition, Perl having failed—it was hoped Perl would pay 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pound, but those hopes were never realized—he paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—the debt was 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I did not know that Terry had signed the deed of composition for 2, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. only—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HOWELL</hi> signed for those bills he expected to be dishonoured, the others he expected to be taken up by the acceptors)—There was no concealment in Perl's case of which I am aware—I frequently spoke to Terry as to Lowenthal's account—it was constantly a subject of discussion and anxiety at the board—Mr. Burch was always present on these occasions—we often referred to the mauager</p>

               <p>as to whether he was satisfied with the securities and the <hi rend="italic">bond fides</hi> of the transactions—his replies were satisfactory—I did not know Ironsides or that he was a customer of the bank—I did not know that some of Lowenthal's bills were substitutions for the acceptances of Ironsides, or given up for those acceptances—I remember F. W. Hall being a debtor to the bank—his debt was discussed at the bank in the presence of Burch, and sometimes of Terry—Terry was called in and warned to be careful with respect to Hall—he said he had confidence in him and was satisfied, or words to that effect—we knew nothing of him ourselves—the manager was not generally present at the meetings; we sent for him when we wanted him—we sat twice a week, and in the interim we called frequently at the bank—he had access to the minutes when he chose—my instructions as to discounting bills were to prefer security before profit—there was a book called the "Cash Article Book"—it was generally read over week by week at the board meetings, but I am not quite sure it was read latterly—the secretary read it—I have no recollection of an item in the book of 1, 095<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in respect to a cheque of Sterne, drawn on Martin, being read over—I could not say how many entries were read—they ought to have been all read, if at all—the book was left on the table, four or five directors sitting round—we never looked at the book—I am quite sure Sterne's name was not called out, or it would have attracted our attention—directions were given after the 30th of June, 1862, by me or Mr. Eyre, to prepare a book containing a list of debts due to the bank—the one produced is it—it is partly in Burch's and partly in Terry's handwriting—the book begins in January, 1863, and pur<lb/>ports to show the debts, good, bad, and. indifferent, due to the bank—it was certainly not with my knowledge, or that of the directors, that the debts of Sterne, Bunyard, Lowenthal, Harris, or Jabez Wood, were omitted from that book—the object of the book was to show what was owing to the bank and what was paid—I recollect that book being produced to the directors, it was the subject of discussion, sometimes with the manager, and sometimes with the secretary—in February, 1864, I recollect going to a meeting of shareholders, and having a conversation with Burch before, going—that was on the 9th of February—I asked him what had become of our assets, our money in the Unity, adding that I could not understand why we owed the London and Middlesex money, and that there ought to be money of our own, or words to that effect—he produced a small book in which were several names of persons represented as owing us money, including Lowenthal and others—I had believed that those debts had been paid long before—I expressed my surprise, and asked why he had not mentioned that before—he replied that he did not like to do so—shortly afterwards, on the same day, I communicated the facts to the directors—Terry was spoken to on the subject during the day—he was called to account about it, but I could not state what took place so well as the other directors—I lost quite 18,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the bank—that was by the depreciation of the shares; in fact every year I was losing about 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by these conceal ments.</p>

               <p>and originally 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I knew that Terry had been sixteen years in the bank of Jones Loyd and Co., and we had perfect confidence in him—I knew the item 207, 668<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. contained past-due bills and cheques in suspense, but I did not know the exact amount of those bills and cheques—I have no doubt the amount was stated to us—it was 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, but I cannot recollect—I did not know that it amounted to nearer 50,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. than 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but the amount, whether 50,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was known to me and the other directors—I am one of the liquidators by virtue of my office as a director under the charter—we, as directors, do not oppose the prosecu<lb/>tion, nor do we sanction it; we do neither—there are three other directors besides myself, namely, Mr. Deputy Bower, Mr. Eyre, and Mr. Hayward, of the Minories, all four well-known gentlemen in the City of London—we have taken no part in the prosecution; we did not oppose it—the prosecution has been instituted by the direction of the Master of the Rolls—we, as directors, knew of the gross amount of past-due bills and cheques in suspense.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This, you know, is a celebrated item, and will always be so in the banking world—I mean "bills discounted, loans to customers, &amp;c. 207, 668<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—why did not the directors divide that item into three parts, so as to show what was cash, what were past-due bills, and what were cheques in suspense? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We placed the item in that way as all other banks do, or did up to that time, latterly there has been an alteration in some—there always must be past-due bills in a bank, and a great many whose realization must always be uncertain, depending as they must do on a great many circumstances and contingencies which I think I need not illustrate—some bankrupts' estates are occasionally twenty years in being wound up—I was not aware that the forged bills were carried into the balance-sheet as good"—we knew that Ollivier's and Frasi's bills were forged—they ought to have been written off—I do not know that they were—the general instructions of the directors were to write off what was bad—I mean to say, that a manager of his own accord would be at liberty to write off debts that he thought were bad, with<lb/>out the sanction of the directors; I would call it deducting from the profits of the half-year—the instructions were to make a true and faithful account of the affairs of the bank; I frequently; have those instructions—I did not suspect that the manager was doing otherwise—every half-year I charged the defendants to make out a true and faithful balance-sheet—the expression "preferring security to profit" which I have used may be found in <hi rend="italic">Gilbert's Book on Banking</hi>—that, at all events, was my rule—I did it to give confi<lb/>dence to our manager; he looked to me very much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose the name of an acceptor was forged, but the drawer and endorser were good, you would not write it off would you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If there was a prospect of getting the money from it, certainly not—if a bank was unfortunate enough to have 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of forged bills, the manager could write that off; he must write it off to make up the balance-sheet—I think it would be very necessary to give some account to the shareholders if there was so large an amount as that—if there was a prospect of getting the money, you would put it at its estimated value.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any written authority anywhere for writing off any amount except for the 38,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I think not.</p>

               <p>past-due bills—it must appear in some account of the bank-books—the British Bank failed In September, 1856, when we were four months' old—I originally took twenty shares, the same as the other directors, to buy which I borrowed 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., from the Unity Life-office, and afterwards repaid it—the directors never had any shares allotted to them for which they did not pay—there was a panic, and a run upon the bank in the autumn of 1856, the shareholders were destroying their own property—the average cost of my shares was 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a share, and I shall, I hope, get back 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a share—I have had to pay interest all the time, without receiving any divi<lb/>dend—I subsequently bought shares at a lower rate with the view to recoup myself, but I still lost 18,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., notwithstanding—one duty a manager is to see the customers; a great deal of paper is passed on a new bank, much of which is very doubtful—the difficulty of a new bank is that the manager at first does not know his customers, and he makes advances, often at con<lb/>siderable loss in the end—I knew nothing of the trust-deed in Bunyard's case—I knew securities were deposited with respect to Bunyard's debt in the shape of hope and guano—I do not recollect 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., of Micklam's bonds being deposited—I believe Terry was serious in his belief that 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pound would be obtained in Perl's case—Sterne's name was never called over as appearing in the cash article book—I knew him very well—my partner, Mr. Bazin, was well acquainted with him, under the same circumstances as I myself was; namely, by his coming to the bank—I have heard the name of Martin called, but not of Sterne—the cheque in question of Sterne was upon Martin—I am not aware that I ever looked into the cash article book—our meetings lasted two or three hours; I can't tell whether the book was produced the first part of the day—after being read I have no doubt it was placed on the table of the board—having had the book read to us we did not look into it, we having confidence in the manager and secretary—the book was left once a week on the table of the board—I am not aware that I heard Sterne's cheque read over more than once—the entry would not attract my attention in the name of Martin, we having no customer of that name—the name of Mr. Eyre, a director, for l, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was in the cash article book, and read out—there was plenty of security in shares for that sum, very likely no other security—there was no concealment of any of the directors' transactions—once in a way Sterne may have taken lunch with us at the board; luncheon was always on the table—I will swear I never saw him alone—I asked him to take shares in the London and Mid<lb/>dlesex Bank, and we were much obliged for the trouble he took in getting his friends to take shares—I think it very likely I asked him to take shares, but I cannot say positively—Mr. Terry often asked him, in my presence, and I was glad that he did, for we were anxious to establish the bank—I don't recollect that I pressed Sterne to take shares—I have no doubt I thanked him for taking shares—Mr. Sterne and Mr. Terry were very intimate—I was a director of the London and Middlesex, and I took 537 shares in it, it being a condition of the transfer that I should take as many shares in it as I had in the Unity—I sold most of them at a premium of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I think the London and Middlesex Bank was given up after twelve months, and nearly the whole capital, amounting to 70,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was lost. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> weekly statement like that produced was made to us regularly—it is a printed form; we examined it—the affairs of the west-end branch also came before us in the same form—the item, "Sundries" in the weekly return in<lb/>cluded the total of the cash article book—I never looked at the general ledger in my life, and very rarely at the cash article book—we looked very particularly at the weekly statement, and read all the correspondence both in</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say on that occasion, "I think it is necessary that I should distinctly and unmistakably state that the conduct of the directors in the management of this bank has been honest and consistent, and of the utmost regularity?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe I did—there were very-likely cries of "No, no, "to that—I also said, "Gentlemen, with respect to the staff, the directors have no knowledge of, nor do they believe in any irregularity on the part of the staff of the Unify Bank"—I believed so at the time—it afterwards took Mr. Howell, the accountant, four months to go over the books to ascertain the true state of affairs—I thought it very strange that the defendants should have carried over those accounts without letting us know—it was not at the wish of the bank that I became Sheriff—I don't think I borrowed 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to pay my shrievalty expenses; I may have done so—my shrievalty cost me 4, 6002.—if the directors had borrowed all the capital, it would have been for the benefit of the shareholders, and nothing would have been lost.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say this at a meeting of shareholders on 16th July, 1858:—"Allow me to say the directors do not trust entirely either to the clerks or the manager; once a month they count all the cash themselves, each director taking his turn; every Tuesday we examine every bill that is dis<lb/>counted, and the particulars of every loan that is proposed; the expenditure also constantly undergoes a most rigid investigation"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is so—the cash was not always counted once a month—that was our duty—it was very often counted—it might in some instances have been omitted—we counted the notes and gold—we verified the cash in the tills.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember Deputy Bower, one of the directors, saying at the same meeting, "Twice a week, gentlemen, every Tuesday and Friday: I am the more entitled to say this because some question has arisen with regard to a monthly audit of the accounts—twice a week, I say, we might always have been found at our posts: not that our efforts have been confined to those days, but on those days there has been a regular examination made of what has been done in the intervening day. Now, when we have made that ex<lb/>amination, and made it, as I know it has been made, correctly; when, and in addition, we have every week made a practical audit by counting the cash, I must say I do not see how any other gentleman coming there monthly could have done the work better than it has been done by ourselves. "<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he was wrong in saying every week, it was every month—I have no doubt he said so—they are <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> reports, and copies were seat to all the shareholders—I think it very likely that the shareholders proposed an audit once a month, and very likely the directors opposed it—on 21st January, 1859, I addressed a meeting—I no doubt said, "I think I may very safely congratulate you on the improved state of your affairs through the excellent management of Mr. Terry, combined with the careful supervision of the directors, the bad debts of the past year, instead of being 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., are under 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. It must be borne in mind that we are not in a position to pick our paper; we are not in the position of the old-established banks, who can take in the largest and the best fish, and reject all the small ones. It is, however, the desire and aim, both of the manager and the directors, not so much to extend our business, as to take care that all the business done shall be <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi>, respectable, and legitimate. Let me add to what I have already said, that the directors still abstain from charging any fees for their services to the bank. They are working very hard, attending very closely to their duties, for the present without any remuneration; but</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186504100165"/>
               <p>if the bank should succeed, as I believe it will, I am quite sure they will receive a fair remuneration from the shareholders at the proper time. The directors are determined to devote close and untiring attention to your affairs. We have always done so up to the present time; We read every letter, we look at every bill, we devote a good deal of time to your interests, and we shall continue our efforts in the hope that are long they will be crowned with happy results."—That is perfectly true—I have mo doubt I said so, and that I meant so—I heard Deputy Bower say at thai meeting—"You all know that we have stack to the bank; yes, almost like leeches have we stuck to it. We have attended twice a week without any remune ration; we examine everything; we take an interest in everything; there can be no retrogression without our knowledge, and 10 advance without our helping to promote it We come before you with a can did statement of our affairs to the last penny. If there had been any lost we should have informed you of it."—At the half-yearly meeting, on the 27th January, 1860, I said, "Past experience has made us wise. We have learnt mot to place too much confidence in any man. We have got an excellent manager (we take care that all who are employed are not merely testimonial men, but persons who have been tried before), but we shall watch even our manager closely; and I contend that, in a concern of this kind, no man should be entrusted with an unlimited amount of responsibility."That is quite true, and acting on that we appointed Mr. Burch as the eye of the Board—I asked for 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for remuneration for my services and my losses—there was no doubt consider able discussion about it—I could not say on what day it was—I said without that I would not consent to the transfer to the London and Middlesex, and I was at liberty to do that as a shareholder—none of the directors asked for remuneration—we were to get 10, 00<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., by the transfer on a certain contingency, and I asked for 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., of that sum I worked for it, too, and I should have had plenty of sympathy from the shareholdaers, if that had been put into my pockets—the June balance-sheet was no doubt considered at our meetings—we always looked at the balance-sheets and talked them over, but we never altered or interfered with them—I have mo recollection on one occasion, when we wished to have a dividend, Mr. Terry entertaining a strong objection to it—if I stated so in July, 1860, it was so certainly.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And not to inquire any further into the matter. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not say that—on the contrary, I inquired whenever there was in my mind a necessity for inquiry—we certainly did not consider it our duty to look at the books of the bank—they were very numerous and voluminous, but at the Board meet<lb/>ings we had all the correspondence read, and we had a weekly statement furnished by our confidential servants—we must have believed what they said, or we must have discharged them—we took their word for the repre<lb/>sentation of certain facts—the books were read to us—we looked at the letter-books occasionally—the correspondence was a most important part of the business of the bank—we could not become clerks or managers.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say at the half-yearly meeting on the 20th July, 1860: "The directors had adopted the prudent policy of endeavouring to do a safe business rather than a very extended one of a less certain character, and he was happy to state as the result, that the losses from bad debts did not ex<lb/>ceed the average small amount which had hitherto occurred under the excel<lb/>lent management of Mr. Terry. On this, the termination of the third year under the new management, he had looked into the books with the view of ascertaining whether and to what extent they had improved their condition under the new <hi rend="italic">regime</hi>, and the result of his inquiry was so favour-able that he ventured to lay a few figures on the subject before the meeting. "Is that true? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never said anything but what I believed to be true—I call that looking into the books—it was made by our confidential manager; if you cannot trust him, who can you trust—perhaps I ought to have said I looked into the accounts—I consider that the looking at the weekly state<lb/>ments produced to us by the proper authorities was looking into the books—we did not employ a detective over our manager—we had all the bills before us weekly, and every loan that was granted, as far as we knew—there was also produced before us every week what was called the customers' account, showing what persons' accounts were overdrawn, and how much the discount for the week was—we should not have fulfilled our duties if we had not had such an account—I had an account in my own name at the head office—I did not draw on that account, it was merely in connexion with the shares—Mechi and Bazin had an account at the chief office, and also at the West-end branch—Mr. Bazin, my partner, had also a separate account—I did not operate on his account—I think it is very likely that I sometimes used his private account for my own purposes—I knew that at times we overdrew our account at the chief office, and at times at the west branch, but my partner managed the financial department altogether; I had nothing to do with the finances of the business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you bring out the money from that West-end branch and pay it into the chief office to give your account there the appearance of a balance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think at the close of a half-year every one likes to make their balance look pretty well, and on one occasion that was done; but the bank suffered nothing by it—whenever our account was overdrawn I insisted on being charged for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you do the same thing sometimes to show a balance at the western branch? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That may have been done; I do not know; my partner managed the financial department.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you in that way always appear to have a respectable balance at both? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very likely; the cheques passed—my partner managed the financial transactions entirely—I did not interfere; he had the entire management—it was without my authority—I should not have objected to it; it was a very innocent affair—I did know it; but I did not authorise him to do it—I knew it at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> So that there would appear a balance at both offices when the balance was against you at both? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The cheques were passing and would be paid—the appearance of the audit would be that we had a balance in our favour, not very considerable—we were not overdrawing; the cheques were passing.</p>

               <p>appear to have overdrawn at both places? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can't say; I am not sure—the cheques were passing to put both accounts in credit, when in fact they were not in credit.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have mentioned the examination of the books by the directors; will you state exactly what was done when you met on the Tuesday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the Tuesday the loans were considered—they were brought before us for our sanction—there was a loan book, in which was placed the amount granted, subject to approval—those were new loans—Mr. Burch mentioned the name of the person applying for the loan and the amount and sometimes Mr. Terry, and the subject was discussed amongst the directors—the manager was called in when it was necessary to get information on the sub<lb/>ject, to enable them to decide—I think the discussion was conducted in the first instance without the manager, but generally with him, and after discus<lb/>sion we came to a decision—all loans or renewals were considered on that same day, the Tuesday—the matter was brought before us by Mr. Burch, verbally or in his list; I can't say which; sometimes the name was put down I think, I cannot quite charge my memory; we discussed the question whether it was a proper loan to grant, Mr. Burch being present, and after<lb/>wards if any further explanation was wanted we called in Mr. Terry to give us the reasons and grounds for granting the loan—here is an entry on 25th June, 1861: "The following loans were approved"—then follows a list of names—they would not be written until after our decision was arrived at—they were discussed one by one—Mr. Burch would regulate the order in which they were brought before us, then we should discuss them, and on being approved they would be put down—no loans were ever brought before us until the manager bad first approved of them—I think that was our principal business on Tuesday—the correspondence was read on Friday—I know that our meetings were very short on Tuesday compared with Friday—the weekly reports were read on the Friday, I think—on the Friday we had the correspondence read, with the list of discounts—Mr. Burch read the correspondence; that occupied a substantial part of our meeting—we then read the weekly reports of the state of the bank—they were first read and then we examined them ourselves—we examined whether the amount of current accounts, deposit accounts, had increased or diminished; we examined all through it—we perfectly understood it, it was our guide to know in what position we were; we could not have got on at all without that—the cash was counted once a month, I think—I mean the cash in the tills, that is the cash referred to in this item—the bank balance we had before us every week—we banked at the Bank of England—some of us frequently went to the Bank to ascertain that the balance was there correctly—the Bank of England notes were counted by us with our own hands, and the money in the tills—I think the silver was weighed—the gold was counted—we did not attempt to verify the item of sundries—they were cheques and bills <hi rend="italic">in transitu</hi> or in suspense, passing into the country for realization and so on—we did not check those, more than the list being read to us—another paper was handed in—that was a paper of discounts; the discounts effected for the week—there is an abundance of these, it is a very important list to us—it was a list of persons requiring discount, how much already had been discounted, what was the average balance, and what the rate of interest—that was part of the business that we managed as directors—we examined each bill that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186504100170"/>
               <p>was discounted—the bills were passed from one director to another to see whether the names were good or not; to see if we knew them, and if not, questions were asked—from two to four hours were occupied in that way at these meetings—it depended upon the length of the correspondence and so on—we did not consider it our duty to look at the books themselves, because we had no doubt of the honesty and straightforwardness of our officials—by our officials I mean the manager, secretary, and accountants—the balance-sheet was brought before us after it had been verified by the auditors—it was then sent to the printers by Mr. Burch or Mr. Terry—we never saw it till then I think—I don't think we saw it before the auditors—it was brought to us immediately before sending it to the printers—it would be submitted to the auditors soon after the accounts were made up at the half-years—I think it occupied the auditors about a fortnight—we never inter<lb/>fered at all with the auditors or held any communication with them with respect to their audit—if we happened to go in and found them there, we immediately said, "Good morning, "and went out—after being audited the balance-sheet was submitted as a matter of course to the shareholders, with the auditrs' signatures attached.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that you did not see the balance-sheet at all before it was submitted to the auditors? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It came to us after the auditors—I don't know that I ever saw it before—my brother directors will be able perhaps to speak upon that, but I don't recollect that we ever saw it before; in tact, I don't think it was made up until then—if I bad seen anything wrong in the balance-sheet, it would have been my duty to call attention to it—the re-port was matter of discussion amongst the directors; that was entirely a matter for the directors—that is not the balance-sheet; it is attached to it on the other side of the fly-leaf—the report assumes the balance-sheet to be correct.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIPFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> A variety of speeches or portions of them have been suggested to you—I believe you have made a good many of those speeches to the shareholders? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We considered it our duty that the absent share<lb/>holders should know everything, as if they were present, and therefore we had a special reporter, who gave a verbatim report of everything that was said and done, and a copy was transmitted to each shareholder—the speeches were rather long at times—I invariably told the shareholders that I would answer any questions put to me, and those questions and answers are all embodied in the reports—at the time I made those statements that have been referred to, I believed them to be true.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever look to see what estimate had been made? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The estimates were discussed frequently in the board-room—in certain cases, in many cases, I inquired of Mr. Terry upon what principle he esti<lb/>mated the bills, such as Perl's, for instance—with reference to this account of 30th June, I don't think I did inquire of him upon what principle he had estimated the bills, or the amount at which he had estimated them—I did not understand the over-due bills' account to be estimated in these weekly returns—he was to carry into the balance-sheet the true value.</p>

                  </hi>. I am A partner in the firm of Byre and Lawson, solicitors, of 1, John-street, Bedford-row—I have been in the pro<lb/>fession since the year 1840—at the formation of the Unity Bank I was applied to by Mr. Bayliss to become a director—I was a director from the first—Mr. Terry was appointed first accountant to the bank at the time I was a director—on Mr. Chamber's retirement he became manager—I did not take an active part in his appointment—I remember an instance of a sum of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., borrowed by a person named Gregory, being entered in the cash article book; that transaction took place before the investigation to the management of the bank by Mr. Chambers—Mr. Gregory had l,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., lent him by Mr. Chambers, without security—an inquiry was made of Mr. Chambers whether that was not in the cash article book, and there was a ques<lb/>tion whether it appeared there or not; Mr. Terry was called into the board-room, and heat once, when asked the question, admitted that it was, and ire<lb/>gularly so, inasmuch as Mr. Gregory had left the country, and the money must be considered as lost—that was an irregularity by Mr. Chambens which Mr. Terry pointed out On 24th December, 1657, I wrote this letter to the directors; it is addressed to Mr. Alderman Mechi—(<hi rend="italic">read;</hi> "My dear Sir—Sinee our last court-day I have taken into consideration the position of the Unity Bank, and my own responsibilities and duties in connexion therewith. After what has passed, and the small shave of support I received from the chair, I do not feel personally inclined, nor do I see the advantage that would arise from my again attending the court until my duty may impera<lb/>lively require ma I desire, however, to put on formal record my view as to our present position, and as to the course which ought to be pursued. You are aware that I hare for some time past regarded the position of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186504100172"/>
               <p>bank with apprehension. That apprehension has been seriously increased by the recent revelations. The committee appointed at my instance has brought to light larger losses and a far more imperfect system of manage<lb/>ment than we were, any of us, previously aware of. The examination has also elicited facts connected with our losses which are of a very serious character. I have ventured to submit to yourself and my colleagues what appears to me to be our only remedy. But while I find my colleagues generally concurring with me as to the serious character of past transactions, I do not find them prepared to take the only step by which, as it seems to me, the property is likely to be saved from ruin. Under such circumstances the grave question which I have to consider is by what course of proceeding I can divest myself of any portion of the serious responsibility which de<lb/>volves upon me, and how far I can best perform my duty, not only to those who at my instance have invested their money in the bank, but to all pro<lb/>prietors at large who have honoured me with their confidence as a director. There is no ordinary meeting of proprietors until the month of January. The circumstances, however, are so serious that I think it ought to be deliberately considered whether we are to await that period or give the proprietary an opportunity of considering the position of the bank. In the balance-sheet of the 30th of April, 1857, our losses were stated to have been 1, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., According to your statement at the court in July, they are now upwards of 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., showing a loss of nearly 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in three months. The customers' deposits in the bank do not increase; at the present time they would be less than they were six months since had not several thousand pounds been paid in respect of the call of the Unity Fire Company. Our paid-up capital (150,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,) has been so dealt with that we have no more than 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—one-tenth of the whole—available at the present time for banking purposes. Our shares, of the value of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., each, are at the present time not saleable in the share-market. Without reference to the many other grave and startling facts which are known to us, it appears to me that the fore<lb/>going considerations alone are sufficient to indicate the propriety of calling our proprietors together. I accordingly request that you will have the kindness to submit this communication to the court, and take its deliberate opinion as to the propriety of calling a special meeting of the proprietors to consider the position of the bank. In the event of any such meeting I shall be prepared to state unreservedly my views of the present position of the property, and at the same time to resign my seat as a director. In the contrary event, I shall, at any rate, feel that I have done my duty by putting on record my protest against the present system of management, and my opinion as to the course which ought to be taken in justice to the pro<lb/>prietors.")—At that time I had from thirty-five to forty shares in the bank—at the time I wrote that letter I had ceased to attend the board—I after<lb/>wards resumed my seat, and continued to attend ever since down to 1862—I afterwards increased my shares to sixty-nine—I certainly understood the item of 207,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in the balance-sheet of June, 1862, to include the past-due bills, taking the latter at the proper estimate of their value—I never ex<lb/>amined the item of cash in hand, 38, 781<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nor did I examine some of the other items—I was present at the weekly meetings when the cash-article book was read, and I believed judging now from the large number of names it con<lb/>tained, that the items in that book could never have been read over fully—on the 27th of June, 1862, those items were written upon thirteen pages of the book, and the reading of these over would have occupied a much longer time than ten minutes—on 17th December, 1862, a list of the defaulters</p>

               <p>out several times, and I made the explanation voluntarily several times that the mortgage was not complete—I will undertake to say that I gave an explanation once, or oftener, from time to time—I knew nothing about the exchange of bills by Mr. Mechi from one bank to the other till it was men<lb/>tioned at the Mansion House—I have been a solicitor twenty-five years nearly—I cannot say much for my acquaintance with accounts—the books contain entries of all the bank's transactions; but my belief is that nobody under<lb/>stands bank-books but a banker—I became trustee for a large sum—I know perfectly well that, as a director, I am expected to understand something of my business—I understand accounts when they are brought before me—certain books were on the table, but I do not believe there was one from which I could have learned the entire affairs of the bank—the general ledger was not on the table, nor was it in the room, as a rule—I do not know that it was ever called for until I was at the Mansion House; I do not think I ever saw it—I know that there was one—I know that the general ledger ought to contain the whole affairs of the bank—an examination of that ledger would have prevented my issuing a false balance-sheet, but the directors never issued a false balance-sheet—it was not signed by Mr. Mechi I believe—the report was signed by Mr. Mechi—he was not the agent of the directors; but, no doubt, as chairman of the directors, he would sign any report—I consider myself responsible for the report as far as it is correct report—I consider myself responsible, with Mr. Mechi and the other directors, for that act, doubtless—if we had examined the general ledger, I should say that we should have been enabled to send out a true report of the state of the bank instead of a false one—have not looked at the ledger, but as a general rule, I should say yes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you say that he could not have read all those thirteen pages; that he did not turn them over? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can not—I am not here to impute any<lb/>thing to anybody—I never had the curiosity to look into the book, as far as I can recollect—it was the cash article book—it was left on the table—I mean to say that when Mr. Burch came before us with a list of defaulters, the names of Lowenthal and Harrison were not read out—I cannot see how the cash article book could in any way have altered my judgment about the state of the bank—I cannot answer the question—the cash article book was laid on the table with the rest of the papers, and the porter would come and take it from the board-room to the secretary's room—I am not aware that there was any concealment of it.</p>

I am a merchant in the Minories—I was one of the directors of the Unity Bank—I became so in 1855—I subse-quently became a director of the London and Middlesex Bank—I was not aware that forged bills were included in this item of 207,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—I con-sidered that bankrupts' bills were so reckoned by our manager—I considered that all past-due bills were valued by our manager at a percentage, according to their value—I took my last shares in December, 1861, paying 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per share—I did not confer with Mr. Terry entirely upon my purchase of those shares, but I took their value from the assets of the bank—I</p>

               <p>thought they would be worth 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a share, consequently I gave that money for them I thought in safety—I recollect hearing a conversation between Burch and Mr. Eyre, at least Burch was called into the committee-room when I was a director of the Lon<lb/>don and Middlesex bank—I recollect a paper or a list of debts that Mr. Eyre observed Alderman Mechi had before him; and Mr. Eyre observing the names of Lowenthal and Sterne there, expressed a good deal of surprise, and so did we all—I was present when the minute of this was taken, on 9th February, 1864, it was read over to Terry—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi> "At a meeting of the directors of the London and Middlesex bank, limited; present T. C.

(<hi rend="italic">Pointing it out</hi>),—I put these ink rings round them to point them out better—I have looked at an old piece called quarter leather, that is marked as well—these two blankets were found in the bed-room, they were marked with the Government mark in the centre, the mark is apparently out of this one, but it is a Government blanket—there is a mark on this other one, you can't see it unless you hold it up to a bright light, it is "W. D." and a broad arrow, all Government blankets are made with the selvage in this way, the W. D. is a mark that has been used since the Crimean war,; formerly they were marked "B. O," and the broad</p>

I am storeholder in the Royal Arsenal—I have charge of the condemned stores; I have the superintending of the sales of all of then—I have seen the leather produced here to-day; this large piece is seat-leather, to cover cloaks, and for other purposes—leather of this kind is never sold; it is new serviceable leather, unconverted—this hide is Govern<lb/>ment leather blacked; that is also new, serviceable leather—this is some more of the same not coloured—I have seen it all—I find the broad arrow on some of it, and the War Department mark.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engine-driver, in the employment of the South Eastern Railway Company—on Friday, 16th December, I was the driver of a ballast-train from Dartford, consisting of an engine and tender, twenty-two trucks, filled with gravel, and two break-carriages, one in front of the train and the other in the rear—it started about five minutes past 3 in the after<lb/>noon—it was an ordinary engine—I had no exact time to keep at the stations down the line, but had to work in between the other trains, and, if necessary, at some of the stations to go on to the sidings, so as to get out of the way of the other trains—eight of the trucks were unloaded at Abbey-wood—we took nine fresh trucks on between Dartford and Erith, before talking the others off—we got to Charlton Station about 4 o'clock, and were stopped there by a signal, and detained about a quarter of an hour—the ballast guard and the signal man at the station gave me the signal to start—a man named Lancaster was the guard of the train; I recieved my orders from him, and he received the order from the signal man—I started and went into the tunnel—at that time I had twenty-three loaded trucks—seven or eight plate-layers were riding in the break-carriage at the end of the train—John Currie was one of them—the tunnel is nearly a mile long; and is on an incline—we went about three parts of the way through—the wheels slipped pretty well all through the tunnel—the greasy state of the rails was the only cause of that—I signalled to have the breaks put on, to prevent the train from slipping back—we had put some sand on the rails to try to get along, but notwithstanding that the train stopped quite still, and we were not able to get along, though the engine was powerful enough—Lancaster then got down, but he had no time to get to the rear of the train before I felt a shock—we were then on the curve—I knew that something had come into us behind, but could not tell what it was—after that some one divided the train, and we went on with twelve of the trucks to Black heath for assist<lb/>ance</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186504100194"/>
               <p>to return with the engine and bring the remainder out—I returned with the engine with Assistance into the tunnel, and found that a passenger train had run into us behind, smashing up several trucks at the end of the train, and killing five of the men on the spot—we were in the tunnel, I sup<lb/>pose, from five to seven minutes before the collision—it was about thirteen minutes from the time of leaving Charlton Station till the collision—the train had just come to a stand-still before the collision—I have stuck in the tunnel once before that, when I have been in charge of a smaller ballast train, and reported that to the authorities—I was not in the habit of un<lb/>uncoupling the train in the tunnel and bringing part out—I cannot say whether the tail lights were on when I entered the tunnel as I did not go behind to see.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is there an express train which ought to leave Dart<lb/>ford at 3.15? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I do not know what time it leaves—the train left Maidstone about half-past 2, or twenty minutes to 3—when I got to Charlton I should have gone straight through without stopping, but for the signal against me—the weight of the train might be 250 tons, I do not know—I heard MR. Card well, the engineer, give his evidence—when so heavy a train as that stopped it is difficult to start afresh—there is an incline and a curve in the middle of the tunnel—I had quite power enough to drive the train; if there had been half the number of carriages the wheels might have slipped all the same—the engine would be more likely to have gone through with half the number of trucks—it would carry ten trucks through; in fact, I divided the train, and then found myself able to go through—when we had got 200 yards or so into the tunnel the slipping commenced, and the guard got down—we were then going almost at a walking pace, it was just previous to stopping still—my fireman got down also—I did not see him kick ballast on the line to make it less slippery—I felt the jar on the engine as if another engine had come into us in front—when one engine backer to another there is sometimes a bit of a jerk—it was not at all a violent shock; the guard asked me what I came back for; I said I had not come back—there was a great deal of steam and noise in the tunnel—when I came out of the tunnel with half the train, Jones, the signalman, was at the end of the platform by the door of his box—the mouth of the tunnel is not very far from the Black<lb/>heath Station; I afterwards saw Mr. Chapman, the station-master—the signal-man was about 200 yards from the mouth of the tunnel, I do not know exactly—when I got to the Blackheath Station I passed along to a siding, and then went back with the engine, having left half the ballast train in the tunnel—I held my arm up to the signal-man, and told him to hold hard—I do not know whether he understood it—Lancaster was in charge of the train; we have no fixed time to run the ballast trains—they are not in the time service at all; it has occurred before in my own case, that ballast<lb/>trains have had to divide, but I cannot speak of others; I have since heard of one or two trains sticking in the same place.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is the slipping in consequence of frost or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From the greasy state of the rails the engine-wheels do not adhere, as it is a very wet tunnel, and such a great quantity of steam goes through which falls on the rails, and there is always a greasiness; if it had not been for the greasy state of the rails the engine was abundantly powerful to draw the train, and more than that, we are more liable to stopping in the winter season.</p>

I am a porter at Blackheath station—on the Friday after<lb/>noon that that accident happened, Bartholomew told me to go to the prisoner at the signal-box and say that there was a train waiting at Charlton—I went to the prisoner's box door and told him so—he said, "Very well, I thought I heard three beats some little time ago"—he said nothing more—I left the box and came away—I did not see him use the instrument.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was he perfectly sober? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have never seen him the worse for liquor—when he said that he heard three beats, I said that I did not know anything about it—I am not paid by the company—I am not in their employ—I only take parcels.</p>

                  </hi>. I am station-master at Blackheath—I have been nearly eighteen years in the company's employ, and am perfectly acquainted with the working of the line—it is a rule that when a train is started a message should be sent from the starting station—in starting from Dart ford the station-master would send a message along the line which would be immediately conveyed to the signalman, and that train would be added to their list of expected trains, which was not done in this instance, and the ballast train became entirely dependant on signals from station to station—the prisoner had been porter for two years and four months—he had been working the signals altogether for about eight or nine days—he had been well taught before he was put into the signal box—every person in the com<lb/>pany's employ is required to make himself acquainted with the rules—he had taken the duty of assistant signalman to help the day man when he went to dinner, and from 6 to 8 in the evening on several occasions when I had given one of the staff a holiday—he was my reserve man, and was par<lb/>ticularly steady and sober, and one of the best men I ever had under my charge—his hours were from 7 in the morning to 6 in the evening with one hour for dinner—he had no other duties but signaling—this message which was sent from Charlton station by the porter was decidedly irregular; it should have been copied in writing and sent to the signalman so as to impress it more on his mind—they are not justified in attending to merely verbal messages, and if the prisoner had attended to this message he would have done wrong—the regulations are strict you must have a written message to act upon—I cannot understand how the man made a mistake—orders to the signalman may be given verbally by me but by no one else except the head porter when he is acting as my deputy—trains have been stopped in the tunnel and divided before—that arises from the wet dripping through and making the rails greasy and very often from atmospheric causes—it is often not so bad as at other times—it has happened many times since I have been at Blackheath—it has always been reported, and all precautions are supposed to be taken and rules are laid down which were considered sufficient—not taking so many trucks would decidedly be the remedy for it.</p>

METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were there two passenger trains which passed just at that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; they were signaled in the ordinary way—I have not got the prisoner's book—the law department have had the charge of it since the accident—I went to the prisoner's box about the time of the col<lb/>lision, as I understood he wanted to speak to me—he said, "I understand the ballast train has divided in the tunnel"—I saw he was agitated, and he said, "I am afraid I have given the clear signal"—I immediately telegraphed to Charlton station, but at that time the collision had taken place.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a time-keeper in the service of the South<lb/>eastern Company—I knew John Cumming, who was injured in the accident—he died in the Royal Marine hospital at Woolwich from the injuries he received.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoners statement before the Magistrate:</hi>—"I entered the company's service two years last August as porter, which situation I held up to a week previous to the accident, when I was placed in the signal-box to do duty for the signal-man who was ill. I don't believe I had done more than twenty duties in the signal-box, that is to say, when there was any signalling to do, before I took charge of it, so that my previous experience was but little. However, when I took the duty I hoped I should have been able to have performed it satisfactorily. My duties were to attend in the signal-box from 7 in the morning until 6 in the evening, with the exception of the hour allowed for dinner. After coming out of the box at 6, I had to wait the arrival and to attend the 6.17 down train. Whilst in the box I had to receive and give telegraphic signals to and from Lewisham-station, and to and from Angerstein-junction. I had beside to enter signals in five different places for each train in the signal-book in addition. I had for each train or engine to attend to the semaphore and distinct signal, and upon each train passing to show my flag or hand-signal that all was right. I will now state briefly the circumstances connected with the lamentable acci<lb/>dent so far as I am able, and the traffic that passed through the station within three-quarters of an hour of it. The following trains passed through the Blackheath-station:—Down from London 3.30, 3.50 (expressed), 4.5, 420 (expressed). Due at Blackheath, 3 51, 4.7, 4.25, 431. The next down train, the 4.30, due at 4.47, was fortunately stopped at Blackheath. Up from Woolwich, 3 30. Due at Blackheath 3.44. Angerstein coal-train, 4.5. Blackheath empties'-train, 4.10. Ballast-train, signalled up at 413.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186504100199"/>
               <p>I believe I had in addition the block-signal, prior to the coal-train from An<lb/>gerstein-junction, but this I am not quite sure without seeing the train-service<lb/>book. I had been in the practice, prior to the day, to send the coal<lb/>train off first from our Blackheath-station, but I was ordered by the head<lb/>porter to keep the coal-train, and send the empties off first, which was the cause of the train being kept at Charlton. During this time the traffic was very great, and I felt it was as much as I could do to attend to it properly. After the coal-train was gone, and I had given the 'line clear' to Anger<lb/>stein-junction, I had the 4.5 express-signal down, and after passing that on to Angeratein-junction, and receiving 'line clear,' I had the 420 express-signal down. Somebody at this time came running out of the Telegraph-office telling me there was a train waiting at Charlton; this message, together with the heavy traffic then taking place, caused me to get confused, and I gave the signal 'line clear.' I was so confused that I did not know what I was about; so much so that I was very much surprised to find it was the outside porter who had brought me the telegraph message out—I could have sworn it was one of the telegraph boys. After the 4.20 down express had passed our station, I thought I had done something wrong as regards the signalling. I immediately sent for Mr. Chapman, the station-master, to tell him of what I had done. I did not at that moment know of the accident He came down on the platform from his house, after half of the ballast-train had passed the station; he came to me, and I think I told him what had taken place as to my signalling. All would have gone well if I had been left alone, and not have received the telegraph message, which seemed wholly to confuse me. I took my eyes off the signals for a moment, and believed at the time I gave the signal 'line clear' that it was the right thing for me to do."</p>
