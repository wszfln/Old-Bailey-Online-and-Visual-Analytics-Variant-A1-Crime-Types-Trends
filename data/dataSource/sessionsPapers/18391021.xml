                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Henry Muggeridge a corn-dealer, in Doctor's Commons; Holyhead was his foreman, Arber deals with Mr. Muggeridge. On the 15th of October, Arber came with his cart—he 'came into the warehouse—Holyhead was standing close by me—he said, "I suppose you want a sack of oats? "—he said he did—Holyhead went into a cellar below to get the sack of oats—Arber went to his cart, and got an empty sack—Holyhead shot the oats into the sack, and they both assisted in putting the sack into the cart—they then came and went to the desk, and Holyhead asked him if he would sign the book, which was usual—they both went to the desk, but did nothing of the kind—there is a book on purpose to be signed—when they came from the desk, Arber asked Holyhead if he would have some gin—he said, he did not care if he did, and they went to a public-house—I went to the desk to see if the book was signed, and it was not—it is here—things are always entered in this book before they go out of the warehouse.</p>

               <p>in below, on the floor—he threw the sack in, and another bushel was fetched from the floor above, by Holyhead—he put it into the sack—Arber held the sack open, and both assisted in putting it into the cart—I heard nothing about signing the book at that time—I am quite sure Arber had said before that he wanted nothing else to-day—he went off with the cart I followed it over Blackfriars-bridge—I hallooed to him, "Hoy," and as soon as he saw me he said, "I have got nothing but what is my own" he whipped his horses, and gallopped away—I went after him, stopped him, and said, "If you have nothing but what is yours, why run away?"—I brought him back—Mr. William Muggeridge gave them both in charge—Holyhead said, "I have got the money, and I meant to pay you for them"—Mr. Muggeridge then said, "There was a sack of oats on Tuesday," but they both denied seeing each other on the Tuesday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Morleys in Gutter-lane—I was shopman to Mr. Charles Johnson, in September last—the prisoner was his porter—he had been there about five weeks On the 18th of September, in consequence of finding something I sent for Bennett the officer, and went with him and the prisoner to his lodg<lb/>ing, No. 19, Clifton-street, North-road, and in a pan of water, in the kitchen, was found a piece of linen, about two or three yards—this is it there is a mark of "No. 26" on it—it was merely the mark of the length—I did not know the mark—in a bed-room I found a short length of linen, with the mark, "26" on it—it is a custom in the trade to mark both ends of the linen with the same mark—these were similarly marked to the other pieces which were in my master's possession—I left the pri<lb/>soner at his lodgings, and communicated with my employer—I went next morning to the prisoner's lodging with sergeant Dick—we found the same two lengths there—the mark was on one, but off the other—it had been taken off—here is the one that has the mark on it—I took the linen away, and two table-covers, which I know to have formed part of our stock—we found another piece of linen at Attenbrough's, the pawnbroker's, marked "F 107"—I knew that to be Mr. Johnson's—it is the remaining part of the piece which was found at the prisoner's house—I am quite certain of that—it makes the twenty-six yards complete—it was one of the pieces bought on the 2nd of March last—we bought eight pieces, from No. 100 to 107, with the letter "F" marked on each—this piece was sent out to a customer on the 21st of June, and returned to Mr. Johnson—here is an<lb/>other piece of linen with a mark, which appears to have been rubbed out—I saw it in Finnigan's possession, and am quite positive it is Mr. John<lb/>son's—it is the only piece we had in the house marked in this partícular way, with a red mark, and I saw the pencil-marks on it—lawn is marked by means of a small piece of linen, on which the private mark is written and pinned near the end—on this piece of lawn here are the pin-holes, but the linen is not here—this is the part of the lawn where the mark was put.</p>

On Saturday evening, the 14th of September, I was going to Mr. Black's, a customer of master's, in Lawrence Pountney-lane about a quarter past eight o'clock—I passed by the prosecutor's shop, and saw two gentlemen—I knocked up against one of them with my tray, by accident—one was dressed in a Macintosh, and the other in a surtout coat-one of them spoke to me—in about two-or three minutes I was re<lb/>turning from Mr. Black's, and saw the one with the Macintosh on at Mr. Thompson's shop—I could not swear it was one of those I had run against he was standing with his arms at his side at the door, and I saw the legs of another man, crawling into the shop on his knees—I went on the other side and looked, and saw the one on his knees take a tin box off a shelf and give it to the one in the Macintosh—I went in, and told what I had seen—Lovell is the man in the Macintosh who received the box from the man that crawled in.</p>

On Monday, the 16th of September, a little before ten o'clock in the 1 morning, I was at the come of Fore-street, when the prisoner Lovell spoke to me, and asked me if I could go on an errand for him to the Bank,</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Thomas Emmott, a jeweller, in Holborn. About the 16th of September, about twelve o'clock, the prisoner Davis and another, who is not into custody, came into the shop and wished me to show them some gold pins—I laid a small tray before them—they looked at them and passed remarks upon them, and asked the price of several—at that time Cleaver came in and inquired the price of some cards, on the other side of the shop—I showed him some—we did not agree about the price, and he went away—Davis and the other boy were still looking at the pins—directly Cleaver left the shop, Manning came in, looked about, and asked questions, and talked with the other boys—I suspected I was robbed, and as Cleaver had left the shop I sent a per<lb/>son after him, who brought him back—I then accused all four of them of robbing me, and sent for an officer—I thought I heard something link on the edge of the counter—I looked and saw a pin there, which I think fell from Manning, as it was nearest to him—I am positive it is one which had been in the tray, and I do not think it had dropped down before—I have no doubt that Manning dropped it—I could not tell how many pins were missing from the tray, as I did not know the number that were in it—this other pin was produced by the officer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to a solicitor in Sise-lane. On the 22nd of October, about eleven o'clock, the prisoner came, and said he had come from Mr. Bagster for a box—I went up stairs to ask my master, leaving the prisoner there—I came down, and the prisoner went nay—I missed an umbrella—I went out, and saw him running down the lane—I pursued him to Tower Royal—I there saw the umbrella in his hand, and collared him—he struck me in the face, and threw it away—he got from me, but I still followed till he was taken—he said he had not taken it, but afterwards he said he had.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Prince of Brunswick public-house at Islington. On the 4th of October, about three o'clock, the prisoner and two others came to my house—they had one pint of beer, which I took in—the prisoner went into the yard, and when he came in we missed a pot from the horse in the yard—I stopped him and another—I gave the pri<lb/>soner to a person—he resisted very much—the other man then got away, and I went to assist in securing the prisoner—we got him on the ground, and discovered these two pots between his skin and his shirt—he had cut the bottoms off, and flattened them—he afterwards took the bottoms, I think, from under the waistband of his trowsers—I said, "You have been stealing my pots"—he said, If I have, I will pay you for them.</p>

On the 27th of September the prisoner came into the shop with a child in her arms—she first asked for some night-caps, which I showed her—she did not buy any—she then wished to see some children's socks—the bought some, and a pair of stockings—I observed her put the child several times on the counter, and once she set the child on a pair of black stockings and took them up with the child—I made out a bill of the articles which she bought—when she went we went after her—she was brought back, and this pair of stockings, three pairs of socks, and a night<lb/>cap, were found on her in a handkerchief, and the parcel of goods I had sold her was wrapped in a paper—I know them to be my master's—two of them have our mark on them.</p>

On the 2nd of October, I was going, with my cart, through Hammersmith—the prisoner asked me to give him a ride—he said he had come from Reading, and was going to London after a situation—I took him to town—I put up at the Greyhound public-house, in Smithfield, and gave him a breakfast and dinner—he went to look after a situation, and I took him back again with me—when we got near Kew-bridge, I got out of the cart to warm my feet—I allowed him to put my coat round his legs, as he was in the cart-a few minutes afterwards, I saw him walking by the side of the horse, and in less than a minute, I missed him and my coat also—the coat has not been found.</p>

On the 10th of October, about two o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop and asked for a quarter of an ounce of silk—the shopman laid a leather of silk before him and went away—I saw the prisoner take twenty skeins of silk and put into his pocket—I seized his hand, kept it in his pocket, and called the shopman—when he came up, the prisoner took the twenty skeins out of his pocket and threw them over the counter and about the place.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Con naught-terrace, and am a butcher—the prisoner was in my employ. On the 6th of October I saw a blue frock concealed between the wainscot of my passage and the shop—it was yond my reach—I took a stick and touched it, and heard a dish rattle a little further round—I then got a policeman to watch my premises—I have no doubt this mutton and beef are mine, and the suet I can swear to.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been in business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nearly fifteen years—the prisoner has been with me since April—he went to market for me three or four days a week—I did not always give him the money—I never sent him to purchase on his own credit, and never knew of his pawning his watch to get goods for ray shop, or of his pawning any thing—I generally sent some money to market—I once sent a bill enclosed to a certain party, confidentially, which was re<lb/>fused—I had not credit with the person—I expected to get credit, not having money—the prisoner has never supplied me with goods or property of his own when I could not get credit—my credit is not good in the market—I owe the prisoner 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have never been applied to for it, except from his father—his father applied to me for his wages, and I withheld them on one particular account—I told him I would send them on one occasion—I did not pay him, because I did not know how much I might be brought in debt for other things—I did not fix a day to pay him—I said I would not pay him till I knew what was owing at Newgate-market—I never said I would not pay him till after this trial was over—I did not say I would</p>

               <p>send it him on the Wednesday—I said I would send him the money-the father came for the prisoner's clothes—I sent a servant up with him and he took them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long is it ago since an accident happened to your scales? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am sure I do not know—I always regulated them every morning but I had not regulated them one morning, and they were found rather short of balance by the Jury when they came—that was the only day that I forgot to regulate them—they are elm scales, and they will vary according to the weather—I regulate them with lead, so that they may be on a ba<lb/>lance—I think the Jury came to my house about eleven o'clock—I had sold something that morning—the Jury did not cut up my scales—they chopped a chain or two—I got one new scale, and got the other regulated by, a scale-maker—I was fined 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—The Jury come once a month—they came by surprise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From the time the prisoner came into your service, have you ever paid him a single shilling? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but Mrs. Fletcher did—she is not here—I do not know how much she paid him—she paid him according as he requested it, with the exception of one occasion—on one occasion be requested leave to go into the country—there was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. due to him—he requested to have the money, and she paid him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., leaving 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not see it, but she told me so—I think she had paid him in my presence—I will not swear it—he never asked me for his wages—he might have asked my wife in my presence—I do not remember that he has asked for wages repeatedly, and could not get a farthing—I do not remember that I have asked him to take a few shillings at a time—I might have been present when he has been asked to take a few shillings at a time, and I not hear it—I might have heard it—I cannot call to recollection whether I did or not—the only amount that I know he received was that 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot swear that he got that—he was to have had 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he never applied to me for wages, that I swear—the first application I had was from his father—I did not refer his father to my wife, as she was not in the way—the first time his father applied I had not the money in the house—he applied twice—I had the money on the last occasion—I have no idea but that he can receive his wages at any time, if he is convicted or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you were first at the police-office did you not say you could not identify any of the meat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I said I believed it to be mine—I said I could identify part—I can identify this suet—this piece of steak I can identify from the piece it is cut off of—I had three persons in my house, the prisoner, and a lad under him, and a maid-servant—the prisoner had partly the management of my shop, but not almost entirely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you spend much of your time in the Quebec public-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, in the evening, and I have been there from two to four o'clock in the afternoon—I have been there perhaps two or three days a week—I have been at the Clanricca public-house perhaps an hour or two in the week—I never was in the Horse and Groom public-house in my life to sit down—I have been in there, and taken a glass perhaps, two or three days in a week—there is no place to sit down there—I have sat down in the other houses—I will not swear that I have not sat down when I could not stand—this meat is not worth much now—I valued it at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I can swear to part of it, but part of it may not be mine—I have not the least doubt of its all having been in my shop—I think the prisoner had been to market for</p>

               <p>me on the Thursday, the Friday, and the Saturday before he was taken—I think I gave him on the Saturday, when he went to market, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he laid out, I think, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he told Mrs. Fletcher he paid the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of his own pocket—I do not know how often he has paid for me when I had not given him money to pay, but whatever he has paid has been returned to him by Mrs. Fletcher when he brought the notes, but latterly he has not brought notes—I did not see Mrs. Fletcher pay him the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I should say the did pay it—I should say that I have seen her pay money to him which he has advanced in Newgate-market, but really I do not recollect how often nor to what amount—it is down in the book, but I have not brought it here—I do not know what was the largest sum I ever trusted him to go to Newgate-market with; it was upwards of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I know.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say any thing to this effect, that you would not be ques<lb/>tioned, and if you were not asked any questions you would be lenient to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, at his father's request—I did not say if I was questioned I would press as severely as possible against the prisoner—I said nothing of the kind—when he was remanded, I came back and I met his father in the Court—he said, "They have employed a solicitor"—"Very well," says I, if they employ a solicitor and cross-examine me, I must enter fully into the case"—those were the words I used—the fact was this, his father was a very respectable man I understood—I had nothing in my mind except good feeling towards him—I did not know who was robbing me—I know I have been robbed to an enormous amount.</p>

               <p>expressly for any thing—there is a window which opens from the back of the work-shop into that place, about four feet from the ground—I saw Street in that place, making towards the window—I saw him go up to it—I was directly opposite the window in Chalk-farm-lane, looking down upon him—when he got to the window I saw the prisoner Crumble (whom I had never seen before) come and talk to him for about five minutes—while they were talking Street turned round and looked at me—I was then satisfied that I was observed—I went back to where I could see them, and they not see me—while I had been looking at them Street's hack was towards me, and Crumble's face—when I went back I saw Street take; handkerchief out of his pocket, put it in at the window, and bring it out with something in it—he then came back to the rails and saw me—I got through the rails, and he ran down to the window and I after him-just as I got to the window he had got a stone bottle out of the handkerchief, and put it in the window—he put the handkerchief into his pocket again—I then told Street he was my prisoner—he begged of me to let him go, and said it was the first time—he wanted to go on his knees, and put up his hands, and said he had a wife and six children—he said, "There is only us two, let me go"—I stood at the window, and saw the bottle inside—I called, but no one answered—I took Street round to the shop, and took possession of the bottle—this is it—there was no one in the shop-time is the front-way out of the shop, through which any one could have gone and left it—I then called Jackson, another constable, and asked him where the painter was—he said he dared to say he was at Chalk-farm at dinner—I said, "Go and fetch him"—he went and brought the prisoner Crumble—I said, "That is the man I want, take him into custody"—I have since examined, near that window, and find there is a little bench, just inside the window—from the means I had of observing Crumble I hare not the slightest doubt of him.</p>

At a little after twelve o'clock, on the 1st of October, I saw Street in custody of Bates—I went to the Chalk-farm tavern, and found Crumble at his dinner—I brought him back to where Bates and Street were—the men leave at twelve o'clock, to go to dinner—the carpenter and the smith usually worked in the shop where Crumble did, and, usually, all went to dinner together, but on that day I saw the smith and the carpenter go together, but I did not see Crumble go at all—they went, and left Crumble alone in the shop—he worked in that shop as a painter.</p>

I am an agent to a hosier in Wood-street The prisoner has been in my service four years and a half, in the situation he held at the time in question, and he was there before me—on the 4th of October I gave him a parcel to take to the Bull-and-Mouth inn, to be sent by mail to Davis and Wilson, Nottingham—it contained three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

Newman, 14, Wood-street"—I went that evening to the Mansion-house, got a search-warrant, and Forrester went with me to the warehouse—I accused the prisoner of having stolen the notes, and said, "Here is an officer, I give you in charge for having stolen the notes inclosed in my parcel"—he said, "No, no"—I said, "You had better admit the fact, Stephen, it will be better for you"—he afterwards desired to see me in pri<lb/>vate—he wished me to go home to his lodging—I went with him and the officer to his lodging, and there he gave me two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and nine sove<lb/>reigns, and begged forgiveness.</p>

On Friday, the 11th of October, between eight and nine o'clock, I was in Old-street-road, and saw the prisoner and another lad standing together by the side of the prosecutor's shop—in about a minute I saw the prisoner go into the shop and come out with the rods in his hand—the other lad stood before the door—I followed them to a marine-store dealer's in Virginia-row, where he offered the rods for sale through the window—I went for a policeman, brought him to the shop, and gave the prisoner into custody—he was at the door in the act of leav<lb/>ing, and had not the rods with him—the policeman took him into the shop, and the owner of the shop then produced the rods—the prisoner said he had offered them for sale—the man said he had not bought them, but had detained them, and told the prisoner to fetch the owner—the prisoner said he had found them near Shoreditch church.</p>

The prisoner had been nearly four years in his service—he was employed particularly to take satins from the shop to a cellar, where they are damped before dressing—we mark every piece of satin which is sent to us—at the latter end of September we missed portions of the lengths of satin sent to us, in many instances, and on the 1st of October, in consequence of sus<lb/>picion, I sent for Dubois, the officer, and went with him to the prisoner's lodgings—he was not there—we waited until he came home, and we were searching his room when he came in—I gave him in charge—Dubois told him it was for robbing his master, and asked him if he had any duplicates—he said yes, he had, and gave up two which did not relate to our pro<lb/>perty—Dubois searched his person and found nine duplicates in his coat pocket, all referring to remnants of satin which have our mark on I found them at the pawnbroker's.</p>

I was with my father on this Tuesday—I remember the prisoner joining us between Egham and Staines—I cannot say how far it was from Bedfont, as I only came up for a few weeks' holidays—I rode inside from the time of the prisoner getting up till I got to Hounslow, or on the footboard, but I never left the wagon—I got down at Bedfont, but did not walk one hundred yards—there were some poles by the side of the wagon at Hounslow—the prisoner got out and went to the corner behind the poles—on that another man came from the other aide of the road, and talked to the prisoner—they were together about two minutes, and I then laid down in the wagon again—up to that time I had not left the wagon—a little time after that he came up on the shafts of the wagon, it was then dark—he said, Is any one here?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Where is your father?"—I said, "In the yard, doing his horses"—he said, "I wanted to have a drop of beer with him before I leave"—I laid down again, and after a time my father came out to me—I told him what had passed between me and the prisoner—my father went away, and did not say any thing—I remained on the wagon about twenty minutes, when my father came to me with a light after the victuals, and looked round the wagon—I can swear the four bales were safe then—I saw them myself—I then went into the tap-room with my father, and the prisoner was there—I did not remain away more than five or six minutes—I had not eaten two mouthfuls—(up to the time I left the wagon the tail of it was safe)—the prisoner said he must go and call for a pipe of tobacco—he went out, then my father said something to me, and gave me some directions, which I obeyed—I went to the tail of the wagon, and heard something rustle—I went to the head, and could hear it plainer—I did not make any noise—I went back to my father in the tap-room, and told him what I had seen and heard—he went out and I after him, but did not get there so soon as he—I saw my father with the prisoner on the ground—the bale was lying up against the head of the wagon—I heard the prisoner say, "Pray let me go"—when be was first taken up he seemed to peep about the wagon, and then he laid down by the side of an old woman, who got down at Hounslow, and went to bed—she was gone before my father examined the wagon with the lantern.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live at Dockhead—the prisoner was in my service.

On Sunday morning, the 5th of October, between one and two o'clock, I met the prisoner in Barbican—I had been to a little society that I belong to—I was quite sober—the pri<lb/>soner came up, and asked how I did—I said I was pretty well—she took bold of my coat, and began to pull me about—I pushed her away, and I felt her hand in my right-hand waistcoat pocket—I endeavoured to get hold of her hand, but she concealed it in her pocket-hole—I missed out of my pocket, three half-crowns, two shillings, and one sixpence—I accused her of it, caught hold of her hand, and took out of it two shil<lb/>lings and one sixpence—I asked her to give me the half-crowns—she denied having them—a policeman was passing, and I gave her in charge—she then dropped two half-crowns—I picked them up, and a gentleman picked up another in Bunhill-row—they were all given to the officer.</p>

Robinson came into our house about a quarter after five o'clock; in the morning, sat down, and called for a quartern of gin—then for another quartern, and asked one or two persons who came in, to drink—she pulled a watch out of her bosom, and asked me to lend her a knife—she went the end of the place, and began scratching it—she brought it to me, and asked me to pawn it for her—a few minutes after some more females came in, and she told me to lay the watch down—she began crying, and said her husband had been away seven years, and he had sent her a watch, and handkerchief, and plenty of money—about twenty minutes afterwards Perkins came in. and said to Robinson, "I have left him sitting in the room"—another female named Rose came, and they were laughing toge<lb/>ther</p>

               <p>—I suspected the watch was stolen, and spoke to Rose, who gave me information—the prisoners went out together, returned again in five mi<lb/>nutes, and Perkins asked mc for the half-sovereign—I told her I knew no<lb/>thing about any half-sovereign, and asked what she meant—Robinson called her away, and said, "No, no, that is all right"—Perkins then asked me for the watch—I asked where she got it—she made use of very abu<lb/>sive language, and asked me what business it was of mine, and what b—business I had to detain the watch—I told her it was stolen, and I should detain it till Mr. Cocket, my master, came down—this is the watch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plumber, and live in Bell-street. I and my brother were repairing these houses—this copper belongs to us—this old copper pipe and guttering was removing to make way for new—we were to have the old materials—I missed some copper from where I deposited it, at No. 1, Little James's-street—I went with the officer to the house, and went to open the door with the key, and the lock fell to pieces, it had been broken—it is about one hundred yards from where the officer found the prisoner—I am satisfied this copper is the same, but I will not swear to it—it corresponds in quantity with what I lost, and in shape and material also.</p>

On the 21st of October, about half-past three o'clock, I saw the prisoners loitering before the shop—I saw Johnson take down the flute, and hand it down close to the hand of M'Lean, who took it up, put it into an umbrella. and walked off with it—I went out and collared Johnson—he slung himself round, and got away—M'Lean walked off—I went and took him, and found the flute—I took him to the station-house, and in ten minutes Johnson was brought in—this is the flute.</p>

On the evening of the 28th of May I had been to a club in Somers-town, with some friends—we got into King-street, Holborn, near upon twelve o'clock—I was with Crowl, Monday, Denton, and Fitzpatrick—I was very bad at the time in my feet, with the gout, and was leaning on Denton's arm—Crowl was rather behind us, and the others were at the top of the street/bidding one of the party good night—as we walked along we met the prisoner and some others—there was one on each side of him, two be<lb/>hind, and I think three more behind them—the prisoner was walking arm-in-arm—one of the three said to me, You b----, can you fight?"—I was looking down at the time—I then looked up—Crowl was a little before—they all three put themselves in a fighting attitude—Crowl then snatched my stick out of my hand, and said, "What are you going to do with my friend?"—some parties behind the three in front said, "Hit the b—down," and that party directly struck the deceased—I did not see which of them—I caught the person's arm by the wrist, as he was going to strike the deceased, and I caught the deceased's arm also, and held him by the arm, to prevent either striking, and I got hit and knocked down by the whole party altogether—the deceased was struck against the rails—I did not see who by—there was then a general fight altogether—I could not see whether he was struck more than once, for I was knocked down myself—I cannot tell to a certainty which of our party had come up at the time—there was a gas-lamp close by where I was-r-after the second attack I aw the persons distinctly, ✗ I lay on the curb-stone—I saw the prisoner—the affray continued for about ten minutes—as I laid on the curb-stone, I saw two policemen come up—I cannot tell where Crowl was while I was on the curb-stone—I got up, and asked the policeman to take the parties into custody—(the prisoner and his companions were there at the time)—the policeman refused, saying he did not see any blows struck—the next time I saw Crowl he was at the end of the street, sitting on some stones</p>

               <p>with Denton—the policeman came up, and said we had better go home—I took Crowl home to St. Clement's-lane—he was afterwards taken to the hospital, and I believe died that very day week.</p>

On the evening of the 28th of May, I was in company with Pape and others, returning down King-street, Holborn—I was walking with Pape—I met three persons coming in a direction from Holborn—I did not know any of them—one was rather taller than the others—I can hardly say the tallest man was in the middle, but I think he was—I heard very bad language—the prisoner's party spoke first—they said, You b—s, can you fight?" or, "Will you fight?"—one or the other—Crowl at that time was a few paces behind me and Pape—he said, "What are you insulting my friends, for?"—one of the party then struck Crowl, but who he was I do not know—I rather think it was the tall one—Crowl then snatched a stick out of Pape's hands, (which I thought was the bead of a window,) and struck the tall man, who I think was the man that struck him—the stick broke, and then the same man struck Crowl again, and they fell down in the road, with the man who struck Crowl on him—I then went away in hopes of finding a policeman to part them, and when I returned in about ten minutes, he was sitting down on the edge of the curb-stone or something—he appeared to be hurt—I helped him home, and saw him next day at Charing-cross hospital.</p>

               <p>the time he came into the hospital till he died? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not his medical attendant—I received him into the hospital—the gentleman who attended him is not here—I believe Mr. Matthias saw the body—I did not observe any external marks of violence—I could not find any fractured rib before death—I did not wish to give him sufficient pain to find that out—it is a painful operation to discover it—I should ask him to cough probably, or to draw his breath hard—I did so, and that gave him pain—a fractured rib is often not detected till after death—it is very easy to detect when several ribs are broken, but it is sometimes very difficult to find a single rib frac<lb/>tured—there was an enlargement of the rib, and it is my opinion under all the circumstances that the fractured rib caused the inflammation, although other causes might probably produce it—there was inside the rib what is called <hi rend="italic">exostosis</hi>—that is an increase of the bone, a projection internally of the bone of the rib—the bone was enlarged to the size of a small hazel nut—that would press on the pleura or lining membrane of the lungs—I think it very possible that would irritate the lining membrane—there was no inflammation of the lung itself—it was confined to the lining membrane of the lung—the affection of the lining membrane of the chest appeared recent—I found no other organ diseased—the lining membrane was very much inflamed, and sloughing had taken place—there was an effusion of water—that is very common after death, but not to large a quantity—I should say there was sixteen ounces probably—I bled him once, and he was bled by other persons—I think he was bled three times, but it might be four—his pulse might be about eighty when I bled him—I cannot re<lb/>member what it was, as I did not expect to be called on to state that—Mr. Houship could tell you more particularly—he is senior surgeon of the hos<lb/>pital—he is not here—he was treated under Mr. Houship's directions, and prescribed for—the acts of the junior surgeons were according to the di<lb/>rections of the senior—there is a complaint called phlebitis, which is inflammation of the vein—it very commonly terminates in pus, and it is very commonly fatal if it is severe—I believe there was some pus in the knee joint internally—that is a common symptom in phlebitis, but not a general one—I believe he had inflammation of the arm, but I had forgotten that when at Bow-street—I cannot say whether his arm was swollen to a most unnatural size—I have no doubt I knew it at the time, but it is a long time ago—it is a very common thing for phlebitis to occur, though the lancet the person is bled with is perfectly clean—I did not bleed him from that arm—there was no inflammation in the arm I bled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you tell how it happened there should be considerable inflam<lb/>mation from bleeding with one arm, and none from the other? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The man's health might have been worse the second time than when I bled him, and then inflammation would be more likely to ensue—a fractured rib is always a dangerous thing, but it generally does well—I suppose there was a connexion between the fractured rib and the inflammation of the pleura—a fractured rib was very likely to produce inflammation—I have had several patients who have died, and from <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examinations I have been satisfied their death arose from inflammation of the lining membrane of the lungs—both that and phlebitis are likely to be mortal—it depends on the strength of the disease—both are dangerous—in my opinion, the deceased certainly did not die of phlebitis—I will not swear phlebitis did not exist, but I was no aware of it.</p>

               <p>the arm and pus under the knee? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will not swear to the swelling of the arm—I did not see that myself—phlebitis is sometimes caused by using a lancet on an inflammatory constitution—a wound in the vein is the usual cause—the man's constitution was bad—he was labouring under disease of the bones, which does not speak well for his constitution, and I believe he was in the habit of drinking—the exostosis appeared to have been formed some time—that is very likely to produce inflammation of the membrane—the circumstances attending his death are rather complicated—I am of opinion he died from inflammation of the lining membrane of the chest, but there are other causes open to its not being so—I cannot say with certainty that the inflammation arose from the fractured rib—there was no appear<lb/>ance of phlebitis—I cannot say how much pus there was under the knee joint, but it is not unusual to find pus in the liver and lungs—the state of the knee joint would be accounted for by suppuration—I should not think the matter in the knee joint would be accounted for by inflammation in the vein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Should you not expect to find the appearance of swelling and sup<lb/>puration in the knee joint in a patient who had been afflicted with phlebi<lb/>tis? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not particularly in the knee joint—I should expect to find if in the joints—I think an injury of the knee would account for the pus—a blow would—he did not complain of any injury from blows—I have no doubt I must have seen his swollen arm, but I was very ill at the time, and a swollen arm is so common a thing in a hospital that I do not remen<lb/>ber it—I am not admitted a licentiate of the Apothecaries' Company, nor yet a member of Surgeon's Hall—I did not say before the Magistrate that I was an apothecary—I believe I was asked if I had received a diploma. and I might have said yes—Mr. Matthias was my colleague at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the College of Surgeons, and am house-surgeon at the Ophthalmic Institution, in King William-street. In May last, I was one of the house-surgeons at Charing-cross hospital—I was present at a portion of the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of Crowl—at the time I came in the fractured rib had been removed, and the knee-joint opened—I looked at it, and there was some pus in it, which induced me to suspect phlebitis—bleeding would no doubt be likely to produce that—the arm was opened in my presence—I observed that it had been bled—I looked at the vein—it was inflamed and thickened—inflammation of the vein is very frequently followed by matter in the joints—my observation of the vein confirmed my opinion as to the disease in the knee-joint—dis<lb/>ease of the vein is very frequently mortal.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did it appear to you that that had caused death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought so at the time, and think so still—I reminded Mr. Calthorp that he had opened the vein in my presence—I did not observe exostosis—the rib was removed before I arrived.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a nurse at Charing cross hospital. I attended Crowl—he appeared very bad in his health, owing to something the matter with his chest, I believe—he was bled—he got worse afterwards—he com<lb/>plained of his arm being very stiff—I looked at it, and there was a kind of black came along the arm—it extended up the upper arm and down the fore arm—it swelled very much, and I thought he had erysipelas in the arm—I applied poultices and fomentations, and other things to reduce the swelling, but it continued inflamed two or three days—I cannot tell how often he was bled—I believe Mr. Calthorp bled him previous to the arm being swollen.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>at Charing-cross hospital for five years. I have heard the evidence of the medical gentlemen and the nurse—from which, in my judgment, the de<lb/>ceased died from phlebitis.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that from the evidence you have heard of there being secretion of pus in the knee-joint? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not entirely—there is the condition of the vein of the arm, the swelling of the arm, and the unusual circumstance of his dying of a fractured rib—it is agreed by surgeons, that pus in the joints is a consequence of phlebitis; my opinion is, that the pus in the knee-joint was occasioned by bleeding in the arm—I do not consider the pus occasioned death, but it is a symptom of the termination of the disease of phlebitis, or one of the terminations—I should be of opinion that phlebitis existed when pus was only mentioned as existing in the knee-joint, but, at the same time, it would be desirable that other organs should be examined, as pus might be found in them, in the lungs, and so on, but if it was not found, my opinion is still, that the pus in the knee-joint was the consequence of phlebitis—pus in the knee-joint is the consequence of many other disorders.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing phlebitis was occasioned by bleeding in the arm, how long might it take to cause death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There have been cases of forty<lb/>eight hours, sometimes longer—a great deal depends on the state of the constitution—I mean if produced by bleeding in the arm—it runs a rapid course sometimes—I have heard the diseased rib described—I do not say that would not cause the death of a person—I have never known a case of death, in fifty or sixty cases, of fractured rib—I never knew death, but once, which was where it pierced the lung—a fractured rib to a person in an ill state of health, would be more likely to cause death—I have heard that coughing gave him great pain in the left side—that is not a symptom of phlebitis—it is a symptom of a broken rib, and also of pleurisies, and other things as well—I have heard the account Mr. Calthorp has given of the inside of the chest—I have observed as severe appearances without death being caused—I do not think the inflammation described sufficient to cause death—it might be with a person of bad habit of body, but my opinion is, that it would not, certainly, of course it might occasion death—I should think the pus in the knee could not be occasioned by external injury, because the patient would probably have directed the attention of the parties to it—a blow might occasion it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why inflammation of those members might even consume them both? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—then, of course, death would fol<lb/>low—there is not a more artificial injury than a broken rib—my opinion is, he died of phlebitis—a blushing of the arm is characteristic of phlebitis—it occasionally arises without any fault on the part of the medial man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have heard that the cones were found in apposition to each other—in general, where a fractured rib occasions inflammation, is it not the case that the rib penetrates the pleura? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and causes death.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my mother in Bell-court, just opposite the prosecutor's. I remember the night of the 27th of July—the first I saw was Beckwith, I believe—he was putting the prosecutor's arm out—I heard Mr. Meredith say, "For God's sake let the door go, let my fingers go," and I saw that his fingers were confined in with the door—the door was opened, and he was pushed out—I saw his hand drop down, and it was all blood—he said, "They are going to murder me," he ran round, and took down one of his shutters in his little flap-door, and got in—he called, "Murder" twice, and I saw him go into the parlour, and take a chair, and set it between the parlour and the shop—I did not hear Beckwith say any thing then—they were quiet for some time, and then Beckwith came to the door, and asked a man to go and fetch Roper, who came, and Beckwith said to him, "Roper, I want you, drink"—they drank together, and went into the parlour—they were there for some time—about eleven o'clock, I saw Roper and Beckwith dragging out Mr. Mere<lb/>dish—Roper had hold of his two shoulders, and Beckwith had hold of his feet—they brought him out quite insensible—there was a high step at the door—Beckwith never came off the step, but he dropped Mr. Meredith's feet at the time that Roper dropped his shoulders—I said to Roper, It is very cruel of you"—he said, "What is that to you? go about your business"—Mr. Foreman came up, and gave them into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tallow-chandler, and live at Walthamstow. On the 28th of September as I was going to bed I heard a noise in the street, and thought I heard a cry of murder—I opened my window, and beard the cry repeated—I went into the street and saw a great number of people, about twenty, a great many of them using violent language—I saw Frederick Hagger beating Lawrence on his head on the ground with a think walking-stick, and kicking him, and William Hagger was beating Reynolds, who was retreating from the mob to avoid the blow—he bad his cutlass up, but did not use it—I saw Frederick Hagger come to assist his brother, who was beating Reynolds—they both beat him violently—Reynolds got over a little fence, and I went to his assistance—Reynolds's wife was clinging round William Hagger, begging him not to murder her hus<lb/>band—Reynolds got out of the yard, and they struck him again—I ran up and pot my hand on William Hagger—I said, "For God's sake, what do you mean to murder this poor man? I will not allow it"—I assisted them home, and sent to the station-house—they appeared very much hurt, and Reynolds was covered with blood.</p>

On Sunday evening, the 29th of September, I was on duty in New King-street, Deptford—shortly before six o'clock Mrs. Hubble spoke to me—I refused to go into the house, and went up the street—when I was some distance from her house I heard a shouting noise—it sounded behind me, towards the Dock-yard gates—I went towards the place, and saw the prisoner John Pine wrestling with a man named Carey, opposite the Dock-yard gate, near the Navy Arms—there were several other persons there, but none connected with the disturbance—I went and asked them to go home—I addressed both of them—John Pine said he would see me d----first—I said if they did not go home I should be under the necessity of taking them to the station-house—they then commenced wrestling again, and shouting, and creating a great disturbance—Carey and Pine shouted—I did not hear any body else—they went on wrestling along the New-row—as they went along the number of people increased very much—when they got to Mr. Ody's railing there were about a hundred persons present—I went and asked them to go away quietly; if they would not I must take them to the station-house, but if they would I would not interfere with them—John Pine immediately struck me on the eye, and knocked off my hat—I immediately collared him—I said nothing to him when I did so—I had collared him about five minutes, when the deceased William Aldridge came to my assistance—during that five minutes I was attempting to get John Pine towards the station-house—I did not draw my staff at that time—Aldridge and myself both drew our staves together when he came to my assistance—John Pine was very violent, and trying to getaway from us—the persons round were very violent against me, trying to rescue the prisoner from roe, and struck John Pine twice on the arm with my staff—I did it in my own protection, in consequence of his violence towards me—he was striking and kicking me—I saw a man named Carey pull a rail off Mr. Ody's fence—Aldridge and I still continued to endeavour to get Pine towards the station-house—we got him as far as the toll-gate—the mob was increasing very rapid, and when we got to the toll-gate they were very violent indeed, throwing stones, and striking both me and Aldridge—at that time Buckmaster, another</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the evening of the 29th of September I went toward, the toll-house at Deptford—I found John Pine in custody of three officer.—a great number of persons were assem-bled-they were making a great disturbance, and calling out. Go it—they were grounding the prisoner, and attempting to rescue him—I went toward. John Pine, and heard him say, "There is another to b—coming, if I had my knife I would stick him"—the mob were throwing stone, at the time at Aldridge and the other Policemen—I got several blows. from stones one on the back of my head, and several besides—as we were going toward, the Telegraph public-house, John Pine struck Al<lb/>dridge on the back part of the head with his fist—he was very obstinate and resolute, wanting to get away from us—opposite the Telegraph public-house I saw Burke throw a stone, which truck Aldridge on the back of the head—he threw it at him, and said, "There, you b----, how do you like that?"—I should say he was not more than a yard and a half from him at the time—Aldridge went on a short distance after that—after Burke struck him I heard another stone strike him on the head, and he said, Oh, my poor heard—he went on the left-hand aide of the road, and I saw no more of him—I had seen Burke kick Aldridge three or four tune, on the back at the toll house, and I saw William Pine strike him on the back of the head with his. fist, at the Telegraph public-house, before I heard the blow-Aldridge had no hat on when the stone struck him.</p>

I was oiled to see Aldridge at Mrs. Richardson's house on the 29th of September, between six and seven o'clock at night—at that time he was lying on the carpet down stairs—he complained of great pain behind the ear, and was bleeding slightly from the wound, which was about two inches behind the right ear—I dressed the wound, and he became faint—I gave him some brandy and water—I asked him whether he would go to the hospital—he said he would rather go home—he was taken home, which was about two miles or two miles and a half, on a stretcher—I saw him again at his own house at half-past three o'clock in the morning—he was sinking—he died about an hour and a half after I left him—I examined the body after death with two other surgeons, and I am of opinion that his death was caused by fracture of the internal plate of the skull—I opened the head—there was about three quarters of a pound of extravasated blood between the skull and the Duran mater-—I attribute his death to external jury from a blow—I think such a blow as would be inflicted by a stone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer and cheesemonger, and live in Trafalgar-road, Greenwich. On the evening of Monday, the 16th of September, I had about a dozen cheeses in my window—I missed one the text morning—this is a part of it—it had a mark of "R," which is still on it—on Wednesday the 18th, the policeman called to say he had got some cheese, and on the 19th, I saw it at the Magistrate's office, on the table—I examined it, but I did not see any mark on it, but I had not time to examine it fully—next day I examined it, and discovered the "R"—it was the same sort of cheese as this, and here is the "R" branded on it with an iron—I am able to swear this is the cheese I lost on the 16th.</p>

It laid on the table—I did not torn it over and over—I did not say if it was mine the mark had been cut off it—I had no doubt it was mine—I was not sure what mark was on it, and the next day I sent a cheese up to the Magistrate to compare it with the mark.</p>

               <p>then closed on him, and struck him with the rattle on the head—he then called to his companions for assistance—they closed round me—one of them struck me—I cannot say whether the third struck me or not—No. 113 came up to my assistance, and then the men were making away—the prisoner was afterwards brought to me by No. 113—I lost a great deal of blood—I went to Guy's Hospital, and got my head dressed—they wanted me to stop there, but I preferred going home, and next morning Dr. Od<lb/>ling, of the police force, attended me—I have been very ill since, and unable to do my duty.</p>

I attend the M division of police—I was sent for on Saturday morning to Union Hall, and examined the prosecutor's head—he had two severe wounds, one on the forehead, and one on the upper part of the left side of the head—I did what was necessary for him—the wounds produced a good deal of fever, symptoms of pain all over, and headache—they were serious wounds, but I did not apprehend danger from them—they might be very dangerous from an instrument of that kind—it must have been a heavy iron instrument—I think this poker was very likely to produce such a wound.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Cook's-buildings, Haswell-place, Old Kent-road, in a house by myself. On the 20th of October, a little after seven o'clock in the evening, I was sitting in my parlour—a knock came to the door—I went with a candle to the door, unbolted it, and opened it—three men rushed in before the door was quite opened, and knocked the candle and candlestick out of my hand—I had no light then, and do not know whether they shut the door after them or not—the man who came in first immediately threw me backwards on the end of the sofa. which was just inside the parlour-door, and my head went through a square of glass in a window at the back—it made a great rattle—I screamed "Murder," three times, and said, "For God's sake don't murder me; if it is money you want I have that for you"—the man immediately put his hand on my face, and forced three of his fingers into my mouth—his hand was as rough as a brick, and his fingers stopped my breath—one of them was a youth—I cannot speak to their persons, as I was in the dark, but a glance of light came from the fen-light, and the one I had the most sight of was the one not in custody—the man who stood second, took a bed-pillow off the sofa to prevent my screaming, clapped it over ray face, held it down with his two hands, and at the same time I saw him, by a glance through the fan-light, take a penknife</p>

                  </hi>. I am a comb-maker, and lire in Alford-place, Old Kent-road. About half-past seven o'clock on the evening in question, I was going home, and passed Mrs. Cockburn's house—when I got near the house, I heard a disturbance—I went near the window, and heard a faint scream, and heard Mrs. Cockburn say, "If it is money you want, you shall have it, if you won't murder me"—I heard a square of glass break, and then heard a man say, "Open the door, we will be off"—he repeated that twice—I went nearer the door, and was about three yards from it, when the two prisoners and another came out—the other man went one way, and the two prisoners another—I swear positively they are the two men—they said, "We will <hi rend="italic">cut</hi> it"—I followed them for about a quarter of an hour—then set two men to watch them, went and fetched a policeman, and went up to them, and seized them—they were then in the same street as the prosecu<lb/>trix lives in—I said, "I have caught you, have I?"—they said, "What is the charge?"—I said, "You have been entering Mrs. Cockburn's house"—they said nothing to that—we took them to Mrs. Cockburn's house, and when we got into the house I heard a key drop—I picked it up and gave it to the policeman—it is a skeleton-key—in taking them to the station-house, I saw Jones in the act of trying to get something down his sleeve, and saw him put something over into a garden—I heard it jingle—I went there next morning, and found a crow-bar—I have not the least doubt about the prisoners—I know them perfectly well by their person and dress, as well as their voices—it was a moon-light night, and the gas was lighted.</p>

"I left home last Sunday evening, at a quarter to seven o'clock, to go and see my brother and sister, in Earl-street; but, unfortunately, going down Alford-place, the young man laid hold of my collar, and told the policeman to lay hold of the other young man, who was walking behind, and who I never saw before. He accused me of being in the prosecutrix's house; he likewise says he saw us come out, and followed us a quarter of an hour, and never made any alarm to have persons taken, who he says he suspected were robbers. He lost sight of us ten minutes. If we were guilty persons, is it likely we should be on the same spot twenty minutes? I had never been down the street before that evening."</p>
