               <p>few years, a Mr. Dornbush started a similar publication, which became very extensively patronized in the trade, and the prisoner's list was not so much patronized—Dornbush's list was established about ten years ago—for a certain time I continued to subscribe to both lists; I then discontinued the prisoner's list, and continued to subscribe to Dornbush—I have never had any quarrel or disagreement with the prisoner—in the beginning of Sep<lb/>tember last, I received this letter from the prisoner—it is his writing—these other letters are all his writing—(<hi rend="italic">Letters read</hi>: "10th September, 1867. Pray remember Mrs. Fermi and her six children, and help Mr. Zariff on their behalf. They are regularly baptized Christians, and not Jews, whom it is now the fashion to throw, like dogs, into the Danube." "16th September, 1867. This family will be lost by the poverty inflicted upon it There is no time to lose. I proclaim it in time; it admits of no more indifference. With this I sound the alarm for the second time. You yourself will be my witness. Seven Christians; you understand. Pray run and see Mr. Zariff. Save the Christians."—(Mr. Zariff is a Greek merchant)—"17th September, 1867. Now pray listen to me well. The list must come back to me, according to solemn engagement when Mrs. Fermi went to Falmouth for it; or there must be arbitration, as accepted, before two gentlemen. I have now additional witnesses to testify on oath to my renewed peaceful steps. Call a meeting, even to the temporary neglect of your own affairs; and, I say so advisedly, the ruin produced is without parallel. This is my last word; I have done. Wisdom in time." "23rd September, 1867. To my own additional credit, I will add that the asking people to subscribe again, even if some would, it would only be for a year, and at the end of that I should be in the same plight again. Patchwork, with this prospect of quickly returning calamity in my spoliation, is abhorrent to a man of my age and declining health. Justice alone! I ask and beg all to obtain it for me. I do not profess Judaism; and if I did, I would undertake to show that a Jew is a man, by heaven! for all that. Stir, I implore you, and get me back the position and respect that are due to me." "3rd October, 1867. I saw Mr. Roselli. It is no farcing matter; never in the world there has been a subject more serious. To repeat its substance once more; one of these things must be done: 1st. The morning list to come all to me, as agreed when Mrs. Fermi went to Falmouth; or, 2nd. Arbitration, as accepted, before two gentlemen; or, 3rd. I give up my own list on receiving 14,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., yielding, at five per cent, the 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year 1 cleared; or, 4th. The promoter of my spoliation to buy the other morning list, and give it to me in reparation. So everything has now been said and written, and wisdom in time recommended. Deeds alone, and quickly remain to prove that Justice must prevail, and that there is no Jew to throw into the Danube here, and no Christianity to shelter malefactors either." "21 Oct, 1867.—First steps in the beginning of the end. Mrs. F. is going, mad. At 2 this morning she upset the house, and ran away in her night-clothes. After much search she was found delirious in the garden. She talks of drowning herself and all the children. For the information of our assassins."—"31 Oct—To Mr. Zariff. Mr. Melas spoke to the man hired to assassinate me, and that man insulted him grossly. To-day boiled rice for all. Make the sign of the Cross."—"To Mr. Melas. 31 Oct, '67. So the man insulted grossly even you. To-day boiled rice for all. Make the sign of the cross."—To Mr. Ralli. Nov. 5, '67. In all solemnity save me from my approaching death by a broken heart; get back for me, for my</p>

Mr. Melas will please to send, or see Mr. Ionides, and make the appointment; Mr. Fermi will call in the course of the day for it." Shortly after the receipt of the letter of 31st October, I had business which took me abroad; I think it was about 10th November—(<hi rend="italic">Two other letters from the prisoner, dated 8th November, were also put in and read, describing the illness of his children, and the poverty of his family, and charging it upon the "dastardly malefactors" who recoiled at the ruin they had caused</hi>)—This paper is a pen-and-ink sketch of the neighbourhood of my house—it is in the prisoner's handwriting—it pretty accurately describes the locality of my house, and the streets leading to and from it—there are the names and addresses of a number of Greek merchants written on the other side—that is in the prisoner's writing—about 10th November I had occasion to go abroad—I remained abroad until the beginning of May—soon after my return, I received some other letters in the prisoner's handwriting—this is one—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">th May, to a similar effect, and stating that his earnings had amounted to</hi> 700<hi rend="italic">l. a year, which, capitalized at</hi> 5<hi rend="italic"> per cent., would give</hi> 14, 000<hi rend="italic">l., which he had claimed, and had been refused, instead of which he had only been offered charity, which he detested—he alluded to his own and his family's sufferings, and urged the necessity for immediate help and an appointment</hi>)—Upon the receipt of these letters, I placed myself in communication with my solicitors—I made no appointment—"4th June, 1868. I this day hand this memorandum to Mr. E. O. Ionides, to show round to his Greek friends. My home cannot hold us any longer, and we must leave or be ejected. Where to go it is impossible to foretell. I call attention to the Greeks, that such a state of things would induce any other man to destroy his whole family. With me they are safe; but I bring to the Greek knowledge that my wife—I cannot be responsible for what she may do, especially as I found her one day sitting alone in great gloom, and she told me she was thinking of shutting the children inside a box, and herself sitting over it till they should be smothered to death. They are seven in all, with the mother, all baptized Christians, and still entirely ruined by Christians, who mistook them for Jews."—I wrote this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and directed it to the prisoner—it was returned to me in an envelope, with the prisoner's writing on it—this is the letter:—"19, Old Broad Street, 12 June, '68. Sir, I am surprised that you should continue to annoy me with your letters. You are well aware that you have no species of claim upon me, and you must distinctly understand that under no cir<lb/>cumstances will you obtain any money from me, and if you again trouble me I intend to apply to the police, and cause you to be sent to prison."—This other letter is the prisoner's writing:—"11 June, 1868. To Mr. Melas. Move, and save this family. I propose that the Greeks and their friends would do as enclosed, and Mr. Coventry is ready to lend the Greeks every amount of co-operation. Save the adoration of Jesus, and before I die, let me see their existence securely restored."—The other papers (<hi rend="italic">looking at several</hi>) are also in the prisoner's writing—in one of the letters there ii the expression, "Make the sign of the Cross"—I understand the meaning of that to be, "Prepare for death"—it is an Italian expression—I am a Greek, but I understand Italian very well—that is the acceptation of the term generally among Italians.</p>

I carry on business at 25, Southampton Row, Hol<lb/>born, and am an expert in handwriting—I have made it my study for many years, and I have been constantly examined in Courts of Justice upon the subject—I have compared the signature of Henry Allen in this book with the signatures on the two orders for 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in my opinion they are decidedly not written by the same persons—I have compared them care<lb/>fully, and give that as my decided opinion—I can give my reasons—I have examined the other deposit receipts produced, and I believe those to be the genuine handwriting of Allen—I have not the slightest doubt of it.</p>

               <p>ELZIA PARKINS I am single—I lived with the prisoner as his wife two years, up to July, at 13, Hendon Place, Pimlico—on 3rd August, about 5 o'clock, I went out for a walk by myself—we had had no words—he said, "I will go and seek for work"—he went out before me—I walked towards Battersea Bridge, and when I got over it he came up to me, and said that he was coming to go for a walk with me—I asked him what business he had following me—he said that he was not following me—I still kept walking on, and he kept following me—I went to his brother's house—he followed me there—I was there two or three minutes, and then went to a friend's house in Pimlico—he followed me down into the kitchen—I stayed there two or three minutes, and then went straight home, and he with me—as soon as I got home, I took off my bonnet, struck him in the face, and asked him what he meant by following me—he said that he did not follow me; he came with the intention of going for a walk—I kept hitting him all the time—he held my hands, and slapped me in the face—I said I would get a situation, and go away and leave him—I flipped him in the face with a towel—he said he would not stand it any longer, and struck me in the face—I called out, and the landlord came up—I ran towards him, and felt a knife being put into my back, just below the shoulder blade—the prisoner was then behind me—I had been putting the knives into the box previous to that—I had said, "I will knock your brains out with the tongs"—the tongs were there, but I had not got them—the prisoner followed me down stairs, and said he was very sorry, and wanted to come into the room, but I would not let him—I saw a doctor.</p>

Mr. Nisbet!"—I rushed up stairs—the door was wide open; the table was standing near the bed, and he was holding her down with one hand on the bed, and getting a table knife out of the drawer with the other—he made three or four probes at her back, but only struck her once—she rushed down stairs—he looked very wild—I was afraid of the knife, and</p>

On the morning of 6th July, about 4.20, I was on duty at the corner of Phoenix Street, Somer's Town, and saw the prisoner and another man—I said to the prisoner, "What are you hanging about for at this time in the morning?"—they said, "We are going to the cattle market"—I said, "All right!" and passed on—I passed Mr. Johnson's shop; it was all right then—I re-passed the shop at about 4.50, and found the door open—I called Mr. Johnson up, and looked through the house—the back parlour window had been forced open, and I found this knife and pickaxe on the floor—there were marks outside the window, and a gimlet was put through the bar—the framework of the window was broken, as though it had been forced from the outside.</p>

I immediately sent for the nearest surgeon, and Mr. Morrison came and dressed the wound"—turning round then from me to her husband, she said, "Have I not told Mr. Gee the truth"—about two seconds elapsed, and he faintly said, "Yes"—I said, "Well, Mr. Vanderhalven, this is a very serious matter"—he said, "It was all my fault"—I said, "Do you wish to charge Mrs. Vanderhalven with this"—he said, "No, certainly not, certainly not, it was my own fault"—he died on the following Sunday, and I then took her into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Plaistow Park Road, and am clerk to a soap manufacturers—on 18th July, I was standing on the footpath, about seventy yards from the last witness's house, on the opposite side—I saw three plea<lb/>sure vans, very crowded with passengers, coming down the road, at what I should term a steady pace, when the driver of the last van suddenly urged his horses to the off-side of the road, endeavouring to pass the other two—I saw him pull his horses on one side, and whip them—I did not see the acci<lb/>dent—I went away to my business.</p>

I am a cooper, at Old Brentford, and live between twenty and thirty yards from Hughes, lower down on the same side, towards Hounslow—I was standing at my door, between 10 and 11 o'clock on the morning of the 18th, and saw two vans, one near the gutter on the near side, and the other about the middle of the road; the first one must have passed—all at once there was a cheer, but from which van I don't know—after that, or almost simultaneously, there was a scream from the women, I think, from the second van, but I could not swear to that—I immediately ran to the spot, and saw the deceased lying on his back behind the van, with his feet towards the middle of the road—I believe the hind wheel of the van had passed over his head—he lived about a quarter of an hour afterwards.</p>

I live at Old Brentford, about thirty yards from Hughes, between his house and the deceased's—I was standing at my door, and made a great alarm, because I saw that the deceased was sure to be killed—he had a barrow with him, and was going towards Hounslow—he was in the road, close against the path on the right side, in the gutter—I saw three vans going by very fast, one with four horses, and two with three I saw the horse knock the old man down and trample on him, and the van went over him—I don't know who was the driver.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I am a mason, and live at 13, Dunford Place, Kentish Town—on 18th July, I and a number of other masons hired a van of the prisoner's father, to go to Hampton Court—it was drawn by four horses—the prisoner drove it; I sat by his side, on the left—when we got to Kew Bridge there were two vans in front of us—we kept behind them—just before we got into Brentford, a drum on the van we were following frightened the horses of two market gardeners' carts, which very nearly backed into the side of our van—they were going the same way as us; we were passing them—when the big drum struck up it frightened our horses and threw the leaders out—we had been following close behind the other van for about ten minutes—we had not attempted to pass up to that time—the horses flew out then—there was a man wheeling a barrow on the off side of the road—we halloaed to him, but he took not the slightest notice—the off side horse hit him right in the back, and he was knocked down; and the prisoner in pulling up, which he did with all his main, threw the off side horse down, also the wheeler, and the old man went underneath the van—the prisoner did all he possibly could, he even put his leg over the rein—we were going between six and seven miles an hour—there had been no racing—we had not been ten minutes on the high road—there was a cart behind us—the prisoner did not use his whip at all, it was in the socket; I am sure of that—he did not shake the reins, or urge on the horses—I attribute it entirely to the drum, which made the horses shoot out.</p>

I will serve you the same"—a female named Morris came running across the road at the same time; several parties came round, and the deceased was picked up, and taken to the hospital—the prisoner followed—he said he was very sorry for what he had done, that he would not hurt a hair of his head; they had been great friends for a number of years—he did not say what they fell out about—the prisoner seemed to be middling sober—he did not seem to be any the worse for liquor—he might have had some<lb/>thing to drink for what I know.</p>

I am a labourer, of Yarwell, in Northampton—on 11th July, I was at Hammersmith, where I had been working about three years—I went into the Hand and Flower, about 11 o'clock, and saw the prisoner there—I had not known him before—Kirkley and Smith were also there—Kirkley was jeering at the prisoner all the while they were in the public-house—Kirkley and Smith went out, and the prisoner came round to where I was, and took off his chain, and put it out of sight: he then went out, and I followed—I saw Smith, Kirkley and Stacey standing close to the door, all together—the prisoner fastened up his coat and crossed the road, walking very fast, and the three men followed him—Kirkley said to Smith and Stacey, "Come on, hold my coat, and I will <hi rend="italic">wop</hi> the b——toper," or something of that sort—I did not see them stop under the trees at all—I kept sight of them all the way—the prisoner started to run away, and the three men ran after him and, when he got near some shops, they surrounded</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 11, Artillery Passage, and carry on the business of an eating-house keeper—the deceased, Emma Grossmith, was my wife—she was forty-five years of age—the prisoner was in my service for about five months, to do anything that would be required to be done in the kitchen—we used to call him John; my wife called him John—his proper name is Alexander Arthur Mackay—we had no other servant at this time—on Friday, 8th May, I left home at 9.10 in the morning—I left no one at home but Mrs. Grossmith and the prisoner—he was cleaning the shop window when I went out—my son had gone on an errand, I believe, and came home after I went out—I did not notice that he was at home when I left—on the Wednesday before this there was a conversation be<lb/>tween the prisoner and me about some potatoes that he spoiled—my wife found it out first—he used to hide the potatoes, and spoil the rest—I can't say whether my wife said anything to him about it in my presence—I spoke to him about it; I could not say on what day it was—I don't remember my wife saying anything to him about it—on the morning of the 8th he threatened the children; Mrs. Grossmith came and told me so; I did not hear him—I was absent forty minutes that morning—it was 9.50 when I came in—I found Mr. Lubbock, Dr. Jackson, and Mrs. Sandiford in the house, attend<lb/>ing upon my wife—they would not allow me to see her then—I saw her about an hour afterwards—she had then been put to bed—I could not describe the state in which she was, it was so fearful—I could not recognize her at all, not a feature—three days afterwards, I think on the Monday, she made a statement to me—she was very sensible then—she died on the 17th; that would be the following Sunday—she told me at the time that she should never get over it—she first asked me what I thought of her—I said, "I think it is dreadful"—she said, "Do you think I shall ever get better?"—I said, "I hope so," and she said, "I never shall"—I made no answer to that—she said almost directly after, "I shall die, I shall die, the pain is so great;" and also a hundred times, I should think, during the time she lived—her words on the Monday were, "I shall die through the pain at the back of my head."</p>

I am a Fellow of the College of Surgeons, and live at 30, Church Street, Spitalfields—on Friday morning, 8th May, I was sent for to Mr. Grossmith's—I got there about 9.45—I went through the shop into the kitchen—I found the deceased lying on the floor, covered with blood—I did not examine her minutely then—I felt her pulse: at least I could not feel any pulse—she appeared to be dying—I waited till she rallied a little, and then had her moved up stairs—before she was moved I saw on the floor a rolling-pin, an iron bar, and some broken crockery—they were covered with blood, and the room generally was covered with</p>

               <p>blood—the blood had spurted I should say from six to eight feet, very nearly to the ceiling, on the walls—I continued to attend her until her death—at the time I first saw her I thought the probabilities were that she would not live from minute to minute. till the afternoon; she then recovered her consciousness—she retained her intellects afterwards perfectly, with the exception of the Tuesday evening; she then had a little delirium, and on the day of the accident she wandered in her mind—with that exception she retained her intellect till the time of her death—when I visited her on the Tuesday evening, she made some incoherent remarks to me—I can hardly say how long she wandered, she did not answer my questions intelligibly while I was examining her—on the day of the accident I think I saw her six or seven times, besides stopping with her several hours; and subsequently I saw her two or three times a day—on one day I may have seen her only once, I can't say what day that was—about the middle of the week follow<lb/>ing the injury I thought there was a chance of her recovery, I think about the Wednesday or Thursday, but she then began to sink—she died on the 17th, about 6 o'clock in the evening—I afterwards made a post-mortem examination—I have my notes of it here—the nose was divided by a con<lb/>tused wound at the junction of the middle with the lower part; the upper lip was divided from the left nostril into the mouth; there were two con<lb/>tused wounds on the left side of the upper lip, about an inch long; part of the left ear was cut off; the cheeks and eyelids bruised; the right cheek bone, the bones of the nose, and of the upper jaw fractured; on the forehead was a wound laying bare the bone over a triangular space which measured three inches vertically and four inches transversely; the periostum, the membrane that covers the bone, was torn off from the bone at the upper part; there was a transverse wound about an inch long above the left brow; on the head, on the left side, there was one wound two inches long, and two wounds one inch long; a little further, but on the right side of the head, was a wound laying bare the skull to the extent of seven inches from before backwards, and five inches transversely; the periostum was torn off in three places at that wound; the scalp on that side of the head (the left) was so contused as to be in the condition of a pulp; the neck was bruised on both sides; the right arm had bruises on the back of the elbow; there was a superficial wound on the left forearm about two and a half inches long, small superficial wounds on the left forearm and hand, and bruises and a wound on the left elbow; there were bruises on the back of the trunk and legs, but no bruises on the chest or abdomen; there was no fracture of the skull—that was the superficial examination—this was afterwards—"No effusion of blood into the interior of the skull, and no laceration of the brain—the organs in the chest and abdomen were healthy"—She must have received a great many bruises—I found sixteen wounds in all, some of them were very slight—the nasal bones are easily broken, but to fracture the upper jaw bone great violence must have been used—she died from the injuries which she had sustained—I have seen the rolling-pin and the iron bar—in my judgment those instruments would have boon quite sufficient to inflict the wounds I saw—a chopper was shown me, it was an ordinary kitchen chopper—I think that had not been used—there were merely a few spots of blood upon it, nothing on the edge—the rolling-pin had a quantity of blood and hair upon it, and the iron bar also—I was shown a waistcoat in the kitchen, on the morning when I first went there, I think it was hanging up, as far as I remember—I did not pay much attention to those</p>

I am professor of chemistry, at the London Hospital—on 27th May the inspector brought me the iron bar, rolling-pin, chopper, and waistcoat produced—I have examined them all—this hair is long hair, like a woman's—some of the hairs appear to have been torn out by the roots; but, as to the greater part, it appears to be cut through—there is blood on it, and it is blood which has coagulated there, therefore it must have been living blood when it was on the hair—this iron bar is about three feet eight inches long—I find hair upon that, the same kind of hair as the other, human hair—there are marks of blood on the iron, not to a very large extent—there is a patch of coagulated blood—the chopper has only a few spots of blood upon it—the rolling-pin has a good deal of blood on it, chiefly at one end and on one side—there is a good deal of coagulated blood on the waistcoat inside, and on the back inside; as far as I can make out there is not any blood on the outside—here are some pieces of broken comb.</p>

I am miller and warder at the county gaol at Maid<lb/>stone—the prisoner was brought there on 28th June—he was going by the name of George Jackson—about five weeks after he had been there, I went and asked him his name (I had seen a photograph)—he said his name was George Jackson, from Greenwich—I asked if he had ever gone in any other name—he said, "No"—I did not say any more to him them; but, in conse<lb/>quence of my suspicions, I had him up before the governor, and he was afterwards sent up to London—I spoke to him in consequence of having seen a photograph of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>said before my marriage and after; that he had seen me very lately, and she would introduce me to him in a few days, next time I called—she said he was a very good man, and a rich man—nothing, at that time, was said about marriage—I saw her in two or three days afterwards, in the small sitting-room, and she said, "I will now introduce you to the man who loves you"—she opened the door, and said, "Lord Ranelagh"—her daughter was there, as was also Madame Valeria, a Russian woman—I said to him, "Are you Lord Ranelagh?"—he replied, "Yes, and here is my card"—he handed me the card; I looked at it and returned it to him—the gentleman I then saw was the same I recognize in Court as Lord Ranelagh—after he had given me his card, Madame Rachel closed the door again—on my returning to her room, she said he would make me a good husband—on several occasions I saw him there, and once to speak to—at the second interview Madame Rachel told me to go and take a bath, and return to her—I went to Mrs. Hicks's, Davies Street, took a bath, returned to the shop, and found Lord Ranelagh was there—she said, "I must again introduce you to Lord Ranelagh"—he made a bow to me—I forget the conversation; it was not much—she again said he would make me a good husband, and asked me if I would like to have him for a husband—I thought, as he was a good man and a rich man, and being in a good posi<lb/>tion, it would be a good thing for my daughter—she will be eighteen in October—the prisoner said he fancied me; she very often told me that—about the end of May, or the beginning of June, she said it was necessary that I should be made beautiful for ever, before I married Lord Ranelagh; for if I was not, it would only be money thrown away, and I should be sent into the country, where I should never be seen—I think she said he also wished it, but I cannot be sure about that—I was to pay 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for being made beautiful for ever—at that time I had money in the Funds—I have since known Mr. Haynes, a solicitor—the prisoner introduced me to him in June, after the conversation about being made beautiful for ever—Mr. Haynes and Madame Rachel accompanied me to the City in a carriage—she said he was a solicitor, but did not say at that time he was her solicitor—I went to the City to sell out the money I had in the Funds, amounting to 1300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I sold for 963<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—money was very scarce, and many banks had failed at that time, and I lost by selling out—when I came from the City I went to Madame Rachel's sitting-room with Mr. Haynes—I told him I was sorry I had sold out the money—the 963<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was net handed over to me; I never had any of it—I gave this order to him—it is not my handwriting, but it is signed by me—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "June, 1866. Mr. Haynes, I request you to pay Madame Rachel 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on account of 963<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received this day. M. T. Borradaile.")—That was given to Mr. Haynes at her shop, in her presence—the receipt produced is in my writing—it was written in Mr. Haynes's office, but I don't know when—Madame Rachel was there, too, and made the mark at the bottom—he was sitting in such a position as to see it written—Madame Rachel told me how to word it, because I did not know what was to be done—I think Mr. Haynes supplied the stamp—(<hi rend="italic">This was a receipt for</hi> 800<hi rend="italic">l., a balance of</hi> 1000<hi rend="italic">l. received from witness, for bath preparations, soaps, powders, sponges, perfumes, and attendance, to be continued till Mrs. Borradaile was finished by the process</hi>.)—I had received no considera<lb/>tion whatever for that 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., beyond what I had previously paid for in 1864 and 1865—Madame Rachel said we were to be married by proxy—she said it was to be done by letter writing; that she had married two parties before</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186808170072"/>
               <p>by proxy, and that I should be the third—about a month after that receipt was signed I began to receive letters—I received some of them before the jewellery was ordered, which was to cost 1400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Madame Rachel said the letters would only be signed "William," in case they should be left about—I knew at that time what Lord Ranelagh's Christian name was; it is Thomas—I received this letter from Madame Rachel, who said it had come from Lord Ranelagh, and she gave me a vinaigrette and a pencil-case, stating they had belonged to Lord Ranelagh's mother: "Mount-street. My only dearly beloved Mary, The little perfume-box and pencil-case belonged to my sainted mother, she died with them in her hand. When she was a school-girl it was my father's first gift to her. Granny has given the watch and locket to me again. Your coronet is finished, my love. Granny said you had answered my last letter, but you had forgotten to send it. I forgot yesterday was Ash Wednesday. Let old Granny arrange the time, as we have too little to spare. My adored one, what is the matter with the old woman; she seems out of sorts? We must keep her in good temper for our own lakes. She has to manage all for us, and I should not have had the joy of your love had it not been for her, darling love. Mary, my sweet one, all will be well in a few hours. The despatches have arrived. I will let you know all when I hear from my heart's life. Bear up, my fond one, and I shall be at your feet, those pretty feet that I love, and you may kick your old donkey. Two letters, naughty little pet, and you have not an<lb/>swered one. You are in sorrow about your brother. With fond and devoted love, yours till death, William."—Madame Rachel was "Granny"—I also received this letter from Madame Rachel's grand-daughter in her pre<lb/>sence—<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "My own dear Mary. Granny tells me that you were to be with me at the Scotch Stores this afternoon. I waited outside 7, George Street for two hours. I give you one warning; if you listen to your family, I will leave England for ever. Mary, my love, I have to play a double game to save your honour and my own. It is now 6 o'clock, and I am wet through, walking up and down George Street I have been asked all manner of questions. You must write and tell Lewis &amp; Lewis you do not want them to interfere further in your affairs, as we are betrayed; and think of your position and name, and think of your daughter. Cope is at the bottom of all this. Mary, for the last time, choose between your family and me. If you value your own life or mine do not admit Smith; he is the paramour of your greatest enemy. My heart's life, I will be at All Souls' to<lb/>morrow. I was at Randall's on Saturday last—a dirty corncutter's. If ever you go there again I shall sense to love you if I can. If I call on you with a gentleman be sure to deny all knowledge of me, as otherwise we are lost. It is your name I study. With fond undying love, your devoted, William" I received one letter after that—my family had been communicated with, and I had consulted Messers. Lewis &amp; Lewis—that letter was received after I had parted with all my money and securities—Mr. Randall is mentioned in it; he is a chiropodist, I had called on him one day—he advised me to go to Lewis &amp; Lewis—almost all the letters were in a different hand writing—every letter I received I supposed came from Lord Ranelagh—Madame Rachel told me he had hurt his arm and could not write very well, and that Stephens, his servant, wrote some of them—I also received this letter from Madame Rachel—"My own Mary, I will be with you to-morrow as soon as possible. Yours until death. Edward. In haste. My dearest beloved, write me a line (kisses)."—I remarked to her that one of the letters</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186808170073"/>
               <p>was signed "Edward," and she replied that was necessary, lest I should lose or leave them about—this letter I received in August, before parting with the 1400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—"Mount Street. My darling Mary, my own pet, do what I ask. I wish you to burn the letters; and all you do is I dare say for the best. My darling pet love, many thanks. I know you will keep your promise. My sweet love, I will devote my love and all my life to you. I cannot express my love to you. I cannot find words to do so. My devotion in years shall tell my heart's fond love for you. Darling sweet one, I will tell you all at your feet. My own loved Mary, with fond devotion, ever yours, with lots of kisses. William." On the envelope "With love and kisses"—I wrote answers to the letters, which answers Madame Rachel always dictated in her sitting-room—she always kept the letters, saying she would give them to Lord Ranelagh—this is another letter: "My dearly beloved Mary, I was in hopes I should have had the pleasure of seeing you this day, but I am doomed to disappointment. I hear you are grieving, my own darling pet. Am I the cause? I would rather be shot than cause you one minute's pain. Do you regret the confidence you have placed in me! You say you have no desire to reside at Cheltenham again, my love. You make what arrangements you think proper, and I am satisfied. I thank you, my love, for going to Covent Garden, Let me know by return, my pet, when you have finished with Mr. Haynes, as I find it impossible to wait any longer. Hope deferred makes the heart sick. I hear all is arranged for the country, my own darling love. Do not let me have to chide you. Only say what you require, and your slightest wish shall be obeyed. With fond devoting love, you affectionate and loving William.—I re<lb/>marked that the spelling of the letters was bad, and she said that his servant used to write them—it must have been in July, August, and Sep<lb/>tember that those letters were written—Madame Rachel had told, me on one occasion that Lord Ranelagh was going to Belgium with the Volunteers—I received this letter from Madame Rachel: "Mount Street My darling Mary, what made you suppose that I would go to Belgium without you? It is cruel of you to think so. But after our disappointment of yesterday I was in hopes that you would have complied with my wishes. I have left the message with Rachel. She told me last night that she ex<lb/>pected you there for true to-day. I have called there twice and I find you have not been. You said you would come after church. My own darling I did not go to church this morning, as you know what prevented me from doing so. You must see Rachel to-night, as I may be ordered off by five in the morning. Pray, sweet love, call on her at once. I had rather be shot like a dog than leave England without you. I am half distracted at not finding you. There is no time to lose. Your devoted and loving friend for ever, William"—I also received this from the same source: "My own beloved Mary, Do not upbraid me. Any sacrifice you have made on my account I will not give you cause to regret I am, dunned to death at the thought of 'the bills,' and it all lies under a nutshell. I will show my love for you in such a way that you shall not regret all you have done for me, and I will repay it with love and devotion. See that fellow in Oxford-street, and tell him you will pay him in a day or two, and so you will. I am not angry with you, my own dear love. I will be with you sooner than you think. Your slightest wish shall be obeyed, but I cannot understand why you prefer Mr. H. but I leave all to you. My love, do not get into any mob. I heard you were insulted by a cabman in Oxford Street. I wish I</p>

               <p>had been there. With my fondest love, your devoted and loving William"—That letter was not so early in the correspondence as the others—Madame Rachel told me that a cabman had been rude to me in Oxford Street, but I do not recollect it—Lord Ranelagh's name was mentioned about the cab<lb/>man—I also received this letter: "Birdcage Walk. My own dear love. My sweet darling Mary, I called at Rachel's to-day, and she looks as black as thunder. What is it, my sweet love? My own dear one. What you said last night I thought was in joke; is it the bill that has annoyed you? What am I to do? I tell you again and again that you are the only woman I love. You have never been the same to me since you listened to all the slander. What is it you want? Write at once and freely. There should be no disguise, my sweet pet. I love you madly—fondly. Why do you trifle with my feelings, cruel one? Yours ever loving, and most devoted and ever affectionate, William. What have you done to offend Rachel I—That was written about the same time the Volunteers were in Belgium—I think it was a few days before they returned—she would never give me any explanation about the bill—I have seen a man named Bower at her shop; she ordered 380<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of lace of him—she said I should require lace, as all ladies had lace—I have since paid Bower's bill for the lace, but I never saw it—Madame Rachel had it; it was sent to her house—she never told me how much it was—I thought it was about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have since been sued for it, and was arrested and went to prison—I have paid for it, but I never had a yard of it—this letter also came from Madame Rachel: "Mary, my heart's life, is it your wish to drive me mad? Granny has my instruc<lb/>tions; do as she tells you. Four letters, and not one reply; what is the meaning of the delay at the eleventh hour? Granny lent me the money. You shall pay her, my own sweet one. Get the lace to-day. I fear nothing. It will be 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I will explain all to your satisfaction, my own sweet one. I have the acknowledgments for every farthing. Granny is our best friend, go you will find. We cannot do without her until we go away. I have some pretty little things for Florence. Light of my heart, your sister and her husband have behaved very badly towards you, if you knew all. I tell you, love, if you are not careful they will divide us for ever. Go to the Strand to-day. Leave all to me, my own love, and fear nothing. If you have lost all love and confidence in your ugly old donkey, tell me; but this suspense is terrible. I receive letters every day telling me that you only laugh at and show my letters. Mary, beloved one of my heart, do not trifle with me. I love once—I love for ever. Leave all to me. I guard your honour with my life. With fond and devoted love, I am your devoted, William. No. 109, Mount Street"—My daughter's Christian name is Florence—I did not go to the Strand; Madame Rachel asked me to go to many places, but I never went and I did not see Lord Ranelagh there—I think that letter was written about July—I received this letter, having the coronet and Lord Ranelagh's cypher, at the end of January or the beginning of February last year—there was another with a coronet or coat of arms, Madame Rachel took that from me one day, and would not return it—<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "My own dar<lb/>ling Mary, Why do you not do as Granny tells you? Why do you put obstacles in the way of your own happiness? Sign the paper; I will pay everything, my own darling love. If you marry, your pension will be stop<lb/>ped; therefore it will not matter if you sign the paper, my own heart's life. I will pay everything. Not the value of a coin shall be touched belonging to you or yours. You have ever been loving and confiding. Why do you</p>

               <p>doubt my honour and sincerity? What motive can you have, my love, for retaining those miserable scrawls of mine? I requested you to return them, and for the first time you refused to do so. Mary, love, if you have sent them to your family, say so. If you wanted my life I would lay it down at your own beautiful little feet Mary, you are my joy. I place your letters with your likeness in my bosom every night Granny told me she would arrange everything to our satisfaction. Why need you fear, my own sweet love? I will not believe that you expose my letters. Darling, say you do not, with your own pretty mouth. This week will settle all. Yours de<lb/>votedly, William"—I also received this: "My darling Mary, I was ordered off at eleven o'clock last night, but I would not, nor could not, go without you, my love. I would rather resign than leave without you, my love. Granny promised me the trial trip last week; can you possibly arrange it for one night this week, my own sweet love t Mary, darling, my health is giving way under this dreadful suspense. I have offered the money three times over, and they refuse to take it. Granny will see to this, and we can pay her when all is settled. What you have done for me I will double with love and devotion. Get the lace from the Strand; you cannot possibly do without it Granny has behaved very well with regard to money affairs, and she loves you as though you were her own child. The old fox is very clever, and will laugh at the Welshman. If you do not be careful and be guided by me, love's labour is lost. The expenses will be 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I am working day and night to save every shilling for you, my heart's life. Be sure to get the lace. Stephens has got the P.O.O. Have you done with my three letters? With fond and devoted love, I am your devoted, William."—I received that at the beginning of 1807—that means to get the lace out of pawn—Madame Rachel told me that it was pawned—I do not remember whether she said that she had pawned it—I always understood that it was pawned for Lord Ranelagh; Madame Rachel told me so, and she asked me to go to the Strand, and take it out for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she told me that he had 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of mine, and the expenses would make up the remainder—I asked her what "the expenses" meant, but I never could get anything out of her, or any explanation—this letter is one of the early ones: "Mount Street. My darling Mary, One would suppose that all the people in your house were dead. I was at your door at 4.45, and we could not make anyone hear. My darling, my sweet love, I was more grieved than you were. Will you keep up your spirits? I have been very much fagged, but I leave every<lb/>thing to you till to-morrow evening, or Wednesday morning. Did Rachel tell you of the scene to-day? She is an old fox; but you quite understand each other. My own sweet love, I am worried to death about money mat<lb/>ters; but it will be all settled before we leave town. With my fondest love, and many kisses. Not one line from you to-day. You must quiet Rachel a little. I think the little lady has been talking to her to-day. I have no wish to offend her, sweet love. I am ever yours, William."—Madame Rachel told me that the little lady was the Duchess of Manchester. I do not like to tell you what she said—these are the envelopes—they all came by hand, and the only one which was dated is not here—I never received any letter by post purporting to come from Lord Ranelagh—Ma<lb/>dame Rachel gave me the rest, and once her granddaughter gave me one—I received many more, but Madame Rachel always took them away from me—at the end of July, or beginning of August, she said it was necessary I should have diamonds, as I was to marry Lord Ranelagh—she said the</p>

               <p>would send for Mr. Pike, a jeweller in New Bond Street—he was sent for, and he brought the diamonds into Madame Rachel's sitting-room—there was a coronet and a necklace—Madame Rachel told him what was required, and I ordered them—she put them round my head, and asked me how I liked them—Mr. Pike said the price was to be 1200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 1260<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I am not sure—I had not at that time 1260<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I had some property at Streatham—I afterwards went with Madame Rachel to Mr. Haynes's again—that was about the end of July or the beginning of August—I went there to sell my property at Streatham to pay for the diamonds—I saw Mr. Haynes from time to time, and negociated with him for the sale of this property, but always with Madame Rachel—the property sold for 1540<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had given Mr. Haynes an order to pay for the diamonds; and Madame Rachel knew I had written it—I wrote it in her presence—everything I wrote was in her presence, but she always insisted on my directing from my own house—I handed it to Mr. Haynes—I do not know whether she was present—<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "My dear Mr. Haynes, Will you kindly pay to Madame Rachel 1400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on my account? M. T. Borradaile."—After the property was sold Madame Rachel said I should have Lord Ranelagh's mother's diamonds, and she showed me an old-fashioned coronet, which she said should be altered—she said Lord Ranelagh would not allow me to have those ordered from Mr. Pike, but did not say why—I paid 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. forfeit to Mr. Pike for not taking them—I asked what had become of the money I had given for the diamonds, but received no satisfactory answer—some time after that Madame Rachel asked me if I would authorise her to give it to Captain William Edwards, whom I understood to be Lord Ranelagh—that was the name he always went by between us—she said he wanted it for the Volun<lb/>teers—she told me that the man adored me, and worshipped the very ground I stood upon, and I authorised her to let him have it—I had given her 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time, which she always said was for Lord Ranelagh, for the Volunteers—on one occasion she sent a servant to me, and I gave her 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Madame Rachel having said on the evening before that it was for Lord Ranelagh—in the course of the day I told Madame Rachel that the servant had had the money—she wanted more, but I could not afford to give it her.

I told her I could not afford to give him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was induced to do it from the belief that it was for Lord Ranelagh—Madame Rachel told me she would get the trousseau for my marriage with him—I ordered clothes and lace and jewellery, and the linendraper (Proctor) sent all the articles to Madame Rachel's shop—I have never had one of them, though I paid 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—she told me some of them would be sent to Folkstone, and some to London, and his servant would call for them—I have often asked for the goods, but have never been able to get them—I have also frequently asked her to return my money—she always replied that I must ask my dear William for it—I had some plate—I took it to Madame Rachel's in a cab, but I walked—it was for the Volunteers; at least, Madame Rachel said so—she had asked me what plate I had, and where it was—I said that a greater part of it was at Cheltenham, where I had been staying for a year—she said I must send for it, and when it arrived she said I had better send it to her—I was induced to send it for one reason, which was, as she said, that we had better have everything together, as we were going to be married—she had some rings of mine—</p>

WILLIAMS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever, in fact, received the bond back from Madame Rachel since you gave it to her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I have never seen it since—I understand nothing about business; Madame Rachel said she would do my business for me—the bond was for 1600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she said that she had handed all my money over to Lord Ranelagh, and she wanted the 1600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for what she was going to do for me, make me beautiful for ever, for one thing—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a letter written by me to Mr. Haynes when I was his client, but Mr. Cridland was my attorney at that time—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 7, <hi rend="italic">George Street, Hanover Square</hi>, 9<hi rend="italic">th February</hi>, 1867, <hi rend="italic">from the witness to Mr. Haynes, and said</hi>, "When I called on you yesterday, I forgot to tell you that the bonds, bills, and I O U's I gave Madame Rachel have been cancelled therefore I will not trouble you further about them." "I skill be obliged if you can sell the reversion.")—The first thing I was arrested for was the lace; that was in 1866—I was arrested four times—I was arrested on this bond in December, 1867—the prisoner came to see me in prison, and was there a whole day—while I was in prison I executed another document with the view of getting out, and that I did at Madame Rachel's suggestion—she said that as I was going to be married it did not matter, and that I should lose my pension through being married—I saw, in prison, a lawyer or lawyer's clerk—I do not think I heard his name—one gentle<lb/>man used to have something to do with Madame Rachel; and very late one evening a gentleman came, and I executed a document, on which I was released from prison—(<hi rend="italic">This was a warrant of attorney to secure the payment of</hi> 1600., <hi rend="italic">dated</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">th December</hi>, 1867.)—While Madame Rachel was under</p>

               <p>remand on this charge, I was again arrested on her suit for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but after<lb/>wards released—I have a cousin, Colonel William Edwardes—I never once corresponded with him in 1866 or 1867, nor saw him for three or four years—I wrote in answer to those letters, but every answer was dictated to me by Madame Rachel—I often asked her what they meant, and she said that I must trust to her, and place confidence in her, and I should never repent it—there was no other person, except the person I believed to be Lord Ranelagh, to whom I was writing during that time—there was no gentleman staying at my house, or who I was visiting during that time—she always told me that William was Lord Ranelagh, and never told me of any other person—she often mentioned Mrs. Lilley, and a person named Stevenson, as Lord Ranelagh's servants, and said that he had promised in their presence to marry me—I do not know them—taking the whole of these sums and goods, and the diamonds, I have never received any<lb/>thing back which I gave to Rachel, nor have I received any consideration for them; she has shown me jewellery, sometimes which she has told me was mine, but I never received any of it—she once took me to a livery stable near her shop, in New Bond Street, to select a carriage for the marriage with Lord Ranelagh; I selected one, and she said that Lord Ranelagh's arms would be painted upon it—I parted with my money for the man that adored me, Lord Ranelagh, on the representations made to me by Rachel about my marriage; every sum.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. D. SEYMOUR</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I hope you will not think me guilty of impertinence if I ask your age? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is a very rude question, there is no use in your pressing me on the subject—I was married in 1846—it was not 1841—the age of the bride is a question I shall not answer—I was married twenty-two years—I was not married in my teens, but I was a very young person when I married—I have been a widow, seven years last May—I have been to India, and have always associated with people of the highest principles and rank—I am acquainted with the style and usages of polite society, but I know nothing about business—my maiden name was Edwardes—I never heard of Madame Rachel till I saw her in 1864—I went to her shop as I was suffering from a little eruption on my face—I saw the Queen's name up, and I had seen the advertisements—I made enquiries of Madame—I recollect her giving me a book, but it was not till the next year—I do not think I had any conversation with her about her process—I do not recollect that she told me that "It did not consist, as many persons have been led to suppose, in stopping up the pores of the flesh with dan<lb/>gerous cosmetiques, neither is it in plastering up the system by painting the face, which must be disgusting to all right-minded women gifted with com<lb/>mon sense; on the contrary, it is principally accomplished by the use of the Arabian bath, composed of pure extracts of the liquid of flowers, choice and rare herbs, and other preparations equally harmless and efficacious"—She said that her process was chiefly cleanliness, assisted by baths—I only saw her twice in 1864—she gave me a book, and I enquired about her process—I think I had two or three baths under Madame Rachel in 1864—I thought her charges were very expensive—she did not, at that time, tell me that there was a regular scale of charges, that her regular charges were pub<lb/>lished for her patronesses, and were from 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 1000 guineas, because she was not going to make me beautiful for ever then—she told me, in 1866, that her regular charge was 1000 guineas for the whole process—I think I had seen her advertisement when I first went and saw her—I went there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186808170079"/>
               <p>merely to get something for an eruption on the face—I only stayed a short time in London in 1864—I never ran up a bill with her, I paid her always at the time for what I had, and I had her receipts, but she took them from me—I received a letter from a person named Richards, in 1864, when I was in Pembrokeshire—I was not residing there under the name of Borradaile Goderich, but he directed so; I was residing at a place called Goderich—I have never gone by any name but Borradaile since I married—I was not a penny in her debt when I heard of the solicitor in the ease—I took two or three baths in 1864—I was introduced to Lord Ranelagh about 18th or 20th May, 1866; I cannot be sure—I never took a bath at Madame's own house, but she had baths in her house; I heard her say so—I never saw a bath there, because I never was anywhere except in the shop and the small sitting room, where there is no room for a bath; but I heard her say that she was giving baths to ladies in her house; she told me so—I heard her say that she had been giving a bath to a lady, and I thought she was in the house—she sometimes said to me, "You shall have a bath here," and after<lb/>wards she said, "No, you shall go to the public bath"—I have heard her say that she has been bathing ladies, and I always understood her in her house; I thought she said in her house, but I will not swear it—when, I took baths I took them at the public baths in Davies Street—I was attended there by a matron or superintendent; everything was conducted with pro<lb/>priety—but what have baths to do with these swindling transactions?—I was before Mr. Knox as a witness—something was said about baths there—I heard something said about gentlemen being allowed to peep at ladies when they were taking their baths—I think Mr. Cridland had am anonymous letter, telling him so; more than one letter—something was said at Marl<lb/>borough Street by my Counsel, about gentlemen being allowed to peep at ladies in baths—I only know what Madame said—I noticed no impropriety when I was in my bath at Davies Street; nothing ever occurred while I was having my bath there to lead me to think that any gentleman was allowed to look at me—I know of no facts for such an assertion only from Madame Rachel herself—I do not know that I am obliged to tell what she said—she never mentioned other ladies; she only mentioned about myself, and I had rather not say what that was—I forget what she said—I will swear she said something about gentlemen seeing me in a bath; she said it about six months ago, or it may be seven—I have not seen her for five months, except at the Police Court—it may have been in February or March—I will not tell you what she said; I really forget; but I recollect she did say something to me about the bath, and she mentioned a person in connection with it—I did not take a bath after that, only at the Argyle, not at Davies Street—I have not been there for a year and a half—I was never told that they would not supply me with a bath there—the last time I saw Mrs. Hicks was at Madame Rachel's shop—she did not say the last time I went that she would not allow me to have a bath after what I had said about peeping at me—I know Mrs. Hicks very well—I saw her here, and spoke to her—she did not refuse to let me have a bath in the house—I am speaking the truth, and I never speak anything but the truth—she did not tell roe that she was instructed by the superintendent not to let me have a bath; nothing of the kind—she may swear it, if she likes—I do not recollect that I ever told anybody that anyone had been peeping at me in my bath—I had rather not swear that I did not; I may have forgotten it—I may have said that some<lb/>body</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186808170080"/>
               <p>told me so; I forget all about it—I forget whether I mentioned it to Mrs. Hicks; it is a long time since—I met Lord Ranelagh in 1866, and was a few minutes in the shop in his company—he gave me his card—I swear that; and I looked at it, and gave it back to him—he was talking to two ladies in the shop—I asked him if he was Lord Ranelagh—he said, "Yes, I am; here is my card"—he said nothing more—I regarded him as my in<lb/>tended husband after that interview; but she introduced him again to me a few days afterwards—I had a conversation with him, but I forget what it was; there was very little said, and what was said was said by Madame Rachel; it was not about perfumes, or the old china there—Madame Rachel said that there were some theatricals going on at Beaufort House, but they were not good enough for me to go to—he had no particular conversation with me—those are the only occasions when I have been with Lord Ranelagh when any conversation took place—he came up from Aldershot one day to dine at Kuhn's, in Regent Street, and she said, "Lord Ranelagh, go round to the shop door"—I saw him, but did not speak to him—I did not see him go away—I went out at one door, and she was talking to him in the shop—I thought she was coming, too, and I did not want it—I believed then that he was going to marry me; I believed it all along—she told me that he knew me before I was married—I cannot say that I ever saw him in my husband's lifetime—I saw a great number of men—I do not think so—I do not see what my late husband has to do with these swindling transactions—the memory of my husband is sacred; let the dead rest—I resided in Brompton during my married life—my husband may have mentioned Lord Ranelagh's name there; I cannot say—he was ill for some time there—he may have done so, but I forget; it is a long time ago—I had about that time become a mother.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Let that refresh your memory? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have been a very virtuous and prudent woman all my lifetime—a copy of a letter was sent at that time—I know nothing about any unpleasantness with which Lord Ranelagh's name was mentioned; I forget—I cannot swear that I knew Lord Ranelagh by sight at that time—I did not know him when I was in Brompton, or see him at my house—my husband introduced me to no gentlemen at all at Brompton—I cannot tell you whether Lord Ranelagh's name was men<lb/>tioned there in connection with a private matter—it was nothing about my child.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath, was there not something about information which your husband had received from Lord Ranelagh, and a threat about somebody else? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My husband did not tell me anything: he kept everything from me—Lord Ranelagh did not at that time give information which led my husband to threaten somebody else—until Madame Rachel introduced me to Lord Ranelagh I knew nothing about it—I do not remember anything of the kind occurring—I am told that something was said, but I had rather not swear that it was not in connection with that child that Lord Ranelagh bad given some information about somebody else—I agreed that Madame Rachel was to have 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know what benefit I derived from her treatment; very little—my skin is no better now than it was—she gave me some soap and some powder, and something to put into the baths—I paid for the baths myself—I thought at one time that she had done my skin some good—I had a little breaking out on my skin—nothing was done to my hair—it has been cut by Mrs. Taylor, of Berners Street, Oxford Street, and for 15 years; it was never cut by Madame Rachel, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186808170081"/>
               <p>it is all my own hair, and the native colour; there is no improving tint—I have used a little of the <hi rend="italic">Auricanus</hi>—that is hair wash—the letters of William which have been read were, I thought, all from Lord Ranelagh—the first letters were badly spelt, but Madame Rachel told me his servant wrote them for him—I did not believe that an English nobleman would make love through his footman, but she said that he had hurt his arm, and I did not think she would tell me stories—I knew that he was living in London—I look at the Peerage sometimes—Lord Kensington and I are of the same family—I know that Lord Ranelagh's name is the Hon. Thomas Heron Jones, and not William or Edward—I do not remember him at all in my husband's lifetime—I do not know where Birdcage Walk is where this letter is dated from—I do not know whether I have ever walked there; I believe it is somewhere by Buckingham Palace—these letters from William were in 1866 and 1867—I never borrowed a shilling of Madame Rachel—in 1866, when I first had to do with her, I did not know what an I 0 U was—she asked me to put my initials to something, as it was of no conse<lb/>quence, and I did it, but I never had a shilling—she got me to sign things—this bill is in my writing. (<hi rend="italic">This was a bill of exchange to Mr. Haynes for</hi> 500<hi rend="italic">l. dated</hi> 13<hi rend="italic">th June</hi>, 1866, <hi rend="italic">signed and accepted by the witness</hi>.) This receipt is also in my writing—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "June 18th, 1866, received of Madame Rachel 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which I nave given her a bill payable on demand at Messrs. Grindlay and Co.'s.—Mary T. Borradaile") I never had a shilling from Madame Rachel—she had an immense influence over me, and used to get me to write things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, when you wrote, "Received 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which I have given a bill," you wrote what was false? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not know what I was writing, I should think—I gave a receipt for my pension at Grindlay's—I have only been spending a guinea a week all this time—this letter is my writing (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "London, Sep. 21, 1866. I, the undersigned, authorise Sarah Rachel Leverson to dispose of all the property she has in her possession belonging to me, a bunch of seals, a ruby ring, a gold chain and cross, silks, linen, boxes, baskets, and sundry items, of all of which a full list has been given Mary Tucker Borradaile.")—I think this long account is also in my writ<lb/>ing: Nov. 27, 1866. An account rendered this day by Madame Rachel to Mrs. Borradaile. Aug. 13, received 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1866.

The following account has been rendered by me to Madame Rachel."—It looks like my writing; I cannot say all of it—the whole may be mine, I have written things which I have no recollection of—I never tell lies; when I am not sure, I will not say—it is not a true account, I have never had a penny from her—I am on my oath; never willfully would I tell a lie—this letter is also in my writing: "7, George Street Hanover Square. Mr. Haynes, Dear Sir, I have instructed Madame Rachel to place in your hands the mortgage for 1600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I gave her on the reversion. Will you ask her for the bills and I O U's she has of mine, and please cancel them. I authorize you to give Madame Rachel an undertaking for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Messrs.

               <p>they are dated George Street—I never wrote any letter at all in George Street—I mean to say that she bewitched me—I believe I wrote it under a fa✗cination—(<hi rend="italic">Mr. Froggett was called into Court to produce a letter from the witness, dated June 14, but declined to do so</hi>)—I was at Mr. Haynes's several times; three, four, or five times with Madame Rachel, and several times without her—I told Mr. Haynes that I was going to be married to Mr. Edwardes—I did not say he was my cousin—I mentioned Mr. Edwardes, because it was the name assumed—it was the name Lord Ranelagh always Went by.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you know that he was going by the name of your own cousin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I knew it was the same name—my cousin never had a penny of my money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that you thought Lord Ranelagh was making use of your cousin's name? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought it was in case my letters should be laid about—I never thought about the name of Captain William Edwardes being used to hide Lord Ranelagh's name—it was certainly the same name—I believed he took that name as he might take any other name—I did not tell Mr. Haynes that I was going to be married to Captain William Edwardes, my cousin—he is a relative of Lord Kensington, but I do not recollect telling Mr. Haynes so—I do not think he asked me—I always thought Lord Ranelagh was Captain William Edwardes, spelling his name with "des" at the end, and I spelt it so—I do not recollect Madame Rachel referring to my extravagance, in my presence, to Mr. Haynes, I will not swear she did not—I never remember her saying that I was squandering my money on my paramour, I cannot swear that she did not—this letter is my writing—(<hi rend="italic">This was to Mr. Haynes, dated January</hi> 23<hi rend="italic">rd</hi>, 1864, <hi rend="italic">stating that the witness had given Madame Rachel a mortgage for</hi> 1600<hi rend="italic">l. on the reversion, making her joint-mortgagee with Mr. Haynes, and that she had instructed Messrs. Nelson, Lawless &amp; Goodman to sell the reversion, Mr. Haynes being ill</hi>)—That was dictated too, word for word—it is crossed—I have relations in Wales named Cope—the arrangement with Mr. Haynes about paying 1400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was made, I think, at the end of August, 1866—I do not know whether Madame Rachel received the money till the end of the next year—my brother-in-law, Mr. Cope, came up to London the first week in September, 1866—I saw him, and went with him to St James's Street—I did not go into the Carlton Club—I do not think he wished me to accompany him—he wanted to know what kept me in London, as I had never been in London before I came up to town; and I told him I was going to be married—he said that he came up to London because he heard I was in bad hands—I think this letter if in my writing; it was dictated to me by Madame Rachel—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 3<hi rend="italic">rd September</hi>, 1866, <hi rend="italic">and began</hi> "My own dear William."—<hi rend="italic">It referred to the visit to London of Mr. Cope, and to her telling him Lord Ranelagh was then out of London, and the people at his town house had not seen him for a week; that Mr. Cope had bought his lordship's photograph in Regent Street, and did not like his nose and was under the impression that the people at the house and poor Rachel were in league to fool her into a marriage with his Lordship; that they would not leave town until they made her go with them to Mr. Haynes, but he was fortunately out of town</hi>)—That was every word written at Madame Rachel s, of course Madame Rachel communicated with my brother-in-law—you must cross-examine him to know whether she was the means of bringing him up, to find out who my paramour was—she was not the means of bringing him up in September, 1866; it is false—she had nothing to do with Mr. Cope coming up the first time—he knew I went to Madame</p>

               <p>Rachel's shop, and he knew I was in bad hands, and that made him come—Madame Rachel told me that I must trust her, and I wrote the letters entirely in consequence of that—I believed her because I did not believe she was such a woman—I mean to tell the Jury that when I wrote that letter I thought I was writing to Lord Ranelagh—this other letter I suppose is my writing: "36, Davies Street, Berkeley Square, Sept. 6th. My dear William, I have just received a letter from my sister, Mrs. Cope, with a postscript from her husband. He says that he will be in town shortly after I receive this. He comes up in consequence of Madame Rachel having sent him the copy of the letter I wrote to you just after they left for North Wales, last Monday. She has exposed the whole affair about the lace, the very thing I did not wish him to know. It was most foolish of her exposing my affairs to my family. She said she did it to prevent my being arrested. This affair has nearly broken my heart. With fondest love, believe me, your affectionate and loving Mary T. Borradaile. P.S. I did not know until this minute that you were ill, or I would not have upbraided you for coldness and unkindness, as I thought that you were neglecting me."—Madame Rachel wrote two or three letters to my family, which they were very much disgusted with—you must ask Mr. Copt about them—I have never seen the lace she ordered for me—this letter looks like my writing—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated September</hi> 12<hi rend="italic">th, and commenced</hi>, "My own dear William, I shall be able to leave town with you to-morrow at any hour you may think proper to appoint;"—<hi rend="italic">it alluded to some neck-ties and socks which she had bought for him, and said</hi>, "Thank goodness they are paid for.")</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Neck-ties and socks for Lord Ranelagh? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I wrote that at her dic<lb/>tation; every word—I did not order any shirt fronts of Rogers; Madame Rachel had them brought to the shop—some shirts were brought to Madame's shop—I cannot swear whether I called and ordered them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Going for gentlemen's shirts is a thing a woman does not do every day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think I did—I think I was there and saw some shirt fronts—they were for Lord Ranelagh, to Madame Rachel said—she told me he wanted ties, and shirts, and socks—I really believed that he wanted them, because I had found out that he was not so very rich about that time, and Madame Rachel said that he would like me to select them—I recollect going to the shop—I forgot it when you first asked me—I do not know whether I had this bill to Mrs. Colonel Alfred Borradaile—I do not recollect having seen it—I know nothing of these shirts being taken to my lodgings in Davies Street—I was at 28, George Street when they were ordered—I gave Rogers an address at my lodgings, and Madame Rachel was present when I did it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now I will call your attention to this letter: "Sept 13. My own dear William, I shall see Mrs. Lilley as you desire. She will no doubt be of service to us. I am sorry that her son is ill. I am told that it was in consequence of your putting yourself into such a passion this morning. You know there are such things as talking birds. My darling, I was very sad this morning. I feel better now, since you tell me we shall leave Charing Cross early to-morrow. Will that morrow ever come? To me it seems an age. There are a few things of consequence that Rachel has to get for me this evening that I should like to have before I leave London. I send you what you ask for, though I frankly tell you that I did not intend giving you any more until we went away, but it seems that you know the over<lb/>land route to my heart It is of no use to regret. I find it hard to deny you anything. You wish me to write a line to Mr. Moon. I will do it; it shall</p>

               <p>be short and sweet. I send it to you; if you approve of it, send it: if not, tell me what alterations you wish. With fondest love, believe me, your affectionate and loving Mary Tucker Borradaile." <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never remember writing that—I have been the overland route to India—I may have thrown in a word now and then in the composition—Mr. Moon is a solicitor—he is not solicitor to Mr. Cope—I was at Mr. Moon's with Mr. Cope, and was asked to tell who dear William was—at first I said that I would not tell—Mr. Cope knew about the marriage with Lord Ranelagh—I only refused to take any proceedings against Madame Rachel because I thought I should get my clothes; I thought I would wait—I did not know what to do at that time—I forget whether I said that I would not sanction any proceedings against Madame Rachel; my brother-in-law will tell you. (<hi rend="italic">Another letter was here read, from the witness to Dear William, dated September, stating that she was very miserable, but that his letter had made her much happier, and allud<lb/>ing to having travelled with him</hi>)—I never travelled with Lord Ranelagh, or any man except my husband—Madame Rachel introduced a lady to me as Lord Ranelagh's sister—(<hi rend="italic">Another letter, dated October</hi> 6, 1866, <hi rend="italic">was put in, addressed</hi> "My own dear William," <hi rend="italic">and contained the following</hi>:—"I am sorry that you are ill." "I am informed that you are now, and have been, keeping a woman with my money." "It is well known in Portsmouth that I have been living with you for some months; you cannot wonder at that when you consider the life we have been leading?" "Am I to believe that the woman you travelled with, and whom you introduced me to as your sister, was your mistress?" "It is well known in Pembrokeshire that I have been living with you some months")—When I wrote that letter, I thought I was writing to Lord Ranelagh—I cannot remember that letter at all—I remember Madame Rachel introducing me to a woman in her shop, who she said was Lord Ranelagh's sister—I can swear that every word of that was written by Madame Rachel's dictation; she told me to trust her, and I should never repent it—(<hi rend="italic">Letter continued</hi>: "I am not surprised at you for<lb/>getting me, as I have forgotten myself")—I have never done anything improper; I have been a virtuous woman all my life—I wrote to the Plough, at Cheltenham, to engage a bed for Lord Ranelagh and myself, when we were married—(<hi rend="italic">Letter continued</hi>: "You may remember that I am the widow of a Colonel, and though I have disgraced myself and my family, by having anything to do with you, I am still far more humiliated by being introduced to such people as you associate with. I have not one person in London to speak to, and dare not return to Wales, but can live in Paris on my pension")—When I wrote that, I thought, on my oath, that I was writing to Lord Rane<lb/>lagh—Mr. Cope was never at Rachel's but once—she did not, in his presence, upbraid me with spending money on a lover, paramour, nor on anyone—no one's name was mentioned but Lord Ranelagh's—she did not charge me with squandering my money—she did not, in my brother-in-law's presence, say that I was spending my money on a man who I ought not to be associated with, not Lord Ranelagh at all; my brother-in-law will contradict it—nothing was ever said about my wasting my money—we went first to Madame Rachel's, and afterwards to Mr. Moon's—I was never in company with Lord Ranelagh at Cheltenham, or at all—a man at the corner of High Street, Cheltenham, cut my hair once or twice—Madame Rachel told me that Lord Ranelagh used to be shaved by that barber—this is one of my unfortunate letters: "Oct 18, 1867. My own dear William, It was very kind of you to take care of my comb and <hi rend="italic">frizzette</hi>, which is my own hair"—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186808170085"/>
               <p>Madame Rachel dictated that—I volunteered to-day that it was my own hair, and I will take my bonnet off and show you.—(<hi rend="italic">Continued</hi>: "The man who keeps the hairdresser's shop at the corner of High Street, Cheltenham, made it for me, the man who used to share you when we were there")—I meant that he shaved Lord Ranelagh—Madame Rachel told me that he was at the Plough Hotel when I was there, when my daughter was at school.—(<hi rend="italic">Letter continued</hi>: "I had more hair on my head than I wanted, my love, therefore I had it cut off.")—This letter is also mine. (<hi rend="italic">This was without date, and was commenced</hi>: "My own dear William, You will see by the enclosed letters that I managed to screen your name; you are quite put aside. Mr. Cridland intends bringing an action against Madame Rachel, not Lord Ranelagh, as poor <hi rend="italic">Tommy</hi> wishes to get into Parliament, and my family are led to believe he has had my money and clothes. Mr. Cridland thinks it would not be kind to expose him. The result will be ruin to me and my daughter. Madame Rachel has a great motive in keeping them, and I am sure she will send them to Mr. Cridland")—Madame Rachel dictated that—I brought an action against her in the Queen's Bench—I do not think she appeared to it. (<hi rend="italic">Letter continued</hi>: "I am very sorry I did not go with you to Hull; I had rather stay in Kentish Town")—I was not going with Lord Ranelagh to Hull, and was never in Kentish Town with him—("I am pretty sure that Madame Rachel gives her money to tell her everything")—she dictated that—this letter was written to Lord Ranelagh—poor Tommy was Lord Ranelagh—I thought I was writing to him when I called him poor <hi rend="italic">Tommy</hi>—I always thought he had my money—I suppose this letter to be mine (<hi rend="italic">This was addressed to dear William, dated</hi> 12<hi rend="italic">th December, and stated</hi>: "Had you married me, as you declared you would do more than a year ago, in the presence of your three sisters and Frank, I should not have written to Cheltenham to prepare the rooms. Remember, I could not be in the same room with you without being married. I wish I had been a little cut-away monkey.")—When I wrote that letter I thought I was writing to Lord Ranelagh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> "I could not be in the same room with you without being married;" did your daughter say that to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have seen very little of her—I think she may have written to me; I think she did write it, and say some<lb/>thing of that sort—she was not sixteen then—I wrote all this by Madame Rachel's dictation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> She could not tell you what your daughter had written to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Do you suppose I did not know that without my daughter telling me—how many more things have I put down which are silly and ridiculous?—it requires a very clever person to do with Madame Rachel—this letter if also mine—"Dear Madame Rachel,—I went to Mr. Cridland's yesterday, and to my horror found Lord Ranelagh there. He certainly was intoxioated, and made use of very bad language, &amp;c. I really thought he would have struck me. If he had, Mr. Cridland would have given him in charge. Lord Ranelagh told me that there was a dear William as well as a dear Tommy, which was very cowardly of him; but when he mentioned William's name, I told him he was a liar and a thief. If he forgot he was talking to a lady, I treated him as an unmanly vagabond. M. T. Borradaile."—The greater part of that letter was dictated by Madame Rachel—she not only dictated the letters I wrote to Lord Ranelagh, but letters I wrote to herself—I did call Lord Ranelagh a thief at Mr. Cridland's office.</p>

               <p>said he had had my money—Lord Ranelagh said that there was a dear William as well as a dear Tommy; but I called him a liar and a thief before that—it was not when he mentioned William's name; I will swear that—Lord Ranelagh was not very complimentary to me, for he called me a liar—I said that dear William and dear Tommy were the same person, and that I knew no one of that name—the first time I heard that Lord Rauelagh denied that he had allowed his name to be mentioned as intending to marry me, was when Mr. Smith, the solicitor, wrote to my mother this year—I did not know, in 1867, that Madame Rachel had told my family that I was in communication with some other person, and that there was no foundation for Lord Ranelagh's attentions to me—she always led me to suppose that he was my affianced husband—that was after Mr. Cope bad been to town in 1867, and much later—besides the letters to Dear William, I wrote others to Dear Tommy, and directed them to Lord Ranelagh, in New Burlington Street—there were a good many letters written to him this year—I wrote three, I think, after I had seen him at Mr. Cridland's office, and told him I did not want to have anything more to say to him, and to give me my clothes and my money—I was at Mr. Cridland's office last about February, I think—he has been very ill, but I think you will see him at this trial—I dare say I wrote a dozen letters to Lord Ranelagh, as my Dear Tommy, up to the end of February—in the beginning of December, a summons was taken out at Marlborough Street Police Court, for some clothes of mine—(<hi rend="italic">The summons was dated</hi>, 3<hi rend="italic">rd December</hi>, 1866, <hi rend="italic">taken out against Sarah Rachel Leverson, for unlawfully detaining certain goods of Mrs. Borradaile's</hi>.)—That was after Mr. Cope had gone back to Wales—Madame Rachel after<lb/>wards told me she would arrange it amicably, and the summons was with<lb/>drawn—we afterwards had a meeting at Mr. Haynes', with a view to an amicable arrangement—I had not a great deal of correspondence with Mr. Haynes—I wished him to arrange things amicably if he could.</p>

Madame Rachel. I instructed Mr. Cridland to sell the reversion, in order to pay my debts, as I have no other way of meeting them.

If Mr. Cridland has sent you any disagreable notice, it is not my doing, as I have not seen him for a week, nor have I written to him.—Yours truly, Mary Borradaile. My messenger will wait your reply."—"Friday Evening. My own dear William. I declare positively that I did not mention your name to Lewis and Lewis. I went there to satisfy my family and to screen you, my love. I did not think Madame Rachel would return to England, as I thought she was going to reside in France, and if Lewis and Lewis write to her she is sure to tell them the truth. With my fondest and dearest love, ever your loving and affectionate, Mary Tucker Borradaile. P.S. I just came out because I did not wish to see Mr. Smith, Lord Ranelagh's solicitor."—"My dear William. My sister and her husband, Mr. and Mrs. Cope, have but just left me. To my great surprise, they called upon me to-night. They came from North Wales, on their way to Scotland. They are staying at Nelson's Hotel, Portland Place; but I would rather be with you. They were very anxious to know what detained me in London, and the name of my lover, and how I had become acquainted with you. I said that you were a friend of my husband's, and that you used to visit us in India, and that you were in the army. They wanted very much to know your name; but I declined to tell them, my love. I wish you had been there, and seen the face I put upon the whole affair. I do not think you would be so angry with me as your unkindness to me leads me to suppose, for refusing to comply with your demand when it was not in my power to do so; and I have never refused you anything that you have wanted. I must see you to-morrow, or you will not see me before I go to Cheltenham, which will be on Monday without fail. We ought to have been there to-day. With fondest love, believe me, your loving Mary Tucker Borradaile. Saturday Morning, September 1."—"7, George Street, Hanover Square, September 26. Dear Rachel, I arrived here between six and seven o'clock yesterday</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186808170094"/>
               <p>evening. I called upon you to-day, but you were engaged. I left a pretty little album with some photographs for your dear little Elsie, and a nice little cross for Leonti. I cannot tell you how grieved I was to hear of your sad accident, and so was my friend William. He will call upon you to-morrow; pray be kind to him for my sake: you know how much I love him, dear Rachel, and I never thanked anyone who would wish to separate me from the only man I love. With kind regards, your sincere friend, Mary T. Borrodaile.")—These two letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are my writing—I did not post them myself—I only wrote one letter, which I posted—I did not post these: "December 3rd, Tuesday evening (<hi rend="italic">addressed to Lord Ranelagh</hi>) My own dear Tom. I feel assured that no one but Mr. Harrison will advise you for your good. I know you love me, but you must remember that you are not the only man who loves me. You may think the Duchess of——very charming; you ought to have found her out by this time. I could have told Mr. Smith a great deal more about money matters. I thought the less I said the better. I have told you over and over again that I would never deny you a favour. Why did you show my letter to Mr. Smith? And you know the letter was never intended to be posted. It was very unkind of you to tell Mr. Smith that you did not know me. You have forgotten that you saw me in my bath in Davies Street. If I had taken Mr. Smith to Mrs. Hicks, she would have told him a different story. If you allow a man like Mr. Smith to speak about me in a lawyer's office, that does not show much friendship on your part. If you had not shown my letter to Mr. Smith, no one would have been at all the wiser. Your friendship, indeed! I should be very sorry to serve you as you have served me. You say you are a woman's friend. It makes me believe what they say—you are a general lover. Not that I ever sought your love—far from it. It really is unkind of you, to say the least of it. I think you were more frightened than hurt; and I will only say you are a naughty old Tommy. So I conclude with, Mary Tucker Borradaile. My sister sent me some fowls! Would you like one?" "13 December 1867. My dear Tom, I cannot find words to express my as<lb/>tonishment when I saw the letter which I wrote to you in confidence, in Mr. Smith's hands, which you told me you gave him to make use of as he thought proper. If you did not give it him, pray tell me who did. I did write to William last night, and I told him that it was dishonourable and unmanly on your part to give my letters to your solicitor, and to tell him to write to my family, to make use of vulgar words—a parcel of lies—merely to screen yourself. So mean of yon to put it upon other people. Thank goodness, William does not require your pity any more than I do myself. How can you deny that you have not exposed my let<lb/>ters? The consequence is that Messrs. Lewis and Lewis will write a sharp letter to you to-morrow, which letter must be answered by yourself. They told me they would not take an answer from anyone but yourself I have one favour to ask you, Tom, and I may never ask you another. It is, I im<lb/>plore you not to compromise William, as I have never mentioned his name to any solicitor. If you go to Lewis and Lewis's office, and I should be there before you, leave me to manage: you are aware I can do that, as you have often told me I had a clever little head. Should you be there before me, Tommy, be sure say as little as possible, and all can be arranged quiet<lb/>ly. "Blessed are the peacemakers." The less said about our affairs the better, for you know I love William dearly, and you know Tommy, I have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186808170095"/>
               <p>not been unkind to you, you donkey. But you are like all the men—always exacting, and never satisfied. I found my umbrella. I told Mr. Smith I had not been to Duke Street. He told me I asked for a very ugly gentle<lb/>man. I said I thought he was a very good-looking man, which I think put him on good terms with himself, for, indeed, I do not wish him to write any more letters to my family. I did not tell him William was waiting for me at the corner of the street. It was only a wonder he did not walk up stairs, to see what kept me so long amongst the Land Conservatives, as he calls them. One thing I am sure you will be glad to hear, that William says he is sure of winning all my money back again next season, if the horses run which he has backed. Any man may have a run of ill-luck. The Marquis of Hastings lost more in one day than my poor William ever had to lose; but we must not be too hard upon him. I have one, and it is a great consolation, that he loves me dearly and fondly, and that his friends and advisers and my family have not the power to separate us. So do as I tell you—be manly and generous, and you will always have the friendship of one who has always endeavoured to keep her promise. Did you get home safely? If you have not taken the cough mixture, take it and put a little flannel on your chest. You are always angry when I tell you you are not getting younger. I never say anything to you to insult you. You have not a wife to take care of you: it is time you had. Where is the Duchess of——? I suppose Mr. Smith knows what a good wife she-will make. She will take such care of you. I hope you will invite me to your wedding. I hope the Duchess will make a good mother to your children. My sister, Mrs. J. Edwards, told me she saw you and your daughter in the park. Dear Tommy, will you say as little as possible? I most remind you once more, for you know you are so nervous. You remember <hi rend="italic">The Telegraph</hi> paper, in which it mentioned I took you from the prison to the church. Be kind, for indeed my fingers ache so: with kind love to the Duchess and your children, believe me, yours sincerely, poor little Mary Tucker Borradaile.—That is her dictation too, every word, both "Dear Tom" and "Dear William"—the letter of 13th December, was written the day after that of 12th December—I knew no William, the only person I knew was Lord Ranelagh.</p>

About 3 o'clock on Sunday morn<lb/>ing, the 12th July, I was on duty in Judd Street, with Inspector Shenton—I met the prisoners Fitzgerald and Barrett at the corner of Leigh Street and Judd Street—I asked them what they were doing out then, and Fitzgerald said, "We have been to the theatre, and are locked out"—I asked them what they had got about them—they opened their coats, and said "Nothing"—I let them go—the inspector took a handkerchief from Barrett's pocket, but gave it back to him again—they were about thirty yards from the prose<lb/>cutor's house—I did not see Bateman at all.</p>

I am the wife of James Rudland, and live at 6, Judd Street—I can see the prosecutor's house quite plainly from my window—on Sunday morning, between 2 and 3 o'clock, I got up, and went to the window—I saw two lads in the street, talking to a young woman, a few yards from the prosecutor's shop—they left the young woman, and went up to the shop, and I lost sight of the tallest of the two, but the small one remained on the doorstep—I could not say who they were—I saw them come off the step, and talk to the young woman again, and then they went down Judd Street—I saw the two boys stopped by two policemen—I am positive they were the same boys that were on the door step—the lads were about the height of the two prisoners, Barrett and Fitzgerald.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable in the Royal Irish Constabulary—early in July, I received a telegram, in consequence of which I went on board the <hi rend="italic">City of Cork</hi> steamer, at Queenstown, which was on its way from Liverpool to New York—I saw the prisoner and Mrs. Allen on board—they were passing as Mr. and Mrs. Prince—I got from Mrs. Allen a bag, which I examined and found to contain six 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and some tens and fives—afterwards Sergeant Campbell came, and came up to London with the prisoners—there were seven 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes mentioned in the telegram, and after I had cautioned the prisoner, I asked him about the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note that was miming—he said, "That must be the note that I changed at Bennett's," a banker, or something, he called him—he said he got it from Mrs. Allen—he did not say anything further about it—in coming across from Dublin to Holyhead, he spoke about the note in the presence of Sergeant Campbell, and said that he had paid it off for some sheep that he had bought.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that the two first Counts, charging the prisoner with stealing this</hi> 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">note, the property of Henry Allen, must fail, at it never was or could have been his property or in hit possession; it was, in fact, obtained by the wife's forgery; neither could it be said, at charged in the other Counts, to be a stealing from the bank, or a receiving; it might have been charged at a receiving of the note obtained by forgery or false pretences, but the bank had clearly parted both with the property and the possession of the money, and therefore it could not be laid in them. Even supposing it was the property of Allen, the wife could not steal the property of her husband, nor could the prisoner receive it knowing it to have been so stolen</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">contended that the property had not passed out of the corporate body of the London and Westminster Bank These notes were their property; the cashier, at their servant, had authority only to pay the money to the depositor, or some person authorized by him, and even if by fraud the servant was induced to part with the property, he not having authority to do so, did not, in law pass it</hi>.

It was for the Jury to say whether, when the prisoner received the note from the wife, under the circumstances of the case, he must not have known that she had obtained it dishonestly. He further contended that, property obtained by fraud or forgery by the wife would, as against a wrongdoer, be properly laid as that of the husband, and that her possession would be his possession in <hi rend="italic">law</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

As to the latter Counts, I contend that the bank parted with both property and possession; that the clerk' had a dis<lb/>cretionary power, that he was the agent of the bank for this purpose, and that the payment by mistake makes no difference.

I am assistant manager of the London and County Bank—in April, 1865, the prisoner opened an account with us by letter—I have not got the letter—I did not see him until June—I considered the account opened in April, but in June we transferred it into another form in the books—I have the ledger here—on 13th June, 1865, 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in, and on 15th June we transferred from our deposit account 2172<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the next sum paid in was 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 19th June—the prisoner drew on his account from time to time—further sums were paid into his account until 15th September of the same year—the actual amount to the credit of the account was 1366<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they were not all sums paid in—some were loans we made him—the money actually paid in was 1067<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., including the interest that we received on certain stock of his which we held—there is a ba<lb/>lance of 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in his favour now—the account was closed on 13th December, 1865—in June, 1865, we purchased some foreign bonds for him by his direction—this is the order signed by himself—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "2nd June, 1865. Please pur<lb/>chase for me 1000 Spanish active bonds, 1000 Portuguese 3 per cents., 1000 Old Mexican 3 per cents., and 1000 Canada 6 per cent, bonds, and charge the costs to my account. Alex.

Murray, the attorneys—when the account was first opened he described himself as a gentleman residing somewhere at Notting Hill—he afterwards described himself as an agent for the sale of steamships—the first letter we had from him directed us to answer to him "Post Restante, Marseilles"—from that I took it that he was on his homeward voyage—the money came in the shape of two bills on Glyn &amp; Co.—I cannot tell when they were drawn, we have no entry, merely that Glyn &amp; Co. had to pay them—we do not take the full particulars—we received the money from Glyn's.</p>

               <p>there about fifteen or sixteen months ago—while be was in the prison, by his direction I sold certain coupons of foreign bonds—I got them cashed for him—in June or July he gave me two coupons of Turkish Bonds, I think of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—I took them to the Ottoman Bank in Princes street—they were not paying them at that time, and referred me to Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am in the office of Messrs.

               <p>farthing of estate to pay the expenses of any defence to the appeal; that was one reason why it was considered advisable that a compromise, if possi<lb/>ble, should be effected—we made enquiries as to what would be the probable amount of the damages awarded to Robinson: I also more than once wrote to him for an account of what damages were claimed; I could get no reply from him—I saw his solicitors in the suit in the Court of Admiralty, and talked the matter over with them, and ultimately an offer was made of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. nett to be paid to the estate, in discharge of the ship, the ship to be made over to the mortgagees—at that time we had had the ship valued at 1660<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the mortgagees' claim was 2200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was told that the damages would not amount to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if I could get 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I should make a very good settle<lb/>ment upon it—that arrangement went off for two or three months—they wanted us to take 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the arrangement ultimately carried out was, that 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be paid by the mortgagees, they were to have the ship, and the assignees were to pay Robinson's charges in the Admiralty Court, and the possession fees; 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid over to the mortgagees, out of which 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to Robinson's solicitors for their charges, a little better than 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for possession fees, and the ultimate result was, about 620<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received for the benefit of the estate—I may say that I saw the Registrar of the Admiralty Court on the subject, and he said it was a very good arrangement; it was not only the best that could be made for the creditors, but, I think, was a very fair arrangement—Wolfe &amp; Smith were the mortgagees of the ship—so far from our acting in connexion with them, we were acting very much against them; we acted throughout in opposition to them, to get as much is we could from them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-cxamined Q.</hi> Who gave you notice of this <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Gibson and Mr. Price gave the firm notice of the <hi rend="italic">Cathcart</hi> affair—I know very little of Gibson further than I know he was a bankrupt, and Mr. Price was hit solicitor—it appears that under Gibson's bankruptcy Robinson was ex<lb/>amined, and the Commissioner recognized him, and it came out that he was an uncertificated bankrupt—Mr. Price searched the records, and came and told us of it, and of the prisoner's claim on the <hi rend="italic">Cathcart</hi>—Price and Gibson came together—they both got the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that reason—I thought it a very fair sum; it was the sum which perhaps they might claim under the Act of Parliament, 5 per cent—I took the opinion of my principals upon it—neither Wolfe or Smith communicated with me about it; with one exception, I have never seen either of that firm—Gibson told us of them; he knew Robinson's affairs, and of the proceedings in the Admiralty Court—he was examined at the Police Court, but merely to prove the hand<lb/>writing of these documents—I think the judgment in the Admiralty Court was somewhere in February, 1867, and Gibson came to us in March 1867—notice of appeal was given and entered—I received a notice of it from the proctor for Wolfe &amp; Smith, and from time to time they obtained an ex<lb/>tension of time to lodge their appeal—the official assignee was appointed immediately after that—we had a meeting about a month ago for the pur<lb/>pose of appointing a trade assignee—I believe Mr. McMillan, who was appointed, is a member of the firm of Halliday &amp; Co., who were the acceptors of the bill of 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for which Gilmore and Co. were pressing—that pressure was not the reason of the prisoner petitioning the Court, or of his trying to make an arrangement; I swear that—I swear boldly, from the documents put in my possession—an action was not being brought on the bill at the time he presented his petition; Gilmores were instructing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186808170113"/>
               <p>us in the matter—I am only speaking from documents, because all this was four or five months before I entered the office—I have examined all the proceedings—Gilmores took up the bill, I believe, on behalf of the acceptors—we knew that at the time they were proving—the proof was admitted when I entered the office—we opposed the proof on behalf of Gilmore; I was in Court at the time—we opposed the proof of the sister's—it has been recently held that a person taking up a bill to the honour of the acceptor has a right to sue the endorser—it appears from the proceedings that we compelled further and better accounts to be furnished from time to time—I did not do it personally, the solicitors did it; we instructed Counsel to do it—we were then acting for the estate—I can't say who proposed that McMillan should be trade assignee; I was not in the office at the time; I only know as a fact that he was appointed—Gilmores voted for the choice—I should think it was not done at the instance of our firm—it must have been known at that time that the bill had been taken up; they had net dishonoured the bill, they had got it taken up—it must have been dis<lb/>honoured before it was taken up.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I live at 5, Norway Place, Commercial Road, Limehouse—on Tuesday evening, 21st July, between 7 and 8 o'clock, I was called to the deceased's house, and saw him and the prisoner—he was suffering much from a swelling at the lower part of the abdomen, about the size of a small fist—it appeared to have been done within a few hours' and was undoubtedly the result of violence—it certainly was inflicted within two or three days—the prisoner said that it was caused by a kick—I prescribed the usual remedies, and left; and next morning I was sent for, and when I arrived he was dead—the prisoner was there, and said, "He had been in the public-house, and when he came home we had some words about some change, but I undressed, and got into bed, while he sat in a chair by the bed-side, and called me foul names. I told him if he called me them again I would knock him out of the chair; he said them again, and I jumped out of bed and kicked him; I thought it was on the knee, but found it could not be so"—She said that this occurred on Tuesday night, 20th July, and that she did not expect to find that he would die—when I saw him on the second occasion he was partly dressed—some female who was in the room said that he intended to go to the hospital, and being impatient at the delay, he jumped out of bed—the prisoner said that being in so much pain he intended to go to the hospital, and the cab not coming at the time ordered, he got impatient, and partly dressed himself—a person suffering from an internal injury would aggravate it by the exertion of dressing—on the Thursday morning, by the Coroner's direction. I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and found that the left kidney was very much congested and inflamed, and part of the bowel was dark and congested—the abdomen con<lb/>tained from a pint to a pint and a half of fluid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The cavity of the abdomen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that was the result of inflammation—there was also a recent rupture on the left side—there was a swelling there and much discoloration when I examined him before.</p>

               <p>would be necessarily fatal—it would be a very extraordinary injury to be inflicted by a woman's naked foot—a blow would produce the injury, but I do not think a fall would, but it is possible if against a sharp corner, or a fall in the public house; against steps might do it, or against anything sharp anything projecting—that would be much more likely to cause it than the naked foot of a woman.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> She says that the man was complaining of very great pain, was not the injury such as to be plain on the first examination? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not the character of the injury—the sole injury had been inflicted when I saw him the first time—if a man was falling and was drunk, the injury would not necessarily be more severe—the injury was very severe altogether—the fluid found in the cavity of the stomach was the waste of the tissues, which was very rapid—it is highly improbable that a woman's naked foot could have produced it, but it is quite possible that the foot with a boot on might.</p>

I was resident medical officer at the Charing Cross Hospital—on the morning of the 16th, the prosecutrix was brought there a few minutes after 12, bleeding very much—I found three severe wounds on the head, which had divided all the structures down to the bone, and also two raised bruises on the scalp—there was also a wound on the lip, a piece almost out—that was done by a sharper instrument—on the back there were other bruises—she was in a very weak state—she was in the hospital about a fortnight—I think she was in a dangerous state for the first few days—there was a probability of her getting erysipelas—the would then very likely have died—the wound on the lip was done by some sharp instrument—the wounds on the head were likely to have been caused by some blunt instrument, but those on the back were as if it had been kicked.</p>
