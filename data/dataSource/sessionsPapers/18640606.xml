                  </hi>. I am the wife of Isaac Williams, who keeps the Duke of Sussex, Clifton-street, Notting-hill—on 20th April, soon after 9 at night the prisoner came in there with two or three others—he asked for a pot of beer, and handed it round to those who were with him—he did not drink any him<lb/>self—he gave me a shilling—I put it in the till—there was no other shilling there at that time—I gave him sixpence and twopence change—he then called for two pennyworth of gin, and gave me another shilling—I looked at it, tried it with my teeth, and found it was bad—I then took the other shilling from the till, and found that was bad too—I told him he had given me two bad shillings—he said he had not, and went out—his companions went out soon after—I called my husband and he followed the prisoner—after that some one came in and gave me a half-crown—that was not one of the men who had been in with the prisoner—he asked what was the matter—I told him, and he said, "I will pay for the beer and the change," and he gave me the money—I gave him eighteen pence out of the half-crown—I did not give him the bad shillings—he did not go away directly—he stopped some little time—I saw no more of the prisoner or his companions—I wrapped the two bad shillings in a paper, and gave them to the policeman a fortnight afterwards—I kept them in my desk, which was locked all that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is your house frequented by working men chiefly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; we very seldom hare much cash in the till—I generally keep it in my pocket—my husband attends to the business—we have no barmaid—it was not a minute after I took the first shilling that the second was given me—I did not put that in the till—I kept it in my hand—the bar was full of people at the time—I did not give any change for the second shilling—I gave the man eighteen pence change out of the half-crown.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband keeps the Boot and Slipper beer-shop, St. Ann's-road, Notting-hill—I remember seeing the prisoner and two other men at our house in the latter part of April—one of the other men called for a pot of beer, and gave me fourpence in coppers for it—then the prisoner called for another pot, and gave me a shilling—I said, "I have not change"—I looked at the shilling and found it was a bad one, and sent my little girl to get change—she came back in two or three minutes and said it was bad—I went and told my husband about it—he was ill at the time, and he said, "Don't say anything about it now, because he is a desperate character"—in consequence of that I gave the prisoner eightpence change—I kept the shilling about three weeks, and afterwards gave it to the constable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where did you keep it all that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In my purse, and kept the purse in my pocket—I put no money into the purse, and took none out all that time; not out of that compartment—our place is frequented by poor working men—I don't often take bad money—I took a bad coin a few weeks before this—I did not see the prisoner in my house during the three weeks before he was taken—I saw him over the road opposite—I believe he is a hard-working man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>asked for a pot of six ale and a quartern of gin, and gave me half a crown—I gave him a shilling and seven pence out—he came in at a different door, and I put the half-crown in another till—after that they all came into the house again, and one of the prisoner's companions asked for a pot of six ale—I gave it to him—he gave me a shilling—I broke it in two, and told him it was a bad one—he put his hand in his pocket, shook it up and said, "I have got plenty of money"—he was the same man who gave me the first shilling—I then looked in the till where I had put the other two shillings, and found they were bad—I sent the pot-boy for my master who was down in the cellar—I told him what had occurred, and he sent for a constable—at that time one of their companions came in and told them a constable had been sent for, and they all went away together in a horse and cart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How did you break the bad shilling? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the centre of the till—good shillings will break in that way, I believe—I received this other bad shilling on 29th April, from a woman who was with the prisoner and the others, when they carne in the last time—after they were gone, she came in and gave it to me, and said that they had given it to her—I broke it—that makes four.</p>

I am in the service of John Corby Thompson and others, warehousemen, 21, Bread-street—I am salesman in the silk depart<lb/>ment, which is on the first floor—there is a warehouse on the ground floor, with stairs leading up to the silk room—the prisoner was a porter in the house—on 16th May there were 10 pieces of silk that came in that morning left on the counter in the silk room—I opened them myself about 10 o'clock that morning, and placed them on the counter—this is one of the pieces—I was in the room all the morning till 2 o'clock—two or three buyers came in—I attended to them—they were respectable persons from the wholesale houses in the City, who I am accustomed to see there—I saw the silk safe after they had gone—I left it safe at 2 o'clock when I went out to my dinner—Mr. Court, the manager, then succeeded me—he came in before I went out, and I left him there—I left the silk safe at that time—I returned about half-past 3, and then missed one of the ten pieces.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am a labourer—I knew the deceased man Eames—on the evening of 19th April, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was walking along Bell-street, Paddington—I came in front of the Brazen Head public-house—I looked in there, and saw two men named King and Donogan fighting—I saw the prisoner there—he was doing nothing, but sitting on a seat—he came out and went across the road—I saw Eames come out of the Brazen Head shortly after, almost directly—he said something—the prisoner was then on the opposite side of the road, I don't know whether he could bear it—Eames followed the prisoner right across the road, and they both apparently com<lb/>menced fighting—they had scarcely commenced fighting when the prisoner hallooed "Police"—I saw them both in a fighting attitude, and saw them strike at each other—Eames returned back to where I was standing, and said he was stabbed—the prisoner went right away as soon as Eames returned back—I believe he went into the beer-shop—Eames did not show me any<lb/>thing—I did not see any wound or any blood—he fetched a policeman, and took him into the beer-shop where the prisoner had gone.</p>

I am a shoemaker of 52, Lisson-street—that is right opposite the Brazen Head—on the night in question I was at home looking out of my window—I saw the prisoner come out of the Brazen Head—he stood for a moment on the kerb, on the same side as the public-house—I saw Eames come out of the Brazen Head, I should think hardly a minute afterwards—he rushed at the prisoner in a fighting attitude—the prisoner ran backwards into the road, calling the aid of the police—I saw Eames strike at the prisoner, but I can't say whether he struck him—they closed after that in the middle of the road, and after they separated I thought Eames was stabbed—I saw him put his hand to his side as soon as they separated, and walk away—I had seen the prisoner make an attempt to strike the deceased an under-handed blow—I was not near enough to see whether it touched him—it was in the front part of his body—I never saw either of them on the ground—if they had been I think I should have seen them.</p>

               <p>living at 27, William-street, Lisson-grove. I was at a public-house called the Brazen Head in Lisson-street; the prisoner Murphy was in the public-house, but not in my company. I knew him before, but never had a quarrel with him. When in the public-house I saw him sharpening a knife with a white handle and small blade on his shoe. I heard him say, 'I will run it in,' but I did not hear him mention any name. He left the house, and I followed him outside the door. I said, "Do you mean the knife for me?" he said, 'Yes, or anybody who comes near me,' and he struck at me with the hand in which the knife was; he struck me about the ribs, but did not then wound me; I think the knife closed on his hand. I saw him open the knife. He then stabbed me where I am wounded. I can't say whether he said anything; he ran away. I found I was stabbed, and ran after him. He ran into a beer-shop in Harrow-street I saw a policeman opposite the Brazen Head; I took him into the beer-shop, and pointed out the prisoner. I am quite sure the prisoner is the man who stabbed me. I am sure the knife produced is the one the prisoner stabbed me with." <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner:</hi> "When I followed out of the Brazen Head he was not picking his pipe with his knife. After he made the first blow at me, and before he stabbed me, I hit him a blow on the ear; it was a blow with my fist. It did not knock him down. I met the prisoner at the Rose and Crown on Monday. I took 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from another man, but I did not know it belonged to the prisoner. I did not follow him from the Black Man to the Brazen Head, though I was at the Black Man when he was. I did not say I would pay him.")</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Mary's Hospital—on the night of 19th April the deceased was brought there between 9 and 10—he was in a state of collapse—his clothes were stripped from him, and there was a wound, and a large portion of intestine exposed through the wall of the abdomen—it was a small incised wound about three-quarters of an inch in breadth—the larger blade of this knife would produce such a wound—the direction of the wound was from below upwards, and a little inwards towards the centre of the belly, as if done by an under-handed blow—he was in con<lb/>siderable danger, so much so that I sent for the Magistrate to take his deposition—I was present when it was taken—he was then quite sensible—he was under my care until his death, which took place on 7th May—the death was caused by the absorption of matter from the wound—I have no doubt the wound was the cause of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had he lost much blood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—when he came in he was in a weak state from the shock, and continued so—he was a strong muscular man, but he had tubercles on the lungs—he was consumptive—that had nothing to do with his death—his examination was taken about three<lb/>quarters of an hour or an hour after he came in—he was put under chloro<lb/>form while the bowel was returned, but he had recovered from that and from the collapse when his examination was taken—we could not have replaced the bowel unless we had put him under chloroform, because we had to enlarge the opening to get it into the abdomen again—he lost a slight amount of blood at that time—he was perhaps a quarter of an hour under the chloro<lb/>form—his examination was taken immediately afterwards—he had recovered from the effects about a quarter of an hour—I apprehended immediate danger—I don't recollect whether any stimulants were administered to him before he gave his evidence—it would not be the ordinary course—I can't say positively whether any were administered or not—I heard him give his</p>

I did not go into the Black Man; I went to the Brazen Head, and loft them at the Black Man, and they followed me from the Black Man to the Brazen Head. I came out of the Brazen Head, and had my pipe in my hand, and was taking the stopper out with my knife. Eames followed me across the road, and hit me on the ear, and knocked me down; with that I had my knife in my hand, and my pipe in the other hand. He fell right over me when he knocked me down, and I believe that was the time he received the knife; I made no attempt to stab him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wire-rope maker, and live at Millwall—the deceased, John James Coghlan, was my brother—on Saturday night, 9th April, I was with him and another young man at the prisoner's coffee-shop, in Carr-street—it was past 12 when we went there—a man named French,—and another man were having a discussion about Garibaldi and the Pope. French made use of very strong language—he said, "B the Pope"—my brother said, "You ought to be ashamed of yourself; the man (meaning the Pope) never did you any harm"—my brother then said to French, "What good did ever Garibaldi do?"—French said, "You fool, what did ever you do?—my brother said, "How do you know that I am a fool?"—French said, "I am sure you are"—my brother said, "Can you make a fool of me?"—French said, "I will punch your head," and they stood up, and were going out to fight—the prisoner began to shove my brother about—my brother said to him, "Don't shove me about I can go out without being shoved out"—the prisoner said, "If you don't leave my house, I shall have you locked up"—my brother said, "I have done nothing, that I know of, that I should be locked up for"—the prisoner said, "If you don't leave my house, I shall do you an injury"—they got to the door, and he shoved my brother out on the pavement—my brother returned and opened the door with his left hand—he only looked in—he did not put his foot inside the door—he said to French, "Are you coming out to make a fool of me?"—the prisoner made a hit at him through the doorway; he then let the door shut, opened it again in a moment or so, and threw a chopper out at my brother—my brother called out, "Look out, here is something coming"—the chopper struck him on the knee—I saw it—he sat down on the pavement—he was afterwards carried back into the coffee-shop, and his leg was bound up—the policeman</p>

I wanted to pass by, but he prevented me. I said I had as much right to pass as any one else, and told him he had no business to stop me, and asked him why he did so. He replied, 'I will show you.' I said, 'Let me get out of the way first,' Then I went into the middle of the road first; he came after me, and we began fighting. I do not remember any blows being struck till I received a cut on the side of my cheek, and I was knocked down senseless; and on coming to myself I found I was in my bed, and my head, face, and arm, which were wounded, had been dressed.")</p>

                  </hi>. I am a traveller, and live at Cloudesley-terrace, Islington—on Saturday evening, 14th May, about half-past 8 o'clock, I was going down Commercial-street, Whitechapel, and saw the prisoners standing near the corner—they pressed upon me—Flynn was in front of me and Cousins in the rear—Flynn seized the brequet chain of my watch and I seized the guard chain, which I held fast, but the brequet chain being slight, it broke away—Cousins tried to knock my hat over my face, but knocked it off instead, and I believe I dealt him a heavy blow with my right hand on his cheek,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186406060041"/>
               <p>and he kicked me very severely in the groin—I had seized Flynn by the left tail of his coat, but in consequence of the kick was obliged to release my hold, and a large rent was made in the coat by a severe struggle between us—they both escaped.</p>

From information I received I went on 22d May to 10, Lavender-villas, Lavender-road, Clapham—I went about 3, and remained till half-past 10, when both the prisoners came in together—they went into the front room of the house—I told the male prisoner he was charged with obtaining a box from 10, Scarsdale-villas, Kensington, on Friday, the 20th, and that it was brought to his house in a cab on that day—he said he knew nothing about any box coming there—he brought no box—I then sent for Collins, the man who took the number of the cab, to identify him—at first Collins thought he was not the man—the prisoner then said, "You have no right to detain me, I want to go"—I told him he answered the description that I had, and I should detain him on my own account—I then sent for the cabman, and he identified him as the man he took in his cab with the box on the Friday—I then searched the room, and found the box, which has been produced, under the bedstead, and the cover—I found the different articles which have been produced in various parts of the room—the jewellery was found on the sofa where the female prisoner was sitting—before that I told her that before I parted with her I should like to have her searched by a female searcher—she rose, and I saw</p>

I live at 23, Severn-street, St. George's-road, and am fore-man to Thomas Fairchild, of Christian-street—on 3d May, I was going across Tower-hill, about 4 in the afternoon, and saw the prisoner there—he had a pair-horse van, loaded with casks of butter—he was lying down in the front of the van with a cask of butter by his side—the head of the cask was out, and he was digging out the butter with a piece of stick—another man was standing behind the van, and directly he saw me he ran up to the prisoner—he got up on the wheel and hit the prisoner, who said something I could not hear—the other man then get down and walked away—I watched the prisoner—he got out of the van, and drove the horses across Tower-hill to George-street—he stopped there, a constable came up and I told him what I had seen, and I went and fetched the prisoner's master—he came, and I told him I had seen the prisoner taking some butter out of a cask, and the prisoner said he had not been doing it—I turned the cask over to the tail part of the van, and showed it to the prisoner, and he said it was so when he received it—I found the butter, which had been taken out of the cask, in the nose-bag under the van, wrapped up in a piece of linen rag—I gave him into custody—Mr. Priestley said he should leave it entirely to me.</p>

I reside at 2, Ranelagh-mews—on Saturday, 21st May, I went out with the deceased about half-past 9—we went to the Manor-house, and had a pot of porter there between four of us—after that we went down the mews to look at some cattle, and had one pint more beer between three of us—we then went to the Old England public-house, and had a pot of beer there between four—we then went back to the Manor-house, and there had two pints between three—we then came back outside the Old England public-house—there was an oyster-stall there; I and the deceased had some oysters, and a man named Bacon treated him to a shilling's worth—when he had had a few Healey asked the fishmonger how many he had had—he said 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth, and we had only had 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth—Healey said the fishmonger</p>

I am a fishmonger—I sell oysters at a stall outside the Old England public-house—on Saturday night, 27th May, about two minutes to 12, Bacon came to my stall, and while he and the prisoner were there Healey and Fisher came up—Bacon put down a shilling for Healey to have some oysters—I opened them—there were some words about there not being the proper number—the prisoner said, "I don't think George would wrong you of an oyster; I have known him for some time, and I think he would rather give you half a dozen than wrong you of one"—Healey sad, "I dare say you know a b——y lot about it"—after that they got into words about coachmanship—Healey look at the prisoner up and down, and said, "I dare say you are a b——y fine coachman; it would be about your style to be kept to feed the pigs"—he had put a bottle on my</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at 10, Delamere<lb/>crescent—on Sunday morning, 22d May, I was called in to see the deceased at 2, Rane-lagh-mews; he was dead—I made a post-mortem examination—on ex<lb/>amining the mouth there was a bruise inside the upper jaw, just beneath the nose; it was about the size of a shilling, externally—there was no dis<lb/>colouration—on removing the scalp there was a quantity of effused blood, and there was a bruised spot, about the size of the palm of the hand, between the scalp and the bone at the back of the head—on removing the calvanium there was a quantity of dark venous blood, which, in my opinion, was the cause of death—the other arteries of the brain were healthy—I could dis<lb/>cover no smell of alcohol in the stomach, nor any appearance as if the man had been drinking to excess—the cause of death was extravasations of blood on the brain—a fall would cause that; it was not done by the blow—the mark on the lip might have been caused by the knuckles of a man's hand; that blow must have been sufficient to knock a sober man over.</p>

Q.</hi> Supposing you had heard nothing of the circumstances of the case, were the post-mortem appearances such as would be found in a case of apoplexy without violence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, taking the appearance of the bruise alone—the bruise at the back of the head might have been produced in a fall from apoplexy—it is probable, but not possible, that apoplexy might have arisen from passion, and from his having partaken too freely of porter—there was very little blood in the right cavity of the heart—in apoplexy you generally find the right cavity full and the left empty.</p>

I live at 62, Banner-square—on 8th May, about 3 o'clock in the morning, I was awoke by my dog barking in the passage, and on going to the window I saw Harris at the shutters of the parlour window of the Hope public-house, which is next door, and projects twenty feet in front of my house—the window is near a little wall, about three feet six inches high—I had a view of him—he had both his hands where the shutters meet—he then pulled with both hands, and with his left hand he pulled the left shutter open, and the right shutter with his right, making a noise—he then put his right hand to the centre window, just under the fastening, and then the glass fell, making a great noise—I did not see him strike it or see any instrument in his hand—I opened the window, and he turned his head up and looked me deliberately in the face—he then jumped over the wall into the garden of my house, and turned out at the gate, staggering us if he was drunk, and got out of my sight—Snape and a tall man were standing opposite me, rather to the left—there was a lamp opposite me—I saw the prisoner take both hands to the window to shove it up—he then entered the house—I threw up my window, making a great noise—I asked for my revolver, which my wife gave me, and fired four shots, while he was in the house—just as I had fired the fourth he came out at the window, placing two coats, one of which appeared very stiff, on the window cell, then he jumped over the wall into my garden, taking both coats under his left arm—he turned round the corner, and just as he got to the corner he made a run—there was a lapse of about a minute between each shot I fired—when I fired the first shot, the tall man, with Snape, walked about twenty yards, and came over by the window—I heard his footstep by the front of the door of the public-house, and then he went off—just as the fourth shot was fired, Harris was coming out at the window—Snape then moved from the tree where he was standing, and walked down directly opposite me under the light of the lamp, and then he went away as Harris went out of the garden with the coats—I then fired a fifth shot—Snape was talking with the tall man very loud, but I could not catch the words—just after the fifth shot was fired, 57<hi rend="italic">G</hi> came up—I told him what had taken place—Harris was sixteen or seventeen feet from me; no further then he is now, only he was rather down—I am certain Snape is the same person.</p>

I reside in the Stowage, Deptford, and am super<lb/>intendent of the General Steam Navigation Company's works in the creek—James Wilkins is chairman of the Company—on 17th May my attention was called to footmarks in my garden, which adjoins the factory—I went round the garden and missed a large copper steam-pipe, weighing a hundred<lb/>weight and a half or three-quarters, which had been lying in the yard close to the coppersmiths' shop—on looking about I found marks of the flange of a pipe, and sent for the police—I afterwards missed three pipes, which I saw at the police-station on the following Monday week—they were worth about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as old copper—I have frequently seen Hill about my premises, and warned him off.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 237). On Sunday morning, 15th May, I went to Mr. Beardmore's premises, and traced footmarks from the factory road, across the kitchen garden, to a field adjoining—I saw the marks of the flange of a pipe, and traced them over a hedge to a lane, where I lost all traces of footmarks; but I traced the wheels apparently of a truck to Pope's-buildings</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186406060060"/>
               <p>—on 16th May, between 2 and 3 in the morning, I concealed my<lb/>self with other constables at Copperas-lane, and between 3 and 4 o'clock the shutters of 13, Copperas-lane, were opened, and somebody, who is not here, came out and walked up and down, where I could see him, till 5 o'clock, when O'Connor came from the railway arch and joined him—they walked on in conversation, occasionally going into Fish-street—about a quarter past 5 Hill joined them, and then the stranger went away, leaving the other two; and at a quarter to 6 the stranger came back with a van, which was dragged to the end of Fish-street, backed up to some posts, the tail-board was let down, and shortly afterwards the stranger and O'Connor came out with one of the large pipes on their shoulders, and placed it in the van, while Hill walked to and fro between the van and where I was concealed with the other two constables—O'Connor and the stranger went and fetched a second and a third pipe, and placed them in the van, which drove away with the three still talking together—we then made our appearance, and as soon as they saw us they made off—I passed Hill to take one of the others, but did not succeed—the van was stopped by a constable—I knew the prisoners well before, and the other man also—they all passed by where I was before the van came—I almost touched them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Hil.</hi> I was going round the corner of the lane and met Mr. Turner. I stopped at my sister's door to get a clean slop and some money. One of the policemen said, "I shall have you." I said, "What for?" He said, "You know; come along," and then he accused me of stealing three copper pipes; that is all I know about it.</p>

I live at 2, Windsor-terrace, Sydenham—I shall be twelve years old on 8th July—I work for Mrs. Mary Ann Dean, a laundress—I take out the clothes—on 16th May I was sent to Mrs. Foster's to fetch some clothes, of Peak-hill, Sydenham—I had a wheelbarrow—before I went there I had received 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mrs. Charlotte—I tied it up in a corner of a towel—I received at Mrs. Foster's 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I put that in the same towel in another corner, and placed it inside on the clothes in the barrow—on going down Peak-hill the barrow turned over—the prisoner with a man was there—she said, "Shall I help you to take it up, my dear?" and she came over and helped me up with the barrow—I went down Peak-hill, the prisoner was walking by my side, and I was in front—they passed, and then I missed the towel—that was only two minutes after they lifted the barrow—they left me together—I went after them—I said to the prisoner, "Please have you picked up a towel with some money in it?" and she said, "No, my dear, I will go back to your mother"—she said she had not seen it—there was then another man on the other side of the road—I did not say anything to him; but a man coming down the road took something from the hedge close by where I had overtaken the prisoner; the towel I had missed—the money was gone—it belonged to Mrs. Dean.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sawyer of 10, High-street, Vauxhall, between half-past 5 and 6 on the afternoon of 18th May, I was in Webber-street, Waterloo-road, and went up to the prisoner's oyster-stall—I had two-penny<lb/>worth of oysters, and I paid for them—there was nothing unpleasant between us then—I then went to a public-house, and had some refreshment with another young man—we then went back to the prisoner's stall, and there were some persons larking with the prisoner—I took up a penny worth of whelks with the intention of paying for them, and he said, "The first person who comes and takes up my goods I will stab him with a knife"—I had not said or done anything to him—I took the whelks up, and was taking them round to the back of the board to the prisoner for him to take them out of the shell, and as I was doing so he made use of that threat, and came round to the left side of the board and stabbed me in the back—the whelks fell out of my hands—I was in motion when I was stabbed—it was a violent blow—it went through the sixth and seventh ribs, and penetrated the lungs—it caused me to spit blood for ten days—I had not taken part in any of the chaffing that was going on.</p>

I was passing down Webber-street on the 18th, and saw a great number of young men round this oyster-stall—I stopped a few minutes, and while there I heard the prisoner say, "Is not this shameful?"—I went over and there were some of them upsetting his oysters; others were upsetting his dishes, and some with whelks in their hands—I said to them, "You ought to be ashamed of yourselves," and the prisoner then said, "The first man that comes round to me again, I will stab him"—imme<lb/>diately afterwards he ran after the prosecutor and stabbed him in the back—I do not think he intended to do him grievous bodily harm, but in his temper he stabbed him—I thought the prosecutor was larking with</p>

I am a surgeon, of 19, Westminster-road, Southwark—on the afternoon of 18th May, the prosecutor was brought to my house in a fainting state—I had him unstripped, and found he had lost a large quantity of blood—his clothes were saturated with blood—he had a punctured wound on the back, between the sixth and seventh rib, rather behind, it had penetrated the lungs on the right side; such a wound could have been caused by this oyster-knife—at first I was very appre<lb/>hensive of its being a serious wound, but he progressed favourably—con<lb/>siderable force must have been used—it penetrated all his clothing.</p>

Day—it is not true that I had made use of bad language to the women; I am quite a different man—I am not capable of doing work now and never shall be any more, I am sorry to say—I have neither been able to dress myself or undress myself since—I went to my solicitor on the subject, and on driving home I ran against the long pole of a timber dray, and my cart turned over and I was upset.</p>

               <p>Wandsworth—I was called in on 13th December, to examine the last witness's back—I found a great pain at the shoulder, over the blade-bone, and there was a great deal of swelling—when the tumefaction and the inflammation had subsided, I detected a transverse fracture of the scapula—I found also injury to, and inflammation of, the spine—that was about the 17th of December—I should say he will never be able to do another day's work—either a blow or a fall would break the scapula—it must have been violent.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cooper, and live at 10, Borough-road—on the morning of 15th May, I heard a cry of "Murder!" at No. 1, Johanna-street, where the prisoner and the deceased lived—I climbed up on Mr. Turner's window-ledge—the little girl opened the window, and I saw the prisoner knocking Mr. Weston's head against the handle of the drawers and the drawers—he was lying on his belly, in his shirt—she was dressed—I hallooed out, "You beastly cow! if you don't let him alone, I will knock you down with this flower-pot"—she then let him go—I saw his head fall, and I called out, "He is dead"—she ran down the stairs, and the mother came up, and hallooed out," God Almighty, go and fetch my son; she will murder him! "I said, "He is already dead"—I was going to open the door, and as I was looking through the window, I saw the prisoner in the passage—she was drunk—she told me that I had got up there to rob the place; and if it had not been for me, she would have seen the last of her husband—I heard the the cry of "Murder" once or twice—it was the deceased's voice.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was that what you first heard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; this was between 1 and 2 in the morning—I was out like a great many more—I was along with two or three of my <hi rend="italic">pal.</hi>—I had been drinking with them—I was not drunk—I had not been fighting—there was a fight in Johanna-street between two women, and that is how I came to be there—I was seven or eight minutes on the window-sill—I did not speak to the prisoner more than I have said—I only called her a beastly cow—it would have made anybody call her names—I knew the deceased before that day—I do not know that he was subject to fits; when I first looked through the window he was trembling.</p>

               <p>and her mother in the prisoner's room on the morning in question—she was quarrelling with her mother, and trying to turn her out—she told me to mind my own business—I went home, and soon afterwards I heard the children's voices—I went out and saw Samuels on the window-ledge—I went into the house after the police-constable, and I there saw the prisoner's mother and the dead man, Stephen Weston—it was from five to ten minutes after I left their shop that I heard the children cry out—the dead man was lying on the bed, which was on the floor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon—I examined the body of Stephen Weston—I have heard the evidence—I think it is quite possible the prisoner might have killed her husband in the way described in two minutes, particularly if he was not well before—the injury to the head would be quite sufficient to cause death—effusion of blood on the brain was the cause of death—the whole of the back part and the side of the head was one mass of puffiness from recent blows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How recent? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Apparently quite recent—it is quite possible that all that could have been done in five minutes—that puffiness would arise in a few minutes—the wounds were such as might be produced by the head being knocked up against drawers, or from any violence, either from direct blows, or from the head being knocked—effusion of blood on the brain would be produced by wounds of that description—there were three clots of blood on the brain—they could be produced in five minutes—a man might get a great many knocks on the head in one minute—there was no fracture of the skull.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Supposing a man had been suffering from fits of delirium-tremens for weeks, would not that account for a number of the bruises that you saw, supposing he fell down in those fits? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> All except two or three bruises were perfectly recent—it was quite possible to inflict the injuries I saw, in from five to ten minutes—he might have been on his back when the injuries were effected—if a man was in a trembling state from delirium-tremens, the restraint of that would affect him unfavourably—very many men have died from delirium-tremens being restrained.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner is my daughter—I remember the morning of this sad occasion—Mr. Weston has been bad with delirium-tremens for several days—he tore the bed things to pieces, and everything; he must have been out of his mind—he got in and out of bed, and me and my son</p>
