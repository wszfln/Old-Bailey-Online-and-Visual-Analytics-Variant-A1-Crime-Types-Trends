                  </hi>. I was formerly an inspector of police—I am employed by the Mint—on 3rd January I went, in company with other officers, to 17, St. Ann-street, Westminster—we found the street-door open, and proceeded upstairs to the second-floor front room, the door of which we found securely fastened—there were two doors, one inside the other—I don't know whether they were both locked; the inner door was bolted—I have the inner door (<hi rend="italic">it was here produced</hi>); the bolt was sprung—the outside door we shattered to pieces—this is the oak post of the inner door—we broke open both the doors, and got into the room—we found the prisoners there in bed together—I had some conversation with the male prisoner of rather a coarse nature—I said to him, "It is quite certain you intended to resist, by all the means in your power, to prevent anybody making an entry in here"—he said he did not know what I meant—I said, "By placing this additional extraordinary strong</p>

I took the prisoner into custody on 27th January, in the street close by his own house—I said, "I am a police-officer, and shall have to take you in charge for embezzling various sums of money belonging to Mr. Mumby, your master"—he said it was a bad job, that he had been out collecting orders and monies, that he got beastly drunk in the evening part, and that in crossing Regent's Park he was garroted by three or four men, and robbed of every penny-piece he had about him—I asked him how they garroted him—he said by pressing his throat very tightly—I asked him if he did not come home in a cab—he said, "Yes, I did; I paid the cabman half a crown, which I found remaining in my pocket"—I asked him if he had given information to the police round about the Regent's Park, as there were plenty of them there, and park-keepers—he said, "I have not; I spoke to a policeman this after<lb/>noon in Homerton, and asked him what was my best course to pursue"—I asked him the number of the policeman, but he could not tell me—I then took him to Seething-lane station—after he was committed for trial, I told him that any inquiry I could make respecting the garotting I would willingly do, I would not care what trouble I took over it if he could give me the slightest clue.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a furrier, at 92, Bartholomew-close—the prisoner has been in my employment since October 4th, as a traveler—on 10th December I gave him instructions to obtain 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Messrs. Hills and Barnard, of Chelsea, for goods previously supplied through our traveller—on his return he was asked whether they had paid it—he said, no, they were out; they would pay the next time he was round—I asked for it once or twice afterwards, and he said they would send it down—on 24th December, the prisoner absented himself from the warehouse—this receipt is the prisoner's writing; it purports to be his receipt for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Messrs. Hills and Barnard, on my account—he never accounted to me for that sum—I have a customer named Ball, of Whitechapel, who purchased goods of my traveler to the amount of a guinea—I did not authorize the prisoner to receive that—it would not be due until 1st February—the prisoner has never accounted to me for it.</p>

I am the husband of the last witness, and am a tailor in Bread-street-hill—I recollect Cole coming to my shop on 1st January, and bringing a pattern of silk—he asked me if I thought I could dispose of it—I said I could not tell without I saw the piece—he went back and brought the piece over to me—he said it was half a crown per yard, nothing less—it was precisely like this—I believe he told me the number of yards, but I don't recollect the number—I gave the silk to my wife to pawn, and she afterwards gave me money, which she said was what she received for it—I gave that money to Cole with the exception of about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was to keep what I got above half a crown a yard, and to keep the ticket—Cole brought me silk four or five times—I handed the money to Cole, after my wife gave it to me with one exception, when I gave it to Tunn—they were both together on that occasion, I think—I don't think Tunn was present on any occasion when I gave the money to Cole—Tunn brought one piece of silk—Glick had two tickets and the officer had one—I don't know what have become of the rest—I had them—I don't know what I have done with the other two—I think my wife gave that one to the officer.</p>

I went with Sergeant Huggett and Mr. Hutley to Glick's shop in Long-alley—Huggett went into the shop, and I walked on with Hutley to the end of the alley, to a public-house—when we got there Tunn came out, spoke to Hutley, and went back into the public-house—I followed him in and there saw Cole—the prisoners were in conversation and drinking wine—I asked Tunn what his name was—he said, "Tunn"—I said to the other prisoner, "What is your name?"—he said, "Cole"—at that time I saw this parcel resting against Cole's leg on the ground—I took hold of it and said, "What it this?"—Tunn directly said, "It is a piece of silk"—I said, "Where did you get it from?"—he said, "I bought it of a porter about ten minutes past 10 this morning, at our office"—I said, "What did you give a yard?"—he said, "A shilling"—I said, "How many yards are there?"—he said, "It was sold to us at eighty-six yards"—I said, "Have you got an invoice with it?"—he said no, he had not—I said, "It is Mr. Leaf's silk"—Tunn said he did not know whose silk it was, but they bought it of a man—I told him that statement was not at all satisfactory to me, I was an officer, and they must consider themselves prisoners—I took them in a cab—on the way to the station I said, "Why, you have given Hutley a lot of other goods to pledge, where did you get them from?"—I said that to both of them—Tunn said they bought them of the same man—I asked him what he gave a yard for it, and he said, "A shilling all round"—I said, "Have you any invoices?"—they said, "No, we have not; that is where we are wrong," or "that is where we have done wrong"—I asked them both if anyone else was present when the man brought the silk, and they said, "No"—I said, "Were you both present when he did bring it," and they said "Yes"—I searched Tunn and found on him 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, a gold watch, a ring, a pin, and several other articles, and on Cole I found about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I think, in money, a watch, chain, pin, gold rings, and some memorandums.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-detective</hi>). I have heard Funnell's statement up to the time the prisoners were brought to the station—I believe it is correct—when they were brought to the station, I asked them whether they could give me any information about the person from whom they bought the silk—Tunn said, "A few weeks back we met a man, dressed as a porter, in Cannon-street; he asked us if we were buyers of hair nets, as he could get some cheap; we told him we were, provided they were cheap; we gave him our address in Bread-street-hill, and the next morning he called and brought us a piece of black silk; I asked him if he had got any nets; he said not then, bat we should have some; we bought that piece of silk; two or three mornings afterwards the same man called, and brought two pieces of silk; I still kept asking him about the nets, and he said we should have some; altogether we bought six or seven pieces of silk of him, which we afterwards give to Hutley, and he disposed of them; we were to give him a shilling a yard all round"—when the charge was read over to them, the name of Messrs. Leaf was mentioned in it, and they both said, "We did not know it came from Mr. Leaf"—I afterwards went to No. 2, Bread-street-hill, which might be about 300 yards from Leaf's warehouse—there was no appearance of business going on there; no fittings or furniture—the place was in a filthy, dirty state—no boxes with hair nets in them, or anything of that kind.</p>

I am a clothier, of 28, St. John-street, Clerkenwell—on Tuesday, 28th January, about 1 o'clock in the night, I was passing along Golden—lane, and the prisoner stepped out from a dark door<lb/>way, and hit me a violent blow on the side of my head with his fist, which knocked me down—he kicked me on my hips, knelt on my stomach, unbuttoned my coat, or rather tore the buttons off, and pulled it open—we struggled together—I got him by the collar and pulled him over me, which baffled his intention—I got up, and found three men and two women sur<lb/>rounding me—I cried out, "Police!"—a constable came up, and the prisoner ran away—we chased him through several courts into Golden-lane, crying out "Stop, him"—he was stopped by a constable, whose fingers he took hold of and wrenched them back, so that he has been under medical treatment</p>

               <p>ever since—he then sprang at the constable who gave chose with me, caught him by the hair, and dragged him to the ground—I tried to extricate his grasp and he got hold of my hand, put it in his mouth, and bit me on the knuckles, so that I have the marks now—two more constables then came up, and he pretended to be drunk, and laid down, but suddenly he took hold of one of the constables by the legs, and tried to lift him and throw him over, but we caught him—the prisoner then got up and kicked and plunged about—it took four constables to take him to the station—the three women, whom I had seen in rising from the ground, then came to me and gave me a hit or two, but a sergeant and six constables came up and then the women ran away—the prisoner was very violent at the station.</p>

I carry on the business of a lithographer and wholesale stationer, at 136, Minories, in partnership with Mr. Field—in the latter part of last year the prisoner Marcus called upon me—it was about two months ago: I can't say positively, it might be longer: it was about six weeks before I went to the Mansion House—he produced the two tickets which I have in my hand, and asked if I could manufacture tickets similar to those—I said I could—I asked what they were—he said they were tickets issued by private individuals over there—I surmised that he meant Poland, but</p>

               <p>that was all he said—he then said that Poland was in a state of insurrection—that they were going to have a new King, and that was the reason that these tickets would be wanted—he said they were equal to our pro<lb/>missory notes used over here—he asked me the price for 5,000 and 1,000—I told him if he called again I would let him know—he said he would call again the next morning—I saw nothing further of him until Thursday, 11th December—he was then alone—he first produced ten slips of paper which I have here, and asked me if I could manufacture similar ones—I said I could, but I suspected that they were money—he asked me the price for doing 100 of etch sort, that would make 1,000—he said he had heard from his father with reference to the two former tickets, and they would not be wanted—I told him to call again next day—in the meantime I made a communication to the Russian authorities and the police—on the following day Marcus called again with a companion, not now in custody, ordered the tickets, 100 of each sort, and left 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. deposit—he wanted them completed by the Tuesday—that would be the 16th—I said I would try to get them done by that time—he called on the Tuesday and wanted to know if the tickets were ready—I told him to call again on the Wednesday, which he did—he said he particularly wanted to have all the tickets delivered by Saturday, as his friend was going over on that day (I am reading from my notes taken at the time)—he impressed upon me very strongly the necessity of having the tickets done so that no one could tell them from the originals—on Thursday, December 18th, Marcus called again and I showed him the lithographic stone which is now before me—this is it with the body of the ticket upon it—on showing him the stone, he went to the door and called in the other prisoner, Herman; that was the first time I had seen him—the two examined the stone together—Marcus professed satis<lb/>faction, and introduced Herman as his friend who was going over on Saturday—Marcus asked me if I was willing to deal with Herman in stationery, and in return I should be favoured with a continuance of his orders for various tickets all the year round in very large quantities, provided they gave satis<lb/>faction—while they were looking at the stone they spoke to each other in a foreign language; I heard them, but could not make out what they said—I promised that the whole of the tickets should be done by 12 o'clock on Saturday—they then left—on the following morning about 11 o'clock I had visit from Marcus—he expressed dissatisfaction that the tickets were not completed, and said he would not have them at all, unless the whole of the order was completed that day, as his friend who was going over could not wait—I again showed him this lithographic stone—he promised to return at 4 that same day—he did so, and I showed him one of two speci<lb/>mens of the tickets—he wanted to take one away, but I retained it, and told him to call again at 5—he did so, and I gave into his hands fifty-two completed tickets—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them—he took them away with him—I told him if he came on the following Monday he might have the remainder of them—this stone has impressed upon it the back and front of this ticket—that stone was lithographed by me, and the tickets printed from it, by Marcus's direction—this other stone has lithographed upon it the border of the ticket, that was also done by his direction.</p>

I know nothing about them"—I said, "Ask him where he got them from?" pointing to Herman—he said something to Herman, who made some reply, which I did not understand, and then Marcos told me that Herman said he got them from a printer's—I then told him that we were officers, and must take them to the police—station, which we did, and searched them—Brett searched Herman—5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money was found on Marcus.</p>

When Scott was inside the shop at 5 on the Saturday evening, Marcus went to the shop and saw them printing these pieces of paper in the window—there was gas burning in the cellar, which is the workshop of Mr. Tewer, and the men were printing these things, which any person could see from the outside; I saw them printing—Marcus came up and saw it also; he then ran and fetched Herman to come and look, and they stood and looked at them for some minutes—I searched Herman, and found on him a pocket-book, containing some pieces of paper similar to those first produced, also two passports in different names.</p>

Bank of England note—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it has on it a stamped endorsement of "Miller and Son, Piccadilly," and some other endorsements, and my own name; I put that on it when she gave it me—I wished her to pay for the bedstead when it was sent home—she said she knew it was our custom not to leave the goods without the money, and she would rather pay for it at the time she bought it—I said I had not change in the house, and asked her to sit down while I sent for it, which she did—I sent Reed, our shopman, out with the note to be changed—the prisoner came into the counting—house to give her address, where I was to send the bedstead—I took it down—it was "Mrs. Beaumont, 1, Wellington—place, Britannia—street, City—road"—when Reed returned with the change, he handed me the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the prisoner 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave her a receipt—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she took it away with her—we paid the note away the same night—it was afterwards returned to us marked "forged"—I subsequently identified the prisoner as the woman who gave me the note.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> This public-house, the "Paddy's Goose," I never resorted to. I never saw the prosecutor until I met him at the end of Pearl-street, that is lower down towards the "Sailors' Home." I was talking to a female when he and the witness came by, both taking up the whole of the pavement; they seemed stupidly drunk; the prosecutor kicked over a tub of oysters. I said, "You will get into a mass;" he said, putting his hand in his pocket and pulling out 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., "Do you know where the Home is? "Yes," I said, "I am going up that way." He said, "I want to go to the 'Home;' will you have a glass of ale?" I laid, "I don't mind." We went to the next door but one, I said, "We can have a glass of ale hers, mate, if you choose to pay for one, if not, I will pay." "No," he said, "I will pay." Then we went on up to Wells street, and we turned the corner, when a man rushed out of the alley; the prosecutor was drunk, as I could see by his staggering about, and unfortunately I laid hold of his coat, but whether in so doing I opened it, I can't say. When I turned round I heard him say, "It is gone! it is gone! my watch is gone; he has taken it." I said, "Why do you not cry out?" Three of them ran down Wellclose-square. I suspected when they got to the end of the alley they could get no further. A policeman came up and asked what was the matter, the pro<lb/>secutor turned round directly, and gave me in charge for unbuttoning his coat When the policeman came up I was with the prosecutor. Is it likely, if I had stolen the watch, I should have stopped there; we had been run<lb/>ning after the man.</p>

               <p>to attend to his Teasel properly, as far as he was able, but he was sick—there was nothing that I know of which rendered it improper to start from Cardiff—if the vessel had foundered in that weather, and we had been obliged to take to the boats, we should have been in extreme peril—the <hi rend="italic">Indus</hi> came close alongside—I would not have minded being in the ship another day, but it was not prudent—I do not think she could have been saved; everything that could be thought of, and which I, as a mariner, could suggest to Rave her, was done—I was never at St. Paulo, but I have been close to it—I know that captains are in the habit of baring a little ven<lb/>ture of their own—I do not know whether the potatoes were ship's stores, or whether they were taken out as a speculation; there would be a large quantity for ship's stores, but not a large quantity for a venture—I do not know of any flour going out, I cannot say whether it, did or did not—there were some pickle jars, and a good quantity of preserved salmon, which I signed for—there was also a good quantity of perfumery; that was not for the sailors; there was a large case of it, and I think there was another case; there was one case of perfumed soap, and another of perfumery of another kind—I do not know whether there is a good return for perfumery on the coast of Africa—I was never out with Burton or Bertie before.</p>

               <p>me, and he produces that to the Consuls if he should put in on his voyage—this document in Latin is a bill of clean health—the content is the one that contains the amount of cargo—I keep these papers at the Custom-house, and have produced them—at the time the ship was cleared. Bertie forwarded me these three bills of loading, according to the statute—the clearance was quite regular in point of form—they are signed by my searcher—when he searches the ship, he signs the bills of lading, to say that, he has done so—he is answerable for that—I produce them from my office—they are either signed by Bertie or by somebody for him—it is by declara<lb/>tion they should be signed by him—I do not think Ruxton was present at the clearing of the ship, but he was within the precincts of the town.</p>

I was from 1859 to 1862 in the employment of Mr. Rux<lb/>ton—I left for a short time, and returned in March, 1861—these two bills are drawn by James Bertie—I know his writing—they are his writing—they are accepted by George Ruxton—the signatures to these other bills are in Ruxton's writing—they are advising the bills to the Union bank—the sig<lb/>natures to these bills of lading are Bertie's, the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Joseph How</hi>—the name of James Bertie, attached to this content, is Bertie's signature—I see Bertie's name on the back of these two bills—that is his writing.</p>

                  </hi>.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">H. W. EDDIS</hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). In the course of my business as an accountant, I have had great opportunities of learning the mode in which mercantile business is carried on—it is necessary to a certain extent in my business that I should be acquainted with the ruling prices of different com<lb/>modities—I was employed in this case to look into Ruxton's papers, and books—I received them from Carlisle—amongst others I received a parcel of papers tied up and ticketed "<hi rend="italic">Joseph Howe</hi>"—I found there a number of invoices, which I produce—I have compacted those invoices with the delivery tickets of the railway porter, and have a statement here showing the small points in which I have not been able to make them correspond—they do correspond, but with some trifling exceptions—I find hers two barrels and one tierce of sundries, four chests, and one trunk, received at car<lb/>diff, which I cannot identify with the goods received by the invoices—they are in the railway accounts, and I cannot find corresponding invoices—there are invoices for small goods, which, according to the ordinary course of business, would be packed in barrels and tierces to be sent by the railway—those small articles do not appear in the railway receipts—there are invoices for small articles in the railway accounts, barrels and tierces, otherwise they correspond exactly—among the invoices I find some for beer—I find an in<lb/>voice for 200 dozen quarts of pale ale, packed in fifty barrels, of four dozen each; 301 dozen pints of pale ale, packed in forty-three barrels of seven doze each; thirteen barrels marked R in a diamond, containing fifty-two dozen quarts of London stout; that makes ninety-three barrels, besides the thirteen of stout—I find no other invoices for beer—I believe a certain quantity of porter is taken as ship's stores—there is no mark in the invoice to the ninety-three barrels—I have seen the bill of lading which was pre<lb/>sented to the company—I have searched all Ruxton's papers, which were delivered to me, for invoices, but did not find any number of invoices which would make up the 800 dozen—there are a number of invoices and small accounts for amounts of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I see on one side an account of the goods, and on the other side the prices are carried out—I see a word here which may be "tons" or "tierces"—assuming it to be "tierces," it is quite impossi<lb/>ble that the prices could be the prices of those goods; it would be quite impossible to put one ton of cabin biscuits in a tierce, and supposing it to be "tons" the price could not correct, because the price given, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., would be approximating to the price of a ton, it would be rather above the price of a ton of cabin biscuits, rather au excessive price, and the same with the</p>

Ruxton"—it is an order on Mr. Car<lb/>roll, dated 22d December, 1860—I also find a receipt signed, "James Bertie," "Received of Mr. George Ruxton 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as wages, as master of the barque <hi rend="italic">Joseph Howe"</hi>—those were not pinned together; that was only done for the purpose of convenience—I also find an account of Mr. J.

                  </hi>. I am a private in the 3d Buffs—on the morning of the 6th January I was in the Blue Boar public-house in Rosemary-lane from about 2 until about a quarter to 3—that was after midnight—while there I saw Thomas Nennis and the four prisoners—I heard Malone say to the prosecutor, "I have paid for a quart of beer for you to drink, and it is nothing but right that you should pay for one for me before you leave the house"—the prosecutor said he had drunk no beer of his, and therefore he should not pay for any for him—there was then a disturbance between the prosecutor and Donovan—he struck the prosecutor—the landlord then turned out Donovan and Nennis—I did not notice which way they went—the remaining three prisoners followed them—I then left house, and was on my way across Tower-hill—I was crossing the top of King-street, and I saw Nennis and the four prisoners; one on top of him, and he down on the ground—Andrews had hold of Nennis by the throat—I took hold of Andrews, and struck him, and knocked him up against a shop door, and he was bleeding at the mouth at the time I gave him into custody—I went over again and I saw Donovan rifling the man's pockets—I said I would not let him loose until such time as I gave him into custody—I then saw Malone putting his hand into the prosecutor's left-hand breast coat pocket, and taking from it a pocket-book—I saw Bryan standing at the feet of Nennis; I cannot say whether he was getting any money from him; he was there implicated in rifling him—I afterwards spoke to the police—I saw Malone in custody at about half-past 3—two men made their escape just at the time the row was; the other two were collared.</p>

I reside at Warwick-terrace, Pimlico, and am solicitor to the Conservative Land Society, Norfolk-street, Strand—at about half-past 5 o'clock, on the 19th of January, I was walking up Holborn, on my way home—I bad my watch at the time—I wore it with an Albert chain, and fastened with a swivel inside my waistcoat pocket hole when I reached Weston's music-hall, some six or eight men intercepted me in my way, and one of them, the prisoner Reilley, seized my watch—he was not successful in getting it on the first attempt—another party called out to him, "Poll it; pull it," at which time I was confined by the arms at the back—I could not say whether by more than one—at the second attempt, Reilley got the watch—he did not make a second snatch—he never loosened his hold until he got the watch—he obtained it by wrenching the ring and straining the swivel, which was attached to my waistcoat pocket—the watch was given me afterwards without the ring—he ran away, and I ran after him—my arms were loosened as soon as he got the watch—he did not call out, but ran away at once—I ran after him, calling out as loudly as I could, "Stop thief! stop thief!" and I saw him until he was given into custody—I never lost sight of him—I did not see the other man doing anything, at that time—there was a scuffle among a crowd of 200 or 300 people—Pigott had stopped Reilley when I got up—that was a quarter of an hour or twenty</p>

               <p>about Cannon-street, and this aunt told her sister so, and Mrs. Pain told me she never could rest at the time, she was afraid Pain was about, he had been seen at Dockhead and different places—I never told her anything; it is only what she told me—she was in such a "flurry," she did not know where to go, whether to go down to her father's or not—I said, "I have got no money, so you must go to some relations"—I advised her to go to the workhouse—then she turned round and said, "I wish I went to the workhouse in the first place, and found my husband, as my father wanted me to do."</p>
