I got a warrant, and took him on the Thursday afterwards, the 23d of May. I know nothing particular of the prisoner's taking it, for I was asleep. The prisoner owned it to me, the constable, and the landlord of the house, coming up Hedge-lane, and before the justice who committed him. He said he had sold it to a silversmith in the Strand.</p>

I was in the next box to the prisoner at the Tylers Arms: the prosecutor was in liquor: there was nobody but them two in the box; the prosecutor was stooping down upon the table; I saw him take his watch out, look at it, and put it in his pocket again: he went to sleep. As the prisoner pulled the watch out, it was pretty tight in his fob, so it hit against the seat, and the glass broke: I heard the noise; I thought then it had been a pipe broke when I heard the glass fall upon the floor. I went down into the cellar; when I came up the prisoner was gone. I saw the broken glass lying upon the ground. We took him in St. James's Park; then he said he was drunk, or he should not have done it.</p>

            . I keep the Tylers Arms in Wardour-street: I went out of the room for about five minutes: the last witness told me when I came in, that the prisoner had stole the prosecutor's watch. I picked up some pieces of glass. I went up stairs; when I came down the prisoner was gone: there was in the room, the prosecutor, a soldier that was quartered at my house, and the last witness: I awaked the prosecutor, and his watch was gone. The prisoner confessed when we took him that he stole the watch, and that he sold it to a silversmith in the Strand for twenty-seven shillings: he confessed it in my house, in Hedge-lane, and before the justice: he said, if he had not been drunk he should not have taken it.</p>

I stept pretty quick to the door, he got out and ran; I pursued him and called out, Stop thief, and then he dropt this silver tea<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030005"/> Pot, (producing it.) I passed it and pursued him up Rupert street, still hallooing, and at last took him; and with the assistance of this man, brought him back to Mr. Swinton's house: we searched him, and out of one of his pockets we took this silver sugar pot, ( producing it) both of which, I swear, are Mr. Swinton's property; I saw the tea pot the evening before; the prisoner was never out of my sight.</p>

            . I live at Dowgate. I was coming from Highgate, on the 15th of May, in a cart, with the prisoner, about seven in the evening. In the back road, Islington, I laid down to sleep being a tired; I drove the cart to Highgate; he went with the cart for pleasure; there were three carts together. When I went to sleep one of the other drivers lay a sleep a long side of me; Chapman drove my cart for me; I waked rather before I came to <placeName id="t17710703-5-crimeloc27">Islington</placeName>

Chapman had a six and thirty and a guinea, and bought a watch with it, that night; I drove the cart back from Islington; I missed the two six and thirty pieces at Holloway; so in Goswell street I took my money out and counted it; the prisoner bought a watch. The next day I took them both upon suspicion; they denied it. I took them before the alderman, and they were discharged; afterwards Chapman was admitted an evidence.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Webb; on Saturday the 22d of June, the two prisoners came into the shop about seven in the evening; I suspected them when they came into the shop, therefore I counted the pieces that were in the wrapper; when I went to shew them the fifth piece they stole the fourth that I had shewn them; I saw Locket take it, she put it under her apron; I let her go out of the shop with it; I took hold of her when she got to the next door, I told her she had got a piece of lawn; she denied it, and then afterwards throwed it in the middle of the highway.</p>

               <p>Q. Before you proceed any further, did you make use of any means to obtain that confession?</p>

               <p>M'Dowall. Any lawful orders.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you once that Troope had given him this linen to pawn as his own, which he had bought in the city; and he said he carried it to pawn for him?</p>
               <p>M'Dowall. Yes, he said so; he said Troope had shewn him bills of parcels of linen bought elsewhere.</p>
               <p>Q. I will ask you fairly whether you have not said that you thought the prisoner believed it to be Troope's, and that he was imposed upon?</p>
               <p>M'Dowall. Yes, I do think so; but I should think he might know my mark.</p>

               <p>Taylor. The place where the bolt of the shutter comes through was strained and broke, and the sash of the parlour was broke; the shutters were open.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether that parlour window and the shutters were fast over night?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Yes; I tried them myself; I went to bed the last in the house, about half an hour after eleven, or near twelve o'clock; I throwed the sash up, and tried the bolts of the window shutters.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put the sash down again?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to know who broke open your house?</p>

               <p>Jones's Defence.</p>
               <p>The night this robbery was committed, (I work at the plaistering business for my living;) being out of work, I got up to go to market; I saw it was day light; I found when I got up the market was not begun; I went to take a walk; I came back just as I came to the end of Church-lane; I met with Pagett; he stoped me and asked where I was going to; I said to get my hod and shovel to go to market; he stopt me; I asked what for; he said I was not to go by myself; he gave the watchman charge of me; and bid him hold me; he was gone for near five minutes; I heard him cry out, stop thief all of a sudden; he let go of me and run after some other persons; I walked up Church lane about my business; I had not walked far before the watchman came and laid hold of me, and carried me to the watch house.</p>

I went there; she had been gone about three days. I went again, and Mrs. Duncan said she had been there and left two bundles. I went there several times; at last I met her at Mr. Duncan's; I asked her how she could be so ungrateful to rob me; she told me she hoped I would forgive her, she was sorry for it; and if ever she got into place she would pay me again. I desired her to go to shew me where the rest of her things were; I went with her to one Mr. Powell's, a pawnbroker, in Oxford-road; there I found two gowns; (the things produced in court,) I can swear to the gowns; she pledged the two gowns at Mr. Powell's.</p>

               <p>Mr. Frederick. That lad there, who is servant to a pawn-broker, came to me to let me know he had stopped a ring offered to him to pawn, and desired to know if it was my property; I went up to his master's house, saw the ring, and immediately knew it to be my property: this is the ring (producing it.)</p>
               <p>Q. How did you lose that ring?</p>
               <p>Mr. Frederick. I don't know; it was taken out of my room in the officers barracks, in the Savoy; I was upon duty at the Savoy at the time, but by whom I know not; it hung to the chain of my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you last see it?</p>
               <p>Mr. Frederick. I can swear to it within ten days, it might be less.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it not have dropped from your watch in the street?</p>
               <p>Mr. Frederick. No; I had not worn the watch for five weeks; it had hung up in my room, and neither the watch nor chain were broke, nor unscrewed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner employed in the Savoy?</p>
               <p>Mr. Frederick. She was employed by the woman that takes care of the barracks, to look after her children, consequently was in the Savoy, but had no business in my apartments. I never saw her to my knowledge in my life: I may have seen her about the Savoy: I never spoke to her in my life; and when I saw her at the silversmith's, it did not then occur to me that I had ever seen her in my life.</p>
               <p>Charles Conway. I am Capt. Frederick's servant. Yesterday week when my master dressed and went into the parade. I went into his closet with some of his cloaths; I found this

She said she came in for a wash-hand-bason; I asked her what business she had with any thing in my master's apartment; she made no answer, but turned round, and went away, I thought, into the kitchen, but I did not observe.

I went down then for Mr. Frederick; I saw his servant; he took his master's watch to him? he described the ring, and found it was his; my master sent for a constable, and secured her.</p>

I never was in Mr. Frederick's room that his cloaths were in.</p>

I had never seen him before to my knowledge. I saw in Surray's hand this waiter and silver spoon. Jennings said, if we would admit him an evidence, he dared to say he could take all the rest. I told him it was not in my power to admit him an evidence, but if he would shew me where to find the others, I would speak to the justice for him to be admitted an evidence. He asked if I would go after the girls first; I said, By all means. He took me to a house near Hog-lane: he asked at the parlour door, if Sall was come in; they said, No. He went up one pair of stairs, and asked there; they said, No. He came down, and looked into the yard, and said they were there. He desired not to be seen himself, but told us to go into the yard. We went into the yard; there the three women stood. I saw the parlour door open as we came in, and saw it shut afterwards. I thought they might be there; I forced the door open where the old woman lay: I said, Where is the bundle that was brought in here? She said, God bless you, Sir, it is under the bed. Allen gave the watchman the two nosles of the candlesticks, that hat, and an apron or two I found in the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Allen give the nosles to the man?</p>
               <p>Hawthorn. I did not; I was searching about the room. They were all tied together in one bundle, except the tea-chest, that was dropt on the road, and picked up by a carpenter. They are separated, Mrs. Bradshaw's and the maid's in two bundles; they were in one before.</p>
               <p>Court to Hatton. Look at the things.</p>
               <p>Hatton. These things are mine (repeating them) I carried the woman to the round house, and went with Jennings in search of the other women, but could not find them. I put Jennings in the round-house, and then went to Mrs. Bradshaw's and alarmed them. When Allen and Beeks were examined before the justice, they acknowledged that she had waited upon Jennings three or four times, in order to break open this house. Jennings had told his story then, and they acknowledged it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there no threats or promises?</p>
               <p>Hatton. No; none. The justice asked whose knife that was; Beeks said it was Altop's. Jennings was asked if that was true; he said, No. Beeks pulled it out of her pocket, gave it him, and he gave it to Allen; then she owned that it was hers. Allen owned that he opened the shutters with that knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Saytuss say any thing?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030018"/>Hatton. Only said, Me, me: I apprehended he wanted to be admitted an evidence. We had a suspicion he was concerned in the robbery and murder at Chelsea; we asked him if he was, and said he might be admitted an evidence, if he was. He said, Not me.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q That expression, Not me, might fit any other question as well as that.</p>
               <p>Hatton. By his answer I apprehended he understood that question.</p>

               <p>Jennings. He waited at the Noah's Ark, by appointment, for me.</p>

               <p>Jennings. To go to Mrs. Bradshaw's house. Allen said, if he would not go, she would go by herself.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you make him understand that he was to go to Bradshaw's?</p>
               <p>Jennings. By motions how to get him in to be lifted over the rails, to undo a door or window.</p>
               <p>Q. That he was to break open the house?</p>
               <p>Jennings. Yes. We went away about half an hour after ten, and were there by eleven.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did they stay?</p>
               <p>Jennings. Better than an hour. There was a woman looked out at her window, and saw us walking about; she called the watchman to her door. When the clock struck three, while the watchman went his rounds, they came out. Allen came out of the house; I was in the fields when she came out, she had a b undle and two silver candlesticks with the tops. Dunny Jemmy came out first, to see if the way was clear about, a quarter of an hour before the others; then Allen, and then Altop came out. Malloney had the waiter, the spoon, and tea chest; I took the tea chest out of his hand, and put it into Beek's hand. Dunny Jemmy took the bundle from

            . I worked with Mr. Williams; I had left a chest of tools upon Saturday night, the 8th of June, in my master's shop; I came there about five o'clock on Monday morning, I observed the chest broke and some of the tools taken out, and particularly the tools mentioned in the indictment; I am sure they were in the chest on Saturday night; upon looking further, I found the shop had been broke open, a board was taken out near the end of the chest, about four in the afternoon; I heard of them at one Mr. Blassan's; I went up to him; they delivered me the things mentioned in the indictment, they are my property; (produced in Court.)</p>

I am a carpenter; I went to work about five o'clock; Philips came to me and told me he had lost his working tools, out of his chest; in the afternoon as I was going to the shop, two little boys came to me and asked if I had lost any tools, they brought two plains; I said, I believed I know who had: I sent to Mr. Phillips; he came, and then the boys shewed me where they found them; with looking about, I found the augur; it was upon a dunghill, very near the shop; having discovered them in the dunghill; and having received the account from the boys, thought it proper to advise the prosecutor to let them remain there; and watch to see who would come for them.</p>
               <p>Phillips. In consequence of that advise I did watch; I left two plains there, and watched till about 10 o'clock, when a man came down the street and went behind a cart near where the tools were concealed; he went away again' I missed him at that time; he came again' and then seeing him search under the cart, looking backwards and forwards; I seized him, and found one of the plains in his pocket; which I produced; I charged him and he denied it: I promised to let him go, if he would bring me to the rest of the s, he confessed they were at one

Somebody proposed they should stand search; the prisoner pulled off his coat and waistcoat, and said he would leave them while he went backwards; I examined the prisoner's waistcoat; I felt the outside of the prisoner's coat pocket, and felt the halfpence.

I sent for an officer; before he came he took the money out, and said, Here is your halfpence; d - n your halfpence, I was only playing the joke with you; I intended to get a pint of beer of you, and threw the halfpence down; the paper burst, and the halfpence fell about the room. I never saw this man nor the people with him before in my life; he was very sober; though before the justice he pretended to be in liquor; when in custody he offered, if I would make the matter up, to have a meeting, and spend four or five shillings at my house; when I refused that, then he offered to give me a note of 20 l. and I refused it; then he offered 20 l. in money, which I refused.</p>

               <p>Breese. Sometimes; about two months ago I was at justice Welch's office; Atwood asked me to go along with him to take one Murphy, who had escaped out of Clerkenwell Bridewell; we took him out of a house in King-street, Seven Dials.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Atwood know the man's person?</p>
               <p>Breese. He said he knew the man; we went to a house; we enquired for him, and he came down stairs to us.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the person?</p>
               <p>Breese. No; he is not the person that came down stairs to us; that man was the brother of this

No; Atwood was going to put him in the round house till morning, for making his escape; we got him just to the corner of King-street, then they struggled together: they collar'd one another, and both fell down: while they were down the prisoner Murphy came and jumped with both his feet upon Atwood's breast.</p>
               <p>Q. With much or little force?</p>
               <p>Breese. Middling. Then Peter Murphy took the stick out of Atwood's hand, and hit him over the head with it; and then hit him in the mouth, and knocked one of his teeth out.</p>

               <p>Breese. No other provocation than seizing his brother; then he beat him over the ribs.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do?</p>
               <p>Breese. Goddard took me away and kept me in hold; I was about a yard off from him; there was Goddard and some other people, a fort of a mob, round me; they would not let me go to assist Atwood.</p>
               <p>Q. You are positive you saw all this very plain?</p>

               <p>Q. You say he continued to beat him some time; how did this end; when did he leave off?</p>
               <p>Breese. After he had given him some blows over his ribs with his own stick; Murphy made his escape; then the Murphys made off,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030023"/> and Goddard kept me some time after; then Atwood went to a house in Monmouth-street, one Mr. Dawson's, a cloaths shop, to wash his mouth; when Goddard let me go.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not beat, was you?</p>
               <p>Breese. Not then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Atwood complain?</p>
               <p>Breese. Yes, very much, of his ribs being sore with the blows he had received; his jaw was broke.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was broke; it might be bruised perhaps?</p>
               <p>Breese. The apothecary said it was broke; then we parted and he and I went home.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he live after this?</p>
               <p>Breese. I believe about a fortnight; but he always complained of the wounds and bruises; he chiefly complained of his ribs.</p>
               <p>Q. Not complain much of his jaw?</p>
               <p>Breese. No; chiefly of his ribs.</p>

               <p>Breese. Yes; he always complained.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he keep his bed?</p>
               <p>Breese. I mostly saw him in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. You know nothing whether any body had made their escape or not?</p>

               <p>Q. What had Atwood like to have got the better of Murphy?</p>
               <p>Breese. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any cry raised upon you; what did they say you was?</p>

               <p>Breese. No.</p>

               <p>Breese. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say when you went?</p>
               <p>Breese. We said we had a letter from Murphy's brother on board a ship; he came down to us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he invite you to eat and drink?</p>
               <p>Breese. Yes; but we would not go to up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the man that invited you to eat and drink, or the other man?</p>
               <p>Breese. Not the prisoner; the other Murphy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say you had any authority to lay hold of him?</p>
               <p>Breese. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How did Atwood behave to him?</p>
               <p>Breese. He laid hold of him by the collar.</p>
               <p>Q. Violently?</p>
               <p>Breese. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell him what he came for?</p>
               <p>Breese. He said, to take him for escaping out of Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he repeatedly ask you to shew your authority?</p>
               <p>Breese. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did they drag him?</p>
               <p>Breese. To the end of King-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear positively that the prisoner Murphy jumped upon Atwood as he lay upon the ground?</p>
               <p>Breese. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030024"/>Q. There was a great number of people, were there not?</p>
               <p>Breese. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say?</p>
               <p>Breese. They said, Knock them down.</p>
               <p>Q. For what?</p>
               <p>Breese. Because we took him upon a wrong cause.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Murphy do any thing more than endeavour to get away?</p>
               <p>Breese. No; only in doing it he knocked him down and the like.</p>
               <p>Q. The next morning you took Murphy, the prisoner, at his lodging?</p>
               <p>Breese. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take him to?</p>
               <p>Breese. To Justice Welch's office.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed there?</p>
               <p>Breese. We took him there with a warrant; he charged Atwood with dragging him about in the street in a wrong cause.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Atwood say that Murphy had struck him?</p>
               <p>Breese. Yes; that he received the blows from Murphy.</p>

             very well; I have heard him often talk that he knew him and his brother for some years before he was a prisoner. He came home much bruised; he had a cut a-top of his head, and a violent blow upon his jaw, which appeared afterwards to be broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you how he came into that condition?</p>
               <p>Walbank. He told me it was by retaking of Murphy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he relate any part of the story to you?</p>
               <p>Walbank. He told me he had taken him, but he was rescued from him in the street; some considerable way from the house; he said they jumped on him, and beat him, and rolled him in the kennel; he declared that the brother that came down the next morning was not the Murphy he had taken, but his brother: that he knew him very well.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not mention any person in particular?</p>
               <p>Walbank. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your method when a person escapes; do you get a warrant and take them before a magistrate or how?</p>
               <p>Walbank. We take them; we apprehend we have authority under their old commitment.</p>
               <p>Q. These runners are officers belonging to the prison I suppose?</p>
               <p>Walbank. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose any person escapes out of your prison, who is sent to retake them?</p>
               <p>Walbank. We go that have the best intelligence, and are most likely to take them again; we went next morning to Mr. Welch's office.</p>
               <p>Q. For what?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030025"/>Walbank. For a warrant for the assault.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he get the warrant?</p>
               <p>Walbank. I was not there; this Murphy came and represented himself as being the Murphy that Atwood took first; but he said to the hour of his death that this was not him; he declared he had hold of the right man; it was reported that he had taken Peter instead of Daniel.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after these blows did he die?</p>
               <p>Walbank. The 24th of May; twenty-four days after he received these bruises: he constantly declared that the ill usage he had received was the occasion of his death; he was very sensible to the last hour.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. The usual employment of these runners, I understand, is to take the prisoners from the prison to the justice's and back again?</p>
               <p>Walbank. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Atwood the commitment about him by which Murphy was committed?</p>
               <p>Walbank. He was committed by order of the court.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he that order about him?</p>
               <p>Walbank. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any charge being given to Atwood to take Murphy into custody?</p>
               <p>Walbank. A charge to take him wherever he could find him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear such a charge given him?</p>
               <p>Walbank. No doubt but my master gave him a charge as he had made his escape.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray was you present at the justices next day?</p>
               <p>Walbank. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The deceased was often in scuffles, being a runner in taking prisoners?</p>
               <p>Walbank. I never knew him to get hurt; he was never capable of doing any thing afterwards.</p>

            . He refused; he said, Come out and I will shew you the letter. When I came out the deceased laid hold of me and dragged me away; he would give me no satisfaction what he took me for; they never said that I had made an escape; they told me they would dash my brains out if I would not go with them; being a powerful man he knocked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030026"/> me down; he was going to stamp upon me, and dragged me five or six yards; he struck me first, and there was a struggle between us; I cannot say whether I struck him or no; I was so stunned when he knocked me down. Before Mr. Welch they had nothing to alledge against me; and they desired us to go and make it up. Mr. Cox said if we were not friends when we had been over to the White Hart we had better go and make it up; they advised me to make it up.</p>
               <p>Goddard's Defence.</p>
               <p>I am an innocent person; I know nothing of it any further than being looking at them, as other people were; It was close by my house; they brought him a letter; he was a lodger of mine; I called him down stairs; I had nothing to do in it. I did not assist in this fray any further than looking on, which I have witness here to prove.</p>

               <p>Rogers. Yes; more powerful than the prisoner at the bar.</p>

               <p>Rogers. Drag him along the street.</p>

               <p>Rogers. Yes; more powerful than the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what passed between them?</p>
               <p>Rogers. The more powerful man had Murphy by the collar, dragging him along; they both had hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they pull him along violently?</p>
               <p>Rogers. Yes.</p>

               <p>Rogers. I know not.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did they drag him?</p>
               <p>Rogers. To the further end of the street; thirty or forty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they ask him any questions?</p>
               <p>Rogers. I did not hear them.</p>

               <p>Rogers. They had.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a hat on?</p>
               <p>Rogers. No; he had not. I went afterwards, and Murphy had got from them: he had no stick, or any thing in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they hold of any other man before him?</p>
               <p>Rogers. I saw them have hold of no man but

            . I am an apothecary in St. John's-street. I have in my hand some minutes I made at the time, in my own hand writing; I attended the deceased on the 21st of May.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you attend him before?</p>
               <p>Mr. Burnet. No. He had a quick pulse; a great heat, and great difficulty of breathing. Upon my enquiring if he had any particular pains, he told me the small of his back was considerably affected; I judged, his kidneys: I found his water black: I judged there must be some degree of putrefaction: I thought it impossible that his life should be saved. I sent my servant to take some blood from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a certain sign of putrefaction?</p>
               <p>Mr. Burnet. Yes; except in a jaundice, it is generally allowed so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how he came by it?</p>
               <p>Mr. Burnet. He said he had had a beating; I did not enquire particulars: he was then almost a dying; he died the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the outside of his body?</p>
               <p>Mr. Burnet. Not at all; I found him so near death, I did not chuse to disturb him. I advised him to be reconciled to what would shortly happen. I saw no possibility of his life being saved.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any mark upon the side of his face?</p>
               <p>Mr. Burnet. Yes; after his death: I saw it when alive, but did not examine it; he had a poultice upon the side of his face.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not examine the jaw?</p>
               <p>Mr. Burnet. After his death I did, and found his jaw was fractured; there is no dispute of that; the right jaw.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not open the body?</p>
               <p>Mr. Burnet. No; his wife informed me the coroner would sit upon his body: on Monday I said the body should be opened; she brought me back word she did not chuse it should be done till the coroner came; then there was such a state of putrefaction, that no gentleman would have chose to open it: the coroner did not sit till Monday evening, about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. to Walbank. How came the coroner not to be sent for sooner?</p>
               <p>Walbank. He said he was obliged to go to Chiswick upon some affair that happened there; and the next day being Sunday, he could not come till Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. to Burnet. Upon the whole, by what you saw of it, without opening the body, what do you imagine to be the occasion of this man's death?</p>
               <p>Mr. Burnet. I could very readily answer your lordship's question, did I not consider that this man, since the accident, had been confined in the Compter; how far that might produce a fever is impossible to say; he was in Wood-street Compter; it was for serving a Compter warrant in the city, or something of that sort, and, I believe, was only discharged the evening preceding my attendance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any bruises?</p>
               <p>Mr. Burnet. Only those common bruises that will be after a body is dead; the blood will settle.</p>
               <p>Q. You are pretty clear the fever was the cause of his death?</p>
               <p>Mr. Burnet. Yes; I would be very tender in my evidence, when I consider the lapse of three weeks; his jaw was fractured; I believe there was a cup full of atter ouzed out when I touched it with my finger.</p>
               <p>Q. The colour of the water is an indication of a putrefaction?</p>
               <p>Mr. Burnet. Yes; his wife mentioned to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030028"/> me that he had black water all along; I know nothing of that.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. If the kidneys had been so putrefied as to have occasioned the water to be black all along, do not you think he would have died before that time?</p>
               <p>Mr. Burnet. The putrefaction might spread; I don't say it was of that colour at first; it was then the colour of the grounds of coffee. Had he not been sent to goal, I should have thought it came from the bruises; but it might arise from a fever occasioned by the confinement.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Atwood. When had your husband any of this discoloured water?</p>
               <p>Atwood. The day after he received the blows.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell me any thing before of his being confined in the Compter; how came you to conceal that?</p>
               <p>Atwood. I did not know I had any occasion for it; he was very bad before he was had to the Compter; he was had there a week before his death; he died on Friday; he was in from Friday till Tuesday.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he in a very bad way when he was carried there?</p>
               <p>Atwood. Yes; very bad; he never was out of his bed; he had kept his bed but one day before he was there.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me just now he kept his bed a fortnight before his death?</p>
               <p>Atwood. It was near about that; he was in bed in the Compter all the whole time; his water grew black the day after the blows, and continued blacker and blacker till the day of his death.</p>
               <p>Murphy. I was told this man fought in the Compter.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any witness of that?</p>

            . I deal on coals, and live in St. Giles's. I was standing at my door; I saw two men pulling the prisoner Murphy along by the collar. He said, What do you pull me for? I said, You shall know what it is for. As they passed my door he said, I will know what it is for before I go much further.

I kept my guard; I wanted to draw my sword; but had not an opportunity, least, if I dropt my guard, they should get in upon me; I struck the other man a violent blow on the side of his head, which I believe stuned him; after that as I retreated back he did not advance upon me; this man advanced faster than the other; I changed my stick to my left hand; I thought it my only opportunity to draw my sword; he advanced upon me; he went to make a blow at me, I stept forward and took him a lone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner cock his pistol again?</p>
               <p>Mr. Croker.

               <p>Q. Did not he see him fall?</p>
               <p>Mr. Croker. I do not know, the prisoner lay upon the ground about half a minute; he got up and went two or three yards and down he dropt again; I did not know the consequence of my staying to take him; I went away and left him there; next day I went to Sir

            . I am a surgeon in St. Bartholomew's hospital; last Sunday threeweeks, the 9th of June about twelve o'clock the prisoner was brought into the hospital; I asked him what was the matter with him; he told me he was wounded in his breast; I asked him how, he told me a coming over the fields, between Pancrass and the Small pox hospital, he was stopt by a couple of footpads, who demanded his money, that he told them he was a poor man and had none; they insisted upon searching his pockets: he told them they should not; upon that one of them stabbed him with a tuck; upon which he fell to the ground, and they then searched his pockets; finding nothing in his pockets they took away his shoes and coat; that he lay sometime before he was able to get up; he got up at last with difficulty; got home, and from there was brought to the hospital; the wound was on the right side between the fifth and sixth rib, it went obliquely downwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it seem to be done with?</p>
               <p>Mr. Iveside. A three edged instrument, and probably a tuck.</p>

               <p>I went out to take a walk along with a particular acquaintance of mine, that I know on the other side of the water, at the time I made an elopement from my wife; he was going into the country asked me to take a walk with him; I condescended to go part of the way with him; we went towards Hampstead, we stopt by the way and had a glass at some of the houses: it was rather late when I got home, it was about half after ten o'clock, when I met with these two men, and received the wound; one was rather behind the other; the first man that came up collared me; he tript up my heels and demanded my money; I told them I was a poor man, I worked hard for my bread and had none; he insisted to have it; he took about nine shillings and some odd halfpence out of my pocket; I changed half a guinea at a house before I left it; he took the silver out of my pocket, and left I believe two or three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030032"/> halfpence, which they found in that waistcoat pocket, when I was carried to the hospital; after they got the money they wanted my cloaths, which I refused to give them; one of the men stabbed me with some instrument in a stick, as I took to be a tuck, or whatever they call it; I fell down, and got up, it deprived me partly of my senses; they stript me of my coat, hat, and shoes; I had plated buckels in my shoes, which I suppose they thought silver. I made the best of my way home; when I had recovered myself I met a couple of people upon the way; I begged them by the tender mercies of God to assist me in prayer, for I was a dead man I believed; they left me; I went away as fast as I could; when I got home they sent for a surgeon; the surgeon said I was stabbed by some means or other; they said as I was a poor man and not able to pay the expences, they would take me into the hospital; my friends carried me to the hospital; the next day this gentleman came and said, I was a man that stopt him upon the high-way and made an attempt to rob him; it was well known I always was a hard working man, and worked hard for my bread; I have no witnesses: I am a <rs id="t17710703-24-deflabel145" type="occupation">shoe maker</rs>

            . About the 17th of May, I am not certain to the day. I was coming home about ten at night; I came to the sign of the Beehive, in a lane going down to Wapping, at the top of Nightingale lane; going past the door the prisoner and some other women asked me to treat them with a pot of beer; they said they would join with me. I went in with them; then they asked me to treat them with some lobsters; I had got a little drop and was merry; I paid 6d. for three lobsters; then she called in a friend of hers, who she called Carraty Sall,

            . The father and mother of the child are acquaintances of mine; they live about two streets of from me. I went to Mr. Sharpe's to get a pot of beer; he keeps a public house. Mr. Sharpe has three children; I saw the two youngest at play. I asked where Betty was; Mrs. Sharpe said she was not well. I went up, and asked her how she did; she said, very bad. I said, is it a fever or a cold; she said she had got an odd running upon her. I asked her what; she said her mammy could tell me; she said she was sore where she made water. I look'd at her; she look'd very much swelled and inflamed; her shift was discoloured. I said, I am afraid some little boy has been playing tricks with you, or some man; and if you don't confess the truth, your mammy won't get you cured, and you will die. Then she colour'd, and burst out a crying, and said I will tell you who it was if you won't tell my dada; I said I would not, but would tell her mama. She said it was Mr. Craige. I asked her who he was; she said, the man that work'd for her father. I asked her how he met with her; she said she was playing with some peas, tossing them up upon the bed, as she sat in the room playing with her doll. As she went to get some of the peas, he throw'd her upon the bed, and did something that hurt her, and pressed her so hard upon her belly that she could eat no victuals all next day. I asked why she did not tell her mother; she said she was afraid: for he had told her, that if she told it, her father and mother would beat her. I asked how long she had had this running; she said, on Tuesday, the day before. I asked her if he had had any thing to do with her; she said, yes, some days before, I can't remember what day; and in the whole, three times, on different days.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you when the first time was?</p>
               <p>Burt. Yes, upon Good Friday: the last time was the Monday, I think, before it was found out. I went down stairs, and told Mrs. Sharpe of it, and call'd in Mr. Sharpe, and told him. He went to the justice, and had the prisoner taken up; I had seen the man before, but did not know his name.</p>

            . When I had taken the prisoner up, as I was going to the justice he turned his head about and look'd at me. I said, How can you look me in the face after you have used me so ill, though I have been a father to you; he said his heart was ready to break.</p>
               <p>Q. He denied the charge I suppose?</p>

            . I keep a public house, the Marquis of Granby, in Chick-lane: on the second of this month, about half past twelve in the forenoon, the prisoner came into my house for a pint of beer; she sat down in a box at the end of a table, there were other people besides myself present; one of them said she had a suspicion the prisoner was doing something not right; we found'd pot tied to her side, she, attempted to get out, but we stopt her: there were two more pint-pot in each of her pockets; I sent for an officer and took her into custody, the pots had Mr. Smith's mark upon them; I sent for him, (the pots produced and deposed to by the prosecutors)</p>

On the nineteenth of June, about half past eleven o'clock, I saw the two prisoners, within about two hundred yards from where the carravan was, coming up Whitecross-street, each had a piece of iron upon his shoulder; I suspected them; I cried, Hallo; upon which Page dropped the iron, and ran away; but, as to Hozier, I secured him with the iron upon his shoulder.

On Saturday morning, the fourth of May, a little after one o'clock, my wife awaked me, and said she heard strange voices, and saw a light in the room adjoining to where I lay, in which room the scholars lay; I was going to speak to them, or hollow out of the window: Mrs. Hickman reminded me of a great bell that was in the room; I rung it; the thieves were alarmed, and run away. When I went down, stairs, I found a window open, in a little scullery, that I had left fast over night; the shutters were thrown open, and the bolts of the shutters wrenched. I have no doubt but they came in there.</p>

She came up and told me the fowls were all stolen. There were about ten lost. Among them two cocks and two hens. I think they were safe over night, I did not see them put up myself; I saw them some time the day before. About four o'clock I came to London, in order to find out who had taken them. I went to Leadenhall market, and found my two cocks and hens in a basket alive; there were nine in the basket. I asked the person that had it the price of them; he did not give me a direct answer about them: I looked several times: at last I said I was sure they were mine. The man then said, If they were mine, he knew nothing of them; he bought them at four in the morning at the Ship in Rosemary Lane, and said he would go with me there. I went with him. The two prisoners, with Parsons, were there; I took hold of him, but he got away from us. Upon going in, and Lucas being pointed out, we secured him. Eagles ran out at the back door. Lucas then informed us where to find Eagle. He was taken up on the other side of the water.</p>

I was going early to market between four and five o'clock on the eighth of June, to buy some fowls. As I was going by the Ship, I was called into that house, where I saw the two prisoners, and another person; I am sure they are two of the people that are there.

I went away, in obedience to my master's orders, to watch what he would do: he went into the compting-house, and opened the counter (that is, the top that lifts up at the counter) and took out a purse: he took the money out of it (that is, poured all out) he took what he chose, and put the rest in again. As soon as he was gone from the counter, and had shut it down again, I immediately laid hold of his collar, and said: You rascal, I have now catched you. He had the money then in one of his hands; upon my taking hold of him, he laid the money out of his hand, upon another counter that was there, and said to me, God bless you, don't say any thing against me: I came here for a sheet of paper.

I said, Why I believe you have something of my mistresses under your petticoat; I said, If you don't come and let me examine you, I must take hold of you. Well, says Hawkins, if you do you must have a run for it; upon which I said, I will have a run for it: Hawkins run as fast as she could; I followed her; I happened to fall down; I called out stop her; Mr. Bishop, a neighbour, run after her; I got up and run after her as fast as I could: I saw Hawkins come out of Mr. Hurley's yard, she had not then the cardinal about her; I took hold of her.</p>

            . I am a weaver in Fleet-street; Clarke the deceased used to draw patterns for me: I saw him about twelve o'clock, the day he was killed, at his own house; he was coming with me up Half Nichols street, Spital-fields, to look at some work; we were attacked by two men, the people increased very fast; they called after him,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030045"/> " There goes Clarke, that blood-selling rascal" or to that effect; he turned round to speak to them, and expostulated with them; I told him he had better come along; they threw stones at him; after he had turned up a little street, I saw two men knocking him down; we ran; I did not look behind me till I saw him upon the ground, after I came into Cock-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did you run?</p>
               <p>West. Strait forward; he turned up a little turning which leads into Cock lane: I saw him upon the ground: then he and I went different ways.</p>
               <p>Q. But the way he and you went, both came into the same street again?</p>
               <p>West. Yes, in Cock-lane; there I saw him down, with his hat and wig off.</p>
               <p>Q. Was nobody with him when you saw him down?</p>
               <p>West. I saw two or three men: I saw one man kicking him: I cannot tell what kind of a man he was; I saw Clarke get up, and he ran into Mrs. Snee's house: that is all I saw of him; then I came away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they follow him to Mrs. Snee's house?</p>
               <p>West. I saw several people about the place.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go?</p>
               <p>West. I went to his house, and told the person he lived with, which I understand now is not his wife; that he was at Mrs. Snee's, that he had been attacked and lost his wig: I desired her to take him a wig.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire her to carry any thing else to him?</p>
               <p>West. I told her I thought it would be necessary to take his pistols, for fear he should be attacked again; he was desired by the justices to carry pistols in his pocket, for fear of being attacked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of the stones hit him?</p>
               <p>West. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. What o'clock was it then?</p>
               <p>West. Between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was from the time he was attacked till you went off?</p>
               <p>West. Not above half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of weather was it, that day?</p>
               <p>West. Scorching weather, afterwards I fancy it rained.</p>
               <p>Q. What o'clock might it be?</p>
               <p>West. Near one: it was half past twelve when we left his house.</p>

            . I live in Cock-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew Clarke, I believe?</p>
               <p>Snee. Yes; I had seen him five times.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his coming to your house?</p>
               <p>Snee. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was that?</p>
               <p>Snee. I thought about tweleve; my people tell me it was about one.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your door open?</p>
               <p>Snee. He opened my latch and ran in he was bloody: he was cut over his eyes, and had no wig on; I said Lord have mercy upon me  what is the matter Mr. Clarke: he said, I beset; I said who has beset you? know says he: he walked about the house, we gave him water and washed him, he said when he came in,</p>
               <p>"Lock the door, for God's lock the door." I did, and shut the inside shutters of my windows: he was very disconsolate. After he had been there some time, he desired me to send for his wife: he said,</p>
               <p>"this is the finishing stroke; this crowns</p>
               <p>"the work:" he desired me to send for his wife, for he had no wig, he asked me to let my daughter bring his pistols: my daughter went and met Mrs. Clarke coming in Shoreditch with his pistols; she brought them, he desired her to go back and fetch him a wig, and bring his powder box with his gun powder, which she did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was she before she returned again?</p>
               <p>Snee. Half an hour, to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. In the mean time did you hear any noise at your door?</p>
               <p>Snee. Yes, now and then; but they turned down the corner of the streets; and our door was pretty clear when she came the last time.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that, did the people call out?</p>
               <p>Snee. Yes; several times, they peeped thro' the window and said,</p>
               <p>"D - n him,</p>
               <p>"there he is: turn him out, let us hang him,</p>
               <p>"or burn him, or any thing, let us do something</p>
               <p>"with him."</p>
               <p>Q. When the wife came, it was pretty quiet then?</p>
               <p>Snee. Yes; and he came out then with his hands one in one pocket and the other in the other, upon his pistols; he went out with his wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030046"/>Q. How long was he in the house, in the whole?</p>
               <p>Snee. Upwards of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he and his wife went out together?</p>
               <p>Snee. Yes, and a little boy; they went a little way, not half a stone's throw, and when the mob saw the corners of the streets beset they came running round him; I was at my own door, I saw a great mob, then he run back again.</p>
               <p>Q. With his wife and boy?</p>
               <p>Snee. No; they came back no more.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose that was but a few minutes after they had left your house?</p>
               <p>Snee. Yes, a very few minutes; then he stood at my door, he took his pistols out; a fellow coming up to him, he said,</p>
               <p>"I will shoot you," the fellow took his stick and held it up to his face, and said,</p>
               <p>"D - n you do." Mr. Clarke could not let the pistol's off, so he pushed into the house, and I shut the door and locked it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people might there be then?</p>
               <p>Snee. I do not know; a great number of people.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there some hundreds?</p>
               <p>Snee. There were I believe, a hundred; I said, for God's sake what must I do; the outside shutters were not shut at all; they throwed a great brickbat at the door, and when they had done that, they throwed another and broke four panes of glass and the frame, and all of the windows. They said,</p>
               <p>"D - n him, turn him out, and they would hang him, or burn him, or drown him, or do something or other to him; d - n him turn him out;" I asked Mr. Clarke whether he knowed them or not, that beset him, he said no I don't, but I know them that does. They kept knocking and beating at the door and window, I did not know what to do; he said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake do not open the door;" then he asked me if I had any cellar; I said, yes; he went down into the wash house, and then down into the cellar; when he was in the cellar, I opened the door, one of the fellows came in; as soon as he came in he pushed into the kitchen to me, and said,</p>
               <p>"D - n you, where is he." I said he is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoners and recollect if you saw either of them there?</p>
               <p>Snee. No; I was in a great fright.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to open the door?</p>
               <p>Snee. I opened it to let a friend in; I thought he was a pretty safe in the cellar; the man ran up stairs and met my daughter and said,</p>
               <p>"D - n my blood, if I don't kill all in the house if they don't find him;</p>
               <p>"my daughter said, as I hope to be saved, he is not up stairs; (for he was then in the cellar;) he saw my daughter go over a garden wall, which put him in mind to do so; the poor creature heard the man swear he would kill all in the house. While he was in the kitchen, the deceased came out and got over the wall. Then they called out in the street,</p>
               <p>"There he goes, there he runs;" then they left me, and run out into the garden.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not a garden belonging to your house, I believe?</p>
               <p>Snee. No; a great garden, belonging to a gardener; they all ran after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go over the wall too?</p>
               <p>Snee. There is gates and places; they can go every way from the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear a pistol go off after this?</p>
               <p>Snee. I did not; I was so frightened I heard nothing more.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been in your house; you say the first time he was in your house, about an hour; how long was it from the time he first came into your house, till he got over the wall?</p>
               <p>Snee. About an hour, or upwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the hour includes the whole time from his coming into your house till he finally went away?</p>
               <p>Snee. Yes.</p>

            . I live at Norton Falgate; I am a silk dresser.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the deceased, Daniel Clarke, upon the 16th of April?</p>
               <p>Gibson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What place did you first see him in?</p>
               <p>Gibson. In Norton Falgate, the corner of White Lyon-yard, or street; it goes by both names.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of day was it?</p>
               <p>Gibson. After two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe what condition he was in?</p>
               <p>Gibson. There might be a hundred people about him, or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way was he coming?</p>
               <p>Gibson. From towards Shoreditch; the people following him; he went and stood up at the corner, going to White Lyon-street, with his back against the wall; he dropt with his back-side upon the ground; a man came by with a dray, and said, Clear the way; he took a whip and began whipping of him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he whip him?</p>
               <p>Gibson. Perhaps a minute; I went away to my shop; I work in Blossom-street: he got up, how I know not; I lost fight of him then, I got fight of him again in about four or five minutes, in Wheeler-street, the next street to White Lyon-street; the people were pursuing him; they had got him up in a corner and were throwing dirt at him, and striking him, that was about one hundred yards from White-Lyon-street; then they went away down Quaker-street with him; he never seemed to try to get away, but seemed to go with them; he was in the middle of a great number of people: about the middle of Quaker's-street somebody came and gave him a blow, and said, D - n your blood: and Clarke fell down. I followed him to the Broad way.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done there?</p>
               <p>Gibson. He kept going before the mob; I saw nobody meddle with him there; he was before that in a very deplorable condition; his head was bloody: then they went to Hare-street: he was going down Hare-street; somebody came and asked me what was the matter; I stopped to tell him it was Clarke: they stopped him against the brew-house; there they stripped him; it is about the middle of Hare-street; I cannot say how much they stripped him; he had his breeches and stockings; then they went into the field, called, Hare-street field, that is at the end of Hare-street: I went into Hare-street field with the mob: when he came into <placeName id="t17710703-59-crimeloc297">Hare-street field</placeName>

               <p>"We will throw him into a pond, or a ditch;" one said, This is not deep enough; and another, This is not deep enough: at last they carried him into the Brick-field, where there is a pond, occasioned by digging out the bricks.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they do with him then?</p>
               <p>Gibson. They forced him into the water; whether they thrust him in by the back, or took hold of him by the arms, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance might you be?</p>
               <p>Gibson. One hundred yards, or farther.</p>
               <p>Q. What number of people might be gathered together at this time.</p>
               <p>Gibson. There might be two or three thousand; there were people out of number.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay after he was shoved into the pond?</p>
               <p>Gibson.

             the very last of all. They kept pelting him with earth and brick-bats, and any thing they met with whilst he was in the water.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030048"/>Q. How deep was this pond?</p>
               <p>Gibson. Where he stood he seemed to be about three feet in the water: whether he stood, or kneeled down in the water, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. How high did the water come?</p>
               <p>Gibson. About the middle of his belly.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of weather was this?</p>
               <p>Gibson. It snowed at times as fast as I ever saw it in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he continue in this pond?</p>
               <p>Gibson. It was a considerable time; half an hour, or three quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they continue throwing earth and brickbats at him?</p>
               <p>Gibson. About half an hour; there was a parcel of boys and girls about him; I went, and said, You little brats you will kill this man, and some of you will get hanged for it. A man came up and assisted me, and we pulled him out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the water bloody at that time?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I did not mind that then.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they do with him then?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I got hold of him; we dragged him four or five yards from the place; some of them said, He is one of his confederates or some such word, and pushed the man in and all; and they were going to push me in with him; I slipped away at a distance from the mob; some advised me to go home, and said I should get myself ill used; but I staid.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Clark at this time?</p>
               <p>Gibson. About nine or ten yards from the water.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition?</p>
               <p>Gibson. He was down upon the sand-heap, and they were throwing sand on the top of him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did this treatment continue upon the sand?</p>
               <p>Gibson. It might be a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of him at the end of this quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes?</p>
               <p>Gibson. They made a sort of a hallo themselves, and then they came and throwed him into the water again.</p>
               <p>Q. How high was the water then?</p>
               <p>Gibson. He was crawling like upon his hands and knees, at times, striving to keep himself from drowning; they kept throwing brickbats and stones at him; brickbats were the chief; there was not many stones; I saw half a brick, as it appeared to me, come and strike him on the left side of his temple, and the blood poured out as fast as if he had been pricked with a lancet, and the water was discoloured with the blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe Clarke do or say any thing?</p>
               <p>Gibson. He put his hand upon his head, and wiped the blood off and said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, gentlemen, you use me cruelly:" I went to get to the side of him to try to get him out of the water, but could not find any body to help me. Somebody cried, By and by; here is Justice Fielding's people coming; with that they drawed back. Somebody said, No, it is not; it is the keeper or White chapel prison. I saw a man coming, a turnkey, or something belonging to the prison; then they drawed back; there was another man there, one Clarke; I asked him to help me to get the man out of the water; he was going to take hold of him; Clarke refused him; whether he thought he was going to push him in further or no, I do not know; but we got him out the second time; that Clarke is a fisherman.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had taken him out of the pond, what happened then?</p>
               <p>Gibson. We got him out of the pond five or six yards, I put him down upon the ground; he got up upon his backside; there I left him; I got away from him; by and by I came up to him again; I think he was leaning down upon his elbow, sitting upon one side; somebody said, Get him to an hospital; I said, It is impossible without a coach; I will assist for one; I left him: soon after somebody came up again, and said, He is dead; I said, How can that be, I saw him just now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he speak after you took him out the second time?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I don't remember hearing him speak.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he groan?</p>
               <p>Gibson. No; I thought he seemed pretty hearty.</p>
               <p>Q. How were his eyes?</p>
               <p>Gibson. He was pretty full in the eyebrows; his eyes were considerably swelled.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he see?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I did not perceive but that he could; I got in between the mob again, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030049"/> looked, and then he was laying straight upon the ground, with both hands out; I stood awhile, and saw him fetch breath: the mob were very strong; I got away again; I could not stand it: somebody cried out afterwards, He is dead: when I went to look again, I saw he was dead; we drawed him away from there to the sand house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after he came out of the pond the second time that you observed he was dead?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I cannot tell; but it must be after four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoners at the bar; do you know either of them?</p>
               <p>Gibson. Yes; I have seen them before, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them do you know?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I believe I have seen them all, but I cannot say I know their names; I know their persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of them present at the time you have been speaking of?</p>
               <p>Gibson. Yes; Campbell; I saw him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts?</p>
               <p>Gibson. Near the pond side with the rest of the mob.</p>
               <p>Q. When the deceased was in the pond?</p>
               <p>Gibson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The first time, or the second?</p>
               <p>Gibson. The second time, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I think he had a great coat on, what they call a bath coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing in his hand?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I do not recollect that he had then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do any thing then?</p>
               <p>Gibson. No further than crowding about, as another person might be.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use any expressions?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I did not hear him speak at all, as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe him at any time do or say any thing?</p>
               <p>Gibson. Never, all the time he continued there.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might he continue there?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I might see him a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes; I cannot say the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he was there about the time Clarke died?</p>
               <p>Gibson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him before Clarke died, how was he dressed then?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I saw him, I think, in his shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. From the prisoner Campbell. Are you sure you saw me in my shirt?</p>
               <p>Gibson. It was something white; I think it was his shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the colour of the bath coat he had on when you first saw him?</p>
               <p>Gibson. A darkish coloured coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Then some small time before Clarke died, you saw him in something white you took to be his shirt.</p>
               <p>Gibson. Yes; I thought it was his shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. We should be glad to know whether you are certain you saw Campbell there?</p>
               <p>Gibson. To the best of my knowledge he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you saw him in white?</p>
               <p>Gibson. Yes; I thought it was his shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other man so dressed?</p>
               <p>Gibson. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen Campbell before?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I cannot be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you say you was absent from the pond some little time?</p>
               <p>Gibson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be absent from the pond?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I was standing nigh, twenty or thirty yards under the shed; I might be there twenty minutes, or half an hour; that was to avoid the snow, because it snowed so very fast.</p>
               <p>Q. The time you was absent for thirty minutes; was it between the first and second time he was in the water?</p>
               <p>Gibson. When they were going to put him in the second time, I went under his place.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw him; when he had the bath great coat on, you was asked if he had any thing in his hand; your answer was, Not then; did you observe afterwards, when he was in his shirt, as you suppose; that he had any thing in his hand?</p>
               <p>Gibson. It appeared to me to be a bit of a hoop stick, or some such thing: that was while he was in his shirt.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. You don't speak with certainty as to the person of Campbell; when you saw him in a dark coloured coat there was a great croud of people; you took no more particular notice of one man than another, I suppose; do you mean to speak certainly that Campbell was the person you saw in the Bath coloured coat?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I took no notice of one man more than another.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take more notice of the person of one man than another?</p>
               <p>Gibson. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Campbell before?</p>
               <p>Gibson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then are you sure that he is the man that you saw at the water side?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I believe he was, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it?</p>
               <p>Gibson. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you speak of the man you saw in the shirt; was that Campbell?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I thought it was the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not sure?</p>
               <p>Gibson. No, it snowed that I could not see.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you a dozen or fourteen yards off at the time you saw him in the Bath coat?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I was near then; I could have laid my hand upon his shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any people between you?</p>
               <p>Gibson. No, not that I remember; we were both upon the edge of the water side.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say whether it was his shirt or a white coat?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I think it was a shirt, I will not swear that it was his shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you there in the whole?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I was there pretty near two hours from first to last.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it o'clock when you saw him first?</p>
               <p>Gibson. It was nigh three, or half past two.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it o'clock when he went to the pond the first time?</p>
               <p>Gibson. Near three.</p>

            . I am a fruiterer in Grey Eagle-street; I don't recollect the exact time this riot happened, but I remember it; I stood at my own door; my house is in the middle of Grey Eagle-street, as near I can say; it is about one hundred yards from the broad way.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you come home?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I cannot say; I saw a mob when I came home and had my dinner; when I first saw the mob they were in Quaker's street, at the corner; two men came towards me from the mob; I asked what was the matter; they said they had got Clarke that hanged the cutters.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know these men?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I did not; I went to my wife and called her, and I ran to the mob; I saw a great mob, and the deceased in the middle; he had a great cut on one of his eyes, and his hat and wig were off: his coat very muddy; they drove him forwards; there was a mob on every side of him; he did not resist much against them; they hunched him down the street into Brick-lane, and then down Hare-street; I called Mrs. Hoe, who is to be the next witness; I followed the mob; when we went along to the brewhouse they stopped at one Mr. Green's; then I ran by the mob; a person asked me what was the matter; I said they had got hold of Clarke: while I was talking to him they stripped him; he was naked; when I saw him before, he had his cloaths on; I did not see them strip him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they do when he was naked?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I saw one man throw a handful of grains in his face, and give him a stripe upon his back with his hand. Clarke was a lusty man, and had a good skin, so the mark of the man's hand was left upon his shoulders; when they came up to the field gate somebody said to Clarke,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake think of your Maker, for you will never get out of this mob alive." I saw them dra gging him by his feet.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did they drag him in that manner?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Not far, a yard I suppose; I went by them again and they came up to a pond.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Bethnall Green road?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at this time making towards Bethnall Green road?</p>
               <p>Clarke. No; he was making down that way afterwards, and the people said,</p>
               <p>"Do not go that way. the justice lives that way."</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to Hare-field gate he made an attempt to go to Bethnall Green?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it he did not go that way?</p>
               <p>

               <p>"Don't go that way, the justice lives that way." Mr. Wilmot lives in the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say any thing else at the time they forced him to the pond?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Not that I can remember; I ran round the field, and got over a place like a bridge; when I turned round I saw the man thrown into the water.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him from the time he was upon his back till he was plunged into the water?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes, I saw him coming along; they were striking and pushing him; when he was at the pond side some said,</p>
               <p>"D - n your eyes, you had no compassion upon others," and such like; I was close to him then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any body hold that talk to him?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Not a soul that I know, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you close by him at that time?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before he was put into the pond?</p>
               <p>Clarke. No after Gibson had pulled him out.</p>
               <p>Q. But was you by at the time he was put into the pond?</p>
               <p>Clarke. No; I was round a little house they call a sand house, as far as to the end of the court; when I turned round he was in the water.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they do to him when he was in the water?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Pelted him with brickbats and stones, and such things.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to any body that did that?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I went on one side; I could not bear to stand by to see it; I stood on the other side of the pond.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see pelt him?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Not one in particular that I know; I saw several I people, neighbours, round the pond; but none that threw at him as I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he in the pond before he was drawn out?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Nigh half an hour. Mr. Gibson pulled him out; the last time I helped him.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was pulled out where did they take him to?</p>
               <p>Clarke. They left him near the side of the pond, about six feet off.</p>
               <p>Q. It was at that time the people talked to him about hanging the cutters?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes, and about Chevat; he made answer and said, Chevat is worse than me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they talk to him about any body else.</p>
               <p>Clarke. He said,</p>
               <p>"Let me go home, for God's sake; I will freely forgive you:" some of them said,</p>
               <p>"D - n you, you said you would swear against twenty." Some of them said that to enrage the people the more, I believe; he said he would freely forgive them if they would let him go home, and shook his head; some of them d - d and cursed him; very saw was for him; all the mob were against him; I heard very saw people that were pitying of him; they said,</p>
               <p>"He was a very bad man, and would swear peoples lives away."</p>
               <p>Q. You must recollect as well as you can; you was ner him when he was pulled out of the pond?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I ran, round the pond and stood close to him.</p>

               <p>Q. How long?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Till they throwed the piece of cord over his head and pulled him along.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it from the time you came round to him before the cord was flung over his head?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Not many minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was the first pulling him out of the water?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was during this number of minutes that this conversation was held; now you must mention the persons that you saw talking to him?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I don't know them.</p>
               <p>Q. Not any of them?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Not one in particular, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any of the prisoners at the bar?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I know that woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Campbell?</p>
               <p>Clarke. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never see him before?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I don't know that ever I did; never to speak to him; if I saw him it has been in passing of him in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen him before?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see him before the 16th of April?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I did not see him then that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect none of the persons?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I saw the other man, Stroud; I took him to be a brick maker.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you first see him?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I saw him stand by the side of the house after the deceased was pulled out of the water.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him before that time?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I have seen him many times, but not to know his name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him that day before Clarke was pulled out of the water?</p>
               <p>Clarke. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you describe any of the people that you saw talking to Clarke before the cord was thrown over his head?</p>
               <p>Clarke. The man that throw'd it was a slim man, like a lad; but looked like a man in years; and I saw a boy, in a green waistcoat, very active in striking him; and I saw a woman at the pond.</p>
               <p>Q. I want you to speak to those persons you know?</p>
               <p>Clarke. If I was to speak to persons I don't know, I might as well swear to you.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the cord put over him?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes; but not to pull him much; when that was done I ran away; I could not bear to see the barbarity; I ran by Mr. Scott's house, and saw them take him round the sand house; when I saw him again his hands were tied.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it from the time he had the cord flung about his neck till he died?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. How far off was you when he was tied?</p>
               <p>Clarke. The length of the pond.</p>
               <p>Q. Who threw it?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I know not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe when he was flung into the water?</p>
               <p>Clarke. He was in the water, but he got up, and the cord hung by his hands; then he was pelted again with brickbats that came over the mob and every way; from the first to the last he was in the water about an hour and an half.</p>
               <p>Q. When his hands were tied was there any huzza?</p>
               <p>Clarke. There was a great noise all the time, but nothing particular more.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it from the time he was thrown in till he was taken out the second time?</p>
               <p>Clarke. About an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing happen the second time?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Not that I remember.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body go in?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Not that I saw; I saw a man stand aiming at him; he seemed to me to be in his shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner was he aiming at him?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I thought he wanted to take hold of the rope.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he from him?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Pretty close; he might kneel down and reach him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him touch him?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Not that I know of; I thought it was to pull him out by the rope.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect that man in the shirt laying hold of him?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I believe once or twice he touched his head.</p>
               <p>Q. In what posture?</p>
               <p>Clarke. He laid his hand upon his head, and endeavoured to bow it down (describes it,) but not so as to go under the water; he just put his foot towards him.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did he put his foot towards him?</p>
               <p>Clarke. With an intention to push him under the water, I believe: the deceased stood in the water, the man stood just by his side: he first put his hand upon his head to push him down, and then his foot to his shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other person in their shirt?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I saw a man in a shirt, as I described to you twice; I will not say whether it was the same or not.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw only one at a time, did you?</p>
               <p>Clarke. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any out-cry at the water?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes; come away: come away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the mob gave any reason to him for coming away?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I cannot say that I did; I was much frightened.</p>
               <p>Q. You say brickbats were thrown at him; did any hit him?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes; there was a sad wound on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030053"/> back part of his head, he was all over bloody, I saw him dip his hand in the water to wash his head; a hundred times for what I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any bricks in the hands of the man in his shirt?</p>
               <p>Clarke. No; I saw a brick come by him; but whether from him or not, I cannot tell; when I helped to take him out of the water, somebody came behind me and put their knees under my backside and said throw him in for his namesake.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the first or second time of pulling him out?</p>
               <p>Clarke. The last time.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you say you saw the woman?</p>
               <p>Clarke. By the side of the pond; she never was out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the man in the shirt enough to know that you saw him dressed otherwise than in his coat; in any part of the day?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Horsford do any thing?</p>
               <p>Clarke. No; I saw her all the time: she stood by the pond and wrung her hands. One said, What do you cry for, you see satisfaction; she said, What is that for the loss of my husband and for my fatherless children.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. from Campbell. Where was you a drinking upon the 17th of the same month the day following?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I was called into Mr. West's.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you talk about there?</p>
               <p>Clarke. He asked me if I would be made a man of; he said, I need not carry fish any more; I might be made a man of for ever.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he offer you any money?</p>
               <p>Clarke. No; another gentleman offered me fourscore pounds; a gentleman that brought me the summons; he said, you know one

               <p>A. I said no such words.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing about fourscore pounds?</p>
               <p>A. No; I mentioned no sum in the world.</p>

               <p>A. Four or five weeks.</p>

               <p>Clarke. Nobody in particular; I believe I told it to one or two of my neighbours; I said, it is a dangerous point to appear in: in Spitalfields and at Billingsgate where we get our bread, they are apt to reflect upon one and another.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the murder was this?</p>

               <p>Clarke. This was Tuesday; I went the Friday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Campbell was in custody at that time?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes; he was committed to Newgate that time; another man came out and said, D - n you, you know that prisoner

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the conversation with you?</p>
               <p>Clarke. One West; it was the 16th day, a very snowy day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he point out any body in particular, who you was to swear against?</p>
               <p>Clarke. He said, 
               <persName id="t17710703-59-person612">
                  Bob

            .</p>
               <p>Q. Was it this West that has been examined here?</p>
               <p>Clarke. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you was in the field?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say you remembered the squinting man at the bar being there, Stroud?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes; he offered to carry the deceased to the Infirmary upon a brick barrow, but the man refused it; I said, is not that man's (Mr. Wolridge's) word sufficient for the safety of it; for they refused to put him in the brick-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember that tall man, Stroud?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Just as he is now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him do any thing</p>
               <p>Clarke. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he desire you, or offer his assistance, to pull the man out of the pond?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Not that I heard; some man held one hand while I stooped down to reach him out of the pond; I took hold of the rope: I believe he was afraid I was going to pull him out to use him ill; he refused it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you turned about and saw the man, do you remember seeing him desirous of giving assistance to the deceased?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes; upon a door. I am sure that was the man that wanted me to go further in the field to take a door off, to carry the deceased upon to the hospital; that was before the man was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Stroud come into the field?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I did not; I don't know I saw the man before he spoke to me; the people would not let us take a door off, Mr. Wolridge would have had him carried into a Sand-house for shelter, and the man refused; the people cried out to me, as I helped him out again, you will be shoved in yourself.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect when the man talked about fetching the door to carry him over the field to take him to the infirmary; did he speak as if he was in anxiety for the deceased?</p>
               <p>Clarke. He appeared in as much anxiety as I was; and I could not help crying about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think as he is a remarkable man if he had done any thing at the pond to the injury of the deceased you should not have seen it?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes, I think I should; I saw Mr. Wolridge there; he offered to give his word for the things in the sand-house, that they should not come to any damage.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that man seem anxious for his safety?</p>
               <p>Clarke. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him throw any thing?</p>
               <p>Clarke. No; he seemed to be in too much trouble.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. I asked you just now<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030055"/> when you was standing as close to the deceased as that little boy and heard people talk, whether you could or not make observation of any one person that spoke a single word; you told me could not?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Not that I knowed.</p>
               <p>Q. But can you describe them?</p>
               <p>Clarke. The man that put the rope round his neck was a thin man.</p>

               <p>Q. You saw many bricks thrown at him?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes; I saw several persons throw, they were chiefly boys; it was a very bitter day, it was impossible to distinguish one man from another, without you was close to him.</p>
               <p>Q. But several people might have talked to him, and throwed bricks at him, while he was upon the ground; yet you could not remember?</p>
               <p>A. Yes.</p>

            . I was at the pond. I saw several pieces of bricks thrown at the deceased; and some hit him on the head; but I don't know any of the people that throwed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him twice in the pond?</p>
               <p>Scales. Yes; but I don't know who put him in.</p>

               <p>Q. He got out the first time?</p>
               <p>Scales. He grappled to the sides to get out, and then I saw him thrown in again; but I did not know-by whom.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing done to him before he was thrown in?</p>
               <p>Scales. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was thrown in the second time did they continue pelting him?</p>
               <p>Scales. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a man in his shirt there?</p>
               <p>Scales. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do?</p>
               <p>Scales. Put him underneath the water; he took him by the head and put him underneath the water, but I don't know the man; it was a short man in his shirt; but I don't know him; it snowed that day very much.</p>
               <p>Court. Don't be afraid; you may give your evidence without being frightened?</p>
               <p>Scales. I am not afraid.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him to any thing else?</p>
               <p>Scales. I think I saw him strike him on the back part of the head with a bit of a brick; I don't know the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to that man?</p>
               <p>Scales. I called out, Savages and brutes, how could you use him so ill? but I don't know a child of eight years old that did any thing to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see that man in his shirt at any other time?</p>
               <p>Scale. Yes, once.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether at any time, either before or after, you saw that man in the shirt that attempted to put Clarke's head under water?</p>
               <p>Scales. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor have not you seen him since?</p>
               <p>Scales. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath?</p>
               <p>Scales. I can't swear who the man was.</p>

            . I was in the field, near the yard; they came down the first time near three o'clock; I saw Clarke standing upon a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030056"/> sand hill; he was almost naked, not quite. I took him up in my arms and carried him over the ditch; the mob took him away from us and throwed him into the pond; after that they tied a rope round his neck and throwed him in again, and threw a great many bricks at him.</p>

               <p>Chambers. Mr. Wilmot; I had no cauliflower plants, but some lettuces; I asked for one or two for breakfast; they said I might have them; I took four for breakfast.</p>
               <p>Q. Who said that?</p>
               <p>Chambers. Mr. Woolridge.</p>
               <p>Council for the crown. Then it was Mr. Wilmot sent you to these gardens to see if the man you knew was there?</p>
               <p>Chambers. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had told Mr. Wilmot you could swear to one man that had thrown some things at the pond?</p>
               <p>Chambers. Yes. Davy gave me the hint and said he would come to the wall side, and show me the man, if I chose it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come and show you the man?</p>
               <p>Chambers. He did not. Mr. Woolridge, when I was in the gardens, I did not speak it before Sir John Fielding it went out of my head, said, Where is my Lord Stroud? three men turned back; one made answer and said, He is down at the bottom of the ground a hoeing. I returned, and told Mr. Wilmot of it directly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. How long was it after this that Stroud was taken?</p>
               <p>Chambers. The day after, I said, I will go to James Knight; because he could swear to the man down right at once.</p>
               <p>Q. But if you could swear so sure to the man, why did you send for him?</p>
               <p>Chambers. I was not sure it was the same man that Knight meant before I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it you went for the lettuces?</p>
               <p>Chambers. About half an hour after seven in the morning, it was before eight, we came out again.</p>
               <p>Justice Wilmot.</p>
               <p>Q. The witness says he had directions of you to go to this place; is that so?</p>
               <p>Justice Wilmot. Yes; when he gave the information against the people, he mentioned something of a tall, hard looking man; a man he should know again if he saw him. This was about a fortnight after the murder. On the Wednesday before Stroud was taken, he came to my house in the evening, and said he heard the man's name was Stroud that was at the pond, if he could see him, he should know whether it was the same person or not. I then said, Go to Mr. Woolridge, and desire him to give you two or three lettuces, and see if you know the man; if you know him, come back and you shall have a warrant. I saw him about nine o'clock; he told me he went to the garden, and Mr. Woolridge called for Lord Stroud, and said, I heard he was drunk as last night, and enquired whether the evidence wanted any thing; he said, No. He was not present; in the garden; it must be at the bottom of the garden, for he did not then see him. I desired him to go to the other people that gave an account of the name, and go and be certain whether it was the person or not. Before he was taken, he came back to me, and told me it was the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030058"/> man. He was taken up and carried before Sir

I sent them to several dyers in the neighbourhood, and some of the gentlemen dyers drew out their people, and showed them all.</p>

               <p>Q. How was he dressed?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the man that knocked the deceased down?</p>
               <p>Baldwin. I cannot say; I saw his hand, but do not know who he was: some kicked him one way, and some another; some said, D - n you, get up again; as he rose up, they pulled all his cloaths off, some one way, and some another; they stripped him naked: Mr. Mosly was at his brewhouse gates; it was within two yards of him, as he stood at the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any of the people that tore his shirt or struck him?</p>
               <p>Baldwin. No; they smeared him with some grains; sometimes he was down, sometimes up. When I got to the pond, I saw him in the pond about up to the waistband of his breeches; there was very little done to him at that time; he begged very hard to come out, they reeled back and he crept out upon all fours; there came a stout man and chucked him heels over head in again; he could hardly recover himself; he begged very hard to come out again, I saw Mr. Gibson help him over; I said, that man was doing good for evil; for he had told me the deceased had wronged him out of about two pound; he went about ten steps, somebody knocked him down; there was a report spread; somebody asked what he said they said, the deceased said, he would take off twenty of them; they buffeted him round a little house for about twenty-minutes, as nigh as I can guess, but when he was knocked down from that place where he was standing, a man came behind him with a cord it might be four yards long, about the size of a sash cord; Clarke was then facing me: the man came behind him and threw the cord over his head; it had a noose, he had him down upon the ground, and dragged him five or six yards; I thought he would never rise any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know that man again if you saw him?</p>
               <p>Baldwin. I don't know; I have not seen him since, I am sure; they took the cord from his neck and wound it round his left hand; while he was doing this Campbell came up to him and asked whether he did not know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030059"/>

            . The deceased said, for God sake spare my life and I will hurt nobody; this was by the pond, then they cried out let us into the pond, again with him; I saw somebody seize his legs, and with a cord in their hand; I saw them wrap it round his legs. I went round and fixed myself in a little place, about ten yards off from him: they throwed him into the pond; he was not in long before he recovered himself; which way he got his hands loose I cannot say; in about two minutes time Campbell came stript in his shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Campbell dressed when he talked to him about Eastman?</p>
               <p>Baldwin. In a lightish coloured drab.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed when he came to the pond again?</p>
               <p>Baldwin. He had his coat off, and was in his shirt; he came running out from among the people into the pond, and came and seized him on the top of his head, and plunged his head under water several times; he stood by the side of the pond; he wetted his shoes a little I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him do any thing else?</p>
               <p>Baldwin. No; but whilst he was doing this, the people about the pond, that I take it knew him well, cried out get away, get away, get away; you have no business there above any body; then he looked round and went out, and I saw him afterwards put his cloaths on, that is, I saw his hands raised up above the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were his cloaths from the pond?</p>
               <p>Baldwin. About three yards from where the deceased lay; I went away then; that was about a quarter after four.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to Campbell when you heard him talk to the deceased about Eastman?</p>
               <p>Baldwin. About three foot; he said, don't you know Eastman; the deceased said, for Gods sake spare my life, and I will hurt nobody; I looked upon it as a kind of a jeer.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen Campbell before?</p>

               <p>Baldwin. Yes; I should know him by his make among five thousand people.</p>
               <p>Q. Without looking at his face?</p>
               <p>Baldwin. I would see his face; though I know him, take him from head to stern.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether do you mean to say that you know him by his face, or the make of his person; should you know him with his face hid?</p>
               <p>Baldwin. I think I should; he is made like a man double jointed.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he was in a lightish coloured coat?</p>
               <p>Baldwin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went into the public house about a quarter after four?</p>
               <p>Baldwin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not in the public house from the time you first came out till after four o'clock?</p>
               <p>Baldwin. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was he from you when he was in his shirt?</p>
               <p>Baldwin. About six or seven yards; when he quitted him I saw the water bubble out of Clarke's mouth.</p>

             that day?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. When he was in my house the last time the report was that Clarke was dead; he was not in at all when the man passed by.</p>
               <p>Q. What time might it be when he came the first time into your house?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Some time after the man passed by into the field.</p>


               <p>Q. What time of day?</p>
               <p>Baldwin. Between four and five in the afternoon; I keep the King and Queen by the fields; it might be four; I am not certain as to the time; it was some time after the man had passed by my house with the mob following him.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when he came the second time into your house?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Not a great while afterwards; it might be about five o'clock; he was not a great while out before he came in again; it was said Clarke was dead before he came the second time; he did not stay long at my house either time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any remark upon his appearing in your house at either time?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any remark upon his appearing in your house the second time?</p>
               <p>Baldwin. Yes; he had a linen thing or frock over his cloaths, such as sailors wear; I said you have got a different dress; he said, I am going to India, will you be my bondsman?</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect how he was dressed when you first saw him?</p>
               <p>Baldwin. In such coloured cloaths as he has on now; I took but little notice of him then.</p>
               <p>Note he was dressed in a darkish drab coloured coat.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Virginia-street from your house?</p>

               <p>Council. Don't be afraid, there can no harm happen to you for any thing you are to do here.* Did you see a man that afternoon dressed in a frock over his cloaths?</p>
               <p>* The witness trembled, and seemed much frightened.</p>
               <p>Breech. No farther than as I came along, I saw a man in a frock; a gentleman said That is the man that was oy the side of the pond.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know that man was the same you saw before in his shirt?</p>
               <p>Breech. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a tall or a short man that was in his shirt?</p>
               <p>Breech. I don't know; I but just saw the glimple of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Clarke's head ducked in the pond?</p>
               <p>Breech. No, nor where the bricks came from I don't know; I don't know who throwed them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Clarke attempt to get out of the pond?</p>
               <p>Breech. I did not; I stood by Mrs Scales, I saw him come out once or twice, and they put him in again.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was grappling to get up did you see him thrown back again?</p>
               <p>Breech. Only when the mob brought him back to throw him in again.</p>

               <p>Breech. I cannot say; I did not stand so near as to take so much notice.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get in again?</p>
               <p>Breech. Some of the mob throw'd him in; I do not know them.</p>

               <p>Q. Where do you work?</p>
               <p>Knight. At Mr. Pankley's garden, near Vauxhall: I was by the pond when Clarke was killed; I did not see him till he was at the pond.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any body that was there that used him ill?</p>

            ; that is the man; (pointing to him.)</p>
               <p>Q. What part did he take in this business?</p>
               <p>Knight. I saw a man shove Clarke under water; when he got up he pumped the water out of his mouth; it was a short man, about my size, in a brown cut wig; he was in his shirt. I don't think I should know him if I was to see him again. After that Clarke had thrown the water out of his mouth again, then Henry Stroud threw two bricks, and hit him on the side of his head, which caused him to bleed very much; each brickbat knocked him down in the water, and he got up again.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he in the water before he got up again?</p>
               <p>Knight. He was very weak; he got up as soon as he could; as soon as he got his head above the water again then Stroud throw'd a second brick at him, and knocked him down again.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030063"/>Q. Are you sure that was Stroud?</p>
               <p>Knight. Yes; I have known him four or five years. I stood but two or three yards behind him. I have worked with him some years.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he drest?</p>
               <p>Knight. In an old blue waistcoat; he had the same coat or waistcoat, or such sort, as he has now.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know one Davy?</p>
               <p>Knight. Yes; very well.</p>
               <p>Q. What is become of him?</p>
               <p>Knight. I have not seen him lately; he follows gardening.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the murder did you see Davy?</p>
               <p>Knight. I cannot say to a day. Davy worked along with me at that time; I saw him the same day this murder was done.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when you drank with him?</p>
               <p>Knight. Four or five days, or a week afterwards. I drank with him at the Ax, in Hackney road; Stroud came in, and called for a pint of beer; I said, when he came in, D - n it, here is the man I have been after all day; I will take him up; he is the man that murdered Clarke, and I will have the hundred pounds reward.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been looking for him?</p>
               <p>Knight. I had not been looking for him; I spoke that out of a joke; I had seen him do it, therefore I was not afraid to say it; I spoke it in the open tap room.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Stroud say or do upon that?</p>
               <p>Knight. He said I was a foolish sort of a fellow. I asked him to lend me a shilling; he said he had no money; he did not stay five minutes after he came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he understand you that you spoke in joke?</p>
               <p>Knight. I do not know whether he did or not; he would not drink with me, but walked out of the house; I did not see him again, while last Friday se'nnight: then I saw him at Sir John Fielding's, in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they to find you as a witness?</p>

               <p>Knight. I did not tell him about his being a gardener.</p>
               <p>Q. You said just now you knew Stroud, you had known him, I think, four or five years?</p>
               <p>Knight. Yes.</p>

               <p>Knight. A brother-in-law.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030064"/>Prisoners Council. How long was it after the sixteenth of April you saw Stroud at the public house?</p>
               <p>Knight. Four or five days, or a week after the murder.</p>
               <p>Q. After Stroud came in, did you ask to drink with him, or began talking of charging him and geting the hundred pounds?</p>
               <p>Knight. I asked him to drink first; I said first, when I saw him coming, this is the man that killed Clarke, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you?</p>
               <p>Knight. He said nothing to me in no shape.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he call you a foolish fellow?</p>
               <p>Knight. No not that I remember.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave your evidence just now, that you charged him with being the man that killed Clarke; 'Stroud said I was a foolish of a fellow.'</p>
               <p>Knight. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say so?</p>
               <p>Knight. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell him upon that day, If you will not give me a pot of beer, I will swear-it?</p>
               <p>Knight. I said, if he would not, I would take him up at once.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he stay and drink his beer?</p>
               <p>Knight. He was not there above five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell him, unless he would give you a pot of beer you would swear it against him, and take him up?</p>
               <p>Knight. Yes; he staid and drank the beer, and out he went.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you was awake when he went out of the house, or drunk and asleep.</p>
               <p>Knight. As sober as I am now, and awake.</p>
               <p>Q. After he was gone you had some conversation with Davy, had not you?</p>
               <p>Knight. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You stayed till Stroud was gone, and Davy likewise?</p>
               <p>Knight. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What conversation had you about Stroud, when he was gone?</p>
               <p>Knight. Nothing particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me, yes or no, whether you offered Davy, any part of the reward, that he should go marks if he would swear against him?</p>
               <p>Knight. I never offered him any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. He is here.</p>
               <p>Knight. I am not afraid to face any man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say you wished you knew any body that would swear any thing against Stroud?</p>
               <p>Knight. I did not say any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say, if you had seen any thing of him yourself, you would go and inform against him?</p>
               <p>Knight. I did not say any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after this conversation before you made any information?</p>
               <p>Knight. I made no information against him, till I was fetched out of the ground last Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. Who fetched you out of the ground?</p>
               <p>Knight.

               <p>Knight. He said I must come along with him, and speak the right truth concerning this murder.</p>

               <p>Q. You knew his name?</p>
               <p>Knight. Yes; because I had worked with him some months before.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray did Chambers know where you worked till the time he fetched you?</p>
               <p>Knight. No; I believe not.</p>

               <p>Q. What was your conversation with Chambers?</p>

               <p>Q. You say, upon your oath, that you did not say to Davy, if you had seen Stroud do any thing you would have sworn it, and wished you could get any body that could?</p>
               <p>Knight. No; it was the last of my thoughts to trouble the man in any degree; I would not have hurt him if I could have helped it.</p>

               <p>Council for the Crown. If Chambers had not found you out at the garden, and so carried you to the justice of the peace, was it your own intention to interfere in the matter, and give evidence against Stroud?</p>
               <p>Knight. I never would have troubled myself about it, nor have given any information: I have worked and drank many a pint and pot of beer with Stroud.</p>
               <p>Court. I understood you first that you spoke it in jest, when you said you would take him up and get a hundred pounds reward?</p>
               <p>Knight. Yes. I believe that is the man (pointing to Campbell) that I saw shove Clarke under the water.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never seen him from that time to this?</p>
               <p>Knight. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen him before?</p>
               <p>Knight. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any memory of his countenance?</p>
               <p>Knight. Not much, he was about my size.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to the deceased; was you there at the time he was ducked?</p>
               <p>Knight. About four yards from the edge of the pond.</p>
               <p>Campbell. He said the person that did that was a person much of his own stature.(Knight goes and Stands by Campbell, he appears to be the head.)</p>

            . I was at the pond when Clarke was in it. I saw Mrs. Horsford, the prisoner, there: I stood upon a hill just by the pond; a woman was crying and tearing by the pond: I ran from the hill; What is the matter, I said; there is Mrs. Horsford; somebody said they wanted to drive her away; she said she would not go away; she took up a brickbat, and said she would as soon die as her husband; she throwed the brickbat at Clarke; who was in the pond; it went into the pond: about an hour afterwards, they said he was gone.</p>

               <p>Jackson. I cannot say; I saw it go into the pond; I cannot be positive whether it hit him or not; there were other people throwing as well as she: then they made a hollowing.</p>

               <p>Q. You say you saw her throw, but did not see it hit Clarke?</p>
               <p>Jackson. No; it fell down by his side; she said this was the man that was the ocsion of her husband's death; she said her poor husband lost his life by this man in the pond; she was crying shockingly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she seem to be of such a temper of mind as to be able to know what she said?</p>

I went to Mr. Wilkinson's warehouse, in Friday-street, and staid till about two o'clock; I then went to Mr. Holmes's, in Milk-street, Cheapside; I went into the alehouse, and seeing some friends, they asked me drink; I had a person with me; they asked him first, and then they asked me; I did not know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030067"/> their names; I knew them by sight. It is the Dolphin, I understand, that I went to; I did not know the sign till lately; it is the corner of the market; the person that was with me advised me to go over to Mr. Holmes's, and ask if he had had any work to give out, which I did. I staid in the passage of the house half an hour; when I found an opportunity I went into the warehouse, and asked the foreman if he had any work to give out; he said, No; a person that was there stiad I was a good workman in the black branch; he said, I wish I could relieve every one that comes, for plenty are out of work; I have got nothing, I assure you. I came back to the same alehouse again, and met my friend, and several more; I told them I was out of work, and had been down to the water side: I used to go on board ships, to rig them, as I understand it: my friend said, after we had drank four pots of purl and two pints of beer, I would advise you to go and ask at Mr. Rimmington's warehouse, in the said Milk-street, lower down in the street; I went and asked there; Mr. Rimmington's foreman said there was not any work; I said, You promised me, if you had any, that you would let Mr. Jones know it; he said, I have not any; I am sorry for it; I have heard you are a good workman: he said he would take the first opportunity to take me in. I came back to my friend again; he had some little company, and was drinking; while he staid, I staid; I did not mind the time, how long it was; we left the place after we had drank several pints of beer: upon that, I said to my friend, Let us go away, if one thing will not do I must see and get another; he said, Where will you go? I said, Towards the India House; he said, Have you a mind to go that way? I said, Yes; what signifies my standing here; I have sold and pawned every thing I can do, and it will not do or me to stand here; I will therefore go to the East or West Indies, if I can find a good captain of a West India ship; I was once steward of a West Indiaman, if that ship is come home I will go on board her in the same station. Two or three days before, I had been enquiring after that ship, but it was not come home; my friend and I came along the city, till we got to the India House; I said, Go into the White Swan, and I will come to you presently; I went down a turning that comes from the White Swan, went into the India House, pushed open the pay-office door, I saw nobody there but two or three runners belonging to the house; I said, It is all over with me to day. I came to my friend, who was drinking at the White Swan, Leadenhall-street; I found him, in company with one Mr. Touchit: the gentleman, seemingly, looked like a seaman; I found him afterwards to be such; they were talking about some affairs of their own, I don't know what: after a little time he asked me to drink; so I drank: presently after he said, Mr. Touchit, Here is a poor man has got four small children, and two or three sick; his intentions are to go to sea, and if you could get him a West India voyage, it would be better than an East; he said, To be sure it would; but how do you know where the man's mind is bent to? His mind is bent to go any where, said my friend: the gentleman said, If I was a seaman, I should be accepted of; if, he said, you will meet me at the Blacksmith's Arms tomorrow morning, I will speak to a West India captain; I have, for my own part, left off the sea, and have bought three estates. I thanked him, so we had three or four pints of beer, and spent some time in drinking it, and talking together; I said to my friend, Let us go home and tell my wife what news we have heard. We steered towards home; we went along Leadenhall-street, into Whitechapel, till we got into Rose-lane; there I left my friend at the same house were I first met him; he said to me, If you will call on me in an hour's time, I will go with you to another warehouse and speak for you. I went with him up the remaining part of Rose-lane, till I came to Christ church, Middlesex, which is called Spital-fields church. I went up Church-street, into Brick-lane; just at the Seven Stars there is a horse ride, which is the back part of some master weaver houses; they have doors come into that place where their work people are served; I saw a young man coming out of the house, one Mr. Halley, with silk; I said, You have work, Sir; he said, Yes; have you got work? I said, No; (I believe he is here) said he, What do you think of doing? I said, I don't intend to look out for any more now; my intention is solely to go to sea; I will go and be impressed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030068"/> on board, if I can't get a bondsman; I said, when I came home, I could do better at sea than as at present, getting sometimes a shilling a day, and sometimes nothing: I met one Bateman, that was along with this Mr. Proctor; I did not know him; we spoke together; I had a little knowledge of him; we went to the sign of the Phoenix, in Phoenix street, and had two pints of beer there along with this Proctor, and one Mr. Bacon; when we came out of the house, it was half past three o'clock and better, as Mr. Holley tells me, when he left his master's house, because the quarters at Christ church had gone; he said it was half an hour after three, or better; he has told me so since: after that I had two pints of beer at the Phoenix; we heard somebody say that the people had got Clarke: then I went to Mr. Lloyd's, that was the first time; I just went to the edge of the ground, and no farther, and returned with this Bateman and Proctor: I then went home to my wife: I said, I will go down, and see if the Gravesend boats go away, and will go there, and ship on board and receive the bounty and impress money at once on board the ship: I put on my jacket and frock; Nancy said I, I will go on board; she said, God bless you, I wish you luck. I went to Mr. Lloyd's to look into the paper; I called for a glass of gin at the bar; the landlord of the house said, Where are you going? I said, I am going to Gravesend. Then I saw one Mr. Hurd; he said, So Campbell, where are you going to night? I said, To Gravesend; Well, says he, we will drink a pint of beer together; he called for a pint of twopenny, and we drank it together. I went away towards Billingsgate; I thought it was better, as it was a late tide, not to go on board; it must have been early in the morning before I could have got down, so had better go in a morning tide, for my affairs were so bad I did not know what to do to get a little money to support my family.</p>

               <p>Rutter, Yes; at Mr. Lloyd's the King and Queen, when Stroud and the man was going by; I and one Cole were drinking together about a quarter of an hour after; Stroud and I went together to see what was the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not weavers either of you?</p>
               <p>Rutter. No; we went down to the pond, and we saw Clarke was in the pond.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Stroud say or do, upon that occasion?</p>
               <p>Rutter. Nothing about it, only shook his head and said, he was a sad man.</p>
               <p>Q. Who?</p>
               <p>Rutter. Clarke was a sad man; so he was by every bodies account.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stand by him?</p>
               <p>Rutter. Yes, all the time; not above a yard and a half off, and never saw him sling any thing, a great mob of people did; but I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had thrown any thing you must have seen it?</p>
               <p>Rutter. Yes; he never offered such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You were at Lloyd's with him a second time?</p>
               <p>Rutter. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done then?</p>
               <p>Rutter. They were pulling him out of the pond.</p>
               <p>Q. Stroud came back with you the first time?</p>
               <p>Rutter. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay by him all the time?</p>
               <p>Rutter. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he throw any thing upon your oath?</p>
               <p>Rutter. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the man that pulled him out of the pond to assist him?</p>
               <p>Rutter. There were a couple of men, I did not know who they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see by this man's behaviour that he shewed a desire to assist this poor man?</p>
               <p>Rutter. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he show it?</p>
               <p>Rutter. He strove to get hold of him, to pull him out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go back with him again to Mr. Lloyds?</p>
               <p>Rutter. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There has been a man here has said, he saw him throw three or four brickbats?</p>
               <p>Rutter. If he did, I did not see him.</p>

               <p>Q. Where do you live now?</p>
               <p>Rutter. In London.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts?</p>
               <p>Rutter. In Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabout in Fleet-street?</p>
               <p>Rutter. The man's name is Jemmy Dowlam.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lodged there?</p>
               <p>Rutter. About a quarter of a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Constantly?</p>
               <p>Rutter. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you been employed in during that time?</p>
               <p>Rutter. I have been a labourer in the brewhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. At what brewhouse?</p>
               <p>Rutter. Trueman's.</p>
               <p>Q. The whole time?</p>
               <p>Rutter. No; I have not been there long.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you at work when this happened?</p>
               <p>Rutter. At Mr. Woolridge's garden.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you continue there?</p>
               <p>Rutter. Five or six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Lodging all the while in Fleet-street?</p>
               <p>Rutter. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been at work there, before this happened?</p>
               <p>Rutter. It might be a month.</p>
               <p>Q. And worked five or six weeks afterwards?</p>
               <p>Rutter. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You worked nine weeks in all?</p>
               <p>Rutter. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you work there every day?</p>
               <p>Rutter. When it was fine that we could work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you work there every day?</p>
               <p>Rutter. We could do no work when it rained.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do then?</p>
               <p>Rutter. No work at all.</p>
               <p>Q. So you went to this alehouse and went along with Stroud to the pond?</p>
               <p>Rutter. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stand quite still the whole time?</p>
               <p>Rutter. No; we kept going round the mob and such like, the mob kept crowding, so we could not stand still.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see no stones thrown?</p>
               <p>Rutter. Yes, a great many; by different people; I don't know any one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. The mob forced about very much?</p>
               <p>Rutter. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present at the time when they said, the justices people were coming?</p>
               <p>Rutter. I did not mind that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mind when the mob huzza'd and ran away from the pond?</p>
               <p>Rutter. Yes; then the man was out.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was a great confusion at that time; how many people do you think was there?</p>
               <p>Rutter. Abundance.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did they run back?</p>
               <p>Rutter. Twenty yards from the pond.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the inside or on the outside at that time?</p>
               <p>Rutter. On the outside.</p>
               <p>Q. So you knew nobody that did it?</p>
               <p>Rutter. No; several threw at him, and the blood ran all down.</p>
               <p>Q. So you stood to see that and did not help him?</p>
               <p>Rutter. I thought it a sad thing a poor man should be served so ill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear many other people besides Stroud say he was a sad fellow?</p>
               <p>Rutter. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a common cry?</p>
               <p>Rutter. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Some people that said so threw stones I suppose?</p>
               <p>Rutter. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So they all agreed with Stroud that he was a sad fellow?</p>
               <p>Rutter. Yes.</p>

            . I am a gardiner; I worked for Mr. Woolridge at this time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Stroud that day?</p>
               <p>Winterson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at the pond?</p>
               <p>Winterson. Yes; I saw a great quantity of people,</p>
               <p>"I thought they dropt out of the clouds;" somebody said, it was a Jew's burying, so we ran out; I saw Stroud when I came there, but did not see him meddle or make; Stroud was out before me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been out?</p>
               <p>Winterson. A dinner time.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go?</p>
               <p>Winterson. About ten minutes after three; I went to the pond, and looked and saw a man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030070"/> upon his knees in blood, with his head bruised very much; I saw Stroud one of the first I saw that I knew.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay?</p>
               <p>Winterson. About fifteen or twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at all active in the business?</p>
               <p>Winterson. I did not see him; he did not throw any thing while we were there; I thought they were all boys.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. Why did not you drive the boys away.</p>
               <p>Winterson. It was very cold and began to snow; and I was ready to perish.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you stand by and see a man pelting to death by a parcel of boys and not drive them away?</p>
               <p>Winterson. I could see the things come, and thought it was done by boys.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you drive them away?</p>
               <p>Winterson. There was a numerous sight of people, and I did not chuse to meddle or make; it snowed hard, and I had a good many cucumbers to take care of.</p>
               <p>Q. So the cucumbers were the reason of your not protecting this man's life?</p>
               <p>Winterson. If I had gone my master's business might have suffered two or three hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Court. Then why did you leave your master's business to go to see this thing at all?</p>
               <p>Winterson. I thought they dropt out of the cloud.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present at Mr. Woolridge's when Chambers came there?</p>
               <p>Winterson. I believe Stroud was not far from him, but can't recollect.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. Do you know where Chamber's wife is?</p>
               <p>Winterson. I heard she ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many people in the same way as you about the pond that did not seem to have any desire to hurt the man?</p>
               <p>Winterson. There were two or three thousand people there I suppose, and I did not see any body meddle or make.</p>
               <p>Q. What people that were innocent?</p>
               <p>Winterson. The greatest part of them, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. What and let these boys knock the man on the head?</p>
               <p>Winterson. They were afraid to meddle or make; a man would not venture himself among the mob.</p>
               <p>Court. Yet these two or three thousand were all peaceable, and these boys did the mischief?</p>
               <p>Winterson. I could not swear to any man; Stroud I knew; every man would be afraid of coming into a hobble.</p>

I went down to the pond; Clarke had got about three yards from the pond; his cloaths were very heavy; he was soon in the pond again; I did not see Stroud at that time; I did afterwards.</p>

            . I went out of the house into the street at the beginning of the disturbance; I went into Hare-street; the mob were running into the field; I went into the King and Queen, Mr. Lloyd's; I saw Stroud sitting over beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was nobody with him?</p>
               <p>Cole. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go out?</p>
               <p>Cole. I was there all the whole time and never missed Stroud, to the best of my knowledge, above half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when you first saw him?</p>
               <p>Cole. About three.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know when he came in again?</p>
               <p>Cole. The first of my seeing him was about half after three; when he came in again.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You was so near this place you probably heard of what was passing, though you did not see it?</p>
               <p>Cole. Not a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Not hear of it at Lloyd's; being so nigh<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030071"/> the field you would hear what was going on there?</p>
               <p>Cole. I heard they had got a man in the field, and were using him ill; therefore I would not go in.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by saying no, not a word.</p>
               <p>Cole. I heard people talking about it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by saying you was by?</p>
               <p>Cole. I was in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You never missed Stroud but half an hour, and he returned about half after three.</p>
               <p>Cole. Yes, he sat down about three quarters of an hour before Clarke died.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he could not be present at the pond side when Clarke died?</p>
               <p>Cole. No, he sat at the same box with me when people came in and said the deceased was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he could not be present when Clarke died?</p>
               <p>Cole. No.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. As you was not at the pond you cannot be certain when the man died, only what the other people said?</p>
               <p>Cole. No.</p>
               <p>- Lloyd. I have been examined before. I keep the King and Queen; the prisoner Stroud came to my house that afternoon, and had a pint of beer; and when there was a noise, that a great number of people were coming up the street, I went to the door to see what was the matter; seeing a great many people I bolted my door, and would not let any body in and out; so he was in for some time; he went out; I did not miss him long; I cannot say for how long.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the mob gone by a good while before he went out?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was along with him?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I cannot rightly recollect; there were several people in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the gardener, the man that stood up just now?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I have seen him at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go out and return back with him?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I cannot be sure whether he did or not; I don't remember; I have known Stroud four or five years.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the general character you have heard of him.</p>
               <p>Lloyd. A quiet, honest, civil man. I never saw him enter into any quarrel or dispute with any body in my house; and he has been there a good many times.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said you do not recollect the time exactly; that it was very soon after the mob went by the first time?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. The people came to the door and wanted to come in; I bolted the door; the house was filled up with people; I was not certain when he went; in a little time again I remember serving him with some more beer; I cannot tell how long he was out.</p>
               <p>- Bath. I live in Hackney-road; I am a gardener; I live with my father.</p>

               <p>Bath. Very well; the day Clarke was killed, he and my father and I went down to Spital-fields to Mr. Warren's warehouse; in going along a young man asked us if we were going to see the deceased ducked; Knight was along with me; he set out with us from our house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Bath. At Hackney-road, between the Nag's head and the turnpike at Cambridge heath.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Bath. About half after two; we saw a young lad in the Gibralter field, Mr. Walton's apprentice, he asked us if we were going to see the deceased ducked; we told him no, we were going down to Mr. Warren's warehouse for some baskets; when we came the baskets were not there; we went to Mr. Atkinson's house, adjoining to Mr. Woolridge's, he is a gardener; we found the baskets; we took up two loads of them, and came away to Mr. Woolridge's ground.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from Cambridge-heath to Mr. Warren's?</p>

               <p>Bath. Wanting a quarter of three.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when you got to Mr. Atkinson's?</p>
               <p>Bath. About a quarter after three; we took up our loads and went to the King and Queen and there pitched; it was then pretty near half an hour after three; we saw two young men coming along, one asked the other if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030072"/> the mar was in the pit; he said, Yes; the other said, he says he shall not come out any more; I said, we will go and see him; Knight and I went together, we took up the two loads and carried them rather better than half way; we pitched them down and my father stood to take care of the baskets; Knight was in my company all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Knight went away with you?</p>
               <p>Bath. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where at that time did you leave Clarke?</p>
               <p>Bath. Between the sand house and the pit, upon the ground, lying upon his back; dying, as I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of day was that?</p>
               <p>Bath. Better than half after three; we went home, and got there before four.</p>
               <p>Q. And Knight was in your company the whole time?</p>
               <p>Bath. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Knight after he got to your father's house?</p>

               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Bath. A gardener.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your father a gardener?</p>
               <p>Bath. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Knight?</p>
               <p>Bath: Better then four years.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you work upon the 16th of April?</p>
               <p>Bath. At my father's.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the time?</p>
               <p>Bath. We go to dinner at one, and come away at two.</p>
               <p>Q. Now when you were at the pond was there a great number of people about?</p>
               <p>Bath. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get near to him?</p>
               <p>Bath. Yes; within a yard, I dare say of him.</p>
               <p>Q. And Knight was along with you all the time?</p>
               <p>Bath. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was not a great throng of people, it was easy to get along?</p>
               <p>Bath. Not a great throng; we pushed thro' with much ado.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see by at that time?</p>
               <p>Bath. Nobody, that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Stroud?</p>
               <p>Bath. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him throw any thing?</p>
               <p>Bath. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see no stones thrown at all?</p>
               <p>Bath. No.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. The man was upon his back a dying, when you came there.</p>
               <p>Bath. Yes.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. The place you saw him at was upon the sand, between the sand-house and the pond.</p>
               <p>Bath. Yes; there we found him, and there we left him.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the place he was first taken to.</p>
               <p>Bath. He died there, by all account.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after that before you got home?</p>
               <p>Bath, About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. So you heard that this man was going to be knocked on the head, and your father heard it.</p>
               <p>Bath. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your father say nothing about your going to help him?</p>
               <p>Bath. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He had no objection then to his being knocked on the head no more than you?</p>
               <p>Bath. It was out of our power to help him.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. If your lordship pleases to call Knight, and see what he will make of this story. (Knight is called.)</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been present while this man has been examined?</p>
               <p>Knight. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say to it; was the man brought to the same place when he died, he had been brought to before when taken out of the pond the first time.</p>
               <p>Knight. When I first went, I saw a man go to him, and shove him under water.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you there with Bath?</p>
               <p>Knight. From a quarter before four, 'till almost half an hour after.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Bath with you at that time?</p>
               <p>Knight. Yes; there was a very great crowd, we were not together all the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030073"/>Q. The account he gives is, that the man was dying when you came away together.</p>
               <p>Knight. I stood there while the man was pelting in the pond, and stood by Stroud, and saw him knocked down.</p>
               <p>Bath. We were not above ten minutes at the pond; I will take my oath of it.</p>
               <p>Council for the prisoner to Knight. Did you pitch the baskets, and leave them in the care of old Mr. Bath.</p>
               <p>Knight. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay at the pond?</p>
               <p>Knight. From about a quarter before four, till near half after.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you was there three quarters of an hour?</p>
               <p>Knight. Yes; I believe I was.</p>
               <p>- Bath. The last witness is my son.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send your son and this Knight, the witness, for some baskets to the warehouse in Spitalfields?</p>
               <p>Bath. Yes; and I went with them; they went afterwards to Mr. Atkinson's.</p>
               <p>Q. As you was going from the King and Queen you heard of this mob at the pond?</p>
               <p>Bath. Yes; they pitched the baskets, then they took them up again, and carried them almost to the pond.</p>
               <p>Q. Do tell your story, how long it was before they came back and went home?</p>
               <p>Bath. I fancy it was near four o'clock when they pitched the baskets; I took care of the baskets.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before they came back?</p>
               <p>Bath. Not above ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How often did they pitch their baskets before they came to the pond?</p>
               <p>Bath. Once before, and once when they came there.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when you got home?</p>
               <p>Bath. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was near four o'clock when they pitched the baskets down?</p>
               <p>Bath. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you what time it was when you got home?</p>
               <p>Bath. I think it must be between four and five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think a quarter, or half after four?</p>
               <p>Bath. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you be positive to say, upon your oath, that from the time they left you at the pond was not three quarters of an hour?</p>
               <p>Bath. I could take an oath of that; I don't think it was above a quarter of an hour in all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet, going home, a man that is called Davy Higgins?</p>
               <p>Bath. I don't remember; I will not say.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard before these people went away that they were going to see this man murdered?</p>
               <p>Bath. We heard the man was going to be ducked; the mob told us he had been in the field about an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to go yourself to see such a sight?</p>
               <p>Bath. I had other business; I was to mind the baskets.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had the curiosity, I suppose, to enquire what they had seen when they came back?</p>
               <p>Bath. They told me the man was dying.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all the story?</p>
               <p>Bath. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you the curiosity to ask how the man came by his death?</p>
               <p>Bath. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then upon their coming back and telling you the man was dying, you was satisfied, took your baskets up, went home, and thought it very well?</p>
               <p>Bath. I did not think any thing about it:</p>
               <p>Q. You thought a fellow creature being murdered was of no consequence; did you know then that he had been pelted to death with bricks.</p>
               <p>Bath. I heard so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear so at that time?</p>
               <p>Bath. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom?</p>

               <p>Bath. They said he was pelted to death, and lay dying.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of them say they saw him pelted, or ducked?</p>
               <p>Bath. They did not say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they tell you they did not see him ducked?</p>
               <p>Bath. They told me so then, that they did not.</p>
               <p>Court. How came they to tell you they did not see him?</p>
               <p>Bath. They told me about the other things; we never talked about it after we got home, for

               <p>Q. Was that the first time?</p>
               <p>Cole. I saw him when he came to that gentleman's (meaning Mr. Woolridge.)</p>
               <p>Q. How often had you seen him before?</p>
               <p>Cole. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what business he is?</p>

               <p>Q. Don't you know he is a constable?</p>
               <p>Cole. I did not know he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never meet him in this part of the world were Clark was killed some time ago?</p>
               <p>Cole. Never, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hold any conversation to him about that, and said he had given an alarm in the neighbourhood, by coming there?</p>
               <p>Clark. Never, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you meet Pagett once, and tell him he put the neighbourhood in a consternation by coming there; that they thought he came for the gardener, Stroud, for he was as much concerned in the murder as any body.</p>
               <p>Cole. I saw him once, he came to arrest Winterson: they said the weavers were all out of the windows: I said, Who are you come after? he said, I am come after your great, big, man in the ground; I took it for Stroud, because he is a stout man; I thought he was come to arrest him: I was going up to my work; he called a boy to fetch a pot of purl, and I drank with him; I thought he was coming to arrest Stroud.</p>
               <p>Q. For what?</p>
               <p>Cole. For debt.</p>
               <p>Court. I thought you did not know Pagett was an officer.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to the pond yourself?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes; I did; my maid said they were ducking Clarke; I said, What Clarke? she said, Clarke that hung the cutters. I went there, and saw the man lay upon the ground; I turned about and went away.</p>

               <p>Atkins. A lying by the edge of the water, by the sand house; I went to the malt-distillers; a man came in about five minutes afterwards, and said, The man is dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible for them to get to the pond before the man was dead?</p>
               <p>Atkins. The man must be out of the water before they came; he was lying upon the ground when I came there, and I came a shorter way than they.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Stroud?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Five or six years.</p>

               <p>Higgins. It might be two or three days; Stroud seeing us sit there came in and called for a pint of beer;

             jumps up and says, G - d d - n my blood, you are the man I was looking for; says Stroud, Looking for me, you fool; what was you looking for me for? Why, said Knight, if you don't give me a pot of beer, I will take you up for murdering the man, and I will swear it. The house was full of people at the time; Stroud said, 
               <persName id="t17710703-59-person664">

             I will give you a pot of beer at any time with all my heart, but not upon such an account as that. He drank out of his own pint, and neither of us drank with him. He went out of the house, and Watts with him.</p>
               <p>Q. After he was gone, had Knight any conversation with you about this Stroud?</p>
               <p>Higgins. No; I left Stroud in the house, and went to my lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay in the house?</p>
               <p>Higgins The value of half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Stroud went away before you?</p>
               <p>Higgins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He went immediately I suppose?</p>
               <p>Higgins. He stay'd and drank his pint of beer.</p>

               <p>Higgins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with Knight about the baskets and people he saw?</p>
               <p>Higgins. I was comming out of my master's ground; I met my old and young master, and him along with them with the baskets upon their heads. He said, Where are you going? I told him it was so cold I could not stand to work. Immediately we went to the Nag's Head; I told Knight we were going there: he said he would follow us. When he came home, he told us that he saw the man lie dying upon the bank, and that he did not see any body throw at him, but saw him when he was dying.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any particular account that he had seen any thing happen, or only a general account?</p>
               <p>Higgins. He said he did not see any body throw any thing, but if he knew any body that could swear it, he would take him up; but he could not himself, because he did not go soon enough.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you in what condition the deceased was when he came up with young Mr. Bath?</p>
               <p>Higgins. He said he lay upon the bank when he came up, and gave a groan.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at the Axe tell him that he told you before he saw no body?</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030076"/>Higgins. I kept nunging him all the time to hold his tongue. I did not say any thing.</p>
               <p>Court. When was the reward offered?</p>
               <p>Higgins. The Saturday night, the twenty-seventh of April, eleven days after the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard him talk about the reward since?</p>
               <p>Higgins. In the ground a great many times.</p>
               <p>Chambers again.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. What passed between Higgins and you upon this affair?</p>
               <p>Chambers. The first of it, Davy came to my house; my wife had a shirt to wash for him; he sat down in a chair, and brings up James Knight. I said, I wished I knew where the son of a b - h was, for I had not seen him for seven weeks, and had been two or three days a-looking for him, but could not find him. He said he was at Vauxhall. I said, he told me he knew a man very active in killing Clarke. Davy said, That is Stroud. He wrote down the name himself, and carried it to Mr. Wilmot's.</p>
               <p>Higgins. When I went to this man's house, he was talking about Knight. I said, I had left him at work; he said, Where is he, for he wanted him on particular business. I said, Does he owe you any thing? He said, No, he did not want him upon that account. One thing brought up another. I mentioned the words he said about Stroud at the Ax. Chambers said, Did you know Stroud? I said, I did know him. He said, he saw a man throw very much at the pond, in a frock, a very little man. Chambers said, he thought it was Stroud. I told him it was not him, for Stroud was a great man, and cross-eyed. He asked me if I knew him; I said, Yes. He said, Would I tell him where he was; I told him where he was, and then he said Mr. Wilmot had bound him in a forty pound bond to find somebody that had been concerned in the murder, and he must take up somebody, and he would be obliged to me to tell him. I told him I saw nothing of the affair, and could say nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. You offered to shew him the man at the pails?</p>
               <p>Higgins. He said he did not know the man if he saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you told him what Knight had said at the Ax; did you tell him what Knight had said at the Nag's Head?</p>
               <p>Higgins. No, I did not say a word about that.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to say what he had said at the Nag's Head?</p>
               <p>Higgins. It did not come into my head. I said, that

               <p>Court. Let me understand you about the conversation you had at the Nag's Head. Are you positive that he told you that he must take up any body, if he could prove it upon him?</p>
               <p>Higgins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that at the Nag's Head?</p>
               <p>Higgins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And what was that for?</p>
               <p>Higgins. Mr. Wilmot offered 10 l. 10 s. and that he said the same night at the Nag's Head.</p>
               <p>Court. That was before the reward could be offered.</p>
               <p>Higgins. No, it was the next day after the murder was done he said he would take him up for the reward.</p>
               <p>Court. For what reward?</p>
               <p>Higgins. I am not certain it was the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it two days then after the murder?</p>
               <p>Higgins. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. How many days conversation had you with him about it?</p>
               <p>Higgins. He said so every day we were at work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Knight say, every day you was at work, that he would take up Stroud for the reward?</p>
               <p>Higgins. Yes, almost every day.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you at work?</p>
               <p>Higgins. At Mr. Bath's.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from Mr. Woolridge's?</p>
               <p>Higgins. A good way; there is a field and a workhouse between.</p>
               <p>Court. You told me that he would take up any body for the reward; now you say Him, or any body. Did he talk the next day about taking up Stroud?</p>
               <p>Higgins. I am not positive in that. As soon as ever the reward was offered in the papers, he said he would do it for the reward.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030077"/>Q. Who was by at the time of this conversation?</p>

               <p>Q. Did Chambers talk to you about offering any money, if you would assist in evidence?</p>
               <p>Higgins. He said I should have 30 l. if I would take him up, because he did not know him. I told him I would not be seen in the affair.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. Did he offer you 30 l. after you had told him you would shew him Stroud?</p>
               <p>Higgins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did he offer 30 l.</p>
               <p>Higgins. It may be he was afraid to take him up himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand that he was to take him up himself, with his own hands?</p>
               <p>Higgins. I could with an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. And don't you think Chambers could with an officer, as well as you?</p>
               <p>Higgins. I don't know but he might be afraid of it.</p>
               <p>Q. For fear of what?</p>
               <p>Higgins. For fear he might be hurt, or something.</p>
               <p>Q. So he would give you 30 l. to take up Stroud, after you had shewed him to him?</p>
               <p>Higgins. He wanted me to take him up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wilmot again. Upon Tuesday I happened to be at Hicks's Hall all day. When I came home, about eleven o'clock, I received a letter from a gentleman, giving an account of this cruel murder. I enquired of my people where it was committed; I found nobody had been to let them know any thing of it. When I enquired farther, I was told it was within about three hundred yards of my house. I immediately sent for the constable of the parish, and went down to Mr. Lloyd's. a public house, between eleven and twelve, with my servant, the beadle, and the constable of the parish. I ordered the door to be shut; I examined the people in the house; about twenty-four or twenty-five people were in the tap-room drinking; I examined them one by one; I could not find that any of them were guilty of this murder. The next morning I found that they went by the workhouse in my own parish. Some of my officers happened to be there: I sent for Mr. Woolridge, who is here; I begged he would give me an account as he was present; Mr. Woolridge called out to some people, and said, Let us be weavers; give me one of your aprons; I will be a weaver myself. The next day, Thursday, I advertised ten pounds reward myself for apprehending any person concerned in the murder; as to any body being bound over, there was no such thing as being bound over to find any body; Chambers was bound over to give evidence against Campbell; that was a long time after.</p>

               <p>Knight. No; I worked there some time afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing of this sort the reason of his discharging you?</p>

Stroud said, No; then he said, if he did not give him a pot of beer, he would take him up.</p>

               <p>Q. What have you heard relative to Stroud?</p>
               <p>Pagett. I am an officer; I had a writ against Winterson, that stands there, I think that is his name; I went in order to arrest him in Mr. Woolridge's ground, about five weeks ago, some time after the murder: the man was in the ground; he bid me defiance: there was eight or nine of them together; and they bid me defiance; I was obliged to retreat, for fear the plaintiff should fix me with the debt, if I made a caption, and he got away. I got up about two o'clock the next morning; he heard of my being there, and got away then: I waited then till seven in the morning: at six o'clock I fell in company with Cole; I said, It is very cold, will you have any purl? I will treat you with a pot: he enquired into my business, and said, We never thought you came after Mr. Winterson, but after Stroud; then I began to enquire what they should think I wanted Stroud for; said he, the street was all of an uproar when you came down yesterday; I knew it was in arms; a good many knowed me, says I; what, is it about Stroud that he is wanted upon? Why, says he, they thought you was come to take him about Clarke's murder; Why, says I, was he there? Yes, says he, he was there, and more in it than any weaver that was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he made use of that expression?</p>
               <p>Pagett. Yes; I am upon my oath; I told Mr. Woolridge of it: here is another gardener here works in the ground with the same man; I asked him his name; he would not tell me.</p>

I said, No; to do my duty; I said, I will do that; he said, You will get your head cut open presently: I said, Very well; I wish I could see the man that should do it; says he, He is a resolute man you are after; he said, We did not think you had come to arrest Winterson, for he has not lived this way a great while; we thought you had come after my fellow servant; I said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030079"/> What has your fellow servant done? he said, I suppose you have heard talk something of that affair of the pond, said he; I was there at the time, and there is a very infamous fellow that is in our ground, and he has a right to be taken up; and if any body will give evidence, I will appear against him.</p>

            . I was in the field when Clarke was killed. I went out; I was not out above a quarter of an hour. I never saw Baldwin in the fields till after Clarke was taken out of the water. Clarke was at the edge of the pond then; a little time after that, somebody drew him out of the water. Mr. Baldwin came past me, and said, How does it go? Why, says I, he is not dead yet. Says he, I will go and have a look at him. He has declared to other people -</p>
               <p>Q. Has he to you declared any thing?</p>
               <p>Stock. He said in my room, he would do any thing rather than work, for he was sick of it: this was before the accident happened. There was like to be a war, and he said he would turn kidnapper.</p>

               <p>Driver. Yes.</p>
               <p>Here the evidence was closed on both sides, and the judge summed it up to the jury, after which Campbell asked leave to call some more witnesses.</p>
               <p>As their names had not been inserted in the list of witnesses given on both sides, at the beginning of the trial, when the witnesses were taken out of court in order to be examined separately, the council for the crown had a right to object to their examination; but they generously declared that they had no objection to his calling whatever witnesses he thought proper, though their names had not been before given into court.</p>

               <p>*** The remarkable circumstance of Stroud's declaring his innocence of the murder of Clarke, to his last moments, has occasioned several letters to the Publisher hereof, desiring the trial may be printed without any abridgement, that the public may be able to form a proper judgment; on which account he has given it at large; so that it is hoped our Readers will not be offended that our compliance with their request has rendered it impossible to include the whole Proceedings of this very long Sessions in less than five parts.</p>

I was not in liquor; the soldiers had no arms; they threw me down upon the ground; I did not understand what they said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030084"/> to me; they took my watch, and money: it was broad day light. The house upon my complaining I had been robbed, sent the hostler to bring me back to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say nothing to him when he took the guinea in he house?</p>
               <p>Tennant. No; because nobody in the house understood French. I had seven guineas; I put two loose into my pocket, because I did not chuse to show my money; the rest was in my purse; I had all my money in my purse when I came into the house: it was in the public house I took out first the light guinea; then the other guinea, which was changed; I took out the other two guineas, that if I wanted money I might not be obliged to take out all the money at once; I put the purse into my right hand pocket, and my other money in my left pocket, which was the reason why the soldiers missed my purse, and took only the two guineas from me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in England?</p>
               <p>Tennant. I came to England last Monday; I had only laid one night in London. Kilbert was taken immediately after: they are both the men that robbed me, coming from a farm that was in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they offer any other violence than throwing you down?</p>
               <p>Tennant. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you drank at the public house?</p>
               <p>Tennant. I drank two or three small glasses of wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in liquor?</p>
               <p>Tennant. No; I was a little merry, but not drunk; the soldier put my hands over his shoulders, and walked with me to the place where he throwed me down.</p>
               <p>Kilbert. He only swears this for the reward.</p>
               <p>Tennant. The justice told me I should get some money for my expences, if I convicted the offenders; but I know of no other reward.</p>

            . I keep the Red Lion. These four people, the two soldiers, and the two Frenchmen, came into my house on Wednesday last. They called for a pot of porter. The Frenchmen were between the soldiers. They drank a pot of beer. After the pot was out, one of the soldiers called for a bottle of wine. I thought they did not appear as if they drank wine. I hesitated; one of the soldiers said, D - n your eyes, what do you mean, bring a bottle of wine, I will pay for it. I brought it, and said, Gentlemen, pay for it, I don't chuse to chalk up wine. The soldier said. Blast you, don't scruple, bring another bottle, I will pay for both. The Frenchman took out his purse, and threw a guinea on the table, which I did not approve of. I found it light; I told them it was a bad guinea; the soldier said, D - n your eyes, bring another bottle upon the strength of it. They were very lavish with it, and gave it to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030085"/> any body that would ask for it. The soldier took up the light guinea, and put it in his pocket. The Frenchman took out another guinea, and gave me; and Kilbert threw back two shillings for a fourth bottle of wine, which they had; then the other soldier put the money in his pocket. The soldier grew uneasy, and wanted more wine; I would not let them have it: then he said, D - n my eyes, let us go. This witness sat down at the door; the two soldiers took the prosecutor with them; they walked about thirty yards: whether he was tripped up, or fell by accident, I could not distinguish, but he fell, and the other two men fell upon him. What they did when they fell I cannot tell; I immediately suspected they were upon no good design: I sent the hostler to fetch the Frenchman back; Kilbert came back along with the Frenchman, the other made off. Kilbert would have persuaded him not to go back with the hostler, but go with him. The other Frenchman went up to the prosecutor. Kilbert left him, and went away. They began to jabber. The other man explained to me, that he had been robbed. We took the soldier before the justice, and found that identical light guinea in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the same light guinea?</p>
               <p>Salt. Yes; the prisoner pretended he had taken that guinea for hay-making. The prisoner Kilbert, when first examined, insisted he had never seen the other man before; that he did not know his name; but next morning, when committed, he acknowledged he knew the other man very well. The watch was afterwards found in the prosecutor's great coat pocket. I remember seeing the watch, when the Frenchman went out, in his sob, for I saw the chain dangling low upon his thigh. The soldier was sober, the Frenchman a little in liquor, but not so much but as to know what passed.</p>
               <p>Kilbert's Defence.</p>
               <p>The landlord seeing the Frenchman in company with us, he encouraged us to drink wine. The landlord brought two bottles when we called but for one, till he made us drunk: it was not my guinea; the Frenchman would make me take the guinea; I don't know whether he did not put it into my pocket; I cannot tell certainly. After we came out of the house, we were walking along; he fell by mere accident: I am entirely innocent; I took nothing from the Frenchman. I would have gone home, but I was so much in liquor I did not know the way.</p>

               <p>What Kilbert has said is very true. I went immediately home.</p>

             from the fifth of June.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the date?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Because I am sure of it: if I get a patient, I always book it; it was on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come to you, or you go to him?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I went to him in Petticoat-lane, some court or other, I believe they call it Bull Court.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever attended him before?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far do you live off?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. In Plough-street, Whitechapel, not far from the church.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning did you send to him?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. It might be between eleven and twelve in the forenoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came for you?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I believe a young fellow; I cannot justly recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Lyons?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes, at his house.</p>
               <p>Q. What room was he in?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. In his room, I believe; two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he up, or in bed?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. In bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the matter with him?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. He had a pleurisy; I bled him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay with him?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Best part of half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he before he got better of this?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I went to see him the evening. following. I attended him ten or eleven days.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had bled him in the morning, when did you first see him again?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. In the evening, about eight, or half after eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in bed, or up?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. In bed.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. The usual time next morning; I go out about eleven or twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition did you find him?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Very bad in bed; I ordered him medicines.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on Thursday?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes, in the evening; I always attended him twice a day.</p>
               <p>Q. And upon Friday?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes, then I attended him between eleven and twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition did you find him on Friday?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. The same condition, rather worse; he was sick in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he able to get up, in your judgement?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Not as I know; to my thinking, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you see him afterwards?</p>
               <p>Benjamine. It was after the Sabbath was begun, in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the evening?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Pretty near eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was not past eight?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. It might be past eight; I will not swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I am sure it was light.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find him?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. In the same place I left him in all the times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find him in bed on Friday evening?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I believe he was in bed; to the best or my memory he was: I attended him in the morning, and desired him not to go out.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030088"/>Q. In what situation was his on Friday evening; how did he appear</p>
               <p>Benjamin. As a sick man.</p>
               <p>Q. How did his appear?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. A stitch in his side, with a pledrify: I bled him.</p>
               <p>Q. Again?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes, on the Sunday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not bled between Wednesday and Sunday?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he was able to get up or o out?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Not to go out, as I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him again on Saturday morning?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes. He appeared much the same as usual, rather better. Sick people are generally better in a morning than an evening.</p>
               <p>Court. How long have you known this man?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Five or six years.</p>
               <p>Q. What way of life was he in?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know how he gets his living?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have known him five or six years, and not know how he gets his living?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. It is not my business; I don't enquire about such things.</p>
               <p>Q. But your own patients, I should think, among your own people, you would know?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I understood he worked in the jewellery business.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he any family?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. A brother and sister, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a housekeeper?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I believe he is.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever before at his house?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes, when any of the family were ailing.</p>
               <p>Q. How many days did he keep his bed?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I attended him nine or ten days.</p>

               <p>Q. How many days did he keep his bed?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Four, or five, or six days, I will not say; I bled him on Sunday; he was not well then.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you would not have bled him if he had been well?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I thought him ill.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you attended him nine or ten days; he did not keep his bed all the time, did he?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. That I will not say.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell how long he did keep his bed?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I will not say he kept his bed any time, because I was not with him the time.</p>
               <p>Q. But you can tell how often you found him it bed when you attended him?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I believe five days.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was more than two days?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure more than three?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. That I am sure too.</p>
               <p>Q. What will you say to four days?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I will not say to that. I am sure he was in bed on Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. That may be, that is an idle day. Are you sure of the day of the week when you first attended him?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes, on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the month was that?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. The fifth of June, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear first of this misfortune that had happened to him, that he was accused of this crime?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I was ordered to come here to attend this court.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you when you first heard of his being accused of this crime?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. About a week or ten days ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not hear of it till a week or ten days ago?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us you entered the date in your book when patients commenced?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You set down what you prescribe for them too?</p>

               <p>Benjamin. Yes, in a book.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you that book here?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What, is it in English or Hebrew?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Neither, it is in Latin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he send to you as soon as he was taken up, to let you know he was taken up?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what justice they had been before?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you never applied to before to attend here?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the house to take care of him when he was so ill?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030089"/>Benjamin. I believe a young fellow that was in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Only a young fellow?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I cannot say who attended him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any nurse?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish you had brought us that book of yours;</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I have not got it here.</p>
               <p>Q. How long should you be in fetching that book, we should have it here; I suppose there is entered in that book all you prescribed for him from time to time and his name?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I did not prescribe a great deal for him. I repeated the same medicine over and over again.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. For a pleurisy, what I thought proper.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you tell us what you thought proper to prescribe for him?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Only boluses.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the composition?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. The composition in plain English, is Venice treakle and spermaceti, and this I prescribed for him.</p>
               <p>Q. And any thing else?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. And powders thrice a day, powders of crabs eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you put down on your book all those prescriptions?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In a regular day-book?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I do not keep a regular day-book, my business is not so great.</p>
               <p>Q. But you must keep some book to make out your bills?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I have a small pocket book I keep it in.</p>
               <p>Q. Then perhaps you may have that book about you?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I have not that book, I have another book.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is that book, you keep it in Latin?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I must be at home at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who have you at home any body that can give it if we send for it?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I do not think they can.</p>
               <p>Court. It is of meat consequence to have your evidence established, (he takes out a little pocket book, and looks over it.)</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I have not got it here.</p>
               <p>Court. I should not think it likely you should have it there because you told me you entered down the time you first attended this man, entered the name and what you prescribed for him in Latin?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes, I entered it in my book.</p>
               <p>Q. In Latin?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I entered it down on such a day.</p>
               <p>Q. But in Latin?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I prescribed it in Latin to my druggist. I do not keep a shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Well then, who is your druggist?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Mr. - what's his name; (there he appeared much confused, and made a long pause. I never was in a court in my life, nor nothing like it.</p>
               <p>Court. Take time to consider of it, I asked you who that druggist was?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I cannot remember the name now.</p>
               <p>Court. Not remember the name now, where does he live, surely you may know where he lives; I can forgive you for not remembering his name, but you must know where he lives?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. He lives by Aldgate, the corner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rogers. There are two druggists there, one is Humphryes, and the other Crowther.</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I believe it is Humphryes.</p>
               <p>Q. You prescribe your medicines, and they are made up at a druggists, you must know who is your druggist you deal with?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is this man you deal with?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Humphryes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does he live?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. The corner of Little Duke's place, facing the pump, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know your own druggist, tell me exactly where he lives?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I do as I know.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in Plow-street?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Between three and four years.</p>
               <p>Q. It is impossible you can be a stranger; you must know the spot exactly; where does he live, does he live opposite the pump, or where?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Not far from the pump, there are two or three live thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Which do you mean?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Only this one lives on the right-hand side of the way as you go towards the 'Change from Aldgate.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030090"/>Q. Are you sure of that, that it is the right side of the way as you go towards the 'Change?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect yourself, is it the left-hand or the right-hand side of the way?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. The right-hand side.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the house?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you show the house?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you dealt with Mr. Humphreys?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Three or four years.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose he has got upon his file all your prescriptions?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I gave no prescriptions, because I am no physician.</p>
               <p>Q. How are your medicines made up?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I tell them what to take, and how they are to be mixed up.</p>
               <p>Q. Remember you told me before, not having the medicines in your own house, you prescribed them in Latin for your druggist to make up?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. That is in writing?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. No; I go there and tell him how to make it up.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you go and tell them in Latin how to make it up?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And if Mr. Humphreys was here, do you think that he would tell us that when you come to have your medicines made up, you prescribe them in Latin?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes, the very same.</p>
               <p>Q. You dealt with this man three or four years, has he made up all your medicines during that time?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way, for ready money, or was there an account between you?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Always for ready money.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he would know you again?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If you deal for ready money, how is it that you keep the account between yourself and patients?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Because I do not bring great bills in, I must have so much for the cure.</p>
               <p>Q. How much had you for this young man's cure?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I am not paid yet.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the account?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many times you attended him?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I do not go this way, if I bring a bill, I must be paid according to what I say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what quantity of medicines you sent to him?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all the medicines sent in to this young man, made up at Humphryes's?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. No; I made up a great many at home, some drops that I keep.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect which of the medicines were made up at Humphryes's, when the young man was ill, that he had, and which you made up yourself?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I cannot justly recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave him repeated boluse's made of Venice treakle and spermaceti; you had not got these things yourself?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I bought sometimes a trifle and mixed them up afterwards myself at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do that in this instance, or send your prescriptions to Humphry's?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I went there the first time, I bought the things and mixed them up myself at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect what quantity of Venice treakle or spermaceti you bought at the time this young man was taken ill?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. You only bought the quantity once at Mr. Humphryes's, and that was all?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me you prescribed the medicines in Latin to your druggist; now I find there was no such prescription, for you only went and ordered so much spermeacti and Venice treakle?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. No, my lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, you seem to have been a little confused, and sometimes to have spoke not quite consistent with yourself in some part of your evidence; recollect yourself and tell us whether you are sure you ever attended this young man at all?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I am sure I have.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030091"/>Q. And are you sure when you first began to attend him?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And what makes you sure as to the time?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Because I am positive: there was a fire-work on Tower-hill the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect it by any other circumstances, except remembering a fire-work the day before; is there any thing else occasion your remembering it to be the next day after the fire-work?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I have got it down, it is the 5th of June.</p>
               <p>Q. As you told me before you had entered it in your book, and the medicines in Latin you gave from time to time?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Not the medicines, I never do that, that is good for a druggist or apothecary.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell me you did do it; you know I asked you if it was in English or Hebrew, you told me in neither, it was in Latin; you understand Latin, I suppose?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. A little.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you turn Venice treakle and spermaceti into Latin?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes I can.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Venice treakle in Latin? (here he pauses.)</p>
               <p>Court. Perhaps you may have forgot. Can you tell me what is spermaceti.</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Dreock is Venice treakle.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the powder of crabs eyes?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Oculus concororam.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I want to know where these entries are that you told me you made in Latin?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I did not make any entry in Latin.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, do you now stand by it or not that when you go to your druggist you describe these drugs in Latin?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. No; I only tell him what the drugs are I want, and then make them up myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there are none of these prescriptions or descriptions in Latin, of your medicines? you have none?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. No.</p>
               <p>Council for Lyons</p>
               <p>Q. Had this man, Lyons, any family?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his wife?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I saw a woman there, and there was a man there. I gave orders to the man in the room, to give him the medicines as I ordered.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose, if there had been a wife there to take care of him you would have taken notice of that; you would have given the directions to her, to be sure?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes, to be sure.</p>

               <p>Jacob. Yes; the fourth of June, the king's birth-day; he went to see the merry-making at Tower-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with him?</p>
               <p>Jacob. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go out?</p>
               <p>Jacob. Yes; sometime in the afternoon.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him come home?</p>
               <p>Jacob. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time?</p>
               <p>Jacob. In the evening, between nine and ten, almost ten; he was very ill, and obliged to go to bed; he complained he was very ill, crushed with the mob. He could not stand.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he keep his bed?</p>
               <p>Jacob. About nine or ten days; he got up about the room, but was not fit to go about.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose, being ill, he was pretty much at home?</p>
               <p>Jacob. Always at home.</p>

               <p>Jacob. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what time the Doctor came?</p>
               <p>Jacob. I believe, in the afternoon of the fifth, on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him in the afternoon?</p>
               <p>Jacob. I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what time?</p>
               <p>Jacob. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he came in the morning, or not?</p>
               <p>Jacob. I am pretty sure he came in the afternoon; what hour, I am not certain; he bled him, and gave him some medicines; some stuffs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what sort of medicines? In what form?</p>
               <p>Jacob. Something to rub his sides, and some stuff to take inwardly; I cannot tell what; some was like ointment, to rub his sides.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he to have to swallow? was it liquid or pills?</p>
               <p>Jacob. Pills and liquids too.</p>
               <p>Q. What, in phials or boxes?</p>
               <p>Jacob. The ointment in boxes; some in little bottles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pull them out ready, or mix any thing at the house?</p>
               <p>Jacob. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any powders?</p>
               <p>Jacob. I cannot recollect whether I did or no.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any medicines given at the time he bled him?</p>
               <p>Jacob. I cannot say; I was in the room when he bled him, not when he gave him the medicines.</p>
               <p>Q. How, then, do you know what medicines he gave him?</p>
               <p>Jacob. I said, I did not take particular notice.</p>

               <p>Q. That was on Wednesday. Did you see him every day?</p>
               <p>Jacob. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the doctor the next time?</p>
               <p>Jacob. On Sunday morning, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him between Wednesday and Thursday, any time?</p>
               <p>Jacob. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him give any medicines? Did you see him when he brought the medicines?</p>
               <p>Jacob. Yes; on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. What time?</p>
               <p>Jacob. The afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did he give them?</p>
               <p>Jacob. I cannot tell. I was at work; he went to give the medicines in the back room.</p>
               <p>Q. What room do you work in?</p>
               <p>Jacob. The two pair of stairs fore room; the man lay in the back room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the back room at all?</p>
               <p>Jacob. Yes; when the doctor bled him, I went in for that.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do?</p>
               <p>Jacob. Nothing at all, I only saw the doctor bleed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hold the bason, or do any thing?</p>

               <p>Jacob. I held the bason for him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay in the room, after the doctor bled him? Did you stay in the back room till the doctor went away, or did you leave the doctor there?</p>
               <p>Jacob. When the doctor shut him up, after the blood was done running, I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Who first; you, or the doctor?</p>
               <p>Jacob. The doctor.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he stay in the room, after you came out?</p>
               <p>Jacob. About half an hour; I cannot tell how long.</p>
               <p>Q. From Wednesday to Sunday, did you work in that room?</p>
               <p>Jacob. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The whole time?</p>
               <p>Jacob. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you keep any servants?</p>
               <p>Jacob. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go out on your business?</p>
               <p>Jacob. No; not in the day time, only in the night time; all the days, I was in the room at work, from morning till night, except the sabbath.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the doctor there on Thursday?</p>
               <p>Jacob. No.</p>
               <p>Q. On Friday?</p>
               <p>Jacob. I did not take particular notice whether he came or no.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you on Friday?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030093"/>Jacob. At work.</p>

             in the three pair of stairs back room: I am a bookbinder. Lyons lodged in the two pair of stairs back room. I have lived there three months. Lyons went out on the king's birth-night; when he came home, he said he was not well, his head ached.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing else the matter with him?</p>
               <p>Harris. No; he sent a boy the same night to Mr. Benjamin.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was a boy?</p>
               <p>Harris. Jacobs told me the same night, that it was a boy. I saw Mr. Benjamin in Lyon's room the next day, but don't know the day of the week, nor the time of day; and Israel Jacob was there. The doctor said, he must bleed him in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bleed him then, in the morning?</p>
               <p>Harris. No, only in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do in the morning?</p>
               <p>Harris. I don't know, I did not stay in the room. I saw the doctor in the afternoon go up to Mr. Lyons, but did not go up myself. I saw the doctor the next day go up to Mr. Lyons; I was going out.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was that?</p>
               <p>Harris. I can't remember; it was the next day after the fire-works.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did Lyons keep his bed?</p>
               <p>Harris. Eight or ten days.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030095"/>Q. Do you mean that he kept his bed, or did not come out of his room?</p>

               <p>Mrs. Leake. I was going by the Stage-coach into Norfolk, on June 5, between eleven and twelve o'clock, and took a hackney-coach; I took a parcel of boxes and other things in the coach with me, the box containing the things mentioned in the indictment, I had packed up myself, and afterwards sowed it up in a wrapper. I had given it to my maid to put into the coach, after I understood from my maid that she had put it into the coach, I saw it in the boot; in order to be more certain about it, I spoke to the coachman to know if he was sure he had the box; he said he had, and gave me the dimensions of it with his whip, to assure me he had it; at the very instant almost he turned round and swore that the box was gone. I know nothing of the persons who took it.</p>

            . I lodge up two pair of stairs in the same house as Mrs. Johnson lives. I was looking through my own room window, a little after six in the evening, on the nineteenth of May, the prisoner was in the house five minutes; she went out with a lap full of things; she had nothing in her lap when she came in. I am sure it was the prisoner; I had never seen her before; I ran down stairs, and put my hand to this woman's door, and it flew open. I went after her towards the temple, cried Stopthief. I overtook her; and, her apron opening, I saw the corner of the gown. I said, I would swear it was Mrs. Johnson's (as I saw it was a brown silk gown, and pink silk lining); I took her home with me; the constable came; as he was among the rest of the mob, I desired him to take her up to my room. She put all the things upon my table; the constable took her out. I am sure those are the things I took out of her apron.</p>

               <p>Phillips. Yes. She came in with nothing in her apron, and afterwards went out with her apron full.</p>
               <p>- Bishop. About the nineteenth day of May, I was sent for about a robbery committed in the house of Mr. Marshall, about a quarter past six. I saw the prisoner with her apron full of these things; I asked her where she got them; she said, a young man gave them her. When I asked her what they were, she said they were things given her by a young man in brown clothes, to take care of for him; she said she did not know where the man was; I asked her where she was going with them; she said, she would shew me, if I would go with her; I told her she must go with me. I took her up stairs, and took these things out of her apron. These things, they are produced, are the things. When she was before the justice, she made the same defence a before.</p>

I was cracking nuts; a man, dressed in brown clothes, came, and says to me, Be kind enough to take this bundle; he said that the funeral was of a relation of his. I stood three or four minutes, and then followed the man; I was not gone two minutes, when she ran after me, abused me, and brought me back to the house where I stood upon the step.</p>

               <p>- Garrard. I am a gangsman: I belong to Smart's and Dyce's key; I saw the prisoner at the bar on the twenty-first of May, when I was landing a lighter of sugar; I saw this man about ten o'clock in the morning, loitering about; I took him with his hands in the hogshead, taking the sugar out, and he had a bag under his apron which he put it into: I went and seized him, and saw the bag with the sugar in. (The sugar produced.) This sugar belonged to Messrs. Christian and Smith.</p>

               <p>I was going by to look for work where they were landing sugar; they cried out, Who works? I said, I will; I went, and some of the sugar came out of one of the casks; I took it up; some of the ticket porters gave me handfuls; it was as black as it could be; I was taking it off the ground.</p>

My servant not returning, I went there and found him in great distress, and found he had been defrauded. I am servant to the prosecutor. I was sent with nineteen pair of silk stockings; the prisoner received me in the dining room. I delivered him the stockings; he said he would go and shew them to his master in the next room: I was rather dubieus about trusting him; but being in the same house, I thought they were safe, so I let him have them to shew his master. The prisoner did not return again, so, after waiting some time, I opened the door where I thought to find the prisoner and his master; there was nobody there: upon enquiry I found he had no interest there; he only lay there that night, in a lodging taken for his master. The prisoner was taken that night; eighteen pair of the stockings were found on him.</p>

               <p>William Biggs. I am a farmer and victualler, at Stanstead, in Hertfordshire. On the sixteenth of January, I sent two teams to London, with flour. My man brought me word that two horses were seized by two men and a constable, one from each waggon. Sweetman, Smith, and Howard, sent me a notice to meet them next day at the Swan, in Fetter-lane: this is the notice (producing it, it is read.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Biggs, Sir,</p>
               <p>Take notice, that unless you meet me at the Swan, in Foster-lane, No. 108. porsley at twelve o'clock, your horses will be condemed according to law.</p>

               <p>I went there, and found Sweetman, Smith, and Howard. I took two of my friends with me; I asked them who they were; they gave me their names; they shewed me the act of parliament, and told me my horses were forfeited. I asked them what they valued them at; at first they said, thirteen guineas; however, they came lower, till at last they asked four guineas; I throwed the four guineas down upon the table; Sweetman insisted upon two guineas more, and he refused one guinea being too light; my friend changed it; they took the four guineas: then a sort of an attorney they had there, drew up a kind of a preamble; that was a promise that I should not proceed against them afte rwards: my friend and I insisted upon going before a justice, which they refused; they wrote an order to the constable, and signed it with their three names, for him to deliver the horses; they called it a warrant. I went to Mr. Goulding, the constable, in the evening; he refused to part with the horses: we went before justice Wilmot; he said the constable had an authority to deliver the horses by that writing: I paid five shillings, and got my horses out, and sent them home.</p>

            . I was with Mr. Biggs on the 17th of January, at Fetter-lane: I was a neighbour of his; I came up with intention to buy these horses, thinking they were forfeited, as I deal in horses: the prisoners, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030102"/> another, not here, were for compounding it; were for going before a magistrate, and they were not willing to go any where. Mr. Biggs had no objection to go before the magistrate; he wished to go there, and would have met them at any hour in the day; they would not fix upon any time: we could have them go before Mr. Wilmot; they would not: Mr. Biggs threw down four guineas; they refused it: Sweetman would have two guineas more; I said, We will not give it, the horses shall be forfeited first; then they agreed to take four guineas, which I paid them.</p>
               <p>Q. from Sweetman. He said Biggs threw down the money; I understood Biggs before that his friend threw down the money.</p>
               <p>Court. No; he threw down the other guinea in the room of the light one he objected to.</p>

            's when Mr. Keeling officiated for Sir John at the examination of the prisoner. Mr. Bonham was sworn. A number of persons were brought into the room, I believe not less than twenty, that Mr. Bonham might fix on the culprit, and Mr. Bonham did so; he very calmly and sedately looked round the room from man to man, and he did deliberately fix upon the prisoner, and said, That is the man. Mr. Bonham's servant, who stood by, did not at all interfere; but some time after his matter had thus fixed upon the prisoner, he spoke, an said, That is the man; I perfectly know the man. At the second examination, the prisoner said, You little jeweller, how should you advertise that I had defrauded you of a diamond ring of twenty-seven pounds value, and eigh guineas. Know, there is a balance of money due to me. You know you owe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030104"/> me the odd shillings upon the balance. Don't you know (says the prisoner) that I was to call upon you for the balance. To which Mr. Bonham replied, Aye, but you knew better things than to call upon me. Sir John said, I thought you was going to ask Mr. Bonham such questions as might induce us to believe you innocent. Don't you know you are confirming your own guilt?</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. You seem to be so exact in every thing that passed; pray, can you recollect how many odd shillings I mentioned to Mr. Bonham were owing to me?</p>
               <p>Gines. I can't recollect exactly.</p>
               <p>Court. Prisoner, that sort of behaviour will not be of use to you; conduct yourself with decency becoming your situation.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know myself innocent; therefore I hope your lordship will permit me to ask such questions as I think necessary.</p>
               <p>Court. You may ask any questions that may be of service to you, but don't be so flippant.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When Mr. Bonham was desired to pick out the man, whether he did not say he could not swear to the man, as it was six months ago?</p>
               <p>Mr. Gines. Mr. Bonham did not say that, he walked round Sir John's office with great caution; he said it was six months ago; and after he had deliberately walked round from man to man, he fixed upon the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did Mr. Bonham intimate that he said no more about it, because I cleared it up so plain: this Davis would have been a material witness with regard to my innocence. I will call a witness to prove that one Humphreys paid away drafts many times: my name is

               <p>Q. You told me just now that he believed it was, but it was six months ago, and a man might alter his face?</p>
