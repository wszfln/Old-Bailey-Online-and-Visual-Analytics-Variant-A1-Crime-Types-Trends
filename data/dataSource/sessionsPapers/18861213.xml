                  </hi>. I live with my husband at 1, Victoria Place, Shadwell—on the morning of 20th November I was at 5, Victoria Place, a friend's house—I got back home between twenty minutes to 1 and 1 o'clock—we occupy the whole house—I had left nobody there, but had left the door ajar—when I came in I saw the prisoner and another young man, a sailor, in the downstairs parlour—there was no woman there—I said "Young man, what are you doing there?"—he said "I think I came here with a young woman"—I said "You have made a mistake, you have come into the wrong house"—the prisoner looked perfectly sober; the other man was very drunk—the prisoner made no answer, so I laid my baby on the bed and said "You have made a mistake"—he drew a white-handled knife out of his trousers pocket and opened it and put it right through the upper part of my left arm—I saw the knife quite plain in his hand—I said "Oh, young man, you have stabbed me, "and I ran back to 5, Victoria Terrace, where a young man lay dead—I told my husband, who was there, that I was stabbed—I remained there, but hearing screams from the direction of my house I ran back there and saw my husband lying on the floor, and the prisoner was jobbing a knife in his shoulder and left side, I think he got four or five stabs in the back—I called three or four men to take him to the hospital—the prisoner ran out—I afterwards saw him taken into custody.</p>

On 20th November I was at No. 5, Victoria Place with my wife—we had only left an old woman upstairs at our house—my wife went home a little after 1 o'clock, and after about five minutes she came running back, saying she was stabbed in the arm—she was bleeding down her wrist—I went back to fetch the baby—I went into the room we occupied; the prisoner was behind the door—he stabbed me in the chest—I turned round quick; he shut the door—I struggled with him—I went down to get hold of his legs, and he stabbed me four times in the back and shoulder—I tossed him over my shoulder, opened the door, and got out—I could just see the white handle of a knife—two or three men took me to the hospital, where I am being attended to now.</p>

On the night of November 9th I received Fletcher into my custody—in consequence of the statement he made to me, I went on the following day to Messrs. Harvest's premises, and saw Mott and spoke to him, and in consequence of what he said I took him in custody—I then saw Fuller; he also made a statement to me, and I handed him over to Saunders, another detective, who took him to the station—from information we then had we went to 90, Villiers Street, Walworth, a grocer's shop kept by Knight—I saw him and said "Mr. Knight"—he said "Yes"—I said, "We are police officers; we have three men in custody named Ephraim Mott, Fletcher, and Fuller, charged with stealing a quantity of tartaric acid from their employers, Messrs. Harvest and Co., of Dowgate Dock; they have stated that you received it through Messrs. Carter Paterson and Co., and also Messrs. Pickford"—he said, "I don't know these men, nor have I received any tartaric acid"—I said, "They state that you received about 1 cwt. On Friday, the 5th inst., from a man named Knock in the employ of Messrs. Pickford and Co."—he said, "I have not received anything at all from Messrs. Pickford and Co., or of Carter Paterson, and I don't know anything of these men"—I said, "Have you any tartaric acid by you?"—he produced a tin containing about 2lb. I should think, and said, "This is all I have, I have had it for some time"—I said, "Have you invoices or any entries in your books with reference to tartaric acid?"—he said, "No, I have none, I have not bought any"—I told him we should take him to the City, where he would be charged with receiving a quantity of tartaric acid from these men, meaning Mott, Fuller, and Fletcher, well knowing it to have been stolen—I also said, "They state that you paid them 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound for it through a man named Fisher"—that was the first time the name of Fisher had been mentioned—he said, "I know nothing of these men, and I never bought any"—I believe he said he knew Fisher, but he denied that he knew either Fuller or Fletcher or Mott—when he was charged he said, "You say the 5th November?"—the inspector said in my presence, "On or about"—the</p>

I don't know these men, I never had any dealings with them, Fisher did not work there," mean<lb/>ing Messrs.

I am a labourer, and live at Parson's Green, Enfield—on 23rd November, a little after 11 p.m., I was going home along the footpath in Pennyfather's fields—Whiter walked with me and Saunders behind on the grass—Saunders struck me in the back of the neck and knocked me down; they held me down—Whitter picked my pocket of 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a few halfpence; both took to their legs, one ran along the path and the other on the grass—I heard the gate go—I said "I know you" when I was on the ground.</p>

About a quarter to 10 p.m. on 8th December I arrested Brooks at a public-house in Globe Road—I walked across to him and touched him on the shoulder and said "Mr. Brooks, I want you"—he said "How do you know my name is Brooks?"—I said "I know you very well, I shall take you in custody for being concerned with two other men now in custody in stealing some spices"—he said "All right"—when I got in the Mile End Road he said "I will speak the truth; <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> the watchman unlocked the gates and let me in; he then went to the lobby, took the key from the hook on the board, took me to Messrs. White and Palmer's office on the first floor, and assisted me in bringing the stuff downstairs"—he also stated that the arrangement was made on the Friday previous to the Sunday, in the Ship public-house, Tower Street—I took him to the station and he was charged—on the way to the Mansion House last Friday, in the presence of Detective Harding, he said "I gave <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>, the watchman, a sovereign," pointing to the ship public-house as we passed, "and I was going to give him some more on the Monday."</p>

On the evening of 25th November I was called to 45, Old Compton Street, where I saw Mr. Brewster and the prisoner—Brewster said, "I wish to give this man into custody for attempting to pass a counterfeit florin"—the prisoner said nothing—I searched him, and found in his outside overcoat pocket three counter<lb/>feit florins, and two shillings, three sixpences, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. bronze in his trousers pockets—I told him I should take him into custody for attempt<lb/>ing to pass a counterfeit coin; he made no reply—I received this bad florin from Brewster—I took the prisoner to the station, and he was charged formally—in answer to the inspector he said, "I have no address, I live at a common lodging-house"—I think he was pretending to be drunk; he staggered about a great deal, but sometimes he walked very well.</p>

Neate Pocock"—he said "Take my account out of this cheque"—I looked at it and said "Who is Webber?"—he said "Oh, he is all right, if it is for 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that is the party that I told you I got 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. commission from, for the re-sale of a house in Budge Row"—I said "I will give you a sovereign"—he said "Give me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., because I have a guinea to give to another party; you know me, you have no need to be afraid"—I said "I will give you a sovereign, and give you the balance when I have passed it through my bank"—I gave him the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he had just come from the Hotel Metropole, where he had been staying with Webber; that he asked him for some cash there, and he had none, and he gave him the cheque—I paid in the cheque to my bankers, the London Joint Stock Bank, on Monday morning, and it was returned to me on Wednesday marked "No account"—it was crossed and endorsed when I got it—I believed it to be a good cheque when I parted with my money.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, Abbey Cottages, Abbey Road—I am 21 years of age—I have known the prisoner about 18 months—I had engaged to marry him him at Christmas, but about three weeks before 9th November I had put it off—during that three weeks the prisoner on several occasions asked me to go for a walk with him—on a Sunday night, a day or so before 9th November, he asked me to go with him to the Millwall Docks—I said I should not go—on the Tuesday he came to see me about 2 or 2.30; he came in and sat by the fire—I got up to wash myself; after I had done so he asked if I was going out—I said I was going to Stratford—he said "Can I come with you?"—I said "No; I don't want you"—he said "It seems to me as if you don't want me to go anywhere with you"—I said "No"—he asked was I going to the dock with him—I said "No, not on a day like this"—one or two more words passed—he asked me again should he go to Stratford—I said "No"—he then asked me to give him a plain under<lb/>standing did I intend to have him or not—I did not answer at first—he said "Do you intend to have me?"—I said "I will gave you an answer, the fact of it is I don't want you"—he said "No, I know you don't, and did not for a long time"—I then went out in front and he went into the back yard—when I had got a little way on to Abbey Bridge he came running after me, about 100 yards from my house; I turned round to the girl who was with me and said "Here he comes; I don't want him along Stratford with me"—he came and caught hold of me by my shawl and pushed me against the wall and said "You gave me a plain understanding, do you mean it?"—I said "Yes," upon which he said "You shall have no one else"—I said "I shall please myself about that"—he said "I swear you shall roll dead at my feet on this bridge," at the same time he pulled his knife out and stabbed me in the back; I fell on the ground on my face, and he knelt down and stabbed me twice more—I saw the knife glittering and tried to get it from him, and after that he turned round and knelt on me across my chest and tried to strangle me—before I was struck I saw a man in a cart, and said "Master, come down, he is going to stab me"—after I was on the ground someone came and pulled him of—after he was pulled off he tried to kick me—then I went away—I believe he was sober.</p>

               <p>November, about 8.10, I was standing under an awning outside the shop—it was a wet night—I saw one of White's ginger-beer vans, drawn by a pair of horses, coming along at a very rapid pace, as far as I could judge about 10 miles an hour; the horses were galloping—Mrs. Medland was crossing from the butcher's shop to where I was—she was about 7 of 8 feet across the road—it is a granite crossing there—the pole of the van seemed to strike her forehead, and knocked her down, and the horses trampled over her, but the wheels did not go over her—she had her umbrella up—I did not hear any one calling out before she was knocked down; there was a lot of shouting out—the van went on about 18 or 19 yards before it was pulled up—I went and picked the woman up; a constable came, she was assisted to a surgery, and the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the Alleyne's Head—on 17th October, about 5.15, three men were there; Shrimpton was one I am con<lb/>fident, and my belief is Rogers was another—they had three halves of bitter—two of them came in first—I saw a cab outside at the time to which Shrimpton was attending—the other men asked for beer to take out to him, and I said that was not allowed; then he came in—they were in the house about two minutes, I think—next day I heard of the rob<lb/>bery, and two or three weeks after I went to the police-station and picked out Shrimpton from a row of seven or nine men—Rogers was not there then—I picked out Rogers after that from a number of men.</p>

Shrimpton was in the house about one and a half minutes; he did not speak to me—that was a slack time; no one else was in at the time—Jackson was outside; I did not see him inside, it was closing time—I saw Jackson in the evening—I did not notice Shrimpton inside then—on 17th October they were all strangers to me—I gave my evidence on 11th November—Shrimpton was the end man of the row at the station when I identified him—some of the others had black beards—I had not been shown a bill describing the men, nor had it been read to me; I did not know there was one about—Brown fetched me to the station; neither he nor Moss told me anything about a man in a high hat—I recognised Shrimpton at once; I did not look at the others.</p>
