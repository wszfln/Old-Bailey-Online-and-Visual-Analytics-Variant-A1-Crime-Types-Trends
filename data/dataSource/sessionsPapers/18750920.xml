On 25th August, a little after 5 o'clock in the evening, I was on duty on the road leading to Acton from Willesden—the London and North Western Railway runs under a bridge, which crosses the road there—I saw the prisoner and three other young men there—I was about 15 yards from them—there was a passenger train going by—I saw the prisoner stoop down and pick up a stone from the side of the footway and throw it at the train that was passing, whether it hit or not I can't say—I immediately took the prisoner into custody—he said "I threw the stone over, but I did not intend to do any harm"—he was taken to the station, and I went off to the station-master—the other young men were waiting outside the station; I only took the one I saw throw the stone—the stone was about the size of an egg—I only saw him throw one.</p>

I went to where I told her to wait, but she was gone—I then went to No. 9, Derby Street, in a cab—I saw the landlady, went upstairs and found Granville—I saw a port<lb/>manteau—I asked Granville who it belonged to—she said it belonged to her husband—I had previously told her who I was, and said "I shall have to take these portmanteaus away, for I have every reason to believe they have been stolen, and she said "Oh dear me no, I am sure you have made a great mistake, for he is no thief, it is his own portmanteau"—the port<lb/>manteau was locked—I asked Granville if that was the only room they occupied; she said "Yes"—I asked her if there was any more property in the room besides these portmanteaus belonging to Howell—she said "In that chest of drawers you will find his underclothing, and it all belongs to him, that I know"—I searched the drawers and found some under clothing belonging to Howell and some under clothing belonging to a Mr. Arden and Colonel Adair—I called Granville's attention to the fact of those names</p>

                  </hi>. I am a potato merchant, of 20 and 49, Tooley Street—I am one of the directors of this company—I was a director in June, 1874—I know the prisoner's handwriting—I produce the minute book of the company—there is a minute of 16th June, 1874, that is not in the prisoner's writing; I can't say that it was made in his presence—he attended a meeting on that day; an arrangement was entered into with him at that meeting appointing him secretary; it was reduced into writing and he had it to copy and some one on his behalf copied it—the resolution was that each of us, the directors and secretary, was to give his services gratuitously till such time as the mine should become a dividend paying one—the prisoner accepted the office of secretary; and it was arranged at that meeting that he should receive a shilling as a registration fee—he then entered into the service of the company and acted as secretary, from 14th May till 27th July, 1875—on 2nd September, 1874, the following minute is in the prisoner's writing: "It is further resolved that as no salary has yet been fixed for the secretary, that a cheque for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. be drawn in his favour as a gratuity"—he received that cheque which was duly honoured—on 24th March, 1875, this minute was in the prisoner's writing: "The secretary, having again applied for a salary, it was proposed that a cheque for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. be drawn in his favour as a gratuity, and should the mine prove to be a dividend paying one, then the services, past and future of the secretary shall undergo a fair consideration at the hands of the directors"—he received that three guineas—if money was sent to the office his duty was to pay it into the National Provincial Bank of England on behalf of the company—that was told to him—the company had an account at that bank—in February, 1875, a call was made—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the printed form of call sent out by the pri<lb/>soner—he kept the cash book and all the books of the company—the business was carried on at 184, Palmerstone Buildings, Bishopsgate Street—he had some one in the office, but in what capacity I can't say; he was not employed by the company—the last meeting of the directors before 27th July, 1875, was on 24th March—the cash book was always laid before the directors at their meetings; it was always kept by the prisoner—there is no entry on 23rd April of a sum of 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Mr. Mackenzie—there is an entry on 8th April of two sums of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there is no entry on 17th May; on the 31st there is an entry of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from M. H. Aschin—the bankers' book is here—the last amount paid in is on 21st May—neither of these sums have been paid over to the directors, or accounted for—these three receipts and the letter on the back of one are the pri<lb/>soner's writing—the directors did not, that I am aware of, give orders for that letter to be written to Mr. Mackenzie—the endorsement on this cheque is the prisoner's writing—between 24th March and 27th July the prisoner came to me representing that we wanted money to pay the labour in Wales, I told him that knowing Mr. Mackenzie and Mr. Aschin, and being in the same line of business as myself, I should call on them for money, he begged me not to do so; he said it would place him in such a position, as secre<lb/>tary it was his duty to have money either sent to him at the office that he would relieve me of the trouble, being largely engaged in business, and he would go himself—in consequence of that I did not go—it was on the meeting of 27th July that I first discovered these entries in the cash book—May did not attend that meeting—no meeting was called between 24th March and 27th July because the directors were living very far distant</p>

               <p>from May, and having but little cash in hand, and very little business doing, it was considered unnecessary to call them together, and they left the case in my hands to give directions to the secretary according to the report I received from him when the next meeting should be called—there had been no agreement entered into by the directors and May about paying him a salary, except what I have read—on 27th July he sent in this letter, making a claim for services rendered. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "I beg to enclose you my account against the company for salary up to the present time, showing a balance due to me of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and as I am much in need of a little money I shall feel greatly obliged if you would make arrangements to <hi rend="italic">let</hi> me have a cheque this week.") That enclosed an account for salary for 13 months at 6 guineas a week, 81<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and credit is given for two sums of 3 guineas and for balance of cash in hand, 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and balance due, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I attended every meeting of the directors—that was the first I heard of any claim for salary.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Southall—I am a gardener in the employment of Dr. Stewart, of that place—on the Thursday morning, 29th July last, about 445, I was proceeding to my work at Dr. Stewart's,—which is in North Road; it is the next house to the Elms on the left-hand side, it is called the Shrubberies—(<hi rend="italic">referring to a plan</hi>) the carriage door is just opposite the lamp post—the Elms is at the corner, the end abuts on the North Road, the front faces the High Road—almost directly after I turned the corner, about 6 or 7 yards, I saw the body of a woman, it was just in the gully grating, the middle of the body was over the grating—it was quite daylight—the head was towards the Uxbridge Road—I went up to the body, the clothes were turned up to the chin, leaving the whole of the body quite exposed—I saw Police-constable Cooper coming in the opposite direction; I made signs to him to come to me—before he came up I touched the body to ascertain whether she was cold; she was quite cold on the face and legs, and quite dead—I noticed a bruise on the left side of the neck, I noticed nothing on the face—the tongue was slightly protruding from the month—she was lying on her back, the right leg was extended straight from, the body and the other drawn up, but yet extended from the centre of the body—I noticed a swelling, a large lump on the bottom of the stomach close to her private parts—I noticed that because it was so prominent, not from the colour but from the size of it—I also noticed a quantity of dirt in or on that part—the constable procured a cart ladder and with my assistance he placed the body on it—on moving the body the constable picked up this cap (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and immediately after<lb/>wards I picked up a pair of cots, to the best of my knowledge these are them, they are things that brickmakers use to handle bricks with, they are made of leather, principally from old boots—one of her boots was off and lying 3 or 4 yards from the body in the road; I can't say whether it was the right or left boot; it was on the edge of a trail that I noticed, the dust had been disturbed above the body towards the Uxbridge road and a little towards the left hand side of the road, on the opposite side to that on which the body was lying; it was a little towards the side but near the centre of the road, between the body and Dr. Stewart's, only higher up, it left an irregular mark about a yard in width—I mean the mark where the dirt looked as if it had been first disturbed; extending from this was a trail leading to the place where the body was in the form of an arc—it looked as if the dust had been disturbed, sweeping round in a circular form, it was one continuous sweep; there was a trail from that to the body, it looked as if the body had fallen in the centre of the road and the trail led right up to the place where the body lay, as if her clothes had flopped down in the road—the body was close up to the hedge, there is a slight bank up to the hedge, and it was just at the bottom of the hedge—the length of the trail was about 8 or 9 yards—it had been a fine night, the ground was quite dry, there was a quantity of dust, there had not been</p>

               <p>any rain for a week—the boot was on the edge of the trail, about half-way: down the trail and on the side nearest the hedge, it was an old spring side: boot, but the springs were almost gone, it would have been very easy to. have pulled off—nobody was about there except the constable—I observed two marks just below the woman's legs, they were two indentations in the ground, the ground was very soft there—I formed an opinion from the appearance of the marks that they had been caused by the toes of a man's boots sticking in the ground, they looked like that—they were almost in a line with the centre of the body, between the two legs, but about a foot below—the legs were open and wide apart—I noticed a bruise on one of the legs, near the knee; I could not say on which leg, I think it was slightly below the knee, but I could not say.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon living at Hanwell, and am divisional surgeon to the police—on the morning of 29th July, I was sent for by the police to go to Southall—I went to the Red Lion and there saw the body of a woman lying dead in the tap-room; that was about 7 o'clock—I carefully examined the body; I made notes when I returned home—the bonnet and clothes were on the body—the first thing that called my attention was a bruise on the left temple, it was a bruise and an abrasion as well, and a few drops of blood had oozed from it—the bruise extended from the temple down the left side of the neck under the lower jaw, and the parts were swollen under the jaw and at the side of the neck—the bruise was about from three to four inches wide from the side of the neck under the jaw; the abrasion was on the left temple; that was not more than an inch long—I did not measure it—I had to unpin the bonnet to see a portion of what I have described, it was pinned under the chin with one pin—I also unpinned a bit of ribbon that was round the neck; they were not tightly pinned on—it was all discoloured from the temple down the side of the neck and under the lower jaw, it was a bluish black; that was owing to effusion of blood under the skin—the lips were congested, that is, of a bluish colour, darkish—neither the ribbon under the chin or that round the neck could have produced any injury during life—on removing the clothes I found the body still warm round the waist, where it had been covered by the clothes—the rest of the body was cold—there <hi rend="italic">were</hi> no marks about the body—between the legs on the right thigh and partially on the lower part of her person, there was a swelling, on the right external labia, about the size of an <hi rend="italic">egg</hi>, and on pressing it some slight blood oozed from the parts, showing a communication—there was no abrasion, only the swelling;' the internal parts must have been injured to have caused what I saw—there was a rupture of the mucous membrane lining the vagina—there was a quantity of gritty dust and sand in the vagina—there was a slight abrasion on the left knee about an inch long, just over the knee cap; in my judgment the cause of death was direct violence applied to the head and neck—I should say death had taken place from four to six hours when I saw the body.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE GUILTY</hi>. There was nothing but a bruise and swelling; that was caused by violence, but how caused I should not like to state positively—there must have been very great external violence to have done that, such violence as I considered sufficient to cause death—a fall would not account for the injuries, nor could they have been done by herself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Supposing a fall, the result of a push, I do not think that would cause such injuries as I saw on the head—it would be violence, but not sufficient to produce what I saw—it would depend on the force that came in contact with the body, there should have been some protrud<lb/>ing body to have got under the lower jaw to produce what I describe, and I have no evidence to show me that there was anything of the kind—if she was expelled from the house and fell on the edge of a stone step, in my opinion that would not account for the abrasion and discoloration I observed on her head—I do not think that would account for what I saw—I made a careful examination—I did not open the body or head, my</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187509200020"/>
               <p>opinion was founded on the external appearances—I considered the external examination sufficient to enable me to account for the death—I am a surgeon of twenty years' experience, I have been an army surgeon, and have seen every kind of wound—I have been for many years in the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich, where we have every kind of injury—I was nine and a half years in the army, and have seen every possible kind of injury that could be inflicted by force—I describe the abrasion as a slight one—the ribbon was tight but not sufficiently tight to—cause strangulation—it was pinned in the ordinary way—I described it as tight before the Magistrate—I should say it fitted accurately round the neck, but not so as to produce any injurious effect—I cannot suppose that it could cause strangulation if she were drunk and rolling about the road, because on re<lb/>moving the ribbon there was no mark of tightening, which must have been there if it had produced any injurious effect—there must have been a regular mark left on the neck, but there was not—there would have been a line all round the neck if it had produced congestion of the upper part of the head—I did not smell her breath, there was no breath to smell, it was all gone—I had no means of ascertaining whether she had been in liquor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I should say that death might be almost instantaneous from such an injury as I saw, or in a very few minutes—it would affect the senses at once—there was no dirt or grit about the neck, nor any mark of any jagged thing having struck it, except on the temple—I do not think that the discoloration, which extended all down, was consequent upon the abrasion on the temple—I think there must have been more than one act of violence, one on the temple and another under the neck or under the jaw over the large blood vessels and nerves—I should say her age was from about fifty-eight to sixty, as near as I could judge.</p>

I am the wife of John Taylor, a labourer, in the employ<lb/>ment of Mr. Whittington, a farmer at Yedding, about 2 miles from Southall—on 28th July we had been hay-making there—Stone Street was also employed there; he had been at work with us for a week or more—I have known him for the last three years and his family; he lives just past Mr. Whittington's—on this evening I was at the Black florae, at Southall, with my husband, Sarah Ware and her husband, and her brother Richard Wilkins, and Stonestreet—we left Mr. Whittington's between 7 and 8 o'clock, and met Drinkwater on our way—he went with us to the Black Horse; I don't know what time we got there—we called for several pots of beer there, and were drinking in the tap-room—about half an hour or twenty minutes after we were there I noticed an elderly woman come into the tap-room; she had fusees in her hand to sell—I did not notice how she was dressed—she stood there two or three minutes, and we asked her if she would drink out of our pot—she said "Yes," and then she said "<hi rend="italic">Now</hi> you have asked me to drink I will go and fetch a pot of beer and you shall drink with me," and she went and fetched a pot into the tap-room—we drank some of it; it was more to associate with us two women, she did not care for the association of the men much—she stayed there till it was time to close the house—I saw her leave—I left first with my child in my, arms, and was waiting outside for my husband and the rest to come out—she seemed rather obstinate in coming out; the landlord told her it was time to go out, and she did not seem to take heed to his words, and he took her by. the shoulders and put her out of the door, and after I saw her put out she fell—she seemed to fall right in front—I was standing by the side of the step and she fell to the left—I did not notice whether she hurt herself—I saw her get up and turn to the left, and I never saw anything more of her—by that time my husband and the rest of them were out, and we went to the right, towards the blacksmith's shop, and then all our men sat down; they were very drunk—Stonestreet was with us; he was helping Thomas Ware home, who was very drunk and insensible—I did not see Drinkwater at that time; I did not see him come out of the public-house, but when we were at the smithy I heard him come and call Stonestreet—we were then sitting down close opposite the smithy, because our husbands were very much in drink, and we had a job to get them along—Thomas Ware was lying in the road—Drinkwater called "<hi rend="italic">Joby</hi>, I want you a moment," and Stonestreet. went back with him in the direction of the Black Horse—we then went on a little further, within about 20 yards of where we had to cross the fields, and our husbands sat down again—I was persuading my husband to come home; he was rather ill-tempered in drink, and said he would not—I said something that he did not like, and he went to strike me—I was afraid he would strike my child, and I cried out "Murder!" Three times—after that we turned to go across Mr. Rice's fields, and when we got into the hay field Stonestreet overtook us—I can't exactly say the time, but I believe it was about three quarters of an hour after he had left us—he came into the hayfield were we were—we had sat down there again in the haycocks—I did not notice then whether he was wearing any hat or cap, because it was very dark—at the time</p>

I am the husband of the last witness—I am a labourer—on 28th July I was employed by Mr. Whittington hay making, we finished that day—I was one of the men that went to the Black Horse—I saw the prisoners there—we all came out together—Stone Street came along with us as far as the blacksmith's shop—when we were there Drinkwater came back for Stonestreet and they went back together towards the Black Horse—that was the last I saw of either of them that night—next morning I saw Stonestreet with a handkerchief on his head; that was about 4. o'clock as near as I can guess, in Mr. Rice's field, at the place where we used to cook our food—we were lying there on the hay—I suppose it was getting towards 12 o'clock when we left the smithy to go to the hay field—I was a little the worse for liquor—I did not see Stonestreet again till 4 o'clock, I don't know where Drinkwater was at that time, I saw him it might be half an hour afterwards, he came into the hay field and joined Stonestreet—Stonestreet said to him "How did you leave the old woman?"—I think he said "As you left her," but I don't remember—Stonestreet said "Well, we are going away harvesting and we must not come back here again, for I expect a policeman after us"—that was all I heard said—they both went along with us to General Wood's harvesting; we left about 9.30 or 10 o'clock in the morning and we got to work at General Wood's about 4 o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hay maker—I was in the employment of Mr. Whittington—on the evening of 28th July I was at the Black Horse with my husband, the Taylors, and others—my husband got the worse for drink—I saw an old woman come in—she drank three or four times with us—at the time for closing we were all turned out—the landlord took the old woman by the shoolders and put her out—she fell down—I did not notice how she fell—I was outside the house; she fell right down but I did not see how—the landlord had not hold of her at that time; her whole body fell on the ground—I did not notice her head going on the ground; she fell on her knees—I was looking after my husband at the time—I saw her get up and walk away to the left, and I saw no more of her; she" got up without assistance—I and the others went to the right towards Uxbridge, Taylor and his wife, my husband, my brother, and Stone Street—when we got down by the blacksmiths Stonestreet was with us, he was helping me home with my husband—while doing that I heard Drinkwater come and call him back; I did not hear what he said; he came close to us—he came up to Stonestreet as he was along with me and my husband—I saw him, he called out and Stonestreet went back with him in the direction of the Black Horse—I should think it was 11.30 by then—we were sitting down just above the blacksmith's shop—we then went on a little way up the road, and afterwards went into Mr. Rice's hay field—I can't say how long we took getting there—after we had been there some time I saw Stonestreet, he overtook us in the field before we got to the bridge, just before we got to Rice's field; I should think that was nearly two o'clock, but I can't say exactly—in the meantime the men had been lying by the side of the road, we could not get them any further—Stonestreet stopped in the hay field—I did not see anything more of Drinkwater till we got to his father's house, between 4 and 5 o'clock—we passed his house as we were going to our master's farm again; Stone-Street was with us—we were going to Mr. Wittington's farm where my family was; I was going to fetch them—we had to pass Drinkwater's father's house, and saw Drinkwater in his father's premises, outside the door; he was dressed—after we got to Mr. Whittington's farm Drink-water came there, and I heard Stonestreet say "What has become of the old woman, and where did she go to"—Drinkwater said that he waked up and found himself lying by the side of the old woman, and she laid there just as they left her, and he took his <hi rend="italic">hook</hi> away from her—I did not hear Stonestreet say anything to that—at that time Stonestreet had a handker<lb/>chief on his head, and Drinkwater was wearing Stonestreet's hat, a billy cock—Drinkwater said he could not find his own, and he should keep Stonestreet's until he found his own—nothing further was said—we left Mr. Whitting<lb/>ton's between 8 and 9 o'clock in the morning all together, and went to West Drayton, and then to Shepperton Green to General <hi rend="italic">Wood's</hi>, where we cut some corn—the prisoners went there with us, they and my brother took the corn together—we went from there to Guildford, and then to Sutton in Sussex, and after we had been there three or four days, Drinkwater's father came down—I can't say the day of the month that was—we went to Shepperton Green on Saturday, and came away on Wednesday morning—Drinkwater's father saw him at Sutton—I did not hear what passed, he stopped with us the night—I heard Drinkwater say to Stonestreet that night when he was in bed "Get up <hi rend="italic">Joby</hi>, we must go away"—I asked Stonestreet if he had done anything that forced him to go away—he said he had not done anything—Drinkwater said "Yes, you have, you know what</p>

               <p>I told you about the old woman"—I told him the old woman had her feel<lb/>ings, the same as his own mother and me, and she ought not to be used badly more than us—I had not heard about the old woman before the father came down Drink water told me that she was dead—he told me that in the public-house at Sutton, the same night the father came, about half an hour after Drink-water woke Stonestreet up—I did not know who he meant by "The old woman," no further than from what he told Stonestreet before, and seeing her at the Black Horse—next morning I heard Drinkwater say that the old woman was drunk—my husband asked Stonestreet if he had had to do with the old woman, and he said yes, there were four of them, and all four had to do with her—Drinkwater was present then—he did not say any<lb/>thing on that; he only said the old woman was drunk—I said if she was tipsy she ought not be ill used—the father went away by the first train in the morning, and the prisoners went away together; Stonestreet said they were going to Aldershot—I heard nothing more of them till they were in custody—the cap produced is Drinkwater's; he was wearing it on the night of the 28th, when we were at the beer-house, and I had seen him wearing it in the village.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector X.</hi>) About 6 o'clock on the morning of 29th July, I heard of this matter, and went to the North Road and saw the roadway—there was a place of about 8 or 9 yards in a circular form, when something had been dragged; that was about 42 yards, by my stepping from the corner of the Uxbridge Road, and 45 yards to where the body lay—I saw marks at the side of the road as if it had been trampled upon, it was very soft—there was an inquest on 31st July, and an open verdict re turned—on Saturday, 21st August, I went to Guildford with an officer named Strange—I there found the prisoners in custody—they were handed over to me by superintendent Barker, of the surrey constabulary—I told them they would be charged on suspicion of wilfully murdering a woman at Southall, on 29th July—Drinkwater said "We know nothing of killing the woman, we had to do with her"—Stone Street said nothing—I took them to Hanwell Station, the charge was then entered and read to them—I cautioned them that they had no occasion to say anything, but what they did say I should repeat again—Drinkwater again said "We know nothing about killing the woman, we had to do with her, and we left her with two other <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi>; she stood five or six pots of beer; after we left the beer-house she went round the corner, a little way up the lane, and laid down—he also said "The landlord, threw the woman out of the beer-house"—Stonestreet said at the same time "We had to do with the woman, and left two other <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> with her"—I asked them if they would know either of those men—they said they were strangers to them, and they did not think they should know them again if they saw them—Stonestreet said that; Drinkwater was by and did not say anything—I produced this cap and cots at that time, and without either of them being asked Drinkwater said "They are mine"—the distance from the smithy to Rice's field is about a mile and a quarter—across the fields it would be about a mile—from the smithy to the Elms, at the corner of the North Road, is about 200 yards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Charles Meeking and others—Alfred Brown, is a member of the firm—I am employed in the woollen department in Hatton Garden, where tailors' materials are sold—the prisoner has been in the habit of dealing there for those materials for from four to six years, and for five or six months' past my attention has been directed to him—on 16th March, between 4 and 5 o'clock, I saw him in the woollen department; he went to the department where coatings are kept, which is further inside—I went behind a stack of goods, and saw him take a remnant from under the counter, and put it on a recess behind him; he was behind the counter—after looking round him he took it from behind him and put it in his bag, which he closed and remained standing there—there was no one near, and he was not served till five minutes after<lb/>wards—I told the clerk and the shop walker, and the next morning I told Mr. Brown—no steps were taken, but it was in consequence of that that I</p>

               <p>observed him particularly when he came again on 11th August—he spoke to Mr. Phillips, who was near me, and then walked on into the coating department, and into the tweed room—I followed him and watched him—I thought I saw him taking a remnant from under the counter and stepped forward quickly and saw the remnant half in the bag and half out—by a quick movement of his hand it was pushed entirely into the bag—he then took out a saucer or a piece of earthenware, put it back and closed the bag again—no one was near him—I moved nearer to him and said "Is anyone serving you!"—he said "No, not yet"—I asked him what he wanted—he said "A blue serge, some twill, and canvas," and we went upstairs to the department where they are kept—he was served with six yards of blue serge and received this invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)—we then went to another department where he was served with some twill and canvas which came to 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the total amount of his bill was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the money was paid—the cash boy brought back the receipt, but I did not see whether it was given to him to him—he did not say a word about anything in his bag or ask to have it put on the bill and charged to him—none of the articles mentioned on the bill would have been purchased in the department where he put the piece of stuff in his bag—he paid the money at the counter—he then asked me to find him a nice sheet of paper if I could—I went to fetch it, spoke to somebody, and did not go back—the prisoner was called to the counting-house, and I stood outside—I partly heard what took place—Mr. Brown was there, and the prisoner, and star, a policeman—Mr. Brown said "We have reason to believe that there is cloth in that bag, which is stolen, let me look"—the prisoner at once opened the bag, took out the cloth, and put it on the counter and said "If you think that is yours"—I identified it as the remnant which had been under the counter—Mr. Brown said "I must give you in custody," or something to that effect—the prisoner said "Good God, you won't do that," or something like that—he was taken to the station—there were two yards of cloth worth about 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

While I was hesitating he said "Go on, its all right; in fact Mr. Pickles wants me, for one or two little things."

I live at No. 30, Greenwood Road, and am the wife of Mr. James Higgs—on the afternoon of the 10th August I was walking in the Greenwood Road at about 2.30, and bad a watch and chain with me, when I observed two men, one on either side of the road—one called to the other, and he immediately rushed towards me and snatched at my chain and broke it—I did not see their faces—I screamed very loudly and he ran away, and the other man asked him if he had got it and he said "No"—his companion made use of very bad language, and I screamed again, fearing he was going to attack me—then he ran away, and I followed him—both ran away—I lost sight of them as they turned the corner, but not before Mr. Fiestal had seen them—I called to Mr. Fiestal, whom I saw coming towards me, to stop the thief—I did not promise Felton a shilling to run after the thief and catch him—the prisoners were then taken into custody—I saw Felton taken, and the other was brought into the station when I was there.</p>

I am the draughtsman and assistant engineer to the London Gas Light Company—this model (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>) of the premises, the hotel and the cellar in Pavilion Road, has been prepared under my directions and is as nearly correct as I was able to make it without access to the defendant's premises—I was instructed not to go near them—this (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>) is an enlarged plan from the ordnance map—there are two open courts at the extreme end of the hotel which are shown on the model by white paper, all the rest is roofed in—this is the harness room—in Pavilion Street there is a small dwelling-house in the occupation of Mr. Davis, a bootmaker, and a small shop in the occupation of Mr. Sturch, a saddler—there is an entrance there by which access is gained to the cellar under Mr. Sturch's place and also under two other rooms, one a work room and the other a living room—Pavilion Road is the road above the cellar in question where the gas was being burnt—this is the flap of the cellar (<hi rend="italic">describing</hi>)—I could see no communication between that cellar and the cellars of the hotel—the hotel is at the corner of Pavilion Street—the open courts at the back of the hotel, between the hotel and the cellar in question, are 14 feet across from wall to wall—from the wall of the harness room where the last gas light of the hotel is to the commencement of the cellar in question is 14 feet.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now a licensed victualler and keep the Crown public-house in Crown Street, Soho—I was employed by Mr. Sanderson as cellarman from about March, 1871, to the 8th September, 1873—I was sometimes engaged in attending to the wines underneath the house 131, Pavilion Road; they were ports and sherries in casks—the means of access to the cellar was by a flap from the Pavilion Road—when</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187509200039"/>
               <p>I first went there there were no means of warming the cellar at all—we always used candles—the cellar was dark—there was a door in it, but it was never used—it could not be used because the large casks were put against it—I remember the beehive apparatus coming to the hotel—I believe Mr. Sanderson was there at the time in the trap; I am not quite positive—the ring with the fish tail burners and the iron pan was brought with the beehive, but not the india-rubber tubing—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced.</hi>) to be the same pan, but I don't think this earthenware beehive is the same, it was a larger one that was there before—the rim used to fit outside on to the feet of the stand—Mr. Sanderson told me to go to the shop of a man named Attridge to get a man to have the piping fixed—he did not tell me on that occasion for what purpose he wanted it fixed, but sometime before he said we were going to have something to warm the cellar with—some short time after I went to Attridge's the apparatus was put up in the cellar and fixed—this 3/4—inch tap at the end of the tube was made by some<lb/>body at Attridge's shop—I had nothing to do with fixing it on—it was fixed to a large pipe in the cellar—I was not aware that the pipe commu<lb/>nicated directly with the main without any meter—I went into Mr. San<lb/>derson's service in March and I think it was somewhere about October that this happened; I can't say, it is five years ago—a thermometer was pro—vided—after the apparatus was fixed Mr. Sanderson instructed me always to keep the pan filled with water when the gas was alight—before it was fixed I went to the cellar say once a fortnight and after it was fixed I went every day if the machine was alight—it was not always kept burning in the winter, it would depend entirely upon the weather—if it was very cold it would be burning all day, we only wanted the cellar at a certain temp<lb/>erature—it was turned off at this thumb tap, that is the only place I turned it off—I should turn it down to regulate the heat—in very cold weather it would be left burning all day and all night if necessary—the pan was always kept filled with water in my time—when the beehive was over the fishtail burners you could not see the light from a great distance—the pan stood on the floor of the cellar—I may be wrong in saying this is not the same beehive, very likely it is the same with the rim broken off—the apparatus was only used in cold weather to regulate the temperature—it could be moved about and put in any part of the cellar—there were 17 feet of tubing and that would reach to any part of the cellar—I bottled wine and did the ordinary cellarman's duty in the cellar—the prisoner was generally there when I was there—he came round once in the day at all events—I had nothing to do with the gas in the hotel part of the premises, it was regulated in the bar and I had nothing to do inside the bar—I could—not say whether the gas in the hotel was turned off at night, I did not sleep on the premises—the place next to the two open courts was used as a harness room in my time—that was lighted with gas—the gas in the harness room in my time was at the end nearest the cellar as it is now—the flap of the cellar in Pavilion Road was padlocked at night when we were done, it was fastened with a padlock and key—the flap was easily removed when we went down—I never had any serious trouble with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This apparatus was used by Mr. Sanderson solely for the purpose of heating the cellar—when he spoke to me about it in the first instance, there had been several complaints that the wine, the port especi<lb/>ally, had got sick from cold, and as far as I could judge, what was in his mind was the best way of obtaining heat in the cellar—I think now, that it is</p>

               <p>quite likely that this beehive or jar is the one that was used in. the cellar—the rim at the bottom might have been broken off—if it had fitted on to this iron I should have had no doubt about it—I don't know whether that would be of service in concentrating the heat—there was a steam from the water, but it did not get hot—the water disappeared somewhere; it wants refilling every day if it is alight—we always continued to use candles in the cellar after this apparatus for warming was put up—it was only in the winter months that it was used, it would depend whether it was a long winter or not, how long was it used, say three months at the utmost—Mr. Attridge was a tradesman in the Pavilion Road—Mr. Sanderson appeared to know him very well—I knew he had an account with Mr. Sanderson—he was a jobbing man—I gave the order to Attridge in Mr. Sanderson's name—there was no concealment of any sort about it that I am aware of—I cer<lb/>tainly did not conceal anything, and did not receive any orders from Mr. Sanderson to do so—I should not think the job of fixing the apparatus would take long—it was desirable that an india rubber tube should be used, so that it could be moved about to different parts of the cellar for the purpose of warming, and that was the reason that was used instead of a pipe—I was with Mr. Sanderson about two and a half years—sometimes I should be round at the cellars all day at work, bottling a pipe or a butt—the cellar flap would be open during the whole of the time—that has frequently happened in the winter and in the summer—if I heard the hotel bell ring while I was in the cellar at work, I should go round to see what they wanted, and the flap would be left open—Mr. Sanderson was well known in the neighbourhood—anybody could see him go into this cellar—he his—not dis<lb/>guise or conceal himself in any way—he used to come down while I was at work there—I knew that there was gas all over the hotel, and also in the stable, which adjoins the harness room—there is an open court between the harness room and the back of the cellar, and there was a door there leading to the cellar—I never saw that door open—I have been told that at one time the tap of the hotel was situated over that cellar, but I don't know it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Candles were used in the ordinary course to give light for the purpose of bottling, and that was always so—when I was at work in the cellar men frequently came into the cellar on business, and also when Mr. Sanderson has been there—when I have been away to the hotel and returned I have never found any strangers there—nothing but cask wine was kept there.</p>

I live at Fawcett Street, Brompton—I was a barman and cellarman—I entered the defendant's service on 8th September, 1873—I succeeded Frost as cellarman; I left some time in April, 1875—the apparatus which has been produced was in the cellar when I went there, but it was not in use then; it was always used in cold weather to warm the cellar—I kept the pan supplied with water by Mr. Sanderson's directions—the gas was turned off at the thumb tap when the temperature was high enough—the tubing was attached to a large pipe in the wall—I certainly did not know that the gas was being burnt without passing through a meter—it was never turned off at the point where it joined the large pipe all the time I was there—during the winter months it was always burnt at night, and when it was very cold it was turned on full—I had to, fill the pan with water two or three and sometimes four times a week—Mr. Sander<lb/>son has been there occasionally when I have been there at work, but not very often—I slept in the hotel—when the gas has been turned off at the hotel I have found it burning in the cellar when I have gone there in the morning—Mr. Sanderson usually turned off the gas at the main in the hotel—he was the last one down at night—I used to put the key of the cellar in a drawer in the bar—I was barman as well as cellarman—there was no communication from any coal cellar in the hotel to the premises at 131, Pavilion Road—the coals at 75, Sloane Street we're kept next to the stable yard—the coal cellar was almost under the spirit cellar, adjoining the stables—you go through the kitchen of the hotel to get to the coal cellar—you could get to the coal cellar from the stables; they were always taken in through the stable gates—I did not give any information before I was subpoenaed as a witness—I left the service through illness—Mr. Sander<lb/>son told me to keep boards in front of the gas to keep the light from show<lb/>ing in the Street—that was when I first entered the service—I put some old champagne case lids across in front of the gas after receiving those directions.</p>

Mr. Sanderson pointed out another and said "That is water also"—we were all this time in the corner of the cellar—there was a confusion of beer pipes and spirit pipes at that place—at that moment one of the com<lb/>pany's men came partially down the cellar steps from the Pavilion Street side—he said "Mr. Tulley, you are wanted in the Pavilion Road"—I said to Sanderson "I am going into the Pavilion Road," and I asked Mr. Larkin to come, and I left the premises by the Pavilion Street entrance—Mr. Larkin and Bamford followed me and Sanderson—on reaching Pavilion Road I found the cellar flap up, and I found Mr. Neighbour and William Murphy, one of the company's men, there, and Boyt, the same man I had seen at work in the cellar of the hotel—Mr. Sanderson got down the cellar first, and he assisted me down—Mr. Neighbour put a light to this rim burner, and it ignited immediately—I told Mr. Sanderson I should take possession of all the apparatus now in court, likewise a piece of the com<lb/>pany's service pipe which I found immediately under where the tube was connected—the tubing was attached to a 3/4 inch barrel service pipe of the company—this piece of iron at the end of the tubing is not a usual fitting, it has been made by some gas fitter to fit the service pipe—I told Mr. Sanderson I should take possession of these things—he said "Is there not a meter"—the thing was not then detached, and I said "Look for yourself, can you see a meter, I can see none"—he was about to make some remarks but I desired him not to do so—I told him I should report the matter to my Board when they met on the Wednesday following, and I should advise him to see the Board; at the same time I would not pledge myself that the Board would see him under the circumstances—he then asked me if I would object to accompany him into the hotel—I said "Certainly not"—I saw a screw hammer like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in Boyt's hand, in the cellar—such an in<lb/>instrument as that would unfix the fittings of nearly every gas pipe—the jaws will move, and will take any sized pipe—such a tool as that would un<lb/>fasten the service from the main—you could not have better—when Boyt was attending to the beer in the cellar of the hotel, I think I saw one of those hammers lying behind him on a barrel—I did not notice whether Boyt took it up after Mr. Sanderson spoke to him, and when he left the cellar—I saw the pipe taken off and placed in the hands of the inspector, and I went to the hotel—Mr. Sanderson took me into the coffee room and said "You were kind enough to tell me when the Directors met, will you write it down for me?" I said "Certainly, I am very sorry for this, a man occupying a respectable position as you are"—I wrote down the particulars of the meeting, and the address—he then put his hands in his pockets and said "Well, what do you call it; what does it amount to?"—I said "Well, in the last case of a similar kind, it was called felony, and it amounted to</p>

               <p>twelve months' hard labour"—he said nothing to that—I understood from him that it was his intention to be at the Board on Wednesday—this was Monday—I have experimentalised on the fish tail burners—the lowest day pressure we have is 10-10ths of an inch, and the highest 15-10ths of an evening—I have tested the india rubber tubing, and it leaked to the extent of a foot and a quarter per hour—there are several perforations in it—the four burners would burn at the rate of 14 feet an hour in the day pressure, and the night pressure would increase it about half—I made a report to the directors—Mr. Sanderson came to the office, but he was not allowed to see the Board—I have traced the pipe from the inside of the cellar to the main in Pavilion Road—there was no connection that I could see between the hotel cellar and the Pavilion Road cellar—it was possible to have a pipe through all those walls, but there was no such pipe—I traced it to its source.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was my information that was laid before the Magis<lb/>trate by the company's solicitor—I was the chief officer—taking the supply of gas at the minimum, pressure from July 1870, to July, 1870,1 make it amount to 124<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that is supposing it to be burning day and night during the whole time—I had no other means of calculating; I took the entire time and the minimum pressure—it was increased 50 per cent at night, and I have not accounted for the leakage in the tube, which is continuous—a wrench of this kind is very much used by publicans, and it is used by gas fitters very frequently—I could not say whether it was closed or open when I saw it—I rather stopped what Mr. Sanderson was saying in the cellar—he did not say to me that he had acted in ignorance—I am quite sure of that—he said "What is the meaning of all this, does it not go through the meter"—I did not inquire whether the tap of the hotel was on that spot several years ago, my inquiries were as to the supply of gas—according to my inquiries there had been no gas in that house until it was laid on. For the saddler, and that was, 1860—I made an examination on the 26th August, to see if the gas in the cellar communicated with the hotel—I was' not ordered to do that by the directors—I did it on my own account as a <hi rend="italic"/> responsible officer of the company—I employed two or three men for the pur<lb/>pose; three I think there were—they were at work about an hour and a half, or two hours—I was not with them all the time they were so occupied—I was there a portion of the time—that was the occasion when I removed the whole of the pipe between the cellar and the main.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> That was after I had been examined as a witness at the police-court, and after I had sworn my information—I had no doubt at any time that the gas was taken from the Pavilion Road main, but after the prosecution commenced I thought I would take up the pipe—in the first instance information was given to the secretary, and the secretary com<lb/>municated to me and I acted upon the information and made inquiries—a paper without a signature, was handed to me by the secretary.</p>

I am assistant superintendent to the London Gas Light Company—I went with Mr. Tully, on 13th July, and again on the 19th, to Pavilion Road—I stationed myself at the doorway of 131, Pavilion Road—when I was standing at the corner of Pavilion Road and Pavilion Street, I saw a man coming towards me from Sloane Street—I had pre<lb/>viously examined the flap door of the cellar, and it was locked—the man came up to the cellar flap—he had a wrench in his hand like this one—I did not see him make any use of it at the flap, but he unlocked the door and</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was standing about 5 or 6 feet from the flap, when the man opened it—he knelt down and turned the iron bar over towards where I was standing, and I shifted about 2 yards further off—there had been a ring on the flap, but it was removed—it would not require any instrument to lift it—there was an upright piece parallel with the house. which the bar fastened, and that is on the flap, and when that is taken out the flap could be removed by putting your hand at the side—he did not say anything to me about opening the flap with the ring on that occasion—he spoke to me about it'last Thursday—there were four men waiting at the end of Pavilion Street, when the cellar flap was opened; Murphy and three others.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an Inspector of the Gas Light Company and have now the Grosvenor district, which includes the hotel in Sloane Street and also 131, Pavilion Road—from the receipts and memorandum put before me I have compiled an account of the consumption of gas at the Cadogan Hotel from 1869 down to April this year—this account (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is an exact copy of my book, and it agrees with the receipts which were produced at the police-court—whilst I have had charge of the district I have gone myself from time to time to see the meter—it is the duty of the servants of the company to take the index of the meter every quarter at the least, and sometimes more often—I had not the slightest idea that any gas was being consumed at 131, Pavilion Road—no application was made to me to put it on—Mr. Sanderson never applied to me for the extension of the gas from the Cadogan Hotel to the Pavilion Road—as a practical man, if I had to put on gas at 131, Pavilion Road, I should put it on from the main in Pavilion Road, and not from Sloane Street—from Pavilion Road would be the least expensive—I recollect being sent for on two occasions to see Mr. Sanderson with regard to the gas—we had a complaint that there was a bad supply of gas to the hotel, we went there and found the service pipe was stopped and remedied that defect—I saw Air. Sanderson on one occasion; I forget when it was—there was a second complaint as to the outside lamps not burning properly, and we found there was a stoppage in the pipe from the meter to the lamps—he never made any communication about the cellar in Pavilion Road—I accompanied Mr. Tully on 19th July—I gave a card to the barmaid and afterwards saw Mr. Sanderson—I went down in the cellar with Mr. Tully—I saw the man Boyt there—when Mr. Sanderson came down I said "We have come to see the meter, have you had any alterations made to the fittings lately?"—he said "No"—I said "None at all"—he said "No, only the lamps seen to"—I said "That I know, that was cleaned out"—he said "Yes"—I said "I mean any fittings going to the back"—he said "No"—Mr. Tully told him we had come to make an inspection of the pipes, knowing that he was burning gas in Pavilion Road, and he was asked whether there was any communication between the cellar where we</p>

               <p>were and the cellar in Pavilion Road—he said he did not know, he hardly knew how the gas went—I saw a large 3/4—inch pipe running across the cellar—I said "Perhaps this would be it, it runs that way"—we traced that up to the end of the wall and lost sight of it—I suggested to him that perhaps he could show us where it went, and he said "Well, that must go upstairs"—that was into an ante room, which was a kind of butler's room where they wash glasses—he said "That is the pipe there, that goes to my daughter's bedroom"—he pointed to another pipe, and said <hi rend="italic">"No</hi>, that is water"—he said "Yes, and that one is water too"—we retraced our steps into the vaults again, and Mr. Tully asked him whether there was any com-munication to the vault at the back from the front—he said "Well, yes, gentlemen, but it will be awkward to get at, it is by way of the coal cellar, you want a light"—we had a light and went as far as we could go, which was to the brick wall of the cellar under the hotel—I suggested then to Mr. Tully that we had better go round to Pavilion Road—I had seen Mr. Sanderson speak to Boyt—that was before he pointed out the pipe to his daughter's bedroom—Boyt left the cellar—he went towards the outlet, and we went further in—I did not see whether he took anything with him—Murphy came and we left and went to the other cellar—Mr. Sanderson went in first and Mr. Tully and myself followed—Mr. Sanderson helped us down—Mr. Tully called his attention to this pipe and connection that we found there, and ordered it to be taken possession of and the gas cut off—on the way from the Pavilion Street entrance of the hotel to the Pavilion Road we met a young man whom I had seen serving in the bar, and I heard him say to Mr. Sanderson "The horse has shot the stable."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Sanderson was paying on an average between 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for gas—he used some fish-tail burners in the hotel and some others—I think he has four patent burners in a chandelier over the bar—I don't know that he has as many as thirty in the house—I have not inquired or conversed with him on the subject—it was after the cellar flap was opened that the young man whom I had seen in the bar spoke to Mr. Sanderson—there were seven or eight gas men there altogether—when we went into the hotel cellar I introduced Mr. Tully to Mr. Sanderson—I said "I have been rather remiss, I ought to have introduced Mr. Tully to you as our superintendent"—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of the forms of receipts sup<lb/>plied by the company—they would be delivered every three months.</p>

I can now tell by reference to the ledger what Miss Adolphus' payments were, in and out, in the two years prior to her death—it was something like 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; the gross payments in, and all drawn out very shortly after the dividends were paid in—on 1st July, 1872, the balance was only about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe the account in 1872 was dealt with pretty much as in former years—from March to July, 1872, the cheques were drawn more rapidly; I believe on one occasion two were drawn in one day, and four or five in one week; that was unusual, the previous account was not so rapid.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Mercer &amp; Mercer, solicitors, of Copthal Court, City—I know all the four prisoners'—on 4th July, 1872, Cooper and Jenkins, then Mrs. Clark, came to the office, together—they saw me and Mr. Mercer—they brought with them the will that is now the subject of inquiry—they handed it to me and gave me instructions to obtain probate on it—I took their instructions and afterwards prepared the affidavits that have been produced—a caveat was entered by Dr. McGrath, and afterwards withdrawn—I saw the other two prisoners, the attesting witnesses; the will not being signed in the ordinary way, it was necessary that one of the attesting witnesses should make an affidavit that the signa<lb/>ture in the attestation clause, or in the body of the will as the case might be, was intended as her signature, that is under Lord St. Leonard's Act; it is the practice at the Registrars' Office to require it—the will has the affidavit annexed to it, to the effect that it was executed by the testatrix on the day of the date thereof by signing her name in the attestation clause thereof, meaning and intending the same for her final signature to her will as the same name appears thereon—on 19th July, Hannah came to the best of my belief with Mrs. Clark; I am not sure whether Cooper came—I went generally into the matter with him as to how the will had been made, and he told me substantially the same as he told me afterwards when the caveat was entered, and on the 20th the affidavits were prepared for the two executrix—the caveat was entered on 29th July; that was communicated to Cooper and Jenkins, and they came to us and I arranged that they should bring the attesting witnesses on the 12th, and on the 12th the four prisoner's came together—I then took down Hutchinson's statement, of which this is the substance, they were all in my room together—the state<lb/>ment I took from Hutchinson, was substantially the same as that which Hannah had previously told me—I afterwards read it over to Hutchinson and Hannah, listened to it at my request—when Hutchinson had signed it, I asked Hannah if it was right, and so on, and he slightly corrected it as you will see, the only correction was, "I had known her by sight some two or three years"—it was an addition, not a correction—the caveat was never withdrawn in terms, we warned the caveator to enter an appearance, he did not, and upon an affidavit of service of the warning, the probate passed through the registry—proceedings were afterwards taken in Chancery, with reference to the will, it was a petition to deal with the fund which was in Court; that assumed the validity of the will; that was in November, 1872; the petition was presented by Mrs. Clark, and Mrs. Cooper, was</p>

               <p>made a respondent—I have not got the petition here—I have the order that was made upon it, dated 17th January, 1873, by Vice Chancellor Malins, directing a payment out on the petition. (<hi rend="italic">This was an order to transfer the sum of</hi> 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">odd to Mary Cooper, and the residue to Amelia Clark</hi>). That 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was capitalised upon a calculation of what the value of Cooper's annuity under the will was, there was a subsequent order of 20th February, 1874, which dealt with the fund of Edwin, the son of sir Jacob Adolphus, that order transferred to Mrs. Jenkins' trustees, the sum of 5,644<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 3 per cent., that all went to the trustees; she had at that time married again, and this was under the marriage settlement—Mrs. Cooper took no interest in that; she had already capitalised her annuity—in July, 1874, there were adverse Chancery proceedings with a view to stop the fund, and a bill was filed by the subsequent plaintiff in the Probate Court—I then prepared these affidavits for the deponents who respectively swore to them, Hannah and Hutchinson, with a view to resist the applica<lb/>tion made in Chancery; I took the statements which they had made to me, and put it in the form of an affidavit and sent a clerk with them to get them made by the deponents—those are the affidavits of 15th July, 1874—I produce two cheques of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, dated 4th July, 1872, the day the testatrix died, payable to Mrs. Cooper, and signed Emma Adolphus—those have not been paid—they were given to me by Mrs. Copper, or Mrs. Clark; I can't say which at this distance of time, at, or a few days after they brought the will—I find by my entry at the time that on 12th July, I went to Robarts, and took the cheques to identify myself with the business, they not knowing me; I conferred with one of the principal clerks there, and he gave me some information as to the state of the account, and as far as my memory serves me there was not sufficient to meet either of the cheques at that time—the first affidavits were made on 15th July—the second ones were prepared pretty much in the same manner, they all rested upon the original statements made to me by Hannah and Hutchinson; by Hannah, in the first instance, and Hutchin<lb/>son, in the second.</p>

I cannot give the exact day when these cheques were brought to me; it was after the 4th of July—the first inter<lb/>view was on the 11th—if I went to the bank on the 12th, I must have had them on the 11th—I think Cooper told me that Miss Adolphus was in the habit of having cheques drawn out before they were wanted, and signing them, so that Cooper could use them when required—I can't say positively whether it was Cooper or Jenkins said that, but they were both there—I feel sure it was Cooper—I retained possession of those cheques, and attached them to the affidavit—I did not go to the bank with the object of getting the money for the cheques, it was rather to obtain information as to the nature of the thing.</p>

                  </hi>. I have for many years made the study of hand<lb/>writing a business—I was applied to some time in March, 1875, to form a judgment upon the subject of the handwriting of Miss Emma Adolphus, and the handwriting of the alleged will—I was examined in the Probate Court on the subject—I have formed a judgment that the will is decidedly not the same handwriting as the admitted handwriting of Emma Adolphus—the materials upon which I proceeded were several original letters which have, not been photographed; these are the letters produced by Dr. McGrath they are marked consecutively from A to O, in my handwriting—these three letters in an envelope were put into my hands by the Treasury—I have seen the originals of all Miss Adolphus's cheques, the cancelled will, and the—originals of all the documents photographed from A to R, but there are some exceptions which I have to make to the document marked K—with that exception these are all the documents I have seen in the handwriting of Emma Adolphus—the documents that I have seen in the handwriting of Mary Cooper, are the copy of the will, the six specimens of the word "Queens" which she wrote in the Probate Court, and the bodies of the cheques from R to Z—I have seen once the two cheques that have been produced to-day—I should like to look at them again (<hi rend="italic">they were handed to the witness</hi>)—my judgment is formed upon them as well as the others—I can give you general reasons why the will could not have been written by Emma Adolphus, in consequence of her defective eye sight—on 13th December she alludes to her failure of sight, in her own handwriting—I have seen the documents admitted or proved to be in her handwriting from that date forwards, and I can trace the failure of sight in the writer—they show that her sight got rapidly worse; there is no trace of any temporary improvement—the later documents evince that she became almost totally blind, if not quite, I should think quite blind, but certainly any one who was quite blind could write quite as well; that is any one who had been accustomed to write; in fact, I am surprised, looking at her handwriting, that she did not write better when blind—in document G, you will find the word "has," the pen entirely fails of ink in the middle; that evinces that the person was blind—at the bottom of the page, she writes "Miss Adolphus"—immediately after writing the "A" the pen fails of ink, but she still continues to write—then in writing the word "compliments" the "t's" fail of ink—any person who could see would naturally take a dip of ink then, but the "t's" is written without any ink at all—in document H you will find the same, in "Messrs. Robarts," and in the word "convenient," and in all the later documents—there are two or three very glaring instances in document I, showing strong evidence that the person could not see, and the same thing occurs both in M and N—in L, 0, and P there are none of those traces of want of ink; those documents are written with a steel pen which does not open so much, the ink in it lasts longer than in a quill pen, at least I think so—I observe in Miss Adolphus' writing where she has lifted the pen she has not been able to resume the writing at the proper point, except by accident; you have instances of that in G, H, and J, in the word "Queen's" and in "Road," and the writing is</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187509200056"/>
               <p>scattered all over the page in H and J; then after that, becoming conscious of that, she keeps her hand on the paper as long as she can; for instance, in K you will find "132, Queen's Road" all written by one operation of the pen, also "London, March," evincing a desire not to break oft", feeling that she could not find the place again—the word" continuous" expresses my meaning—in Q there is the same "ten pounds" she has taken her pen off, but the junctions are made most inaccurately; she has made the "0" by two operations of the pen, but there is no junction, she cannot see where she has put down the pen again—the middle "0" in the shilling place is joined accurately at the bottom, but that is accidental—in photograph H she has lifted her pen to cross the "t" in "convenient," that is done very well, but that is the last instance of it, never after that does she cross the "t" by a separate operation of the pen, but by taking it across from the bottom of the letter—the word "ten" in L is not written by her in my judgment—in B and D the small "i" is dotted and in photograph F, but there is no instance of that in any subsequent document—I have omitted one of the strongest instances of Miss Adolphus' failure of sight, which is in document Q; in the numerals 132 she has added another 2, making it 1322—I think that is a positive demonstration that she could not see; that is plainly and blackly written, and if she could see at all she must have been able to see that—the same thing occurs in "Bayswater," the letters over<lb/>ride each other constantly—now, taking the will, I judge from that that the writer was able to see perfectly well, as well as you or I, I am sure of it—where the pen of the writer of the will failed of ink the writer per<lb/>ceived it immediately, as in the following instance with the "h" in "bequeath," line 8, you find at the end of the h the pen fails or opens, and the next letter, the a in "all," which follows it is written as black as pos<lb/>sible, evincing that a fresh dip had been taken; and in the a in "seal" in the next line you find the pen opens and fails of ink, and the 1 is quite black—in the small in "be" in line 12 the pen writes pale, and the nest word is perfectly black—again at the in "Queen's," line 14, the pen fails, and you will observe in that particular instance that the junction is made very accurately, the upstroke is taken up again exactly where the pen had been taken off; the misplacing of the words which occurs in the will is, in my belief, intentional; for instance, in the sentence, "This is the last will," the word "will" is written above the word "last"—at line 11 of the first page the words "Mary Cooper of" are written on a curved line; that curved line is guided by the line immediately preceding it, by the words "shall be entitled," so that the person could see perfectly well to do that, and that line again follows the curve of the preceding line, so that the sight of the person had been influenced by each line—a similar observation may be made with respect to the next page, lines 9, 10, 11, and 12 follow the same curve, and the spaces between the words are as they would be made by a person who could see, as contrasted by the admitted writing of Miss Adolphus where the words are huddled together or separated by irregular and un<lb/>natural spaces—in the later documents of Miss Adolphus I have shown that she kept her hand on the paper as long as possible; now throughout the will the pen is continually lifted, as in the word "testament," the pen has been lifted after the s, and all through the will each word is apparently separate and distinct, there is not a single instance of two words being joined together, they may touch accidentally, as in the words "the last will and testament of," but the pen has been lifted before writing the word "of"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187509200057"/>
               <p>—in the word "and" at line 2 you will find in the upstroke connecting the "n" and the "d" the pen has been lifted after forming the n, and it is put down again very accurately, and in "Bayswater," at line 5, after forming the pen has been taken up and the upstroke continued exactly in its right place, no one could continue it more accurately—there is a very clear instance in the word "Queen's" at line 14, and I could point out a number of such instances, not only in the upstroke, but the down stroke—the down-stroke of the in the second word of the will has been lengthened exactly in its place, and in the word "testament" in line 2 them has been lengthened—all the letters t in the will are crossed by a separate operation of the pen and never taken from the bottom of the letter, except perhaps in one or two doubtful instances at the end of a word—there are thirty-six small letters it in the will, twenty-seven of them are dotted, and with one exception all are dotted with dots in their proper place immediately over the letters, indicating that the writer possessed a clear vision, the one exception is in the word "said" at page 3, line 4, the 1 there is out of place, there may be two dots to it, most likely it is so, because I notice that the will is not punctuated—every line of the first and second pages of the will appears to begin at the proper distance from the edge of the paper, and there are several instances at the end of the lines where the writer has apparently compressed the character of the writing in approaching the edge of the paper, just like any writer would do—I don't find that the writing has been gradually diminished, because I think it has been the object of the writer to write a large hand; at the bottom of page 2 the final "s" in "Adolphus is diminished"—the capital "B" in "Bayswater" is unlike any capital B written by Emma Adolphus; the word "Bayswater" frequently occurs in the will, and the B finishes on a down stroke, but in Miss Adolphus's writing it is clear of the down stroke and joins with the a—in every instance of the word Bayswater she has joined the B with the a—the capital J in the third page of the will is unlike any capital J formed by Emma Adolphus—there are two J's in the cheque B, and again in cheque C a different form of J altogether—the J in "July" appears to be of a person not very familiar with handwriting—the capital N in the word "Names" is the last word of the will is formed more like a capital V, and unlike any capital N of Emma Adolphus—you see one of her N's in the word Number in both the cheques B and C, and she has made an enlargement of the small n in the document A, line 12; that is a very different N from the N in the will—she makes the N in two ways, but in no instance does it resemble a V, and I never saw one before, it is very peculiar. The capital letter Q occurs three times in the will, made like a capital U, that is still more distinctive, and certainly not like any capital Q by Emma Adolphus, her Q's are particularly plain and made like a Q in the orthodox manner—the word "Queens" comes several times; in photo<lb/>graph G you will find a Q at the top, and still plainer in document I at the beginning, it is a plain Q made in the proper manner, looped at the bottom; she always makes it in the same way—the writer of the will seems totally unacquainted with the form of the letter Q at all, both as a capital and a small letter—it is made improperly; a small q occurs only twice in the will in the word "bequeath" in line 8, it is made like a "y," and in line 10 of the last page like a "j," in neither instance like a properly formed q. There are five instances in the will where the word "in" is written with a capital I; Miss Adolphus never wrote the word "in" in the middle of a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187509200058"/>
               <p>sentence with a capital letter—there are three instances in the last page of the will in the sentence "in the presence of us the undersigned who in her presence and in the presence of each other," and there is no such thing in Emma Adolphus's writing—the numeral 3 in lines 4 and 14 of the will is unlike her numeral—I cannot find an instance of a 3 finished in the same way; there is something indistinct about it; here the 3 is finished with a strong dash of the pen—there are several 3's, and in the fourth line of the will it is finished very distinctively indeed, in a very bold and emphatic manner—in the third page of the will the name "Adolphus" is written without the letter I; I think the person who wrote that was going to write "Adop," and the first stroke of the p has been converted into an 1, refer<lb/>ing to the proper mode of spelling it; but the 1 is omitted altogether—I have formed a judgment as to whose handwriting the will is—I have no doubt it is in the same handwriting as the copy of the will and the body of the cheques R to Z, and these six specimens—my reasons for saying so are the capital N formed like a V in the word "Names" in the last line of the will, also in the abbreviation "No" for "Number" in photograph K, in the cheques from R to Z, and in the two cheques produced this morning, the N is like a V—the best instances of it are in the cheques T, U, and V—in the copy of the will proved to be in Cooper's writing the word "Queens" occurs in three instances, and in each the Q is formed like a capital U in the same manner as the Q in "Queens" in the fourteenth line of the will—I have looked at the six specimens of the word Queens written by Cooper at the Probate Court; in one instance in No. 3 she has formed a small q like a y, and in Nos. 4 and 5 it begins like a y, and where it is in a capital it is made distictly like a capital U, that is in No. 2, but in none of the instances of the word Queens written with a small letter is that small letter at all like a q, no one would read it for a q; in No. 3 there is a little correction, in the first instance it is like a j, and it is now more like a y, and so is the y and j like they and j in the will—I have formed a very confident opinion on the subject with which I am now dealing—I have a great number of other instances of peculiarities—in my judgment I detect the writer of the will to be the same as the writer of the copy of the will and the cheques proved to be in Cooper's writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRAIN</hi>. Messrs. Spiers &amp; sons first instructed me in this matter—I rather think they told me what the object was—I think they put the question rather fairly to me—they asked me if this will was in the same handwriting as a document which has not been mentioned now, a letter marked A, which was marked E as an Exhibit in Chancery, dated 36, Queen's Road, Bayswater, June 11—the year was not marked; it was some writing of Miss Adolphus's long before 1872—I was shown the will subsequently—they brought me in the first instance all these photographs, and I think only that one document, and they asked me whether the will was in the same handwriting as the photographs, which were admitted to be in the same handwriting as the document E—I was at the same time shown some documents of Cooper's admitted handwriting, the bodies of the cheques from R to Z—I knew of course by the will being; brought to me that it was a matter in dispute—I think that Mrs. Cooper has written the whole of the will herself—I should think she would try to copy the writing of the person as nearly as possible, if she had it to copy from, but I think that would be very difficult to get—supposing she had no specimens of this large handwriting of Miss Adolphus before her I should</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187509200059"/>
               <p>not think it would require great ingenuity to forge a will in this way; I don't see the ingenuity in the forging of it—I don't see the difficulty in putting the "nt" in the word "testament" after they in this way; that was just an attempt to imitate the sprawling way in which Miss Adolphus wrote her cheques—I think that easy enough—the person might have written the "nt" below they if that idea had seized the mind of the writer, or put it anywhere else—there is nothing difficult in it—the curve in "emma Adolphus" does not show any ingenuity to my mind—I say it was done wilfully; I say all these curves are very easily done, requiring very little ingenuity—there in "road" at the bottom of page 1 is not at all similar to there in "road" in exhibit G; it is altogether different—the two words are as different as they well could be—there is as unlike as could be; it is not even an imitation of it—it would not be difficult to smear over the words "place" and "road" in this way; it might be done by accident—smears are similar to each other by whoever made; they might be done by the hand of the forger or by anybody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Assuming for a moment that the hand that wrote the will was guided, would you expect to find any idiosyncrasies of the stronger hand in the writing of the guided hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not much experience in guided hands, but I should think it would be so, but there would be plain evidence that the hand was guided—I should expect to find some of the cha<lb/>racteristics of the guiding hand in the will; it would depend upon the amount of power of the guiding hand and the amount of weakness of the guided hand—the extent would depend upon the comparative power and capacity of the two hands—if the guided hand were weak and the guiding band were that of a strong person I think it is very possible, that the idiosyncracies of the guiding hand would be strongly marked—that is almost obvious—the guiding hand could do as it liked, especially if the hand was strong—if any peculiarity of the weak hand did appear it would be rather more likely to appear in the signature than in other words, but you see in the will it does not appear, because the A in "Adolphus" in the will is a small a, on the third line in the first page—the a's are formed like a small a, not like an enlarged one—I say the a in that third line is a small a; it is not more a capital A than the a in "and"—I say it is not intended for a capital letter, nor is the a in "Adolphus" in the fifteenth line of the second page, or in the word "Amelia" they are all small—look<lb/>ing at the word "Bayswater" in the third line of the copy of the will made at Messrs. Mercer's office, and at the same word in page 1 of the will, line 5, I have not the slightest doubt that whoever wrote the one wrote the other—the one seems to me to be the parent of the other, they are so alike—I do not think that the E in "emma" in exhibit M is like the E in "Estate" at page 1 of the will—there is a great difference—it was a characteristic of Emma Adolphus's E to make the upper loop very large and "' distinct and bold—if you look at all her E's you will find that is her chief characteristic—in the word "Estate" it is very cramped, as if the writer was almost afraid to make the bow at all—both are made on the same plan—of course very many persons make a capital E on the same plan; that is the only similarity between them—the A in the copy will made at Messrs. Mercer's office is similar to the A always made by Miss Adolphus, and all the A's in the copy will are properly formed capital A's—I dare say she would have formed the A in the same way in the will if she had written it small, but she has written it very large; that affords a possible motive for</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187509200060"/>
               <p>using that form of letter—she might have associated largeness of writing with childlike writing, and she may have formed the a small for that reason—I cannot tell; the Jury can form their view upon that as well as I can—the E in "emma" in the copy will is spelt twice with a small e; in the sixth line from the bottom it is a capital E; that is the way in which I make a capital E myself—I notice that there is a blundering in the spelling of the word "emma."</p>

I may have formed an opinion as to whether the will was or not all written at one time, but I forget; if you will let me look at it, I will tell you now; my mind has not been directed to that at present, because I only had an opportunity of looking at the will once (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—there is no indication of its having been written at different times; it may have been, but it appears to me to have been written all at one time; that is my opinion upon it—I should think the names of the attesting witnesses were not written at the same time, the ink is not so dark; they may have been blotted, but I don't think they have—I could not tell whether they were written at or about the same time; I can't say they were not—I see no reason to doubt that the signatures were written at the same time, as far as I can see—I don't dispute it—I don't know how many times Juries have disagreed with my opinions, they have occasionally—sometimes one Jury has agreed, and another Jury has disturbed the verdict of the first.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRAIN</hi>. I have just seen the two cheques produced, they arc forgeries undoubtedly—in the second cheque there are four strokes to the am in "emma," like one of the m's in the copy of the will—it may be a double n or it may be an in with four strokes—I believe the name is spelt correctly in the will and not in that cheque—two documents were sub<lb/>mitted to me, upon which I would not express an opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined. Q.</hi> What are those two documents? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In my examina<lb/>tion at the Probate Court, I did not speak with the same strength with regard to the signatures of R and S—I have expressed my opinion that they are the signatures of Miss Adolphus, but I am not absolutely sure of it; those are the only things I have a doubt about—I don't say they are not in her handwriting, that is all—my opinion about them is much the same now as it was then—there are certain peculiarities applicable to writing that has been guided—I do not find any such peculiarities or any trace of guiding in the whole of the will—I think it would be impossible for a guided hand to make the junctions with such accuracy, to begin with—there would be great decrepitude in the writing if it was guided, some<lb/>thing of a tremulous nature—I could very readily believe that some of the cheques written by Miss Adolphus were written by a guided hand, the character of the writing would have more of that character—not a particle of the will exhibits the character of being guided, it is in a clear firm hand throughout—the difference between there in the word "road" in the will and in document G, is this, in the will the lower limb of there is separated from the first down stroke, but in document G it merges; it is difficult to describe it, but it has a different character—in the o in "road" in the will the up-stroke is taken from the very middle of the o, connecting it with the a, but in document G, it is continued from above the o, and unusually high up—then the D is of different form altogether—Miss Adolphus frequently made the d turned up, but it is not so in the word "road," neither does it occur in any d in the will—there is no d at all like the d in document G—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187509200061"/>
               <p>Miss Adolphus invariably made the d as in the word "pounds," and never in any other way; it is the same in the word "and;" and in all the cheques in Mrs. Cooper's handwriting the d is made in the same way as in the will—all the four letters in the word "road" are formed on a totally different principle from those of Miss Adolphus.</p>

The following week I went to a sale, and my husband fetched the things away the next day; I do not know whether the note was changed there after I was gone, by the party I was in company, but it certainly was not in my presence.</p>

I received information, and on 24th I went to Mr. Dickenson's warehouse, 5, Tooley Street, Bermondsey—he is a hop merchant—I saw the five rolls of canvas, one had been cut in halves—I took away three and a half pieces—this piece (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of the five rolls—I saw Mr. Dickenson's warehouseman and after examining the canvas I remained in charge of it and sent another detective to the City to give information to the owner; then Mr. Ower's brother came over and identified the property—the next day I saw Mr. Dickenson, junior, in com<lb/>pany with Detectives Childs and Stevens; from what he told us we went in search of Mr. Vinal, who purchased the canvas from prisoner, whom we found—Vinal went in search of the prisoner while we remained at a certain place in the Borough—I afterwards found the prisoner and Detective Childs at the corner of King Street and High Street, Borough—nest day I went to Vinal's and afterwards saw the prisoner—Vinal first spoke in the prisoner's hearing and said "This is the man of whom I bought the canvas, I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it"—the prisoner said he did not give him so much—I asked the pri<lb/>soner how be accounted for the possession of the five pieces of canvas, to which he replied a man went to him and asked him if he would buy it, he said "No," but possibly he could find some one to do so, and he saw Vinal, to whom he sold it, but never received 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—he further stated that he did not know the man who came to him with the canvas—before I took him into custody he said that Vinal and himself were at Mr. Dickenson's office when the canvas was delivered there—on the way to the station he repeated that he did not receive so much as 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the canvas and that he gave the two men about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). I was at the Bishopsgate Station on the 4th September when the prisoner was brought in—he made the following state<lb/>ment voluntarily:—"On the Friday afternoon I was in Gracechurch Street when I met a man by the name of Tupe, whom I had known for some time; we' got into conversation. I told him I was not getting on very well and was hard up. He said 'If you meet me tomorrow afternoon I shall be able to lend you a few shillings. I went this afternoon to Lombard Court, met a man named Miles, and asked him if he had seen Tupe, he said 'No, but knew where to find him at 5'oclock as he had an appointment with him.' I asked where, and he replied at a public-house in Fore Street where there is a hoarding. I went there at 6.10, not expecting to see Tupe, but he was there, and we both went into a public-house. I called for a pint-of four ale, and asked Tupe whether he could fulfil his promise. Tupe said he unfor<lb/>tunately had not succeeded in getting the money he wanted, but if I liked to do a little turn for a friend of his he would pay me for it. I asked Tupe what it was, and he said he would fetch his friend, which he did. He brought Drewett back. Drewett told me to take a cheque to 'Dirty Dick's' (Barker's, in Bishopsgate Street), get some grocery for him, and bring him the cash. When outside the public-house, I asked why he did not go him-self. He replied that he did not want to go in the neighbourhood because a few 'bull-dogs' (meaning detectives) were about. We left Drewett at the corner of London Wall and Moorgate Street, and went on towards Bishops<lb/>gate Street, and I then asked Tupe if it was 'all right.' He replied that he had known Drewett for some time, and he believed it was all right. I asked him if I should sign my whole name or two Christian names. He said 'Your two Christian names will be all right; you can sign it; George Shaw will do, or anything.' When I came out to find the parties I could not; they were nowhere about. I will assist you all in my power." Shephard was present when he made this statement, and took his wife's address—the prisoner suffered no interruption when making this statement.</p>

The. prisoner was admitted to the gaol of Newgate on 3rd August and I saw him daily until the 7tn when I left town—I examined him and formed a very decided opinion that he was deranged in his mind—he had very distinct and powerful delusions that persons were about to throw him overboard and when he got ashore every one he met was about to murder him—he was likewise very terrified that any one should attack him while in the gaol for the first few days—all that feeling has passed away and very little remains now—I have watched his progress since and I am of opinion that he is nearly well—he says he should not like to go back to the ship, but beyond that he has no delusion I think—having heard the evidence I think it is such an act that a person in his state of mind would commit, he would suppose he was acting in self-defence.</p>

Sunday—I returned to Liverpool some time in the nest week, but I can't say on what day—my wife could tell you—I am not aware that I said that I would rather lose 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. than appear against the soldiers—Miss Allen was not with me when I lost my watch, that I am aware of—I became acquainted with her on the Monday at the Old Bailey—I am not aware that I introduced her to everybody as ray cousin—she wanted to take my arm from this Court to Fleet Street, but I prevented her by taking my arm away—you did not tell me that it would be derogatory to the Court for me to retire without its permission—you did not give me the address of three solicitors, and represent that I had better see one of them—I do not recollect the name of Mr. Reader, except in a letter, or Mr. Newhurst, or Mr. Froggart—I swear that I gave you no instructions to employ counsel on my behalf—I got a letter from you after my return to Liverpool, after the trial was over—it could not have affected the trial—I did not charge either of the men with stealing ray watch, but the police did—you told me that the older soldier had been in the regiment seventeen years—I did not pay attention to the character which Sergeant Hollis gave them—you did not tell me that my attendance here was of the highest importance to the soldiers; nothing of the sort—during the time I was in London, I forget where I was—I had no companion, lady or gentleman, day or night, that I am aware of.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was dated August 14th, from Mr. Reader to the prisoner, stating that he did not consider it a matter of form, and declining to act.</hi>) My clerk was subpoenaed—he sent me a telegram and I came home from the Lakes immediately.</p>

I was in charge of the indictment against Nichols and Hawkinson—on 16th August, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I heard Talley ask Lancaster, to go down and take lunch—they were in the passage leading to the Grand Jury room—Lancaster said "No"—Talley than asked him to go down and have a glass of champagne; he said "No," and then Talley asked him to have a glass of ale, and cigars—I then told Lancaster in Talley's presence that he must not go away as the indictment was in before the Grand Jury, and he would be called upon—Lancaster said "Will you excuse me, I want to go the urinal," he went down stairs and the prisoner followed him—I followed, and saw Lancaster come out of the urinal—Talley then spoke to him outside the Court door, and Holloway joined them—I saw Talley with a paper in his hand, offering it to Lancaster, who refused to take it—they stood there five minutes talking, but I could not hear—I then went to Lancaster, and told him he was to come upstairs at once—Talley followed him upstairs, and tried to draw him away again, but I told him he must not go away—Talley said to me "Have you got Mr. Lancaster in custody?"—I said "No, it is my duty to keep the witnesses and the prosecutor together till after they have passed the Grand Jury"—he still stopped about the different passages and followed us all the afternoon—the bill was found between 4 and 5 o'clock, on the Monday afternoon, not on the Tuesday—the Court adjourned at about 5 o'clock, and I then walked a little way with Lancaster, and left him just this side of the Holborn Viaduct—I then saw Talley, Holloway, Mrs. Nichols, and Miss Allen, join him—I left them talking to him; he said that he was going straight home, and I wished them good-night—he was lodging somewhere in Fleet Street—I saw Hutt, just as we left the Court—I saw them again next day, but we had no conversation—although the soldiers were acquitted, the Common Serjeant ordered the money found on them to be given up to the prosecutor, and I did so.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Lancaster went before the Grand Jury, between 4 and 5 o'clock on the Monday—I stated on the last occasion that Lancaster, signed the charge sheet, the mistake was that a lady signed it instead of him—that was Miss Chalwin, a witness, in the case—that is the same charge sheet that was produced before the Magistrate; it was signed at that time, she signed it before she left the station—when Lancaster spoke to you I was not aware that he had sent for you—I did not see Miss Allen on Lancaster's arm.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer</hi>). On 16th August I was at this Court, and after the Court adjourned I was outside, and saw Lancaster with Heavens (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 798)—they walked towards the Holborn Viaduct—Heavens left Lancaster, who came back and was talking to a man named Holloway, when Talley brought Miss Allen up on his arm and said "This is the old friend I was speaking about"—he then took Lancaster and Holloway a few yards on, leaving Miss Allen with me, and in about a minute she was called—not liking the look of them, I called Lancaster to me and asked him who these people were (Talley was only 2 or 3 yards from us, and most likely he could hear what was said)—Lancaster said "They are the friends of Nichols"—I said "Whatever you do, don't go into a public-house with them nor sign any paper"—he said "I will just hear what they have got to say, and then I shall go to my hotel"—I left for two or three minutes, and when I walked up the Old Bailey again I saw Miss Allen holding Lancaster's arm, trying to get him into a public-house, Talley and Holloway being close behind—Lancaster would not go into a public-house, and Talley then looked at Miss Allen and nodded his head in the direction of Holborn Viaduct, and they all walked that way, Allen and Lancaster first, and Talley and Holloway 2 or 3 yards behind, who both looked round to see whether 1 was following them—they went over the Viaduct to the corner of St. Andrew's Street and into the new street, where they all stopped and surrounded Lancaster for about ten minutes—he apparently tried to get away, but Allen took hold of his arm again and took him about half-way down the new street, where they stopped again and surrounded him for about half an hour—I saw Talley take some paper from his pocket and appear to be reading to Lancaster, who tried to get away again—he threw down his umbrella and got away for a few yards, but Miss Allen followed him and caught hold of his arm, Holloway and Talley following him—they went on into Farringdon Street, where they stopped again for a few minutes, and Lancaster took his umbrella up and threw it down in a very excited state, and walked away and Holloway, Talley, and Miss Allen had a little conversation—Miss Allen and Holloway then followed and Talley followed a few yards behind them—Holloway spoke to him first—Lancaster crossed over to St. Bride's Avenue to get out of the way, followed by Miss Allen, who caught hold of his arm, and Holloway—I saw detective Hawkins in Fleet Street and asked him to go with me—Miss Allen and Lancaster stopped with Holloway close to them in the court—Holloway turned and saw me and walked into Salisbury Court where he met Talley—when they got close together I took hold of them one by each arm and said "I have a great mind to lock you up for endeavouring to defeat the ends of justice by tampering with the witness"—Talley said "I have done nothing of the kind"—I said "You vagabond, I have been watching you over an hour"—I regretted that as soon as I had said it—we all walked together into St. Bride's Avenue—I had let go of their arms—I touched Miss Allen on the shoulder and said "If I see any more of this I shall lock you up"—Lan<lb/>caster</p>

               <p>saw his opportunity and went away—Talley walked up Fleet Street by my side and said "I am a solicitor and why do you call me a vagabond?" I said "Perhaps struck off the rolls," he not being dressed very well, he had a straw hat, a dust coat, and a coloured waistcoat—I turned into the Temple and he asked my name and I told him to meet me at the Court next morning and I should be prepared to meet any complaint he had got to make—he said "No, I want your name"—he followed me out of the Temple and we met Goodman 445 <hi rend="italic">City</hi>, to whom he said "I want this man's name"—Goodman said "Give the gentleman your name"—I said "You know me, Hutt, and took out my warrant card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) containing my Christian and surname, which Talley could see if he liked—he said to Goodman "He and others are following me for the purpose of in<lb/>timidating roe for a pecuniary purpose"—I said "That shows I did not call you out of your name to make that imputation against me"—I then walked away followed by Holloway—I had Lancaster with me all the next day and at the adjournment of the Court I took him opposite to give him some lunch—Talley came in and said "I have the opinion of eminent counsel, if I choose to dine with you I can do it and dare any one to interfere"—I took no notice of him but brought Lancaster over to the Court again—on the Wednesday when the case was called on, Talley came into the Court where Lancaster and I were and gave him a card in an envelope, he looked at it and then gave it to me—Talley asked what he thought of it—Lancaster said "Nothing, what does it mean?"—Talley said "Oh, there is a meaning in it"—after Nichols and Hawkinson were discharged I made an application to Sir Thomas Chambers about the money and he desired me to give it to Lancaster and not to Talley.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> No one gave me instructions to follow you—I am paid so much a week as a detective—I am not paid by the case—I became acquainted with Lancaster by seeing him in the witness box the day after he was robbed—I have been a detective two years—I had no idea that you were an attorney—you did not produce your card—I had no private meeting with the chief clerk previous to 16th August—he did not give me instructions, nor did Sir Robert Carden—I went to Miss Allen after the case was before the Bench to ascertain whether she had given a correct account of herself—I am the nominal prosecutor—I went to an address where she said she did not live at 12, Dukes Row—I became acquainted with her on the 16th of last month, when you introduced her to Lancaster as the friend you had been talking about—she had hold of your arm, and after you left her I said to her, "Mrs. Lancaster, I presume," knowing that Mrs. Lancaster was in London, and she said "No"—I went to Anderton's Hotel with Lancaster and had a cup of tea. (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner persisted in asking questions which the Court informed him had nothing to do with the case.</hi>) I was not aware that Lancaster borrowed money of Holloway—Miss Allen told me that she first met Lancaster in the street, by the Mansion House on the Friday—I laid an information against you at the Mansion House, upon which a summons was granted—I did not wait till the Court was cleared, there may have been four or five persons present—I was called into the witness-box here by Sir Thomas Chambers to state what I had seen you do, and you were ordered to be at the Court next morning, when Sir Thomas said that he would wait until the Commissioners had enquired into your complaint against me, and 70<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

               <p>has not sent for me, and I have had no subsequent conversation with him—I heard on the Tuesday evening of your complaint against me—the Commissioners wanted to see me at the office—I did not arrest you when I saw you with Lancaster because I had a doubt whether it was a charge which we could lock up for ourselves, or whether we required the instructions of a judge, and you had the benefit of it—I did not think I had settled it when I called you a vagabond, but you gave me a direct falsehood, and I spoke hastily—I said that <hi rend="italic">perhaps</hi> you had been struck off the rolls—I was a little hot, and so were you—I saw Mrs. Lancaster in the evening, and she asked me to look after her husband the next day—Lancaster did not ask me to lend him any money—during the two days we were together he sometimes paid, and sometimes I did—you and Holloway were working together. (<hi rend="italic">The</hi> Jury <hi rend="italic">here interposed, and the Court informed the prisoner that he was injuring his own case</hi>).

I cannot recollect how much of this letter was read in the hearing of the Jury—my impression is that it was all read by some one or other—I believe Lancaster said to me that it was not his signature; then he said "I am not sure of it, as one of my Christian names is left out"—Sir T. Chambers then took it in his hand, and my impression is that he read the whole of it, or the greater part of it, in the hearing of the Jury—Mr. Metcalf made a great many communications to me.</p>

               <p>to a refreshment-house near the Mansion House; I don't know the name of it—I don't think he asked you individually to lend him money, but you and Holloway were together, and he asked you both—he expressed a wish. to retire from the prosecution—I heard you inform Sir R. Carden of that circumstance, but do not remember what he said—no consent was given—I wrote this letter (D), and saw Mr. Lancaster sign it—I attested his signature—he was neither drunk nor sober—he had no money about him; he made several applications for some—there is no pretence for saying that you introduced me to Lancaster—when he asked you for money you told him distinctly that you would not give it to him, as it would injure the case; he wanted it very much—after leaving the refreshment-house we took the train to Westminster, and went to Mrs. Nichols' house—you came there also—I don't know whether you came with us but you were there—Lancaster was sober enough to walk through the streets—there is no pre<lb/>tence for saying that he could not understand what was said to him—it was promised that Mrs. Nichols should give him some money—he got 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and signed this receipt for it, which is in my writing, "July 30, 1875, Received of Mr. George Holloway 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account. T. B. Lancaster. Witness, Amelia Allen" the letter was signed at the refreshment-house; nothing was done clandestinely or secretly—I may have said "Well, he really wants the money to get home with"—I knew he wanted to return to Liverpool—Holloway also came to Nichols' house—we went there again on the 31st for more money which was promised—he could not get to Liverpool for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he urged that as one object for procuring money—he went there two or throe times, but could <hi rend="italic">not</hi> get the money, as Mrs. Nichols was out—he was in about the same state the following day, neither drunk nor sober—this other receipt is in Lancaster's writing, but I did not see him write it.

It was arranged on the Tuesday night that Mrs. Nichols and Mr. Holloway between them should make up this amount of money, and Lancaster was to call for it on Saturday afternoon at 4 o'clock, and we did so—I heard that the money was to be repaid to Mr. Holloway from the money in Court—Hutt called on me to see where I resided—he may have been with me twenty minutes—I cannot tell you exactly what passed—he has not called on me about this case, but I spoke to him—I went to your office one evening when the soldiers' trial was on, and wrote a letter to you at your desk, and one to Lancaster—you offered me your arm on leaving this Court, as there were a great many vehicles passing, and I walked up the street with you a little way—we spoke to Lancaster and to Hutt, and then returned and chatted for a few minutes—I don't think I ever saw you give drink to Lancaster—you did not annoy or importune him in any way—I have not seen Lancaster since that Monday night.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Lancaster said that he would do anything he could to save the prisoners—he asked you to whom he should address the letter; I do not remember what answer you gave him—I heard you make an application to Sir Robert Carden, but cannot tell now what you said—Lan<lb/>caster appeared an educated man, he writes a very good hand—there is no pretence for saying that there were any importunities on your part to induce him to do anything that I am aware of—he gave the letter as a guarantee to Holloway for the money he was going to receive—I took the letter from him because he was making such a bungle of it—Holloway said that the letter was useless to him for the purpose of</p>

September, I watched the premises 118, America Square, the business place of the Wholesale Co-operative Stores Society, Limited—at 1.55 I saw a man named Rowley leave the warehouse with a tub of butter—Carey was standing at the door—the tub was placed down in the Minories, and a man was beckoned from the opposite side of</p>

In consequence of something said to me I passed the shop 10, Minories and saw Seal and King taking butter out of a tub—on the 6th September I was watching with Williams, and saw, at about 2 o'clock,' Rowley leave the warehouse with a bag containing twelve cheeses—Carey at that time was at the door of the warehouse in America Square—I saw Rowley take the bag to 10, Minories, leave it there, and come away—I then handed him over to Williams, and went into the shop and saw Mrs. King and Seal—I said "I am a police officer; this bag has been stolen by a man named Carey, I shall charge you with receiving it, knowing it to have been stolen"—Seal replied "It has just come from the Midland Railway," at the same time handing me this consignment note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said "You will also be charged with receiving a tub of butter on Friday last"—he told me his name was not King, that he simply was a servant, and that Mrs. King and himself managed the business, but he was the responsible party—he further stated that he did not deny having bought goods of Carey, and that he possessed invoices—I obtained these invoices (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) after a little struggle—I left Williams in the shop in charge of Seal and Mrs. King while I went after Carey, whom I took to the station, and afterwards returned to the shop—I sent Williams on to the station with Seal—I found this consignment note marked B (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which relates to a firkin of butter—I took Mrs. King to the station—I also found a. cash book and some empty butter tubs, the latter of which I took to the station and showed to Mrs. King, stating that Mr. Jones, the manager of the society, had identified them as the property of the society—these are the heads of the tubs (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I went to Carey's house and found six books amongst other things, which appear to have been used as delivery books.</p>

I am manager of the London Branch of the Whole-sale Co-operative Society—the business is wholesale in groceries and pro<lb/>visions—we supply retail co-operative societies, and no one else—Carey was in our employ as warehouse foreman—he had been with us about sixteen months—his duties were to receive goods into the warehouse and send goods out—I have seen some Dutch cheeses, which are similar to those in our warehouse—I have also seen some tubs, which bear our mark upon them—I identify these order-books (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) as belonging to the society—Carey had not the control over them—I have seen these invoices (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>); the writing upon them is by Carey—I know the prices the society were charging for these goods at the time, and observe those on the in<lb/>voices for which these goods were sold, but prices vary—the prices obtained for these goods are considerably too low—I have missed some goods since July last.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. M. WILLIAMS</hi>. I am a buyer and salesman too occasionally—I form my estimate that these are low prices, knowing what the goods are selling at—we are very particular to whom we sell; we sell only to co-operative societies—we do not supply private tradesmen—'it is a question of consideration whether our goods are too good for them—we try not to sell goods that are bad—we do not sell spoiled goods to our own customers—we supply no other persons but our own customers in the regular way of trade—ours is a regular way of trade—we occasionally sell a small parcel of goods if it is not good enough for our customers; if it is not good enough for our customers, it is good enough for private selling—we do not try to dispose of them in the ordinary way; we certainly tell them they are bad—our sales pass through our books—we sold about the time in question two sides of bacon, not fit for our trade, to a man who paid ready money for them—Carey had three men under him—it was a principle before last Christmas to sell goods to our own people to the extent of their own consumption, at least that is what was understood—it would not be Carey's duty to make out invoices, but the clerk's.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer K</hi>). On the 1st September I met Woodcock at the Rose Wharf, Blackwall, at about 11 o'clock in the forenoon—I told him I was an officer and should take him into custody for being concerned with others in stealing two cows on the 6th of last May—he said "I think they are getting it up for me"—I told him he would have to go to Plaistow, where we had another man locked up—I took him there and charged him again—he said nothing at all—I had taken Hubbard on the 27th August—I had been on the look-out for Woodcock ever since then—when I took Hubbard and told him the charge, he said "All right, I know nothing about it. I expected this. I should not have done so if it had not been for little Ben Woodcock who sent me. to fetch the cows, and told me to tell Mark Gibbard that Mr. Smith had sent me for them. They were sold to go over the water. I went down to fetch them. Mark Gibbard would not let me have them that night until the next morning between 4 and 5 o'clock, when I brought them up to the World's End public-house, Stepney Green, and there little Ben took them from me and told me he would see me to-morrow night.

I live at 21, Cockley Street, Stepney Green, and am a potman—I am a brother of the prisoner Hubbard—I remember seeing Woodcock, in Whitechapel Market, about six weeks or two months ago, when I had some conversation with him about my brother Robert—I asked him if he had seen my brother, and he said "Do you know that the <hi rend="italic">detect</hi> are after him?"—I said "I am quite aware of that"—then he said "I gave your brother 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of what we got for the cows; if <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> is taken he won't <hi rend="italic">round</hi> on us; he will stand the racket of the lot"—he did'nt say how the cows were brought from Tottenham, or who brought them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That conversation took place about six weeks, or two months ago—about the end of July—I have seen him in the market before that, but have not had-anything to say to him—I am quite sure he said "I gave your brother 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of what we got for the cows"—I didn't say "Out of the sale of the two heifers" before the Magistrate; "two cows" I believe is what I said.

It <hi rend="italic">was heifers</hi> he said before the Magistrate—as these cows were stolen on the Thursday, I bad information on the Satur<lb/>day, and then I enquired into the case—that would be on the 8th May, I believe—I knew my brother had gone away, but did not know where he had gone to—it is over two months ago since I first saw the police in the matter—I saw the first constable about it in May—he came from Ilford, and was in plain clothes—there were three or four detectives—there was Detective Smith—I didn't make Detective Murrell's acquaintance until my brother was in custody; not to tell him anything about the case.</p>

I received some information from the last witness in consequence of which I went to the Town Quay, Barking, to look after Hollick, Ryan, and two other men—I saw them in the Blue Anchor public-house, which is close on the Town Quay—about 20 yards from Glenny's Wharf I saw Ryan and two other men come out of the public-house and go on board a manure barge in the Town Quay—about two minutes afterwards Hollick came out and went on the manure barge and all went down in the cabin—I went for another constable and, while I was com<lb/>ing back with him the two prisoners and another man passed us in the street—Hollick spoke some bye-word to me—this was close on 11 o'clock—I stood there for some ten or fifteen minutes and the two prisoners and the other man came back again and went on board the manure barge—I then, some minutes afterwards, went on board the barge in company of the other constable—I jumped off the Town Quay on to the barge and away one man went a good run—I believe that was the man in charge of the barge—I don't know him—I went down in the cabin and found the two prisoners there and this can about three parts full of ale (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and on the seat in the cabin I found a cask of beer with this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) knocked in the hole and dripping very fast at the time—it is a piece of wood with some paper round it, a substitute for a tap—they appealed to have been drinking beer; they appeared to be sober—I took them into custody and told them they were charged with stealing that cask of ale from the wharf—Hollick said he had come with the others to have a drop of beer—Ryan said he had come there to have a night's sleep—I took them to the station.</p>

I am the wife of the last witness—on Thursday, 12th August, I was out with my husband between 11 and 12 o'clock—we saw the prisoner at the Gipsy Queen, he called us in—we had some drink there and then went to a beershop, then to the Thurloe and afterwards to the Horns, drinking at some of the places during the day—I remember the prisoner asking if we knew of a chemist's shop, that was after we came out of the public-house opposite the chemist's—my husband told him there was one there and he went across to it, he came out again but did not say whether he had got anything or what he went after—we came out of the Horns about 5 o'clock or it might be a little after—I tumbled down and cut my eye—we afterwards went home to our house—Mrs. Hudson came in to dress my head—the prisoner gave us some stuff out of the bottle and then he asked Mrs. Hudson if she would have some and she partook of it, he gave her some out of the glass, the same as we had—after that he said she had better go indoors, and when she got to the door he said she had better have a drop more and he gave her the bottle and she drank out of it and went indoors—after she' had drank it he said "La, ma'am, you have drunk enough to kill a pig," and he turned round into the house and put the bottle in his pocket—after he had gone I was taken ill, I fell off the chair on to the floor—I got my fingers in my mouth and my jaw got <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi>, and I could not get them out again—Dr. Harris came and attended to me—I am getting quite right now—when the prisoner gave us the stuff he said "You had better drink it and <hi rend="italic">get</hi> upstairs"—I understood him that he was a</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Lower Norwood—on Thursday evening, 12th August, I was sent for to No. 6, Providence Place; it was about 6.20 when I got there—I found Mrs. Hudson on the floor; she appeared to be in great abdominal pain—I could not at that moment tell what from—she said a doctor at No. 10 had given her some medicine; I then saw a spasm, accompanied with an arching of the back—I recognised that as a symptom of poisoning by strychnine—I immediately went for an emetic—I was only gone a minute and a half or two minutes, but she was dead before the emetic could be raised to her lips—she died just before I reached the door—I had taken a-boy with me, who ran on in front—on the Friday I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the heart was empty, and from the appearances I was able to form an opinion that death was consistent with poisoning by strychnine—I saw no other cause of death—an overdose of strychnine would quite account for the appearances I saw—in my judgment that was the cause of death—the stomach was almost empty—I took it out and tied it securely at the esophagus, and the intestines also; they were very nearly empty—the stomach was done up and sent to Dr. Muter—on the same Thursday evening, from what I heard after Mrs. Hudson was dead, I went in to No. 10—I found the prisoner there and Mr. and Mrs. Taylor—the prisoner was the worse for drink; he was slightly intoxicated—Taylor was much worse, and Mrs. Taylor exceedingly so—the prisoner knew perfectly what he was about—I asked him if he had given Mrs. Hudson anything—he said "No, but I have been doing all I could for these poor creatures, who are drunk," or something of that kind—I examined Taylor at once; I did not then see any marks of poisoning by strychnine—about</p>

               <p>three-quarters of an hour afterwards I did, the arching of the back—I administered an emetic to him; the prisoner had left then—I gave Taylor two emetics; he vomited—I took possession of the vomit, put it into a bottle, and it was sent to Dr. Muter—Mr. Taylor did not appear to be Buffering so much from the strychnine as her husband; the symptoms were less marked, simply spasm—I saw no characteristic arching; the spasms were consistent with her having had a mild dose of strychnine in solution—being under the influence of liquor it might not act so powerfully; they are perfectly well now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have never used strychnine as a remedy for intemperance, or known it so used; it is a valuable tonic—I believe it has a counteracting effect, but it is not used as a remedy—I am familiar with Dr. Taylor's work on "Medical Jurisprudence"—I quite agree with this at page 176, ninth edition: "Of the appearances observed in poisoning with strychnine there are none which can be considered strictly characteristic"—there are none taken by themselves, but there are other certain symptoms, taken with other facts, which help to bring the cause of death to a decision—there might be a spasm and an arching not due to strychnine—the symptoms before death, taken with certain appearances after death, would in my mind leave no doubt—the appearances after death alone I should say are not conclusive—I have no experience of the fatal effects of strych<lb/>nine in the human body—I believe it has been known to be as short as fifteen or twenty minutes—in Taylor's case it was over an hour before the symptoms showed themselves—it was very nearly 6.30 when I saw Mrs. Hudson dead—the case of Dr. Warner cited by Dr. Taylor, where death took place in twenty minutes, would, I think, be one of the most rapid fatal cases—you did not seem to be in any baste <hi rend="italic">to go</hi>, or to be trying to avoid me—I don't think I noticed that your legs were at all constricted or bowed—I noticed a slight stagger, as though you had been drinking—lock-jaw is a light symptom of poisoning by strychnine.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant P</hi> 35). From information I received on this Thursday evening I went to the London, Brighton and South Coast Station at Lower Norwood, and found the prisoner on a seat at the platform—I told him I should have to take him to the station for causing the death of a woman named Hudson, and also with attempting to administer poison to two other persons—he said "I know nothing about it"—I took him to the station, and he was charged with causing Mrs. Hudson's death by administering to her a poisonous draught, namely, strychnine, and also with attempting the deaths of two other persons with the same poison—he said "I had been drinking with Taylor and his wife, and I did administer' strychnine to them in a wine glass of water; the deceased woman Hudson I know nothing about"—he wished me to take that down, and I did so—I searched him and found this small medicine bottle in his inside breast coat pocket; there was about a table—spoonful of a white liquid in it—I gave it to Inspector Dorgan—the prisoner said, when I took the bottle from him, that it contained strychnine—I afterwards went to 10, Providence Place; I found Taylor and his wife both ill—this wine glass was on the mantelpiece; I gave it to the inspector—the prisoner was very drunk and very excited at the station—I visited him in the cell at 1 o'clock in the morning; he then said that he had been a great drinker, and had been in the habit of taking strychnine to deaden the drink.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Kennington Road—I am public analyst for the parish of Lambeth—I received this jar and other things—the medicine bottle was sealed up—I examined the solution in it; there was about a tea-spoonful in it, about one fluid drachm—it was a solution of strychnine; that is in the pharmacopea as a medicine—it is a powerful tonic—the mixed official dose is 10 drops—it is of a recognised strength—I should say that a teaspoonful might be enough to kill; that would be 60 drops—a medicine of that kind requires to be administered with proper care and skill; it is one of the medicines scheduled in the Poisons Act that a chemist has no right to sell without a doctor's prescription, or registering the name and address of the person to whom he sells it—the stone jar was sealed; it contained a stomach—there was a very small quantity of fluid in it; I should say not much over a tablespoonful, if that—I examined that, and found it contained strychnine—I did not weigh the quantity, it appeared so very small—I examined the bottle containing the vomit; that was sealed with red wax—I found it contained sulphate of zinc and strychnine, and a large quantity of alcohol—sulphate of. zinc is used as an emetic—I have read that alcohol will deaden the effect of strychnine—a large quantity of strychnine taken on an empty stomach would cause death more rapidly; if taken with food, its effects would be diminished.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> All that I can say is that I found sufficient strychnine in the stomach to give me a well-marked test of its presence, but not of its quantity—I believe I said before the Magistrate that I found a trace of strychnine; anything that we do not weigh we are accustomed, in chemical language, to call a trace—whether I should expect to find more than a trace in the case of a fatal dose would depend very much upon the time it had been in the body, and whether the person vomited or not—no change in the body after death affects the presence of strychnine—if vomiting took place there would not be time for it to be absorbed; if there was no vomiting, and no letting out of the contents of the stomach by accident, I should expect to find more than a trace—I could not succeed in isolating a fatal dose—I could not give any opinion as to there being a</p>

               <p>fatal dose in the vomit; I did not find sufficient to be a fatal dose—in poisoning by strychnine you would have to take the symptoms before death in connection with the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>; the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> alone is not sufficient—I don't say that the symptoms alone are not sufficient; I think the symptoms are very well marked, but I never saw a person die from strychnine—my knowledge is derived from reading, and from seeing animals die—I believe the symptoms are much the same; there are certain marked symptoms peculiar to strychnine—I heard Dr. Harris' evidence—I do not think the appearances described by him are consistent with death from natural decay aecelerated by insufficient nutrition—I am conversant with the action of sulphate of zinc—it does not cause pain in the abdomen; it is rejected the moment it is taken, when taken as an emetic—I should say two doses might have a tendency to cause pain in the abdomen; if takes in small doses it is an irritant—pain in the abdomen is a well-known symptom of poisoning by sulphate of zinc—I do not think it would account for characteristic convulsions.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist, of Thurloe Place, Lower Norwood, a little before 2 o'clock on Thursday afternoon, 12th August, the prisoner came to my shop and asked me for a dose of <hi rend="italic">nux vomica</hi> for <hi rend="italic">delirium, tremens</hi>—after some little time I served him with it, and after a little while I gave him a second dose, he took them both before he left—he asked me to let him have a small bottle of it—I declined to do so—there was no symptom of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> about him, but he accounted for it in another way, he was very excited, and talked very fast, but he appeared to know what he was about very well.</p>

I am a fishmonger at Lower Norwood—between 2 and 3 o'clock on the afternoon of 12th August I was in the Gipsy Queen, I saw the prisoner come in about that time, he called for something to drink and was served—he asked me about a chemist's shop—I told him there was one next door, Mr. Tomsett's—he said he had been there—I said there was another one lower down, Mr. Windle's—he said he had been there—I told him of another one, but he did not say anything to that, whether he had been there or not—that was in Chapel Road, about 1/2 a mile from there—he</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon—on 30th July, I was fetched to 33, Stanley Street, about 4.45—I went into the first floor front room and found the prosecutor lying on the bed with his head to the foot apparently insensible—his face and chest were covered with blood, and his face was very much swollen—one pillow was saturated with blood, another-pillow was on the ground between the bed and the window, also saturated with blood—there was a knife on the ground, this poker was on a chair on the other side of the bed, near the door; both of them were covered with blood, and there was hair on the poker as well—I afterwards saw a case of two razors on a chair, near the fireplace—there was a table and a couch in the room—I did not examine the razors, but they did not appear to have been used—I did not open them—I found two contused wounds on Drake's right temple and an incised wound on his forehead—the contused wounds could be produced by a poker, and the incised wounds by a knife—his right eye was reduced to a state of pulp, either from pressure or from the end of the poker striking it; it is entirely destroyed—there were three smaller incised wounds on his face; his lower jaw was very much swollen from a severe blow, and blood was oozing from his mouth—one tooth was lying loose in his mouth, and there were two or three teeth about the bed—he had a deep incised wound on his abdomen, below the naval, dividing the skin, and the fatty muscles—the small bone of his right arm was fractured, and there was concussion of the brain from the effects of the blows—he was still losing much blood—I dressed his wounds and then tried to rouse him—all the wounds could be produced by these weapons—it is nearly always the case that persons labouring under concussion of the brain, know nothing about it at the time—I saw the prosecutor's trousers on the couch and noticed blood on the braces which were attached—from the fact of his remembering nothing about it the inference would be that the poker was</p>

               <p>used on his head first and concussion caused, he would then be paralyzed for the time, and the other wounds would be made without resistance—when the concussion passed off the loss of blood would tend to produce sensibility, and he might get out of bed and go to the door and make a noise, but as the blood continued to flow he would become insensible again, and there would be syncope from loss of blood—none of the wounds were dangerous to life individually, but collectively they were.</p>

I live at 5, North Place, West Square—my husband died in January, 1874—I have known the prisoner over two years—we kept a general shop, and he frequently came there during my husband's life, and after his death—he sometimes came there two or three time a day—he promised my husband when he was dying that he would give an eye to the shop, and he did help me—in May this year he said that his wife was dead and he should expect to have me, and, if he could not, no one else should—he frequently asked me to marry him, but I always refused him—the last time he asked me was on the morning this occurred—I had a collar of his to wash, and on 15th August I took it to his house, in Ely Place, St. George's Road—the street door was open, and I went to his room door and knocked—he said "Come in"—he was lying on the floor just inside the door; he had sold his furniture, and there was no bed—he spoke first—he said "I have not been in above ten minutes; I have been out all night"—I said "You must be foolish to stop out spending your money; you will want it to keep you next week; I cannot stop now, I am going into the London Road"—I laid the collar on a box—he said "Wait a minute," and ran towards the door and turned the key, and then he held his hands over his shoulders, clasping his hands, and said "I don't know what is the matter with me"—that frightened me (I had been frightened of him some times because he threatened that if he could not have me himself no one else should, for he would do for me)—he then pushed me against the window with his left hand; his right—hand was in his right trousers pocket—I turned my head, and felt a razor go across my throat—I said "Oh, you have cut my throat"—I did not see the razor till I took it from his hand and threw it down by the box; it was a white handled one—the blood poured from my throat like a fountain—he seemed staggered for a few minutes, and I gave him a push with one hand, turned the key with the other, got into the passage, and screamed "Murder!"—he got hold of me again in the passage, and I got hold of his whiskers—Mrs. Maynard and another woman then came to my assistance, and the next thing I remember is coming to my senses in St. Thomas's Hospital—I received this paper in pencil (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on 24th or 25th August—it is in the prisoner's writing—he writes two or three hands, but this is the hand he generally writes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Rudd; of 5, North Place, West Square—the prosecutrix has lodged in my house since Easter—the prisoner has visited her there, and I have heard words between them more than once; the first time was at the end of May or the beginning of June—they were at my street door, and I heard him say that if he did not have her nobody else should, and I heard him abusing her at the end of July—I do not remember the words he used—she only said "Go on"—I have seen her write, but only addresses on envelopes—the signature "Jane Indermaur" on this blue paper (A) is not her writing in my opinion.</p>

I live at 9, Elizabeth Place, Webber Row, Waterloo Road, and am the wife of Samuel Tubb, a painter—the prisoner lives at No. 17—on Monday evening, 16th August, I was passing his door between 9 and 10 o'clock, with Mrs. Cook—the prisoner was standing at his garden gate and made use of fearful language towards me—he put up his fist and hit me—my husband was sitting at the door, and I called to him to protect me, he came up and I went indoors—the prisoner said if he did not do something for me someone else should before the week was out—nothing more occurred until the Wednesday, when my son went and asked the prisoner what he meant by calling me such filthy names—I went up with my son—the prisoner said if he did not go away from the door he would rip his b----bowels out—he shoved him away and they fought—my husband came and took the boy home—about ten or fifteen minutes after wards I sent my little girl for the beer, and I saw the prisoner come rushing down to our place—I said "Shut the door"—he rushed into the house and seized the chair to illuse my son—I put up my right hand and I saw part of a knife in his hand, below his fist, and I received four stabs on my hand—my husband put him outside the door—someone said "Blind her with the lamp," and my husband removed the lamp from the table and put the prisoner out—I went to the station and the inspector ordered me to be taken to the hospital, where my band was dressed.</p>

I live at 6, George's Place, George Street, Lam beth, and am a carpenter—on the evening of 9th August, about 5 o'clock, I was in Regent Street, Lambeth, talking with a man named Casey—the pri<lb/>soner came up and said "Good evening"—I said "I don't want to have any thing to say to you"—he said "I have something to say to you, though"—I moved away a pace and he struck me behind the left ear with the butt end of a revolver—the blow felled me to the ground, and when on the ground I saw the revolver and he held the muzzle of it against my chin he struck me several blows over the head after that with the revolver—when I was on the ground I heard the hammer of the revolver go down; I heard the click from the pulling of the trigger—I am quite sure I saw the pistol in the prisoner's hand—his finger was on the trigger and I am quite sure I heard the click—I called to Casey to help me—a constable was fetched and I gave the prisoner into custody for assaulting me with fire arms—he said "I meant to shoot him and I will do it again."</p>

               <p>Magistrate—I don't think I was asked the question—I have been a witness in many cases, and I have had some experience in Courts of Justice—I was convicted 18 years ago as a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> boy, about 13 years of age—I had three months and four years in a Reformatory—I did net do all the time—I was let off in consequence of good conduct—I came out in 1861 I believe—I have been in the Police Force some portion of the time since then—I did not tell them anything about my conviction; I was not asked that question—I was asked as to character, and I produced characters—it is necessary to produce characters for the last five years, which I did—I wrote down that I was a single man—I married the prisoner's daughter, and she was away from me—she had left me, and I considered I was a single man—I said I was a single man, and I knew I was married—I subsequently asked for leave of absence in order to go and get married—that was in July or August 1873—I did not get married—I went back again, and took a woman as my wife to whom I had not been married—that was discovered, and I was dismissed the next day from the Police Force—that was in December, 1873—I am a carpenter and joiner now, nothing else besides—I was secretary to the Magna Charta Association, but I did not get any pay for that—I am not a member now—I ceased to be a member the same week that this happened—it did not suit me to belong to it any longer, I did not think it worth while—there was not a Committee of Inquiry into my conduct in connection with the Magna Charta—I was not there, and I don't know anything about it—I believe a committee was appointed in my absence, and I believe Casey was one of them—I don't know what it was appointed for, I was not there—it was not to inquire as to certain sums which I had received and not paid in—I had nothing to do with the money, and it could not have been so—the Committee were holding an inquiry without my consent at the Mason's Arms, and I went up to know what it meant, and to stop them—I had not got my jaw bandaged up then, nor when I was before the Magistrate—I had a piece of sticking-plaster behind my ear, where the prisoner had wounded me with the revolver—I had it on for a week, till the place was well—I will swear I had not a bandage or a handkerchief on when I was before the Magistrate—I had seen the prisoner about ten days or a fortnight before this occurred—I have seen him several times, but have not spoken to him—I had seen him more than once in two years before this affair; it is not two years since he was the means of getting me dismissed from the Police Force—that was in December, 1873—I had only seen him once since then before this occasion, <hi rend="italic">when</hi> I was talking to Casey—it was in Regent Street, and Casey lives there, and it was close to my house as well—I was standing talking to Casey when I saw the prisoner, and that was the first time I had seen him since eight or ten days before—I will swear that I saw his finger on the trigger at the time I heard the click—I believe the prisoner has been in the Army; in the East India Company—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was the revolver I saw in his hand.</p>

I live at 34, Regent Street, Lambeth—on the evening of 9th August, about five o'clock, I was talking to Reeve in Regent Street—the prisoner came up and looked very heavily, like thunder, at Mr. Reeve—Mr. Reeve said "I don't wish to have anything to say with you"—he said "But I do with you," and he rushed at him, and struck him with his fist—he did not fall at that—he returned back and said "Do you see this"—I could see something in his hand, but I did not know it was a</p>

               <p>4th August, I saw two men come out of King's Head Yard together; Butler was one of the men, and I believe McSweeney to be the other, but I don't speak positively to him—they had their coats on their arms—they were coming at rather a quick pace, and were in rather an excited state—they went across High Street into Stoney Street—after they passed me, Cording spoke to me, and I ran after them—I lost sight of them when they turned into Stoney Street—I came back into High Street, and saw Butler in the custody of Cording, and Giles was assisting him—I asked Butler what account he gave of himself—he said "I will give an account of myself at the proper place"—he was taken to the station by other constables, and I went with Cording to 39, High Street—we rang the bell, but no one came down—I roused the people at No. 43, and they let me in—I got over the roofs of 43 and 41, and got into 39 and let Cording in—on the first-floor I found two holes cut in the floor large enough to admit a man, one over the staircase and one over the jeweller's shop, and there was a piece of rope which would serve the purpose of a ladder—I came downstairs, and found a hole large enough to admit a man cut in the partition between the passage and the shop—I found a crowbar, <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, lantern, a screw-driver, and a few other instruments at the bottom of the stairs—T went to the back of the premises and found the sky-light in the back room had been broken, and there was a large hole. there—the steps which had been used by workmen previously were standing under the hole—I <hi rend="italic">went</hi> up the steps through the hole on to the roof of 39, over a low wall to 41, which adjoins King's Head Yard—on the wall next the yard, I found a parcel containing several iron and steel wedges, and seven or eight skeleton keys—I have all the things here—I saw some scratches against the water-pipe by which a man could get down—I next saw McSweeney about a fortnight or three weeks after in the cells—I was directed by my acting inspector to go to the cells to see if I saw any one I knew—I saw McSweeney in the last cell, and said "I believe that to be the man," and that is my belief now, but I can't speak positively.</p>

Paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.)—I did not see any one else in the shop—on the follow ing Monday I went there again and made another payment on the drawers—the young man tore up the piece of paper and gave me another piece with the two payments made upon it—this is the piece (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) he gave me on the second occasion—I saw him make the entry, I suppose from his memory—he told me it was a proper bill—he got the price from the other piece of paper, I saw him copy it—the first paper bore the date of the 30th May, which was a Sunday—I went regularly every week and paid install<lb/>ments for the drawers—it was on a Monday, I believe, the 23rd August, I last went to the shop to pay three half-crowns and requested the drawers to be sent home—another pair was sent in the place of the ones I bought and I told the boy to take them back—I went to the shop and asked the pri<lb/>soner what he meant by swindling me out of my drawers, and he said "You"—I asked him for the bill and he told me he would not give it—I asked him where were the drawers I purchased and he stated that he had sold them to another customer and if I did not like to take the ones sent I should have nothing at all; he had my money and he would swindle me out of the lot—I asked several times for the bill, which he refused to give me—I then fetched a policeman who asked prisoner for the bill and he threw it at me—I saw the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was not put down on the bill, he eventually put it down and I had the bill—I afterwards went to the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>wards went with the prisoner to Mr. Bourne's furniture shop, where I bought a couch, an easy chair, six chairs, a table, some stair carpet, oil cloth, and a rug—the prisoner's wife was with us also—the prisoner also bought a bedstead and a palliasse—Mr. Bourne asked the prisoner if he should make out two receipts—he said "No, one will do"—Bourne said "What name?" and the prisoner said "May"—I paid for all but the bed-stead and palliasse; I am positive of that—the prisoner paid for that all bat a shilling—he had not sufficient to pay—it was rather more for the bedstead than he expected, and he asked me to lend him a shilling, which I did—the things were sent home and put into my parlour—the prisoner never claimed ownership to these things until my return from seeing my sister—I asked him to buy a chimney glass, and gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay for it, and also the money to pay for a timepiece—I also bought a pair of vases and a jug which were in my room—in April, 1874, I changed my bed-room for a larger room, for which I was to pay another 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—the furniture was not lent me then; that belonged to me—a gentleman named Martin bought it for me—in May, this year, I owed 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for rent, and on the 24th I paid 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and ultimately a claim was made against me for rent up to the 12th August of a balance of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he seized my furniture in the bed-room, when I consulted Mr. Fullagar, my present solicitor, and I went with him to the prisoner—Mr. Fullagar went to see what it was that May claimed, and he said if the rent was paid he would give the goods up, and the goods in the bed-room he would give up on receiving a letter from Mr. Martin—Mr. Martin has been on intimate terms with me—May did not say one single word at that time about the goods in the parlour belonging to him—I had a receipt of Bourne when I bought the goods, and also a receipt for the timepiece and looking-glass—it was in September, 1874, that I went away to see my sick sister—I then left the receipts locked up in a small work-box in the cupboard in the parlour; the cupboard was not locked—I came back in January, and the receipts were then gone—the work-box was there; it had been forced open—they were produced by the prisoner's advocate before the Magistrate—I never gave him authority to take the receipts—I afterwards attended before the Magistrate and gave my evidence, and got my goods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I acted as barmaid at the restaurant in Token house Yard in 1873 and 4—I was on very good terms with the prisoner's wife—she was in the kitchen department—Mr. Fullagar represented me when I was before the Magistrate—the solicitor who appeared for the prisoner was a little the worse for liquor; he was very obtuse and stupid—at the time Mr. Lushington made the order for the goods to be delivered up, he put Mr. Fullagar into the witness-box to prove the perjury against the prisoner, and ordered the latter into custody there and then—it was the act of the Magistrate—when I first went to live at the prisoner's house, I had a smaller bedroom, a back room upstairs—I knew Mr. Martin then—I did not buy wedding dresses and go away to be married—I did not say so—the baby was born in January, 1875—I did not wear a wedding ring—that is the truth—Mr. Martin did not pass as my husband—he bought a lot of goods from Maples, to put into the bedroom I occupied—that was for my confinement—I don't know that Maples got back their property because they were not paid for—I don't know where Mr. Martin is—I know now he is a married man—I did not buy a wedding outfit, or represent that I was going away to marry Mr. Martin, or come back and say that I had married him—when</p>

               <p>May reproached Mr. Martin as a married man for having connection with me, it was because I showed Mr. Martin my bill, and he said I had been overcharged and he would not pay a farthing—the rent for the small room was 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I changed to a larger room, and Mr. Martin used to come and visit me—I never deceived Mrs. May—<hi rend="italic">Mr.</hi> May never said anything to me about it—before I went to them I was going to advertise for a room" and Mr. May said "We shall be obliged to make <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> change on account of my Bon; we want a larger house, would you like a room or two?" it was not arranged that they were to provide the furniture and I was to select it according to my own taste—the son was not with us at Bourne's—I do not know that the prisoner borrowed 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from a person named Pilkington to buy the furniture at Bourne's; it is not the fact that he purchased 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth at Bourne's, and that I said I had some money to make up—Bourne was making out the bill when I put the money down; it was not 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that I put down—I think he bought a pair of curtains for 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the bedstead and palliasse were for the son's room; the curtains were for my room, where they were put up—I only claimed what belonged to me—I selected all but the bedstead and palliasse—Bourne suggested that we should have two bills, and May said "No, one will do"—after this I wanted a chimney-glass bought; I claimed that—I gave the money to the son to pay for the time-piece, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; the money for the time-piece and chimney-glass was my own—I cannot say exactly the date that Mr. Martin last called; not after May of this year—the furniture for the larger room was sent in from Maples'—when I left the lodgings, I was staying at my brother's for a little while—Maples' goods are at Mr. Lloyd's now—they are not Maples' goods; they were given me by Mr. Martin—I know nothing of any claim by Maples—they have not been to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Mr. Martin seduced me, and the result was that a child was born in January—it was in April, 1874, that I took the larger bed room—Mr. Martin gave me the furniture for my confinement, and, as far as I know, it is now in the hands of Mr. Lloyd, who is a broker, who was entitled to recover all my furniture for me—I believe it was in the latter part of April or beginning of May of the present year that Mr. Martin spoke of the overcharge made by the prisoner—until then no observation was made by prisoner about Mr. Martin coming to the house—I never attempted to deceive the prisoner or his wife into believing that I was a married woman.</p>

I carry on business at 198, Camberwell Road, and have a large business in general furnishing—I remember the prisoner and Miss Eversleigh coming to my shop—the date is not on this paper—it was the 17th January, 1874—I have my book to prove it—by looking at this bill my memory goes back to the transaction perfectly well—Miss Evers<lb/>leigh purchased the bulk of goods entered on this invoice—there was a bedstead and palliasse purchased by the prisoner—Miss Eversleigh paid for the goods, with the exception of those two items—there was a remark made about Mr. May wanting a bedstead, and Miss Eversleigh offered to lend him an amount—I cannot say how much, whether 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I saw some money pass between them—I asked if both transactions should be put into one bill, and they said "Oh, yes, Mr. Bourne, it makes no differ<lb/>rence," and as Miss Eversleigh was standing by I thought it didn't matter, though I don't usually do transactions in that manner—I made out the bill as it now stands—the total amount was 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I next asked "Where hall I send these goods to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>"—May said "Mr. May's, 3, Dane's Road"</p>

               <p>and Miss Eversleigh was standing by, I thought it would make no difference sending the goods to Mr. May, if I put "Mr. May" on the bill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was asked to be a witness when the question of detaining the goods was before Mr. Lushington—I think it was about the first week in August that Miss Eversleigh applied to me asking for another bill—there was a party with them when the goods were bought—who it was I don't know—three parties altogether. (<hi rend="italic">Alfred May was called in</hi>). I do not think I have ever seen that lad before—I did not give him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to my knowledge that night—he had nothing to do with the purchase, and no gratuity was given him—there was something said about Miss Eversleigh going to live with, them—she selected the articles that were to be used in her room—the curtains are scratched out in my book as not had—they were purchased, and afterwards drawn through—I see the curtains are required to make up the 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I certainly must admit that I didn't know the curtains were in here—if my book is allowed to be produced, it will be found that they are scratched through—I never knew Kiss Eversleigh before she came to my shop on this occasion—I saw nothing of her between January, 1874. and August, 1875, when she applied to me for a second bill—I never saw Mr. Martin till I saw him in Court in my life—who is Mr. Martin?
