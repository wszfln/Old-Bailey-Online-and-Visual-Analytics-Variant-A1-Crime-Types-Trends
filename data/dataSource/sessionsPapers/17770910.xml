               <p>The prisoner came to my shop about three weeks ago, and bought a pair of shoes for two shillings and nine-pence; he opened him bundle and desired I would let him leave the bundle for an hour; I looked at it and said I supposed it was worth the shoes; he took away the shoes; in ten days he called and paid for the shoes, and he then asked me to let him leave the coat for three or four days; when the hand-bills came round I then saw that the coat was the property of Mr. Burn; I sent my husband to inform Mr. Burn of it; the prisoner sent me a letter to send him the coat, which I refused to do, as I had then received the hand-bill.</p>

               <p>Do you yourself know whether they were fastened over night? - No; my footman called me about four or five in the morning, and told me I had been robbed; I came down and found all the doors broke open; the coach-house doors appeared to have been forced open.</p>
               <p>Is your house in a street at Hammersmith? - No, it stands by itself in the center of a lane.</p>
               <p>How far is the coach-house and stable from your dwelling-house? - About twice the length of this court; one end of the brick work of the stable communicates to the garden, but not to the dwelling-house; there is a garden between the dwelling-house and stable.</p>
               <p>One of the JURY. My Lord, there is a wall from the dwelling-house to the stable; we all know the house? - Yes; there is a wall goes all the way from the house to the stable; I saw the things that were lost at the justice's.</p>

               <p>Was it in the month of August? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time in the night was it? - I cannot exactly say; I know nothing but by the information of my man.</p>
               <p>Then it might be broke open the day before for what you know? - No; it could not, I came down that day with my carriage, and the harness of the carriage was taken away.</p>
               <p>Pray is the butt end of the wall part of the stable or part of the mansion-house? - The butt end is part of the stable.</p>
               <p>How far is the mansion-house from the stable? - Not quite twice the length of this court.</p>

               <p>What do you think is the value of all these things? - 8 l. or 9 l. glasses and all; I went in and called the footman up, and told him to call my master, and inform him of the matter; he went to London and advertised the things; Macdonald came down that evening, and said they had taken the man; I came to London and went with my master to Justice Welch's, where I saw the goods.</p>

               <p>I am a Jew, and live in Adam's Court, near Aldgate; I deal in old cloaths; I know the prisoner Graves; I have seen Colley once with Graves on last Tuesday was a fortnight.</p>
               <p>That was the 26th of August I believe? - I believe it was, I can't tell; I bought this coat of Graves in a parlour at a public house in Goodman's-lane; he left the coat at the King's Head in Holborn, just by; he sent me to the King's Head for it, and I bought it of him for half a crown; the other prisoner Colley was in the yard playing at skittles with two or three more; after I paid Graves the money he called the other in, and said to me, I will give him his share of the money while you are here, or he will think I had more of you; before we parted we had a pint of beer; then both of them said, if I would meet them on the morrow, they would bring a saddle, a pair of harness, and three glasses; they told me I should meet them the same night at eleven o'clock at Grave's room; he shewed me his room; I was there once before; it was in a court just by.</p>
               <p>Did you go that night? - No, we have a society near where I live from seven to nine, where our people learn the law; Graves came to me next morning before I was up (when they sold me the coat they said they had buried the things in two places, that if they lost one, they might have the other); Graves called next morning before I was up, and left word for me to come to his lodging at ten o'clock; I went between ten and eleven, there were two hampers; Graves only was there; he opened the hampers; I said here is but two glasses? he said he broke one in burying it; he took-all the things that are here out of the hampers; he said I need not be afraid to sell them, they came from Hammersmith; I agreed to give him twenty-eight shillings for them; he would not let me go without giving him some money; I gave him half a guinea; I bought them with a view for the owner to have them again; I was told by one Lewis in Crutched-friars a week before, that there had been some harness stole, and he bid me stop it if I met with it; I had a bag with me, in which we put the hammer cloth and some of the things; I told him I would go and fetch the rest of the money; I went across Holborn that he might not suspect me, and then went to justice Welch's in Litchfield-street, there I met with M'Donald; I asked him to go with me to stop the men; we went directly and took Graves and carried him and all the things to justice Welch's.</p>
               <p>Was you there when Mr. Morris and the coachman came? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long was that after you carried the goods to justice Welch's? - I believe the same day.</p>
               <p>Were the things you bought of Graves seen by Mr. Morris and the coachman? - Yes, the same things.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of Addington? - I have seen her with Graves.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether she had any of these goods? - I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What is your profession? - I deal in coach<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177709100009"/> glasses, and cloaths, and every thing that is honest.</p>
               <p>How long have you known Graves? - Not three months.</p>
               <p>Is this the first transaction you had had together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you bought the coat, how came you not to apply to the constable immediately without waiting till next day? - When I bought the coat I brought it home; my wife asked when I was going to the fair, why I did not take it; I am a poor man, what I buy in the morning I sell in the afternoon at Rag-fair; I said it was not mine, I had a reason for it.</p>
               <p>When Graves sold you the great coat he told you he had other things to sell? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had no suspicion that he got the coat improperly? - I knew the coat was stole.</p>
               <p>Why did not you give information of the coat without staying till next day? - Because if I had given information of the coat, we should have lost all the property that was buried.</p>
               <p>What did you agree to give to him for the property that was buried? - Twenty-eight shillings.</p>
               <p>It was worth 28 l. I believe? - That is the reason I bought it.</p>
               <p>[The goods were produced in Court, and Steptoe deposed that they were the property of Mr. Morris.]</p>

               <p>When did you apprehend Colley? - Hyde took Colley; I suspected Colley because I had seen him with Graves, and bid Hyde take him.</p>
               <p>You had no reason to suspect Colley only you had seen him in company with him? - No, only Symonds told me Graves sold him a great coat and they shared the money at a public house; he told me that the same day that I took Graves.</p>

            , Esq; sworn.</p>
               <p>You are Deputy-governor of the London Assurance, I believe? - I am.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner, Mr. Harrison? - I do.</p>
               <p>He was an officer in that Company in the month of July last? - He was.</p>
               <p>What office did he bear? - He was the accomptant.</p>
               <p>I believe the Company have at all times kept a cash account with the Bank? - Yes, they have.</p>
               <p>In what manner was that account kept? - It belonged to both Charters, and was the mixed cash of both Charters, in the name of The London Assurance.</p>
               <p>Have you the book in which that account was kept? - I have it here (producing it) this is the book in which the account was kept between the joint Companies and the Bank of England.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the circumstance of a committee of the Company meeting any day in July last? - On Wednesday the ninth of July.</p>
               <p>Will you please to take the book into your hand, and explain in what manner the account is kept between the Company and the Bank of England? - The title of the book is, Debtor; the Bank of England with the London Assurance, Creditor; on the debtor's side, the clerk of the Bank, when any money is sent to him or bank-note, enters the date, and what it is, such as June 16th, bank-note; then he signs his name Clifford, and afterwards writes the sum; and if it is the sum of a hundred only, he puts a bar or dash before the figure in order to prevent a figure of a thousand being subjoined; when a thousand is put down the dash is not added: when we send for money, we send an order to the cashier of the Bank to write off so much from our bankbook; one of the confidential clerks of the office is sent by the accomptant with this book to write off, and upon producing it to the cashiers at the Bank, they give him the money, and write off the sum of money.</p>
               <p>JURY. It is not a common rule to make a bar to all the sums, I see here are some where there are no bars? - I imagine that is where there are bills of exchange.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prosecution. Where the line is not carried home to the sum in the last column, the sum is entered in a former column, as not received immediately at the time, as when bills are paid in that have some time to run.</p>
               <p>Who had that book in general in charge in the office? - The prisoner.</p>
               <p>Had the prisoner, from the nature of his office, from time to time money of the Companies in his hands? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the prisoner being called upon on the 9th of July last to produce the book? - Yes, at about 11 o'clock.</p>
               <p>I believe it was a Wednesday? - Yes; to produce it to the committee of the treasury who were about to sit.</p>
               <p>Did he deliver in the book? - He had compared the book with the other cash-books in the court-room where we hold a committee of treasury, and it was left there ready for inspection.</p>
               <p>Did he attend the committee that day? - He was in the room, we waited for him to open the committee, but he disappeared, he did not come.</p>
               <p>When did you see any thing of him afterwards? - I saw him in the evening, I believe it was about six o'clock; I had been informed that he was at one Mr. Richardson's at Wapping; I went there in the evening, and there I found him.</p>
               <p>In what situation did you find him? - In great agitation of mind.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him the reason of your coming to him there? - I told him we had perceived three alterations in the bank-book, amounting to 7000 l. and I desired him to inform me if that was all his guilt with the Company; I was very uncasy in order to find out how far the Company might be injured; I assured him I would do every thing for him that could be done with consistency, if he would come back to the house of the Company, and I prevailed upon him to come back to the house of the Company.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177709100013"/>For what? - In order that he might explain matters, and give us a true and just account of every thing: he did return with me and one of the persons that had been security for him, a Mr. Richardson.</p>
               <p>When he came back was the book adverted to? - The next morning it was: I desired the secretary and the book-keeper, who were in the house, to take care of him, not to suffer him to do any mischief to himself, and likewise not to suffer him to go; he continued all night in the office under the custody and care of these two officers.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. On the day that you saw him at Mr. Richardson's you went in company with Mr. Richardson's son there? - Mr. Richardson himself.</p>
               <p>You would therefore not have known where the prisoner was, had it not been for his friend Mr. Richardson, who came to the office to you? - I should not.</p>
               <p>When you came there you behaved very kindly to him, and gave him every assurance that you would do all that was in your power to have matters set to rights? - With propriety and consistency, these were my expressions.</p>
               <p>At that time I believe you yourself produced a bond? - I did, of Mr.

                  Angus

            .</p>
               <p>Did you or not write on the back of that bond an assignment of it to yourself? - No; I had consulted previously with our solicitor before I went to Mr. Richardson, and he advised me to get Mr. Harrison to assign the bond to me the first thing, and he did do that to me as deputy-governor.</p>
               <p>What was the amount of that bond? - 7550 l.</p>
               <p>Then that bond was assigned to you as a security for the Company? - I meant it should be, in order to recover as much as we could, by that bond, of the sum of 7550 l.</p>
               <p>In consequence of your having done that, and your assurances to him, he returned with you as his friend to the office? - He did.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prosecution. Can you give us an account of what this bond was from Mr. Mackey to the prisoner, what Mr. Harrison said about it? - Mr. Harrison said, that he had at several times lent money to 
               <persName id="t17770910-7-person127">
                  Angus

            ; that he began by small sums, and they increased afterwards to very large ones; that he had been used very ill by Mackey, who had promised faithfully to return the money, and kept him in the greatest distress, telling him he must stop payment if he did not let him have more money still; he told me he acquainted Mackey with the manner in which he could only raise these sums by alterations in the Bank book, and he should be obliged to do so again, if he lent him more money; he did demand more money of him, and it went to the amount, I suppose, of that bond; whether interest was included in it or not I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>This was the account that Mr. Harrison gave you of the nature of the bond from Mackey to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And then you procured an assignment of the bond to indemnify the Company as far as might be from the deficiency in Mr. Harrison's account? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. You have been intimately acquainted with Mr. Harrison, and a friend to him? - He has been in the office 19 years and an half; I have been acquainted with him as our officer, but in no other manner.</p>
               <p>He was at that time under no restraint, but in the house of his own friend? - No, certainly under no other restraint.</p>
               <p>And was conversing with you upon this subject as an acquaintance? - As the governor of the Company.</p>
               <p>Do you mean that you were sent by the Company to him that evening? - I mean that it was my duty, as the deputy governor of the London Assurance, to find him.</p>
               <p>Therefore what you did was of your own free will? - Entirely.</p>
               <p>You was not sent as a particular officer of the Company by the directors of it? - No.</p>
               <p>But going with the friend of Mr. Harrison, at whose house he was, to his Mr. Richardson's house? - When Mr. Richardson was there, we consulted with the other directors that were present, and they advised me to go.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prosecution. When you found Mr. Harrison at Wapping, and that passed between you which you have related, did you make him any promises of safety, or that he should not be prosecuted, or any thing of the sort? - Nothing like it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177709100014"/>And you used no kind of threats? - No, I only said, you had better come to the London Assurance with me, I will do every thing in my power for you that is consistent with propriety; he was in such a state of mind I was afraid he would attempt to make away with himself.</p>
               <p>This was all you said to him by way of inducement? - To the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about it upon your own mind; did you ever desire him to confess? - I did ask him if there was any thing more beside the 7000 l. that we had discovered in the Bank book.</p>
               <p>But did you use any other means than you have given an account of to prevail upon him to say what he did say? - No.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. There was no prosecution then set on foot, nor any threatened? - None at all.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you think he would have returned with you to the office, provided he imagined he should have been prosecuted? - I imagined he did not apprehend then any more than I did that it was a capital offence, I believe he thought it a breach of trust only.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Did not you enquire of him the responsibility of Mackey to pay that bond when it became due? - I don't remember my doing it that evening, but I did afterwards; I believe he might tell me without my asking it, that it was a very good bond, it would be all well paid; I believe he might say that, indeed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Whether you took it that the prisoner understood by what passed between you and him that he should not be prosecuted for any fort of offence? - I should imagine he could never think that; I believe he imagined that I would be of service to him in what I could with propriety; but I believe he must imagine that the offence was so great that I could not palliate or screen him, or help him off.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. And you at that time conceived that in point of law this was no capital offence? - I mean not a forgery.</p>
               <p>You could have no reason for supposing that any prosecution would be commenced against him? - There are prosecutions for many offences that are not forgery; why not for a breach of trust?</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. If the Court have a difficulty about the confession, we don't press it.</p>
               <p>COURT. The prisoner should know the situation he is in at the time he makes a declaration that shall affect his life.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Then I will only ask you a general question, Can you inform the Court what deficiency there was in the prisoner's account with the Company of cash that ought to have been in his hands? - The whole deficiency.</p>
               <p>Yes, the whole deficiency? - 7570 l. and upwards.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Which was the amount of that bond? - More than that in money and cash; but if other goods that belong to the prisoner, that are in our house, are to be supposed to be set off against the sum, it will not be quite so much; Mr. Mackey's bond is 7550 l.</p>
               <p>There is another bond, is there not, to the Company? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The corporation is now in possession of a bond from Mr. Mackey for the whole deficiency? - For the amount of his bond to Harrison, as we did not know what the consequence might be when we took Mr. Mackey and Harrison both up to Sir

               <p>What was the amount of the second bond? - 7581 l.</p>
               <p>When was that given? - We were advised by our solicitor that we should have a bond of Mackey directly to me, for we had Mackey's bond to Mr. Harrison assigned; it was thought proper to add the sum of 301. that would be the amount of the interest of that bond of 7550 l. to that, and that he should make his bond for 7581 l. that it might appear that the second bond was different from the sum of the first.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prosecution. Then in truth they were for one and the same sum? - In satisfaction of the former bond they are not one and the same sum, nor do they in fact cover the deficiency.</p>

               <p>Counsel for the Prosecution. This letter was brought immediately I presume to the committee? - About five or ten minutes after Mr. Harrison's disappearance, Mr. Hall brought it into the committee; a very little after that I went to the Bank in order to see how our balance stood there.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. This book was left open, so that all the clerks in the office had recourse to it? - Not all; it was in the accomptant's or treasurer's office, as it is called, when that office was opened, the press in which the book laid, behind the prisoner, was to be sure open, and the secretary might as well look at it as himself.</p>
               <p>Therefore it was not a book absolutely in his custody from the rest of the people in the office; but any body in the office that chose it might go and look at it? - No; the accomptant is always charged to keep things to himself about the Company's affairs. He has the care of the book. People might take it against his will from him, and the secretary might look at it; but it is none of his business.</p>
               <p>It lay there open to people's view? - If people chose to look at it forcibly they might; he alone had the care of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. And if he chose it nobody else could have looked at it? - No; unless a governor or director had ordered him to, produce it.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Was it his business to go backwards and forwards with this book to the Bank, or did he send it by other clerks? - He had the cash; he used in general to send a confidential clerk, the book-keeper, Mr. Austin, and deliver to him the Bank book.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>You are secretary, I believe, to the London assurance? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You know Mr. Harrison? - Very well.</p>
               <p>He was accomptant to the Company? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who produced the book on the 9th July, when the treasurers met? - Mr. Austin produced the book to Mr. Aubert.</p>
               <p>Who is Mr. Austin? - A clerk in the office.</p>
               <p>Did Austin produce it first, or was it produced by any body else to him? - He brought it from the Bank, and produced it to Mr. Aubert.</p>
               <p>Did any thing happen that made it necessary to send the book to the Bank? - Yes; the corporation had occasion for 4000 l. and Mr. Austin, the clerk, who generally went upon that business, took the book, and had the money wrote off at the Bank, and brought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177709100016"/> the book back again. In the time of Mr. Austin's going to the Bank Mr. Harrison decamped.</p>
               <p>How soon was it after Mr. Harrison decamped that you received a letter from him? - To the best of my recollection, six or seven or ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Look at that letter; is that Mr. Harrison's hand-writing. (The witness inspects it.) - Yes, that it is.</p>
               <p>Was any thing inclosed in that letter? - He sent me the key of the office: there was an account inclosed in the letter.</p>
               <p>You know Mr. Harrison's hand-writing you say? - I do.</p>
               <p>You have been a long while familiar with Mr. Harrison's hand-writing? - I have been in the same office with him six or seven years.</p>
               <p>Take that book into your hand (the Bank book) look at the sum 3210 l. and tell the Court whether any part of that is the prisoner's writing. - To the best of my belief, there is.</p>
               <p>Which figure do you believe to be the handwriting of the prisoner? - The figure 3.</p>
               <p>Do you form that judgment upon your knowledge of his hand-writing? - I do.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do look at that again, and look upon the account delivered in by Harrison, in the second article in that account there is the sum of 336 l. look at those figures of three, and see if they are like that you have now mentioned? - I do; I think they are wrote by the same hand.</p>
               <p>Look at the figure 3 just immediately over that in the Bank book, and see if it is not more like that? - They seem all to be wrote by him.</p>
               <p>All four? - Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. That is the sum brought over? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is that brought over by the accomptant, or by the clerks of the Bank? - By the accomptant.</p>
               <p>- AUSTIN sworn.</p>
               <p>You are a clerk to the London Assurance? - I am.</p>
               <p>Do you remember on the 9th July, when the Bank book was necessary to be shewn to the committee? - I was not present when the book was asked for.</p>
               <p>How did the Bank book come into your possession? - The prisoner at the bar delivered it to me with a write-off for 4000 l. which I went for.</p>
               <p>You were the clerk intrusted to carry this write off, with the Bank book, to the Bank of England? - I was.</p>

               <p>To what clerk of the Bank did you apply? - I believe to Mr. Clifford; he delivered the book back to me.</p>
               <p>Was any discovery made of any alteration in that book, either by you or the clerk of the Bank? - When the book was delivered back to me, I happened to turn over the blotting paper which was in the middle of the book, and I immediately observed that the money of the 16th of June, which I carried, 210 l. to the Bank, then stood 3210 l.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. You carried Bank notes for 210 l.? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prosecution. To whom did you pay this money? - Mr. Clifford.</p>
               <p>Did you see Mr. Clifford make an entry of that? - I did not see him write it in the book, because the compter is above my head; he wrote them in, as I suppose, and gave me the book back again.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Clifford re-delivered the book was that sum entered? - Yes, 210 l. was entered in the book.</p>
               <p>Did you see Mr. Clifford's name opposite to this sum in the Bank book? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Look at the book, and say whether you know Mr. Clifford's hand-writing. You remember when this book was re-delivered to you by the clerk of the Bank, whether there was any bar carried up to the figure? - To the best of my recollection there was to the figure 2.</p>
               <p>Are you acquainted with Mr. Harrison's mode of making figures? - Yes; I have been so these ten years.</p>
               <p>Can you take upon you to say, whether that 3, according to the best of your belief, is the figure of Mr. Harrison? - It is.</p>

               <p>You are a clerk at the Bank? - I am.</p>
               <p>You was in the month of June last in that character? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did it happen to you in the course of your business to enter into the account, between the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177709100017"/> Bank of England and the London Assurance, the cash or notes received into the Bank on the account of the London Assurance? - I did.</p>
               <p>Look at the entry of the article 1777, June the 16th. - I see it.</p>
               <p>What money did you receive that day on account of the London Assurance? - 210 l.</p>
               <p>And no more? - Not more.</p>
               <p>Did you make an entry corresponding with the receipt in that book? - I did.</p>
               <p>What was the entry you made? - The word June, the figures 16, the words Bank notes, and the word Clifford.</p>
               <p>Between the word Clifford and the last figures, which are 210, did you draw any thing, or leave a space? - I generally draw a bar line.</p>
               <p>Did you draw a bar line there then? - I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Is that figure of 3 your writing? - It is not.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect how the sum was paid that day? - It was brought to me by Mr. Austin, their book-keeper, in bank notes.</p>
               <p>When bank notes are brought in, do you enter, them as notes or cash? - As notes, expressing what they are; they are from that placed to the credit of the several accounts, and persons that keep cash with us are at liberty to take up either notes or money.</p>
               <p>And to the amount of those notes you consider the Bank as chargeable? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>When you have made the entry of 210 l. or any other sum, do you deliver the book over to any other person, to have a further entry made? - No; I return the book to the person that brings it: I returned that book, having made that entry, to Mr. Austin; and he saw it, and, I believe, was satisfied.</p>
               <p>There is an entry made in the Bank cashbook, I believe? - There is a box: Mr. Foster, who was at the second cash-book, came to the boxes, that is usual, and entered these notes to the account of the Governor and Company of the London Assurance; he placed them to the credit of their account.</p>
               <p>COURT. When you make up the page of your account, who carries it over, you or the person with whom you keep the account? - It is never carried over by us, we never settle the books.</p>
               <p>Is the carrying it over your hand-writing, or the clerks of the Bank? - I cannot positively say whose it is; some gentlemen choose to do that themselves, if not the clerks at the Bank do it.</p>
               <p>COURT to Mr. AUSTIN. I observe in the beginning of the page the words brought over, and then a very large sum opposite it, whose hand-writing is that? - Both the words brought over, the date, and the sum is Mr. Harrison's hand-writing.</p>

               <p>How long have you known him? - From the year 1757.</p>
               <p>What character does Mr. Harrison bear? - I know him as the person who was employed for me under our agent, Mr. Smithen, in building of the Eddiston light-house; upon that occasion it was necessary that Mr. Smithen should have a clerk: I lived with him for near a month, and from what I observed from his general conduct and behaviour there, I looked upon him to be as honest a man as ever I knew in my life. In the experience we had of him we found him extremely assiduous, diligent in his business, punctual, and thoroughly honest.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177709100018"/> He was trusted with the management of our monies, which were very considerable, under the direction of Mr. Smithen.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner to Mr. Aubert.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Harrison went from the office, I believe, he left 2000 l. in his desk? - About 1900 l.</p>

               <p>I have known Mr. Harrison about five years; he always bore an exceeding good character; he has had a great many money affairs on the part of my family; he always discharged his trust with the greatest fidelity to my entire satisfaction.</p>

            ? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - Yes; he lodged at my house in the two pair of stairs room.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any thing happening on Monday night? - Yes; Mr. Gibson and I were standing at the door between seven and eight in the evening; Collier asked if Mr. Gibson was at home; I told him that was Mr. Gibson; he went and fetched a tall man from the public-house; Gibson in the mean time went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Did he know the man? - No.</p>
               <p>Who was the tall man? - Downes; they came into the house and went into the parlour; I told them that was not Mr. Gibson's room, that his room was up two pair of stairs; they went up, I followed them up one pair of stairs and stood on the landing place; Mrs. Gibson stood in the passage at the head of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gibson is the wife of the prisoner? - Yes; Downes went up and asked if Mr. Gibson was at home? she answered, yes, and asked him his business, he said he wanted Mr. Gibson; she asked his name; he said it was Downes; Gibson answered from the inside he did not know the name of Downes, and nobody should enter his room till he knew his business; after that I heard a great noise, and Mrs. Gibson called out murder.</p>
               <p>You don't know whether the door was locked? - No, that was the time they went in.</p>
               <p>The two men got into the room? - Yes, I believe, by Mr. Gibson's voice, that the door was shut; I heard no more; I went down stairs and called my master; he went up stairs, but did not stay two minutes, his business called him into the shop; I went up stairs again then, and Mr. Atterbury and Mr. Mountain went up with me; Downes had got Gibson on the top of the stairs in the passage, holding him fast by the collar at the bottom of the garret stairs; the gentlemen asked Downes what he wanted with the gentleman; he said he had a warrant against Mr. Gibson, and we all went into the room; the deceased then lay on the floor.</p>
               <p>What did you see when you first came into the room? - I saw the short man, Collier, lying on the ground.</p>
               <p>Was he living or dead? - He was living, but wounded; they asked for the warrant, and Downes produced it out of his pocketbook; Downes sat down in a chair by Collier, and asked if he was hurt; he answered very faintly, Yes; then I came down stairs.</p>
               <p>Did it appear from any thing that passed in conversation then who he had been hurt by? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. KELSON sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon to the Middlesex Hospital.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the deceased being brought into your house? - At the time he was brought in I was not at home; he was upon the point of expiring when he was brought in.</p>
               <p>You know nothing from him of the manner in which he received his death wound? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>He was wounded in a manner that was fatal? - Yes, he had received a mortal wound.</p>
               <p>There being no other evidence attending for the crown the prisoner was not put upon his defence.</p>

I said, I did not know; upon that the prosecutrix came up and said, she had been robbed of a hat and cap, and the prisoner had left the hat in the road; I said, I supposed that was the cap: on his making use of some horrid expressions to her, she fainted away.</p>

            ? - Yes; my husband is an auctioneer and appraiser.</p>
               <p>Relate what passed upon the 15th of July last: where do you live? - Red Lion-alley, Cow-cross.</p>
               <p>Relate to the Court where you first saw Cutler on the 15th of July? - At Merlin's Cave.</p>
               <p>Who were in company? - Mrs. Bates and her brother and Mrs. Boutflower; we were together by ourselves and supped in the garden on some cold lamb; I saw Cutler in the ground playing at skittles, he was not of our company; he came to fetch us into the house to hear some women sing.</p>
               <p>What did he say when he came to you? - About ten o'clock he came down to the bottom of the ground where we were, and invited me and the two ladies to go into the house to hear some women sing.</p>
               <p>Did you go into the house? - Yes; Mrs. Boutflower, Mr. Bates, and I went in.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay in the house? - About two hours and a half; we did not stay all the time in one room.</p>
               <p>Then you went home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who were the company that went home together? - Mrs. Boutflower, Mr. and Mrs. Bates, and I, the prisoner, and a gentleman and gentlewoman I don't know.</p>
               <p>Where did you part with the company? - At the Cold Bath, Cold-bath-fields; Mr. and Mrs. Bates live facing the Cold Bath; the other gentleman and lady left us at Cold-bath-fields likewise.</p>
               <p>When did you part with Mrs. Boutflower? - We went as far as the Three Tuns, Brook-street, Holborn; there we parted with Mrs. Boutflower.</p>
               <p>Then there remained only you and the prisoner? - No; I turned out of Brook's-street into Holborn, and I desired Mr. Cutler there to go home; we made a sort of a shop, he asked me to go in to drink a glass of wine or something; I said I would do no such thing; he said it was not prudent for a woman to walk along the streets at that time of night; then I went home to my own house, and he went with me.</p>
               <p>Was there any body in the house when you came home? - Yes, a woman that I had left in care of the house.</p>
               <p>How far is it from where you live to the Three Tuns in Brook-street? - I cannot tell exactly the distance; a great way.</p>

               <p>What time do you suppose that might be in the morning? - I fancy near half an hour after one, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>When you came to your house you say there was a woman in the house? - Yes, she opened the door.</p>
               <p>Did she remain in the house or did she go? - She had her bonnet and cloak on; I desired her to stay; she went out of the house immediately; she said if she did not go home she should be turned out of her lodgings and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177709100028"/> never be admitted more, that if it were ever so late she must go home; she went out and shut the door immediately.</p>
               <p>What became of Mr. Cutler? - He went into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Who shut the door? - That Mrs. Bradley.</p>
               <p>JURY. Did the prisoner offer to take his. leave of you when you came to the door? - No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was you got into the house before the woman went out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where was Cutler? - He walked into the kitchen before me; the kitchen is near the door.</p>
               <p>When the woman was gone had you any conversation with Mr. Cutler? - After the woman was gone I desired him to go home, that it was not a proper time for him to stay; he went to the far end of the kitchen next the fire place, and there he pulled me on his knees.</p>
               <p>How long might that be after the woman was gone? - Ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, ten minutes I fancy; I struggled and altercated with him a good deal.</p>
               <p>Did you endeavour to get away from him? - Yes, I did get away from him from there; he overtook me at the kitchen door as I was going to the street door to call for assistance; he caught me in his arms and threw me down on the floor; after that with a good deal of struggling, I got loose from him once more.</p>
               <p>You got away from him again? - Not away, I only got up upon my feet; he took me up in his arms again and carried me to the kitchen fire place to the far end of the kitchen; he threw me down there; then he effected his purpose there; he threw me down upon my back and fell a top of me.</p>
               <p>What did he do to you there? - He effected his purpose, and did what he intended to do to me.</p>
               <p>You must describe what he did to you? - In what manner.</p>
               <p>You must tell what he did, whether he lay with you or what? - He lay with me.</p>
               <p>Did he lie with you as your husband does? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he or not enter your body? - He did by force and violence, not by my consent.</p>
               <p>When he had entered your body, did you feel any thing particular? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>What did you feel? - It is a very disagreeable circumstance to mention; I found something come from him.</p>
               <p>You are a married woman; had he complete carnal knowledge of your body? - He had.</p>
               <p>What passed after he had done this? - He lifted me up again; I told him that he had used me extremely ill; that he had the wrong person to deal with; that I would certainly acquaint Mr. Bradley of it, and I insisted upon his going out of the house immediately; during this scuffle two little children of mine were crying in bed, I in a flurry went up stairs.</p>
               <p>COURT. You have two small children? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How old is the eldest? - Three years old.</p>
               <p>How old is the youngest? - Fifteen months; I just looked into the room and went down stairs again immediately.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. So you went down again immediately to the object of your affection?</p>
               <p>Where was the prisoner during the time you went up stairs? - In the kitchen; when I came down I desired him a second time to go out of the house; I was exceedingly flurried and frightened; I told him he had terrified and frightened me so I did not know what to do, and begged he would out of the house; he said if I would take the children up some drink which they wanted, he would go out of the house the moment I came down again; I carried the drink up, a cup I believe it was of liquor, to the children; he followed me close up stairs; I went into the room first; he came in, locked the door upon me, and locked me and himself into the room; he took me up in his arms then, and threw me upon the foot of the bed; there he committed the same fact as he had done in the kitchen before.</p>
               <p>Had he complete knowledge of you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>JURY. Were the two children in the bed? - Yes, in the same bed.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him when he took you in his arms? - I struggled with him all I could, and repeated the same words as in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177709100029"/> the kitchen, that he certainly would suffer for using me in the manner that he did.</p>
               <p>JURY. Was it not possible for you to have locked yourself in the room from him when you first went up? - I did not go into the room.</p>
               <p>JURY. It was possible for you to have got into the room, and locked the door? - To be sure it was, but I had not a thought to do it when I went up the first time, I was so exceedingly frightened.</p>
               <p>COURT. You know you left Cutler below stairs in the kitchen when you went up to the door? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>COURT. So then you had complete time to have gone into the room and locked the door? - I was so frightened that I had not the thought to do it; I only peep'd in to see what was the matter with the children.</p>
               <p>What passed after that? - He then insisted upon my going into my bed; he swore d - n his body he would do for me if I did not undress and go to bed immediately.</p>
               <p>Did he oblige you to go into bed or not? - He did.</p>
               <p>What became of him? - He undressed himself and came in after me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you undress yourself? - He helped to undress me, and frightened me exceedingly.</p>
               <p>With the two children? - Yes, the two little children were in bed.</p>
               <p>How long did he remain there? - About an hour, or an hour and half.</p>
               <p>Nothing passed in bed, I believe? - No, only my altercation with him; he went down stairs, I thought he was going out of the house, but I did not hear the house door shut.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you came down? - Two hours after that, I dare say.</p>
               <p>When you came down, where did you find Cutler? - In the kitchen, sitting upon a chair; I asked him the reason he was not gone out of the house all that while, for that I should certainly acquaint Mr. Bradley of my ill treatment; he said, he hoped I would not acquaint my husband of it; he opened the street door and went out, and I saw no more of him till I saw him before Sir

            : the first person I saw that morning was Mr. Hamley, a relation of my husband's; I appeared much frightened and flurried; I did not look in my countenance as usual; he asked me what was the matter with me; I told him I had been to Merlin's Cave the night before, and a gentleman had seen me home, and had grossly affronted me and used me ill.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Did you tell him the same story that you have done now? - Not all; he said he was going to Mr. Fowler's in Dean-street, and he would call again in his return home; he called again about 12; he asked me then about it, and I related him some part of the story again; but was very cautious what I said to him.</p>
               <p>COURT. What did you tell him? - I told him of the prisoner's using me ill in the kitchen, and throwing me down twice in the same manner that I have related to you: he said, he could wish to have some further conversation with me, and he invited me to take, a walk with him that afternoon.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him that he lay with you? - No, I did not repeat the same as I have done to you now; he wished to take a walk with me in the afternoon, to have some more discourse with me upon the matter; we took a walk as far as John o'Grote's in St. George's Fields; I then related the whole of the matter that had happened to me; I imagined that was his reason for inviting me to take a walk.</p>
               <p>When did you inform your husband of it? - The next morning, the Thursday morning; Mr. Hamley advised me to acquaint my husband as soon as possible, which I did the next morning.</p>
               <p>Is the house you live in adjoining to any dwelling-house? - No, there is never a house adjoining, nor dwelling-room.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>I think this acquaintance of yours with Mr. Cutler began at Merlin's Cave, did it not? - I never had no particular acquaintance with Mr. Cutler; I only knew him by sight.</p>
               <p>Had you never been in his company before? - Never by myself.</p>
               <p>Have you been in company with him with other people? - I have seen him playing at skittles there.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177709100030"/>You said no acquaintance with him? - No farther than his saying, how do you do Mrs. Bradley.</p>
               <p>Did you say how do you do Mr. Cutler, in answer to it? - No farther than very well, thank you.</p>
               <p>You knew each other by sight, and to speak to each other? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time in the evening was it that you went to this Merlin's Cave? - Between seven and eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>What diversion was going on there; what amusement; what a sort of a place is it? - A public-house.</p>
               <p>Did you play at skittles? - The gentlemen were playing at skittles.</p>
               <p>Did you play at skittles? - No.</p>
               <p>You have never played at skittles? - Yes, I have before now.</p>
               <p>How many times a week in general do you think you go to play at skittles at Merlin's Cave? - I don't know; I have been once or twice with a lady or so.</p>
               <p>But you have been there three times a week, have not you? - I have been often, sometimes with my husband.</p>
               <p>Never without your husband? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>You was invited into a room by Cutler at half after ten, to hear some ladies sing? - There was a great deal of company there.</p>
               <p>You had supped there? - Some cold lamb and cucumbers and some ale.</p>
               <p>I suppose when Mr. Cutler got you in he got better liquor for you? - He did not ask me to drink.</p>
               <p>So you drank nothing but that mug of ale that evening? - There were other people as well as me to drink it.</p>
               <p>You drank nothing else but ale? - I saw nothing else but ale.</p>
               <p>At about what time did you set off from Merlin's Cave to go home? - Between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>You told us you parted with your company in Cold Bath Fields? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts did Mr. Cutler propose to give you a glass of wine? - About Holborn.</p>
               <p>You refused that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You thought it I suppose a very impudent application of Mr. Cutler to you? - Yes, I thought it rude.</p>
               <p>How did it happen afterwards that you suffered Mr. Cutler to walk home with you after this? - He politely asked me to let him see me home.</p>
               <p>Then his politeness had cured this insult in asking you before to go in and drink a pint of wine: when he came to your house there was a woman in the house? - There was.</p>
               <p>How many children? - Four.</p>
               <p>I suppose you took your leave of Mr. Cutler at the door? - No, I did not, he followed me in.</p>
               <p>I should have thought now that it would have been full as prudent, considering the insult he had offered you in the street, not to suffer him to come into the house; a man that had asked a married woman about one in the morning to go into a house and drink pint of wine with him, how came you to firsser him to come-in? - I had no apprehension that he meant to do me any mischief.</p>
               <p>Well, you did suffer him to come into the house; then how came you to let this woman go out of the house, before he was gone out of the house? - I had several times desired had to stay.</p>
               <p>You did not walk out of the house with her, and call the watch for fear of accidents? - No, I expected Mr. Cutler would have gone out.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. Cutler continued ten or fifteen minutes before he began to be what you call rude; then he began to be very rude, threw you twice on the floor, and then got his will of you; you forgot to tell us that you cried out murder, and help, and so on? - I was never asked the question.</p>
               <p>You did cry out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>As loud as ever you could? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After he had lain with you the first time, then you went up stairs? - Yes, and looked into the room.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury asked you a very sensible question just now; it never entered your head to lock yourself into the room, and cry out for help? - I was so frightened and intimidated I did not know what to do.</p>
               <p>So frightened, that instead of locking yourself into the room, to prevent further danger, you ran down into the kitchen again to the person that had frightened you: how many yards is the watchman and his box from your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177709100031"/> house; is he within 20 or 30 yards from you? - He is within sight.</p>
               <p>If you had but put your head out of the window and called the watchman, you would have prevented the second mischief? - I wish I had, and prevented it all.</p>
               <p>How long was it from the first time that you say he lay with you in the kitchen, before you went up stairs with the drink for the children? - Immediately as soon as he lifted me up.</p>
               <p>Within five or ten minutes then? - Yes, the children screaming all the time.</p>
               <p>Then within five or ten minutes he had thrown you down, and repeated this thing? - No, it was some time; it might be ten minutes or a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Ten minutes or a quarter of an hour between the two acts: how many beds are there in this room in which you looked in? - Only one.</p>
               <p>How many children were in the bed? - Two.</p>
               <p>Where were the other two? - In another room, up another pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>How old is the eldest child that was up above stairs? - About seven or eight.</p>
               <p>He did what you have told us; and you undressed yourself at his threats and went to bed; and he to you; he got up in an hour; nothing happened but altercation there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you go to sleep? - No, I lay awake all the time.</p>
               <p>Did it never enter your head to get up, and cry out at the window, to apprehend this villain that had done you so much mischief? - I did not chuse to make any nordtion there; I thought I could take him afterwards.</p>
               <p>You let him stay till between six and seven in the morning? - Five or six.</p>
               <p>Was not you afraid that people would all be up; people are all up at six or seven in the morning; was not you apprehensive of having a strange man seen coming out of your house? - I gave you my reason, I intended to acquaint my husband.</p>
               <p>On the morning after this happened, the first person you saw was Mr. Hamley, who is a relation of your husband's? - By marriage.</p>
               <p>And a particular friend of your's? - He has known me and my family a great many years.</p>
               <p>Are you very intimate with him, or nothing more than a common acquaintance with him? - Nothing more than a common acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Had you no woman of your acquaintance; do you know no good motherly woman that you could have gone and told this to? - You see he came into the house while I was at breakfast.</p>
               <p>But there you did not tell him what had happened? - I related to him part of the story.</p>
               <p>You had not told him that he had lain with you? - I told him that he threw me down in the kitchen and used me ill.</p>

               <p>Not that he had lain with you? - Yes, I told him that he had thrown me down in the kitchen, and lay with me.</p>
               <p>Then for God's sake what was the walk to John o'Grote's house in the evening for? for you had told him all you knew, that the man had lain with you; what was this scheme that was to be cooked up in the evening? - Mr. Hamley did not tell me his reasons for inviting me out.</p>
               <p>Then neither he nor you thought of going then before a justice, and taking out a warrant? - I did not know that I should do that.</p>
               <p>Had you never heard that to commit such an outrage upon a woman was an offence punishable? Had you never heard that people usually applied to justices upon such an occasion? - I never had any conversation about the matter.</p>
               <p>When was it for the first time that you went before a justice of peace? - On the Thursday afterwards.</p>
               <p>Was it the Thursday or Friday? - I think it was the Thursday.</p>
               <p>You did not go till the Thursday? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you been at this Merlin's Cave on the Wednesday? - No.</p>
               <p>That you swear, positively? - Wednesday was the day I was at John o'Grote's house; it happened on the Wednesday morning</p>
               <p>Was you at Merlin's Cave of the evening of Wednesday? - No, I was at John o'Grote's with Mr. Hamley then.</p>
               <p>Was you or not at Merlin's Cave on Wednesday? - No.</p>
               <p>Were you there on the Thursday? - I was there one day in the week afterwards, but cannot tell.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177709100032"/>But had you been there before you had been at the justices, the evening before you had been at the justices? - I don't know, I believe I had.</p>
               <p>Did you play at skittles then? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing about Mr. Cutler? - I never mentioned his name at all.</p>
               <p>Was any body with you in your walk to John o'Grote's house; did any company go with you? - Nobody but Mr. Hamley and I.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Hyde out with you that evening? - I never walked out with that gentleman in my life.</p>
               <p>You know such a person? - I know he was in possession in the same house that my husband was.</p>
               <p>Where was your husband on the Tuesday or Wednesday? - He was in possession as a man under the messenger in Lamb's Conduit-street.</p>
               <p>That is close by; it may be half a mile, it is not more? - More than that.</p>
               <p>Well, no matter, three quarters of a mile; when did you see your husband first? - Thursday morning.</p>
               <p>Did not you see your husband on the Wednesday at all? - I did not.</p>
               <p>On Thursday you saw him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see Hyde in his company? - I saw Hyde at the house.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with your husband before Hyde? - Not on this matter.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with Hyde? - No; the man was quite a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to Hyde about your husband's having a fine opportunity of making 70 or 80 l.? - I mentioned to my husband, that there was an advertisement for a rider's place, and thought he had better accept of that, it would be 70 or 80 l. a year; that it would be better than being a servant to a messenger to bankruptcies.</p>
               <p>You were blaming your husband for being a fool about not accepting this profitable place; do you know a Mrs.

               <p>Counsel for the Prosecution. You say when you got into Holborn with Mr. Cutler, that he asked you to drink a glass of wine with him? - He did.</p>
               <p>You considered that as an insult? - I told him, I did not chuse to do any such thing; it was not prudent for me to go into taverns and places.</p>
               <p>COURT. What did you understand was his drift by that invitation? - I did not think he meant me any ill.</p>
               <p>Then it did not strike you that he meant to have any intimacy with you, if you had gone to a tavern with him? - If it had been in the middle of noon-day I should not have gone into any tavern with a man.</p>
               <p>Did not you understand, by that invitation, that he meant to take you into a tavern and be familiar with you? - I did not know that he meant to take me into a tavern.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you understand that he meant by that question of his to get you into some place and to lie with you? - I had no ill opinion of him till he began to use me ill.</p>
               <p>Did not you at that time imagine that that was his drift? - I would not have gone if it had been in the day, much more by night.</p>
               <p>Why do you think it improper to go by night more than by day? - I would not have gone in the day with any man.</p>
               <p>Did not you understand that Cutler, when he asked you that question, wanted to have you into some house to be familiar with you? - I had no suspicion that he intended any such thing, I had not indeed.</p>

               <p>Did you see Mrs. Bradley on Wednesday the 16th of July? - Yes; being out about business on Wednesday the 16th I came into St. John's-street, Clerkenwell, from thence coming into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177709100033"/> Cow-cross, before Mrs. Bradley's door, I called in to ask how the family did; it was about 9 o'clock; seeing some alteration in her countenance to what I usually before did, I asked her, what ailed her? she said, she was not well; I immediately bid her a good morning; she said, Mr. Hamley, if you will be so obliging as to wait a few minutes I have something particular to acquaint you with; about ten minutes after I withdrew into another room; she then said, that the evening before, the 15th, she spent the evening at Merlin's Cave, together with Mr. and Mrs. Bates, and Mrs. Boutflower, the wife of an attorney's clerk; in her way from her own house she called at Mrs. Bates's in Cold Bath Fields; Mrs. Bates's brother being there, went with Mrs. Bradley, as Mrs. Bates, it did not suit her immediately to go, she would follow them in a few minutes after; when they came to Merlin's Cave they went into a skittle-ground; seeing some gentlemen at skittles they sat at the farther end of the garden, this Mr. Bates the brother, and Mrs. Bradley; soon after which Mrs. Bates came to them and joined their company, and there they remained till about nine or between nine and ten o'clock; after which they adjourned into the house, by the intreaties of some of the gentlemen that came to them, I don't know whether it was Mr. Bates or not, or the prisoner; as soon as they came into the house they joined in one of the rooms, and sat altogether; after which there were two women that came into their company that had formerly sung at Sadler's Wells; Mr. Cutler knowing them desired them to sing a song, and I believe it was repeated by some others in the company; they sang till about twelve or between twelve and one; she then went home with Mr. Cutler, Mrs. Boutflower, and Mr. and Mrs. Bates into Cold Bath Fields, to their lodging, where they parted from Mr. and Mrs. Bates; from thence they went to Brook-street, Holborn, to a public house, where Mr. Boutflower was spending the evening; the wife of Mr. Boutflower, when she came to the door, seeing the waiter, enquired whether her husband was gone home or not; she there took leave of Mrs. Bradley, and, Mr. Cutler going down Holborn, Mrs. Bradley desired Mr. Cutler not to trouble himself in going home with her, as she was very capable of taking care of herself; he then entreated her to go with her to see her home; as soon as they came to her door they saw a woman that was occasionally hired by this Mrs. Bradley to look after the children in her absence; she, in opening the door, had her cloak and hat ready to go home to her lodgings; Mrs. Bradley then entreated her to stay there for the might, or the remaining part of the morning; she answered, that the people would wait up all the morning, in expectation of her coming home; the woman then going, Mrs. Bradley shutting the door after her, went into the kitchen, where the prisoner was; he then began with some familiarities, and Mrs. Bradley then had some altercation with him; she desired him to quit the house, or otherwise she would acquaint her husband of it; saying, Mr. Cutler, you have the wrong person to deal with. you may depend upon it, and if you proceed to any ill treatment you may be assured that you will suffer for it; he then threw her down on the floor, and in struggling she got from him, ran to the street-door to make her escape; but Mr. Cutler immediately ran to her, took her in his arms, carried her to the farther part of the kitchen, near the chimney, there threw her down, and then carnally knew her: she did not mention immediately the word carnally, but it implied the same; then he lifted her up from the floor; she desired him to go out of the house, which he refused, repeating the same words as before, that she would acquaint her husband of it; he said, he hoped she would not be guilty of informing her husband; with that the children were crying up stairs, she ran up as far as the door; the children calling for liquor, tea, or something, she went back into the kitchen, where the prisoner was, and then taking up the liquor to give the children, desiring of him then to quit the house; the prisoner said, if she would carry up the liquor he would go; upon which she went up stairs, and the prisoner followed her; that as soon as she entered the room they both entered the room; he locked the door on the inside; she then turned round and asked the prisoner, how he dared presume to come into her bed-chamber? that then the prisoner laid hold of her, threw her on the bed, and carnally knew her a second time; after which the prisoner bid her to take off her cloaths to go to bed, for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177709100034"/> he would sleep with her the remainder of the morning; she then undressing herself, or he partly undressed her, she could not recollect which, she went then to bed, and the prisoner undressed himself and went to bed also; in the morning about five or six I believe the prisoner got up, and she supposed he was gone out of the house; but on her coming down some time after, an hour or the like, she found the prisoner sleeping on a chair; she desiring him to go about his business, he soon after withdrew, entreating her not to inform Mr. Bradley, her husband of it; to which she said, he might certainly depend upon it that she would acquaint her husband of the whole transaction: after she had told me this, I went out of the house, and told her, that if she would defer going to her husband till the afternoon I should be glad to meet her on Black-friars Bridge, and take a walk into St. George's Fields: my motive was to see, if possible, whether there had been any intimacy before: I asked her if they had ever been together before? whether there had been any intimacy, any liberties granted whatever? and she declared, that she was innocent from first to last: I did it on purpose to evade it, before the information should come to the husband's ear; she met me about four or a little after in the afternoon; she declared her innocence from first to last: In coming home I went into Hatton-garden, and told her I should call on my return home at her house, as she expected that the prisoner would call that night; he had told her so the foregoing day.</p>
               <p>When did he tell her so? - The Wednesday evening I was told of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. When did he say, that he would call? - On the Tuesday, I believe, the former evening; I went in the evening, but Mr. Cutler was not there.</p>
               <p>COURT. When was it did she say, that Cutler said he would call again? - I suppose it might be in the evening, before they parted; said he, Mrs. Bradley, I will call and see you to-morrow; Mrs. Bradley replied, she should have some company to-morrow evening; therefore whether she desired him or not I cannot particularly tell; she said, she did not desire to see him, did not desire his company not the ensuing evening.</p>
               <p>COURT. That is what she told you; but what did she say to him, that she excused herself from seeing him because she should have some company? Can you recollect when it was that Mrs. Bradley said, Mr. Cutler made this proposal of calling to see her in the evening? - On the foregoing night, Tuesday the 15th to the morning of the 16th.</p>
               <p>COURT. At her house? - I cannot immediately say it was in the evening.</p>
               <p>COURT. Whether it was when Mr. Cutler parted from her in the morning, or when? - I did not remark that, I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You are a watchmaker you tell us? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you ever act as an attorney? - No.</p>
               <p>I thought you had; because the precision with which this lady told the story to you was more like giving instruction for drawing a brief than telling a tale to a friend; she desired you to stay a few minutes, and then you retired into a back room with her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she tell you the story in the same words afterwards? - There might be some part of it repeated then.</p>
               <p>Not since then? - Yes; in the presence of her husband I heard it.</p>
               <p>Only those times? - No.</p>
               <p>You have a fine memory indeed! so you, as a friend to the family, called in to pay a morning visit, and enquire how the family did; when had you seen the family before? - Very likely the Sunday before.</p>
               <p>Do you visit often at Mrs. Bradley's? - Very often.</p>
               <p>How many times in a week? - Sometimes two or three times in a week.</p>
               <p>You are intimate there? - Very intimate with Mrs. Bradley, and her husband, and family and all.</p>
               <p>So intimate that in a wet stormy night perhaps you take a bed there? - No; far from it.</p>
               <p>I ask you upon your oath, did you never sleep in that house?  - No, never</p>
               <p>Never a night in your life? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Do you ever happen to stay late in an afternoon? - Till twelve or one o'clock in a morning I might be there.</p>
               <p>You deny that you did ever sleep there all night? - I never slept with her.</p>
               <p>Never slept with her, and always in the kitchen; never in the bed-chamber, upon your oath? - I have been in the bed-chamber many<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177709100035"/> a time; not any criminal connection we never had together in our lives; I have been when the children have been ill.</p>
               <p>Then you have been a kind tender nurse when the children have been ill, and, anxious for their health, you have been perhaps in the bed chamber; sometimes when Mr. Bradley, who is pretty much from home, is absent, you are so kind as to keep the wife company till one or two in the morning; sit up and tell her some very pleasant stories? - I have been there very often.</p>
               <p>Now by this walk that you took you suspected her a little I find, because this walk to John o'Grote's house was to sift her, to know whether she had been guilty of any imprudencies? - Certainly my motive was to evade a prosecution if there had been any intimacy, but she declared there had not.</p>
               <p>Then from the knowledge that you have of your relation's character, you suspected there might have been something of that f ort? - No, I wanted an altercation to discover if there had been any thing of intimacy.</p>
               <p>Then you were a little jealous of her? - No, not jealous.</p>
               <p>Neither jealous nor suspicious, but for the purpose of preventing this getting to the ears of her husband, the only ear it should have got to, you took a walk to John o'Grote's house for the purpose of sifting her to evade a prosecution; did you see her any more that night? - Yes, I called at the house, and the woman that was there the night before was there.</p>
               <p>You was in hopes that you should catch Mr. Cutler in a trap then, you thought that he would be there? - I did not know but he might.</p>
               <p>You was in hopes of meeting him there? - I had no engagement with him.</p>
               <p>But you thought you might meet with him there? - Probably that might be the reason.</p>
               <p>You found Mrs. Bradley at home, and she told you that Mr. Cutler had not been there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she tell you she had been to look for him at Merlin's Cave? - She did not say that; she had never been to Merlin's Cave till the Thursday.</p>
               <p>She could not tell you that then? - No.</p>
               <p>She might be there on the Wednesday? - I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. We shall prove that she walked there after she had been at John o'Grote's house.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prosecutrix. Was there any mention made of Cutler's being to be at your house on Wednesday evening? - I believe he did say he would come on the Wednesday evening, and I told him that I did not desire to see him any more.</p>
               <p>When did he tell you he intended to come on Wednesday evening? - When he was going out of the house, I believe, in the morning; I said I did not desire to see him any more; I should certainly acquaint my husband with the affair.</p>
               <p>That is all the answer you made him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You said nothing to him about having company? - I don't believe I did, I did not desire his company.</p>
               <p>The question is, whether you told him not to come on Wednesday evening, for you should have company? - I told him I did not desire to see him any more.</p>
               <p>Did you give that reason for it, that you should have company? - I cannot say upon my word whether I did or no.</p>
               <p>Did you tell Mr. Hamley that you told the prisoner when he proposed calling upon you that evening, that you should have company? - I don't remember saying so.</p>
               <p>Court to HAMLEY. You hear this woman says she cannot recollect telling you that she made that excuse with the prisoner that she should have company that evening? - The words were mentioned to me, that some acquaintance or company would be there, and therefore she desired he might not come.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prosecutrix. Did you or did you not expect he would come that evening? - I did not expect that he would.</p>
               <p>Did not you appoint Mr. Hamley to come to your house, after you had parted with him in Hatton-garden, in expectation that he would meet Cutler there? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>COURT. What say you to that Hamley?</p>
               <p>HAMLEY. I recollect the circumstance well that she did recollect something of his saying he would call in the evening, and she desired him not; I told her I would be near her house about nine, and would drop in.</p>
               <p>Why? - Because I expected Mr. Cutler would come again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my defence to my counsel.</p>

               <p>What conversation passed between you and her on Wednesday? - I had an acquaintance laid in, who had caught a violent cold; I knew one time when Mrs. Bradley was bad with her face, that she had an old woman with her; I asked her if she could tell me whether that old woman was at leisure, I wanted to get her a nurse's place; she said she was afraid she was not at leisure; she asked me after that if I had seen Mr. Cutler.</p>

               <p>Did Mr. Cutler come up to the Cave that evening? - I did not see him that night at all.</p>

               <p>You knew her sometime, and was in her house and have reason to know her character; is she, from the knowledge you have of her character, a modest or a lewd, immodest woman? - I told you my opinion; she cannot be very modest, when at all times she would go out and come home at all hours when I was there, and sometimes very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Have you seen her with other men besides her husband? - Yes, that I have divers of times when the husband was not at home at all, and men have laid in the house when he was not at home.</p>

               <p>Do you remember any time in the evening, when you was in the room, Mrs. Bradley laying a wager about any thing? - No, but I remember another circumstance which is rather more singular, that was, Cutler was asked to sing a song, which he frequently did, so he begins and sings a bit, By G - d, says he, I can neither sing nor do any thing else; she took notice of it, she goes out and takes him with her into the passage between the two rooms, and she comes in again, this was on that Tuesday evening; she comes in again, and said that Mr. Cutler was fineable for what he had said.</p>
               <p>She went out to form her judgment, and came in and said that Mr. Cutler was fineable for what he had said? - Yes; upon which we desired that the ladies would withdraw to bring in their verdict upon it; they went out into the other room.</p>
               <p>How many of them? - Four, and when they came in again we fixed a foreman; we asked them what was their verdict, the verdict was given by Mrs. Bradley; they resolved<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177709100038"/> that he was fineable a bottle of ale; the bottle of ale was had in, and he paid the six-pence because he was not incapable.</p>

            ; I lived there seven months.</p>
               <p>You are a single woman? - Yes: I lost a silver tankard, a silver half pint, and eight silver table spoons, there is but one in the indictment, a pair of silver tea tongs, a silver salver, and a black silk sacque and petticoat; they were locked up in a trunk in my lodging in Dowding's house; I had the one-pair of stairs fore-room.</p>
               <p>Where did the trunk stand? - By my bedside in the corner on one of the boxes; I had the key in my pocket at the time I missed the things; I saw it safe on Sunday morning the 23d; I found it broke open about nine at night; I did not lie in the house between the 23d and 25th; I was at the prisoner's house, the prisoner's wife had been my servant; I trusted him in my house; I was involved in trouble.</p>
               <p>Was she your servant at that time? - No; I had been to my attorney, and he ordered me to look at my evidence; she was my only evidence; I went and found her up and she was married to this man; she had been from me some months; she asked me to come to his house; the prisoner lay at my house at the time; when I found them out they were in great distress.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you ever give him authority to pawn any thing for you? - Only a pint mug when I wanted money.</p>
               <p>That was the only article you gave him authority to pawn? - Yes, that was the only piece of plate I ever gave him to pawn.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Bruin, a pawnbroker? - Yes; instead of carrying it to Mr. Johnson's, as I told him, he went to Mr. Bruin's, and Mr. Bruin sent for me, and stopped him, and asked me if I had that left, having lost so much before.</p>

Viner and Cummings to bring the prisoner into their shop, which was consented to; one of the gentlemen there went to St. Martin's watch house, and fetched four watchmen, who conducted them to the round-house; the next morning the prisoner was committed: they were both searched, but nothing found upon either of them; I am positive the prisoner is the person who struck me on the breast, and was opposite to me when my watch was pulled out, and there was no other person so near me, nay no person near enough to be able to reach my pocket but the prisoner.</p>

I said I did not know, I found them in the street; he said, he supposed I had robbed that man; he searched me, and took me to the watch-house; and said, he would transport me unless I gave him some money to drink, and then he would make it up with me: I have a husband, who was pressed three weeks ago to New York; I was born in Ireland, and bred up in the West Indies.</p>

               <p>Mr. SWAIN. When we went before the justice he said, he would go down on his bare knees if I would forgive him; I said, I pitied him, but the crime was of such a nature that I could not forgive him.</p>

               <p>Why did you lay your hand on him? - Because I knew this money was to be taken; Jenks and Baldwin took the money from him.</p>
               <p>Why did you lay your hand over him? - I am used to lay my hand over any body when a-bed; Hill picked one pocket, and Jenks the other; Jenks took a guinea and eight shillings, and Hill a shilling; then they all got up and ran away, and left Hunter and me; Hunter snored, I take it he was between sleep and awake; when they ran away he started up; I believe they ran round the haystack and lost him.</p>
               <p>On his Cross Examination he said, it might be later than half after nine, but he was sure it was not twelve when they met the prosecutor; that one of them reached over the prosecutor to pick his pocket on the side he lay on; that he was perfectly sober, but the others were not; that the reason of their going into the fields at that time of night was, that they said they knew where a great many girls inhabited, and Hunter agreed to go; that they rambled about from ten till between one and two, when this was done.</p>

               <p>[The trunk was deposed to by the prosecutor.]</p>

Deitz took a pen and ink and cast it up; he said it came to 90 l. 2 s. he said that was 90 l. payable, and we should drink a bottle of wine with the 2 s. when the goods were delivered; I agreed for ready money; they said I should have the money when I delivered the goods, but they would call at three o'clock and take away the goods; they came near five o'clock; we then went to Pemberton-row; they asked for a receipt; I asked the name, he said it was Prince; the prisoner Deitz wrote a direction, No 2, Pemberton-row, near Fleet-street; but there was a mistake, there was no number; we put the goods in a coach and went to Pemberton-row; I was to be paid when I brought the goods to Pemberton-row; we took the goods out of the coach, and Deitz said lay them down there, that was in the room below, you call it a parlour in England, I believe; there sat a clerk<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177709100062"/> at a table with a number of books and papers; they sat there to write; Mr. Prince and Mr. Deitz called me to go up stairs, we went up stairs, Prince took out a bottle of wine, set it on the table; I said, No, I don't like wine, I like better to have my money than wine; then what should I drink, O, I like a draught of porter; well they would send for it; they drank a draught of porter, and Prince took out his pocket book; and gave me a draught, I said it was two different hand-writings; I don't understand English, and I believe that the draught is not good; this is the draught (producing it) I sat close to the table, on the other side sat Prince and Deitz; when I said I believe the draught was not good, I gave it to Mr. Deitz, he took it in his hand, and said, O you be not afraid, this note is good, it is as good as the Bank of England; Deitz then said, now you must give us change, 9 l. 18 s. I said I have not so much in my pocket, I will go home and get change; Deitz said, O no, this merchant believes you an honest man, so give your own note to pay to-morrow after tomorrow; I said I did not like that, I would go home and get change; I went directly to Lombard-street; I asked for Mr. Smith upon whom that note was drawn; one person I met told me which was the house of Mr. Smith; I shewed the banker the paper, I said I did not come for money, I only wanted to know if it was good; the banker said, my name is not John Smith; I said, does there live any

               <p>That is the direction given you by Deitz in his hand writing? - He wrote it himself, but the goods were not delivered at that house, and besides there was no number.</p>

               <p>What capacity did I pass in, did I pass as a hair-merchant to you; you are upon your oath, do you know the meaning of kissing the book in English? - I do.</p>
               <p>Did I pass as a hair-merchant to you upon your oath? - You brought Mr. Prince, who you said had a commission; you said you did not know the hair.</p>
               <p>Did I pass as a hair-merchant to you? - No, he said he had a commission to buy the hair, but he said he did not know the hair.</p>
               <p>Did I buy any goods of you? - You and he came together.</p>
               <p>Did I ever say that I had a commission, or that I was in partnership with Prince, or that I would pay you for it; did I make any promise to pay you? - You said Prince had a great quantity of commissions out of the country, and kept a fine house and kept his clerks.</p>
               <p>On what day was it that I first came to your house? - The 23d of July.</p>

               <p>When you came to Pemberton-row, who received you? - You ordered the coach to bring us there; there we left the hair below in the parlour, you and Prince ordered us to go up stairs, I never saw the hair any more; you gave an order to Prince to lay the hair down there, and I never saw the hair any more.</p>
               <p>Did I tell you that this Smith was a banker? - You said it was as good as the bank of England, that Mr. Smith lived in Lombard-street, and that was enough.</p>
               <p>Was I at that time in any superior appearance than you have seen me before or after, or did you think that I came with an intent to cheat or defraud you, or did I insinuate to you that I was any thing which I was not? - You gave me a false draught and a false direction.</p>

             swears hard where his property is concerned, where perhaps a man or conscience or an Englishman would not have sworn so severe as he has done, for I believe putting him to his oath upon an English bible has not put him to that severity as if he had been sworn in a foreign, in a more solemn manner; if I had given him the goods or the money, he would never have staid in England to put the laws in force against a High German; Mr. Prince and the king's barber are both strangers to me; Prince came to me at the Turk's Head bagnio, he said he was informed I understood several languages, did I understand Dutch? I said I did; he said he had a commission from Marlborough to buy hair, and he would make me amends; I having been but lately discharged from Mr. Akerman's academy, and having been detained there ten months, as your Lordship knows, I thought it as well for me to condescend to be Mr. Prince's interpreter, which formerly, when I was in prosperity and kept my own chariot, I should not have gone to do that for a guinea; I not being a judge of his commission, never asked the man about his goods; but Mr. Prince said I have got an order for hair for the length of so many inches; the Dutchman said he could suit him, but he had not so great a quantity as he wanted; Prince said, let me have what you have already; he said he would write to his friend, and get some more; one Kelly, I am informed, is the man that made the wig for his Majesty; he was was then foreman to the shop who served his Majesty, and was applied to to make a wig for the king when he had his hair cut off; Kelly said, he had made the king's wig: I know no more of Prince than as a bottle-friend, by his coming twice or three times to that tavern; the goods were never delivered to me nor my care; I drank part of a bottle with them up stairs; I was not very well, I retired home and left Mr. Prince and the hair-merchant there; I saw Mr. Prince in the evening at the Turk's-head tavern; the waiter said, some of Sir John's men had been after me; I said, I would go immediately up to Sir John's office; I went there; Sir John's office; I went there; Sir John's office was shut up then, because it was late in the evening; I went to a public house the next door to the office, and enjoyed myself with a few acquaintance; I enquired for Mr. Leigh, Sir John's clerk, one of Sir John's men went and asked Mr. Leigh, if he had any thing against me; he said, if the Count comes let him be derained for a fraud; one called me our very genteely, and said, he had an information that I had been concerned with one Prince in defrauding a Dutch merchant; I said I will clear up the matter with you at any time, or take my word till the morning; he took me to Covent-garden round-house; I staid in the watch-house till morning; I gave all the description to Mr. Wright, the magistrate, that Prince might have been brought to an account, and the servant who officiated as servant to Mr. Prince; but Mr. Wright being rather prejudiced against me for appearing like himself as a gentleman, it was his intention to commit me, right or wrong, which justice Addington would not the day before; I said to the justice, he might do the devil justice which he deserved, and discharge me; Prince, and Paterson, and Bailey, and those whom he has mentioned, the king's barber and Prince, I have not heard since about them, nor have they applied to me, nor assisted me, nor do I know what is become of them, nor the hair; if there has been a fraud committed I think it would be requisite to have them advertized, and he might get his hair from them, and not from me, a man that had it not in his possession; I went with these men as an interpreter; I don't know but he is a hair-merchant: I have suffered almost two months imprisonment; I hope<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177709100064"/> the gentlemen will take it into consideration that my liberty is at stake; he was fitter to have a concern in it than not; for if I had had a hundred pound in my hand I could have easily got bail; I hope you will consider me as an innocent man, and judge me accordingly.</p>

               <p>Court to the prosecutor. When you left the house, and went to Lombard-street, did you expect them to stay till you came back? - Yes, they were to stay for the change, the 9 l. 18 s.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. Was not I in a dishabille; and did not I tell you, that I wanted to be shaved and dressed, and be gone? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>You did not see that I was in a dishabille? - I never look to a man's dress.</p>
               <p>Then you cannot tell that I am the same man? - O yes, I know you too well.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you ever find out whether that Prince was a hair-merchant? - I never could find out or hear any thing of him.</p>
