                  </hi>. I live at 56, Green Street, Grosvenor Square, when in town—in May last I left town and went to Maidenhead—before leav<lb/>ing I locked up various articles of china in my dining-room and took the key with me—on making occasional visits to town from May up to the end of September I placed other articles in the dining-room and again took the key with me—I left the prisoner Norah Lynn in charge of the house; she was the sole person in the house in my employ—I returned to town for the winter on 18th October—on going into the dining-room I missed a great number of articles that I had placed there—in consequence of that my suspicions were aroused—I received information on the 19th and went to Mr. Wertheimer's in New Bond Street, a well-known dealer in china—I had an interview with him between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon, in con<lb/>sequence of which I went on to the shop of the prisoner Jewell, 496, Oxford Street—I there saw a shopman who I had never seen before to my know<lb/>ledge</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187601310009"/>
               <p>and I don't think he knew me—I asked him if he had got any good china for sale—he said "Would you buy a very fine Bristol cup and saucer," which he produced—I said "This is very fine; what is the price of it"—he said "100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said that was rather a high price—he said that was the usual price that was given for them, and he produced a book in which there was an entry opposite the words "Bristol cup and saucer" of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 100 guineas—I had very little doubt that it was my Bristol cup and saucer—there are one or two others in existence—there are five in existence—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the cup and saucer—I gave 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it at Christie and Mason's sale on 10th May last year—I then said to the shopman "Have you got anything else in Bristol"—he went to the same safe, which he unlocked, and produced these four Bristol figures—he said the price of them was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the two Cupids and 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the other pair of figures with musical instruments—I said "They are very fine; where is Mr. Jewell"—he said that he had gone out, but he would be back in a few minutes—I at once-identified these as my property—I then walked round the shop and saw a Bow figure in a cupboard and two blue oriental plates on a side table—1 at once knew them to be mine—I then went away and went to the police-station to engage the services of Marshall, the detective—I returned to Jewell's shop in about half an hour, leaving Marshall outside in the cab—I went into the shop and was met at the door by Jewell—I said "Mr. Jewell, you have got a very fine Bristol cup and saucer; would you let me see it?"—he replied "I cannot; it is sold"—I said "Indeed, that is curious, because I saw it only half an hour ago; it was offered to me for sale—would you let me see the four Bristol figures?"—he said "I can't show you those either, they are all sold," and he then pointed to a gentleman at the end of the shop and said "This is the purchaser, Mr. Mendoza;" and Mr. Mendoza said "Yes; I have bought the lot"—I said to Mr. Mendoza "What did you give for the lot?" he said "I bought them in a lot for 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "Would you let me see them again"—he said "I cannot, as they are gone away; I am going to submit them to a gentleman in Liverpool"—I asked Jewell if he thought Mendoza would resell them to me at a profit—Mendoza replied that he could not sell them to me as he had to submit them to Mr. Matheson—I believe he is a collector in Liverpool and an M.P.—I asked Jewell what he had given for the cup and saucer and where he had got it from—he said he had bought it from a man in the street, who went about as a traveller, and that he had only given 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it as he did not know it was Bristol—I then looked round the shop to see if there was anything else of my property and I saw the two blue plates which I said I would purchase, and the Bow figure which I also agreed to purchase—the price named was 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the Bow figure and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the plates—I said I should like to see the Bristol cup and saucer and the four figures; Mendoza said "I am not going to show them to you at this time of night, I will show them to you to<lb/>morrow"—I had the articles I purchased for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. put in paper, and they were carried to the cab door by Jewell—when there I said "Mr. Jewell' I am very sorry to have to inform you that the Bristol cup and saucer and the four figures as well as these plates and figure that you have put in paper, have been stolen from me"—he replied "I was not aware they were stolen"—I asked who he got them from—he said "From a man in the streets"—I asked if he had had anything else from the same man—he re<lb/>plied "I had a lot, of rubbish from him the other day which I don't know if</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187601310010"/>
               <p>it belongs to you"—I said I should like to see it—he then lighted up the back part of the shop, and took me to a small table on which I saw about 20 articles of small value, all of which I recognised as my property with the ex<lb/>ception of four small pieces of china at the corners—I then said to Jewell "I must call some one in to identify these articles "and I called in Marshall—I then made a list of the articles on the table belonging to me, and gave Jewell notice not to part with them or with the Bristol cup and saucer, and the four Bristol figures, and I then again asked him the name of the man he had brought them from—he said he did not recollect, or he did not know—I then asked him to produce his day book—he produced it rather unwillingly; he did not produce it at first, he did afterwards—he said "I don't know that I am obliged to show it to you"—he said to the shopman "Here, can't you find that card that the man left," and then he said "I think it was Clark, or something, or some name like that"—Marshall had told him when he came in, that he was a detective officer, and I think he asked him one or two questions, he asked him where he got the china from—he said he bought them from a man who came in as a traveller, but he did not re<lb/>member his name—this is the book he subsequently produced. <hi rend="italic">The follow<lb/>ing entries were read from the day book</hi>—"24th September, 1875, Bristol group, 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; Chelsea figures, 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1st October, Clark, china, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; Mirror, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4th October, total 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5th October, Clark, china, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6th October, Clark, china, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11th October, Clark, china, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12th October, Clark, china, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making a total of 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "Can't you find the card "the shopman said—"I can't find it, but I will have it for you to-morrow morning if I have to sit up all night"—before I left I said "Mr. Jewell I give you notice not to part with any of these things on the table or with any of the things I have seen to-day belonging to me"—he said he would not—I said to Mendoza "Cannot you show them to me to night" he said "They are at my house, and I am not going to be disturbed at this time of night, if you will come to-morrow morning I will show you what I bought"—I then left—next morning the 20th, about 10.45 I went again to Jewell's shop in company with detective serjeant Butcher—I saw Jewell and Mendoza there—I said to Jewell "Have you found the card "he said "I have" and produced it—this is it.

Yours, &amp;c, David Jewell.") Jewell was not there when I went with Butcher, he came in afterwards—I went round and found a large number of articles belonging to me placed on a table at the back of the shop—I made a list of them at the time and have it here—I had not seen any of those articles on my previous visits to Jewell's—I put the prices against the pieces, they are as near as I can say the actual amount paid for them; the total amount is 472<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that is without the Bristol cup and saucer and the four figures, the Bow figure and the plates—I paid 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the pair of Cupids and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or ten guineas for the other pair of Bristol figures—for the Bow figure with another I paid 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the plates, and 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think, for the group sold to Mr. Wertheimer—the total value of all the articles found at Jewell's was 711<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Jewell came in during the time I was going round the pre<lb/>mises, and I said to him "These are all my property, and they have been stolen from me"—he said "I have induced Mr. Mendoza to re-sell these to me"—he was then referring to the things on the table as well as the Bristol cup and saucer and the four figures—I think that was all he said—he was then taken into custody—I first went to Clark's premises on Wednesday, 20th, in company with Butcher, about 5 or 6 o'clock in the evening—I saw Clark there; before speaking to him I saw some carpets in the shop—it is a small shop in Crawford Street with second-hand clothes hanging outside—to some extent it corresponded with the address on the card, it was the</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. I have been for about five years a collector of old china—I have made it a complete study—I think I can tell pretty nearly the intrinsic value of old china almost the moment I see it—I have studied Continental and Oriental china as well as English—I think that information is confined to a few—I think it requires a certain amount of study—I don't think it quite approaches to a fine art; it is akin to the study of pictures—I have not indulged in the study of autographs—it sometimes happens that china of this kind is bought at an extremely low price and sold again at a very high price, but that is uncommon; important and well-known pieces vary very little in price—the Bristol cup is not the article that I set most value upon, I set considerable value upon it—the two Cupids are in reality Plymouth china, but it is very much the same as Bristol; the other pair is also Plymouth; they are known as Bristol—the cup and saucer was not originally sold for a mere trifle, it was purchased by a well-known connoisseur, and the history of it is well known; the ser<lb/>vice was purchased by a Mr. Walker, of Bath, a well-known collector, some seven or eight years ago; he sold the complete tea service by public auc<lb/>tion, and various persons who are well known purchased several articles—Mr. Walker purchased it from abroad, I don't know the exact sum he gave for it; I should think more than 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a cup—I have known a Bristol cup and saucer to be sold for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have seen them sold at public auction at Christies for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. during the last two years; not similar to this; I have never known one of these sold for anything like that price; there is a coat-of-arms on them with an inscription by which they are well distinguished; that is on this cup and saucer, and they are known among collectors by the paste, by the material they are made of—my cup would be known to be Bristol by the paste, by the general appearance of it; there are five of these chocolate cups and saucers in existence, and there are five or six tea cups and saucers; these were originally made for chocolate—there was a teapot, cream ewer, and sugar basin which the late Mr. Callender possessed; he was a collector—I have purchased china at a very small price which is worth a good deal more now than what I gave for it—I purchased a group in Italy, for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I value at 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have never purchased any<lb/>thing at 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I value at 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I never had such luck; if I had I should not object, if I was convinced it was honestly come by—I describe this as a Bristol cup and saucer which is extremely rare, from the fact that the manufacture of Bristol china lasted only a few years, and the history of it is well known—the coat-of-arms is the coat-of-anns of the celebrated Edmund Burke, and it was presented to him by Mr. Champion, the master of the works at Bristol, and there is an inscription to that effect; it was manufactured and painted at Bristol—I have known of several sales of old china at Wilkinson's, Sotheby's, and Christie's during many years—I have not known of a tea service sold for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and afterwards fetching 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I remember Mr. Lizardi's sale being advertised—I never heard of vases which he bought for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. selling for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know of four cups</p>

               <p>bought for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and selling for 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know of Mr. Werthiemer's buy. ing silver vases and figures for 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and selling them for 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or of a china service purchased for 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and selling for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know Captain Lee as a collector—I do not know of five plates that he used for dog's drinking troughs which he sold for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. fetching 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. immediately afterwards—I have not known Chelsea vases bought for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and selling for 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I have known them bought for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and sold for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have been in the habit of going about looking after old china at sales and curiosity shops to pick up a, good bargain at the lowest price—to the best of my belief I saw Mr. Jewell on one occasion at the sale where I purchased the cup and saucer it was a three days' sale—I saw him there the day the cup was sold—to the best of my belief he has returned to me the whole of the china that he received—the first time I went to his shop I saw the shopman, that is the gentleman (Mr. Jones), and when I came in half an hour afterwards I saw Mr. Jewell—he said he had bought a lot of rubbish of Clark when I told him that the Bristol cup and saucer and the figures were stolen from me, that was on the 19th instant—I think I stated before the Magistrate that he said he had bought a lot of rubbish, I am not quite sure, it is so long ago—he said "I have bought a lot of things not worth much," or "A lot of rubbish"—it may not have been those exact words, it was "A lot of things that are worthless" or "A lot of small value," or something of that sort—the ex<lb/>pression he used was that he bought them out of the street or from the street; that the man brought them in to him from the street—I under<lb/>stood his meaning to be that he had come in from the street casually and sold them to him—I did not see Mr. Mendoza in the shop when I first saw Mr. Jones—when I came back he was there and Mr. Jewell referred me to him as the purchaser of the china—I don't remember his saying that he should have much pleasure in showing them to me; he said he would show them to me—I am quite sure that the Shopman produced the Bristol figures out of a safe—I am quite sure they were not exposed for sale; they were not where I could see them—he produced them from under the desk where the safe was—I saw the safe afterwards in the same place where he brought them from—it was a desk about the middle of the shop, at the end of the first part of the china shop—it is not a regular counter, it is a desk where accounts are kept; it is a kind of double shop; there was a good deal of valuable property in the shop—I should think 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—the cup and saucer were produced out of the safe—I did not know Mr. Jones—I don't know whether he knew me, I don't think he did—I did not give him my name—I never bought anything of him—I had been to Jewell's shop once or twice before without purchasing—my motive in purchasing the Bow figure and the two plates was to take them away and to be able to swear that they were my property, and also to ascertain if they were ex<lb/>posed for sale—the Bow figure was in a cupboard, the two plates were on a side table—the cupboard had a glass front to it; it could be seen if you looked into it, without unlocking it—there were several other things with it; it was a small cabinet—I did not hint to Mr. Jones the first time I saw him that the cup was stolen—I was not at first quite sure that the cup and saucer were mine—there are others in existence, but very few—there was very strong evidence to my mind that they belonged to me, but I was not then aware that I had had one stolen from me—I was not quite sure till I saw the four Bristol figures, then I was quite certain—the possessors of these cups are all known, I have a list here of all of them—I got the in<lb/>formation</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187601310015"/>
               <p>from a friend—the group I saw at Mr. Wertheimer's was produced by him from the back of the shop on the second day, a friend of my wife's bad seen it there—the Bristol figures that I saw at Mr. Jewell's shop I had seen two or three days before—they were shown to me by Mr. George, of Albany Street—I did not then recognise them as mine—I was not then aware I had been robbed; it struck me they were very like mine, but I thought they might be a similar pair—they are uncommon, but there are others in existence—I don't think the group sold to Mr. Wertheimer had been redecorated—I think I gave 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I have said that Mr. Jewell rendered me assistance to recover all I have got—I believe everything Mr. Jewell had he has returned to me—when I told him on the 19th that these things had been stolen he said "I am extremely sorry to hear it; I had not the least idea they were stolen"—when I gave him into custody on the 22nd he said I should have to answer for it, and I believe he said he con<lb/>sidered my conduct harsh, or something of the kind, I don't remember the words.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I believe I saw George a day or two before the 19th—he had only the pair of Cupids with him—the Bristol cup that I have known sold for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was not at all like this—it depends entirely on the quality and the condition; if broken, of course they are valueless.</p>

I have acted as solicitor for Mr. Jewell, and for his father for nearly thirty years—I never heard anything contrary to the character of an honourable and honest man as regards Mr. Jewell—I issued the writ for him against Mr. Wertheimer—he intended to en<lb/>force that claim—of course if it had been resisted there must have been a public inquiry—when the cheque was stopped I issued the writ by Mr. Jewell's direction—I afterwards gave notice to Mr. Wertheimer not to answer to it, because I was going to return the china to Mr. Salting—that was after the first examination at Bow Street—Mr. Jewell came to me on the 20th, and said there had been a noise about the china he was buying—I said "Who have you been purchasing from?"—he said "A man that keeps a shop in the Edgware Road"—I said "What is he?"—he said "A dealer in china and all manner of things?"—I said "If you have bought of a shop-keeper you can't get into any trouble"—he said "They want to look at my books"—I said "I don't know that I should show them all my books, but I should ask them to refer to any particular items and refer to your books, but I should not like any detective or anybody else to overhaul all my books"—I gave him that advice on the 20th—he told me the shop-keeper had informed him that he had bought them from a lady who had been kept by a noble<lb/>man, that she had not seen him for eight or nine months, and she was dis<lb/>posing of different articles that she did not require, for the purpose of main<lb/>taining herself, as she did not know what had become of him—he said "Do you think I might buy them from the lady herself"—I said "Certainly not, you had much better buy them from the shop-keeper, because the gentleman may come back and complain of the lady selling his property."</p>

I carry on business at Hanway Street—I am a. dealer in china and antique furniture—I have been a dealer all my life—I have heard the various gentlemen examined, and I agree in their statements that it is a habit to buy china cheaply and sell it dearly—I saw a Bristol—tea service purchased for 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and it fetched 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in auction afterwards—I also know of a Worcester teapot being bought for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and sold afterwards for 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I am a furniture salesman—I know Mr. Jewell—1 went on the 19th October with a message for him to Mr. Mendoza—I was present on that date in Mr. Jewell's shop when Mr. Mendoza Mr. Salting, and Mr. Jewell were there—I did not know then who they were, but I do now—Mr. Jewell on that occasion asked me to take a parcel round to 27, Bloomsbury Squre—that was between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening—I found Mr. Mendoza, the old gentleman; he opened the door, and I said "I have brought a parcel from Mr. Jewell'"—I went on another errand that day for Mr. Jones; about an hour afterwards, but Mr. Mendoza was not at home the second time—I went back and told Mr. Jones.</p>

I am assistant to George Thompson, a pawnbroker, of 48, New North Road—I sleep on—the premises—on 7th January, about 11.30, I fastened up the house, and secured the first floor landing window by a catch—about 1.451 heard a dog bark, and awoke my fellow-servant—I went into a back room and heard a rattle springing—I stood at the street door and saw constable Doughty, who made a communication to me—I re<lb/>turned upstairs and he followed me—I then saw the prisoner with his legs and part of his legs and part of his body through—the window which I had secured over<lb/>night, and which was then open, there are bars inside the window, and there was a bradawl inserted in it to help it up—the policeman pulled the prisoner into the Tiouse—he said "'Help"—two constables came, and one of them went into the back yard and brought back the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> and dark Lin-tern—the prisoner said he would use the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> in self-defence.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">interpreted</hi>). I am an Italian, and am twenty-seven years of age—I have always been at sea since I was nine years old—in September, 1873, I was a seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Chiavari</hi>, a three-masted schooner, built of wood; I could not exactly say her tonnage—in September, 1873, we sailed from Buenos Ayres for Liverpool with fourteen hands on board, all told—on 14th November we were off the coast of Ireland, I was not on watch, I was down below—I heard the ship's bell ring about 4.30 or 5 o'clock in the morning—I went on deck as soon as I heard the bell and they called out below—the captain and crew were on deck—I saw another vessel a very short distance off, about 1 1/2 yards—we were on the port taek—she was on the starboard taek—she came into collision with us; I now know that vessel to be the <hi rend="italic">Oberon;</hi> she struck us amidship; as soon as she struck us the <hi rend="italic">Chiavari</hi> leaned on one side—the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> had all her sails set, they were drawing—we were carrying low sails—she struck us on the starboard side—it was dark, I could not exactly state what effect the collision had on our vessel; as soon as it took place I jumped on board the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi>—I did not notice the figure head of the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi>—her jibboom and bowsprit were right across the midships of our vessel—our people cried out "Help! help!" and called the Blessed Virgin to their aid—the collision gave a great shock, our vessel oscillated'a little and gave way to the other side—all our men were on deck at the time of the collision—I got onboard the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> by getting hold of the chain attached to the bowsprit—another fellow-seaman, Eugenie Giacomucci, also got on board—two or three other sailors were trying to do so, but they got hold of the jibboom, which broke away, and I believe they fell back on the <hi rend="italic">Chiavari</hi>—when we got on board the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> she backed out, that was a very short while after the collision, I could not state how long—I then saw our vessel, we could not see the whole of her, we could only just see the bulwarks—the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> put her sails aback and remained in that position, nothing further; she then went on the port</p>

               <p>tack—I did not hear any cries or anything said from our vessel as the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> was backing out—I saw our vessel for about ten minutes after I got on board the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi>, I could not exactly say the time—she was on the port side, I could not exactly see what became of her, she must have gone-down; I have never seen or heard of her since—we spoke to some one on board the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> and told them to lower the boats to render assistance; we were making signs with our hands to the sailors on board to lower the boats—I cannot speak any English—as soon as they put the sails of their vessel right they made us go into the captain's cabin—then sails were put so as to take the port taek—there was a strong wind—I found that the cook could understand some Italian—I found that out when we—were asked to go into the small cabin, when he brought us some coffee; that was about half or three quarters of an hour after the collision—we asked the cook to lower some boats so that we might go and give assistance to our companions—I afterwards saw the captain (<hi rend="italic">the defendant</hi>)—Giacomucci and the cook were with me—in the captain's presence the cook asked us some questions; I could not say exactly how long that was after the collision, it was about three quarters of an hour after—he asked us first the name of our vessel and then what damage was done to her—I said damage there was a good deal done, but I could not state what damage really was done to the vessel—the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> continued on the port tack about two or three hours; I could not state exactly, I had no watch—the captain afterwards called us to the poop, I could not state the time; we had then been on the starboard tack a little while—the captain asked us through the—cook if we had any casks on deck and what colour they were—we said they were painted white with black hoops—I did not see any casks in the sea—I had helped to stow the cargo of the <hi rend="italic">Chiavari</hi> at Buenos Ayres—we had barrels of tallow, bones and some hides on board—the tallow was in the hold, amidships—I saw some tallow on the prow of the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> close by the martingale when it was clear, in the morning and when we were on the port tack—the only damage I saw done to the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> was the jibboom, that was broken and the martingale was damaged—I believe she had a figure head—if the other sailors had had courage we could have lowered the boats and rendered assistance to the other sailors—the weather was not very good, it was bad weather; the sea was rather roughish—nothing was done on board the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> to assist the <hi rend="italic">Chiavari</hi> after the collision—we afterwards arrived in Liverpool—I stayed there forty-seven days—the <hi rend="italic">Chiavari</hi> never arrived there and was never heard of afterwards—some time after the Board of Trade inquiry I went back to Italy—I arrived in London last Saturday—I was brought from Mar<lb/>seilles in an Italian man-of-war.</p>

               <p>they took the sails away, because it was very bad weather—she was going right before the wind—when there is a desire to lower the boats to save people's lives it does not matter what sea there is on—I mean to swear that they could have pulled a ship's boot against the wind for half a mile that night; if we could have seen the vessel we might have done so—as soon us they stopped her sternway they set-to to clear away the wreck, the gear of the bowsprit, and one thing and another at her bow—she was on the port tack while they were clearing away, she was sailing—they did not put her on the port tack to go after the other ship; theyput her on the port tack so as to get out of the way—our vessel was on the port tack at the time of the collision, sailing by the wind—I do not remember how the wind was; when the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> went on the port tack I could not say whether it was the same tack that our vessel was on, they took their own course—she was close hauled on the port tack—we had some sails up at the time of the collision, but very small ones; we were under very low sails—we earned square sails on one mast only—the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> took off the greater part of his canvas when he went on the port tack, he went away on the port tack under very low canvas—the reason why I think he was running away from our ship is, because he went on the port tack—I thought so the very mo<lb/>ment that he put on the port tack—we gave a hand with the ropes to get her on the port tack—we ought to have gone on the starboard tack to have gons in search of our vessel—I did not think it was to go in search of our vessel—I was examined at Liverpool about two years ago, I do not write, I did not put a mark to my deposition that I remember, or remember its being read over to me—no doubt we were on deck rendering assistance, but it was not to go round to the other vessel—I did not swear at Liverpool that I lent a hand at the ropes, and that I thought the manoeuvres were made to go round to our vessel—I think it was to go away from her—we were help<lb/>ing to try to keep the vessel on the port tack—when the collision took place they could not do otherwise than put her on the port tack—the ma<lb/>noeuvres could not have been intended to help those on our vessel—I did say so—I first formed an opinion that our vessel had sunk when we heard nothing of her, when we got to Liverpool—we could not see whether she had gone down or not, but we could not see anything of her—I did not know whether she was damaged below the water line or not, I could not exactly say what damage was done—I do not know what Giacomucci said, he is here, he can answer for himself—I did not hear him say so to the captain when we were called aft to him—the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> stood on the port tack until the morning—if we were on the port tack, how could we have been on the look-out for the <hi rend="italic">Chiavari</hi>, they were not looking for her—it was before midday that they put on the starboard tack, I cannot say the hour, it was when he put the vessel again on the starboard tack that he asked about the casks—that was before midday; after we had sailed a little while on the starboard tack—it is impossible for me to judge how far we had sailed, I do not think we had got back to the place of collision, it is impossible for me to say—it was a strong blow that struck our ship, very heavy, because she leaned on the other side—I said at Liverpool that it was a good blow, I did not say "very heavy," if the'interpreter added words, I don't know—I could not say whether our vessel sailed away for some dis<lb/>tance on the port tack after the collision, because we could not see her, the last time I saw her was about ten minutes after the collision, I could not see the vessel, it was so dark we could not see her lights, they carried</p>

I told the captain that the foremast of our vessel had fallen—I was examined at Liverpool, I believe we said some<lb/>thing about it then, but I do not remember exactly—our foreyard came down before the mast—it must have come down before—I could not speak English, and the captain could not speak Italiau—what was said was through the cook's interpretation—I believe I spoke about the foremast having come down—I remember perfectly well to have said something about it—I am certain I did—I swear that the foremast did fall—the fore<lb/>mast is in three pieces, and not all of it fell—it was the fore part of it that came down, the top of the foretopmast—she had not a foretop gallant mast—we had five sails altogether, two on the foremast, and two on the foretop—it was only the foretop mast that came down, not the foremast—I was on deck as watch a long while before the collision, we were on the port tack, close hauled, with our sails to the wind—I could not say what wind it was—the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> was sailing on the starboard tack—I could not say in what direction our vessel was heading by the compass, I was not at the helm—the green light I saw was on the starboard side, I saw it from the poop—I first saw the green light, and then the red light—I swear I saw the green light on our starboard side—our vessel was close hauled, only going very slowly—the lights of the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> could be seen—I think she was run<lb/>ning free when I saw the green light, running before the wind—as soon as the collision took place the <hi rend="italic">Oberon's</hi> sails were a back—I mean soon after the collision, I could not see at the moment of the collision—I could not swear whether the <hi rend="italic">Chiavari</hi> went down at the time or not, but of course as there has been nothing beard of her since I came to that conclusion—I never saw her afterwards—I certainly believed that she had gone down from the collision, while I was on board the <hi rend="italic">Oberon;</hi> before daylight she must have gone down—I did not tell anybody on board the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> that if she had</p>

I was cook on board the <hi rend="italic">Oberon;</hi> it was my first voyage in her from Liverpool to Calcutta—I was on deck from 4 a.m. till 8 p.m.—on the morning of the 14th November, when we were off the coast of Ire<lb/>land, I was on deck; we were on the starboard tack—I can't exactly say how we were heading; we were close by the wind—about 4.45 or thereabouts I saw the green light of a vessel approaching us; it afterwards turned out to be the <hi rend="italic">Chiavari</hi>—we saw her light between twelve and fifteen minutes—the captain was sent for shortly before the collision; he came on deck as soon as he was called—the second mate called him—I should say he was on deck two or three minutes before the collision occurred—the second mate gave orders to the man at the wheel to keep her close to the wind—when the captain first came on deck he was on the poop; I can't say how long he remained there; his orders were to let go the lee sheets—the" <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> struck the <hi rend="italic">Chiavari</hi> about midships, I should say; I don't remember on which side—I heard the crash of our jibboom going; that was all I heard; it was carried away, broken—I did not see what happened to the <hi rend="italic">Chiavari;</hi> I was standing on the main hatch at the time—after the colli<lb/>sion our yards were backed—our sails were aback at the time of the collision—I should say we went astern about half a mile—all our sails were backed—the wind was carrying us aback rapidly—I did not hear what orders were given to the helmsman; the yards were braced; the first order was to clew up the topgallant sails and courses—by getting our sails down and bracing the yards, that would bring her on the port tack; that was done when we</p>

               <p>had got about half a mile, I should say, by the rate we were going; them we stood on the port tack—we were only under topsails then; the other sails were clewed up; they remained clewed up until we got our wreckage in, our head-gear under the bow—when we had got that in we stood on on the same tack—I don't remember that we put more sail on, it is so long ago, and I did not pay much atteution at the time—I could not say what sail we set; it is not part of my business to set the sails, or to be on deck—I should be in the galley at that time attending to my duty—I did not keep any watch—I could not say how long we remained on the port tack, we remained on it till daylight—we then went about on the starboard tack; that was daylight, some time after the collision—we remained on the starboard tack for some time—I did not see the <hi rend="italic">Chiavari</hi> when our sails were aback, and we were going astern; I did not look—I was in the galley at the time, after the collision—I was in and out on the deck—I did not pay any particular attention to the collision; I saw the collision—after we had got astern a certain distance I went into the galley—after a time I heard that there were two men aboard of us from the other vessel; we were going aback when I heard that—they spoke to me—I speak some Italian, fluently enough to understand what is said to me—it must have been about twenty minutes after the collision when I first saw them—some of our men said there were two foreigners aboard, and I went and saw them and took them into the galley and gave them some coffee—the captain sent for them, and I went with them; that must have been fully half an hour after the collision—at that time we were standing on the port tack; I am sure of that—I interpreted for them—the captain told me to ask them if they thought their vessel was seriously damaged—I did so; they said they did not think she was seriously damaged below the water, below the deck—I told the men that—the captain asked what she was loaded with—they said with tallow, bones, and hides, and she was bound from Buenos Ayres; that was all that was said at that time—about two hours after, as near as I could judge, the captain sent for me to ask them if they had any water casks on deck—it was daylight then—they said she had two casks on deck—the captain asked what colour—they said they were painted white, with black hoops—the captain said he thought they were painted lead colour-instead of white; he said he saw the casks in the water just about the time that I was there—I did not see them; I understood that he had seen them just before he had sent for me—I think we were on the starboard tack then—I could not say how long we had been so—I don't remember whether the ship had gone about just before I was sent for—we must have gone about again—I don't understand the working of the ship—that was all that was said at that time, we were about sixteen sailors in crew—our cargo was grain—before the collision we had all plain sails set—I should say we had been on the port tack about half an hour or twenty minutes before the men were brought to me; I could not say the exact time—I can't say how long it was after we went on the port tack before we got in our wreckage—after the collision I saw nothing of the <hi rend="italic">Chiavari.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BUTT</hi>. I first saw the <hi rend="italic">Chiavari's</hi> green light; that would be on the port bow, about two points and a half, I should say—I should say she never was on cur starboard bow before the collision—I don't think they could see our green light when they were two points and a half on our port bow—I should say they were screened in the usual way—our red light would be full in view and not our green light, that being on our port bow—I did not feel any shock on board; of course a vessel striking you</p>

               <p>that way with a great shock would throw you off your feet—our sails were backed to clear us of the other ship—we got a stern way on, and the courses were clewed up, and we let go the maintopgallant sails—men were sent aloft to furl them, and I distinctly heard the captain order them to keep a look<lb/>out for the other vessel—I did not hear him inquire of them whether they had been able to see her—I can't say whether any of the other hands were looking after her; I did not see—the Italian sailors said nothing to me about one of their masts having come down, or their foretop mast; I am sure of that—there was no one else on board that could speak Italian; there was a Frenchman, they were conversing with him; I don't know his name, he was one of the crew—I am sure they never mentioned it when we were with the captain; all their mention was about the foreyard, they said they thought that was gone; I think that was said before the captain, I am not sure—I did not see enough of the vessel to see how she was rigged—we had sixteen sailors on board, besides the officers and apprentices; I don't know the number exactly.</p>

                  </hi>. I was carpenter on board the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi>—on the morn<lb/>ing of the collision, about 4.30 or 5 o'clock, I turned out of my bunk—all hands had been called on deck—I saw a vessel coming on our port bow—I saw her green light—I was on the deck when the collision took place—I con<lb/>sider we struck the other about amidships—I did not feel much of a shock on our vessel—I felt the jibboom going—I went to-get aft out of the road in case the fore topgallant mast came down in consequence of the collision—I afterwards went forward to the forecastle head; that was just imme<lb/>diately after the collision—I saw the two Italian sailors climbing on board the best way they could—I called out there were two men coming on board, and I called for the assistance of the other crew to stand by me, and the boatswain and one of the crew came to assist them if they required assistance—the captain, I suppose, might be aft or on the main deck, I can't exactly swear where he was—we backed out and went astern—the instant the captain was called on deck he gave orders to let go the lee after braces to deaden the ship's way, to stop the way; and he ordered the topsail and the fore topgallant halliards to be let go; that was when we actually struck—I heard that order distintly given; in fact, he went himself and let go—I did not hear anything about the helm—directly her lee braces were let go her yards were swung and she would deaden a little and come round on the port tack—as soon as we backed out I went and sounded the fore com<lb/>partment; I found it tight—I then sounded the main pumps and found they were making no water—I dare say I might have reported that to the captain or the mate—I went to assist in getting the yards hauled round to get the vessel round on the port tack, and she was brought round on the port tack—a portion of our flying jibboom was carried away and the jibboom was hanging overboard in the water and all the head gear broken and gone; the martingale had gone—that might be the principal cause of the jibboom going, according to my judgment, by catching the other vessel's bulwarks—after the collision I saw the other vessel, she was standing just across our bow either a half or a quarter of a point to port, that was immediately after the collision—I don't know how long after; I</p>

               <p>don't suppose it was more than a minute or a minute and a half—I felt the crash of the jibboom going, and I went forward in an instant—she seemed to me to be all right, what I saw of her the instant after the collision—I did not see anything gone, no more than her main-top mast staysail, that was all I saw gone—I did not see what became of her, we were making great stern way—I did not see her afterwards—a considerable time afterwards my attention was called to a piece of tallow about 3 inches in diameter, just as if it had been thrown on the stern—I think we went round the starboard tack when my attention was called to that—it was well into daylight—I could not say whether our stem had cut into the ship—I did not think the vessel had been hurt—I did not know till after I en<lb/>quired of the cook what their vessel was loaded with, and he said with tallow, but I could not say where it came from—we had four boats on the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi>—the two forward boats were life-boats—the two would hold about fifty people and the others about thirty in a case of emergency—they were in good condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We got a good sternway on and after the collision I think we went astern for about half a mile, or perhaps three-quarters—we went to leeward—if we had lowered one of the life-boats, I don't believe the men could have pulled it half a mile to windward on that night, because they would have the wind and sea against them—there was a very rough sea on at the time, and what you might call a stiff topgallant sail breeze, I saw some men go aloft to furl the topgallant sails, and I heard the order given to keep a look out if they could see the other vessel—I believe the captain gave that order, and when they came down he asked them if anything was seen of the vessel, and they said no, I heard it said distinctly that they saw nothing of the other vessel—when I last saw her she was on the port tack, on the same tack as when we came into collision—she was a little on our port bow, about a quarter of a point when I last saw her, more on the port bow than right ahead from what I could see of her—I considered she was not seriously damaged; of course it was rather dark—I don't know which way the wind was, I don't understand it; I can't say which way she was heading—we were on the starboard tack before the collision; afterwards we went on the port tack that was the same tack as the other vessel when I last saw her—I should think that was the best chance of finding the other vessel, I was as anxiously looking out for her, I should say as any indi<lb/>vidual on board.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I was anxiously looking out to see if I could see her, which I dare say a good many individuals on board, besides myself were also doing—not because I thought she might have been seriously damaged, "merely just to see if I could see anything of her—I can't say that I thought she was seriously damaged, I did not think so, and I should be going against toy own judgment to say so—if she had been seriously damaged the captain may have stood away on the port tack as he did—he could not have done more than he did do—if he had thought she was sinking when we struck her it would have been right to go on the port tack—I consider the captain did what was right in coming round on the same tack as the other vessel, I am not supposed to be the judge of that—he came round on the port tack to give every assistance he possibly could to the vessel he was in collision with—this was my second voyage in a sailing vessel, I have not been above three years at sea altogether, I don't profess to be a nautical man; I was carpenter of the ship—I was doing my utmost in looking over</p>

               <p>the side of the vessel shortly after the collision, while we were going round—I saw her at last a little on our port bow, and then I went on my duties—I last saw her just an instant after the collision; I saw no more of her, because I went to sound the fore compartment and the main pumps, then all hands were called to attend to the braces, to get the yards hauled round, and I went to assist—the first thing to be done was to get the vessel brought to the wind again, to bring her round on the port tack—I think that was the first thing that was done.</p>

After she was got round on the port tack her courses were clewed up, and the topgallant sails, and she was kept under the two lower top<lb/>sails, close hauled to the wind—her topgallant sails were furled, and the large lower sails were clewed up, so that she would go very slowly on the port tack.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant clerk to the Borough Magistrates at Liverpool—I was present at the Court of Inquiry held at Liverpool, on the 13tb, 14th, and 15th December, 1873, it was a Board of Trade inquiry before the Magistrate, and two nautical assessors—after the witnesses had been examined the solicitor for the defendant put in a statement which he signed, this is it.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">This was put in and read; after some preliminary statement relative to the voyage, it proceeds to narrate the circumstances of the collision, as follows</hi>: "At about 5.30 I was called by the second officer who reported a green light on our port bow. I instantly went on deck and saw a green light from two to three points on lee bow. I directly ordered the man at the wheel to keep the ship close to the wind, reducing the speed from seven knots to about three, and the second officer to go forward to see if he could make out what the ship was doing. At this time we had a fresh breeze from S.E., ship headed E.N.E., wind increasing fast. About ten minutes after, seeing that the light was drawing very near and not showing her red light, and that a collison was inevitable, I ordered the helm hard down and the lee after braces to be let go, which was done immediately, and the main and cross jack yards immediately swung round. About the same time we came into collision with a three masted vessel, when all the sails were a back. I ordered the topgallant halyards to be let go, the ship backed astern directly. I never felt the slightest shock. The only thing I heard was the crash of our jibboom. Our ship having good stern away, I ordered the helm to be reversed, or hard a starboard, and the ship payed off to starboard; We got the yards hauled round and brought the ship to wind on the port tack, hauled up the courses and clewed up topgallant sails. I lost sight of the other vessel about five minutes after we separated. She was then about two points before our port beam. I considered that she must be still on the port tack I did not hear a sound from the other ship during the collision, either before or after, neither were any lights or signals of distress or sign of distress seen or reported. A ship at this time without any light could not be seen above 500 yards off. As soon as the ship was trimmed to the wind I ordered four hands to furl the topgallant sails and the rest to clear away the wreck forward. Carpenter to sound the pumps. Found the ship tight and the jibboom jibs and all head gear towing under the bows endangering the topmast and topgallant mast. Directly after we separated I called to the steward to know what time it was. He reported 6.20. Shortly after he reported to me that there were two of the vessel's men on board and that they were Italians and that the cook could understand them a little.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187601310048"/>
               <p>I sent for them and the cook directly and questioned them through the cook as to what the vessel was, where she was from and where bound, and partic<lb/>ularly whether she had received any serious damage. They replied she was the <hi rend="italic">Java</hi> (as we understood) from Buenos Ayres bound to Liverpool and that they did not think she was damaged below the decks—they also said that they were standing off the land under easy sail waiting for daylight the captain intending to bear up for Queenstown. When the hands were sent up to furl the mizen topgallant sails I ordered them to give a good look round to try if they could see anything of the vessel or any lights. When they came down I asked if they had seen anything and they said no, I myself was looking out on the poop all the time and a look out on the forecastle as well. At daylight about 7.30, blowing a strong breeze; thick and dirty, I judged that a vessel might have been seen three-quarters or a mile off; I then held a consultation with the chief officer and we concluded that she must have gone on the other tack. I then gave orders to wear ship, we having been under three topsails going very close to the wind about half a knot an hour since we parted. All the gear being cleared away and the mast secured got the ship round on the starboard tack and set the foresail. At 9 o'clock sent all hands to breakfast; at 10. blowing a strong topsail breeze and cloudy weather. Seeing nothing of the vessel. I had another consultation with the chief office and we considered that she must have borne up for Queenstown; we continued our search. At about 11 a.m., I saw two casks in the water. I sent for the cook and the two men and asked them whether they had any casks on deck; if so, what colour were they painted. They replied they had two painted white with black hoops. We continued our search; at 1 p.m., saw the land, bearing north; at 3 saw the Hook Light House, bearing N.E., distant about 3 miles, wind E, strong breeze, tacked ship, arrived off Holyhead at 5 p.m. on the 19th and took a steam tug for Liverpool and arrived in the Mersey at 9 a.m. on the 18th November. During the time I have been a master, I never had a col<lb/>lision or an accident of any description; I never had to make a claim on the underwriters except when my vessel was damaged in the Bay of Bengal and afterwards when damaged in the Arabian Sea being caught on both occasions in a Typhoon.

I am an eating-house keeper, of 43, Bethnal Green Road—on Saturday, 20th September, the prisoner, who had been in my employ a month as extra man, was boneing meat at the back of the shop about 1 p.m.—I told him he was doing it very slowly and badly and wast<lb/>ing the meat, and he threw the things off the table, bones and all manner of things—I <hi rend="italic">blowed</hi> him up for it, and he swore at me—I went to serve my customers in the shop and afterwards had my tea—I then went behind the counter, and about G.20 the prisoner came to me and said "You b——what have you to say to me?"—I told him to go away about his work or I would send for a policeman and have him taken away—he went away from the</p>

               <p>front of the counter, where he was standing, to a settle and stayed there a few minutes—he then took bis blue smock off, threw it down, and came to the counter with his shirt sleeves tucked up on both arms; he had nothing in his hands—he came behind the counter and pushed up against me—I pushed him back twice—he came a third time, and as I went to push him away again I received a dreadful blow under my left arm—he got away from me then and came back, and then I saw this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his right hand in the attitude of striking—I put my left hand up to ward off the blow and it cut the palm of my hand nearly in half—I felt blood fast running down my body from where I had been struck under my arm, and cried out "I have been stabbed!"—the prisoner was held down and I was taken upstairs.</p>

I am a surgeon of 180, High Street, Shore<lb/>ditch—about about 6.30 on this evening I saw the prosecutor at his own house—he was excessively low, fainting, and prostrate, bleeding from a wound on his left side, which commenced about an inch below the armpit, and extended downwards, and a little backwards, it was two inches wide and six or seven inches long—such a knife as this would produce it—if the knife had entered laterally it would have wounded the lungs, and he would have died, and if it had entered one inch lower down death must have en<lb/>sued—he went on fairly for a fortnight, erysipelas then set in, and his life was in danger—the inside of his left hand was cut across, and his right hand was out just a little—I have attended him ever since, and he is still far from well.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 9, South Street, Pentonville Road—on the 20th December I met Evans and' another woman in Pentonville Road, outside the Builders' Arms—Evans stood outside the door with some<lb/>thing in her hand, I could not see what; she uttered an oath that she would do for that <hi rend="italic">sod</hi> to-night, looking in at the public-house door—I turned and looked, and saw the prosecutor and the other prisoner come out fighting—Clark and the prosecutor were striking, and one or two were fighting with them—both the male prisoners struck the prosecutor, but I did not see him strike anyone—I saw the whole of them fall down, but cannot say who was undermost—while Lodge was down Evans deliberately came up and said "Take that, you <hi rend="italic">sod,"</hi> and made a motion of stabbing three or four times; she had something in her hand—Lodge got up and dropped his arm, and blood ran down his coat-sleeve—the three prisoners all walked away together—as I passed the door I saw something dark in Evans' hand, but I cannot say whether it was a key or a knife.</p>

I live at 99, Euston Street, and am a baker—I was opposite the Builders' Arms, and saw Lodge and the male prisoners come out together; they were striking Lodge, and he was defending himself, as well as I could see—he was knocked down on the pavement—Smith was on top of him and Clark was alongside of him and kicked him on his side while he was down—Evans then got down on her knees and put something into him; I could not see whether she had a knife because it was a dark night, but she said "Take that" repeatedly—when he got up the blood rushed down his arm, and he staggered and fell on his back; I thought he was dead—the three prisoners went away together, and I followed them across the under<lb/>ground railway, got a policeman, explained the case to him, and he went with me; they went through the underground railway station, which is a thoroughfare, and into Gray's Inn Road, when the male prisoners went, I think it was through Dudley-Street, and Evans branched off to the left—the policeman and I brought Smith and Clark back, and Evans came back of her own accord; they said that they had done nothing—I told them they would be obliged to come back with the policeman and me to find out what was done—the police saw the pavement covered with blood, and of course they took them to the station.</p>

I live with my father at Old Pye Street, Westminster—the prisoner and I had been acquainted for two years he was paying bis addresses <hi rend="italic">to me</hi>—on 14th December. I was with him in Jeffrey's public-house—we left there between 10 and 11 o'clock p.m. and went to another public-house; and about 11 or 11.30 o'clock we were in Old Pye Street standing close together at the corner—he put his arm round my neck and struck me a violent blow on my side by the force of which I fell on the ground—I do not remember anything after I fell, but I got up, crossed over the road, went into my own house and into Mrs. Burke's room and complained of a pain in my left side—Mrs. Burke said that she saw blood coming from my dress, and I was taken to Westminster Hospital where I was undressed and examined by a surgeon—I am an indoor patient there still—I had had words with the prisoner two or three nights before—I appointed to meet him at my place and disappoiuted him, and he charged</p>

I came from Ireland this morning—I am brother to the first wife of the prisoner—they lived together for about six years, and then went to Australia, I believe—he left her in Australia and went to California—she returned to her father's house, and lived with him for two or three years until he died—she then, having no place to go to and no one to support her, resided with me at my house for a year and a half—there were three children born, and she was left with two in. A-istralia—the prisoner returned from California to London about two years ago and visited his wife at my house—his excuse was that he was looking for an appointment fa London—there was frequent correspondence between them—I pressed upon her to go to London to see what he was doing; she did so, and they met—they lived together again for probably a month on and off—he then deserted her, and she was obliged to return to Ireland—her property was settled upon her, it was very small—she returned to Dublin, not to my house, in February or March, 1875, survived about six or seven months, and then died in September—the children are alive—I heard of the second marriage last April for the first time—I am informed that the proceedings were instituted by Dean Dickenson, who, hearing her case, made an applica<lb/>tion to the solicitor in Ireland.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of the last witness—I am now living with her—in 1874 Yurgense came to live there under the name of Ahlborn—Soisson used to cohie there to see him—I believe Ahlborn had an office in Regent Street, No. 20—I have been with him there—in February last year I had a disagreement with my mother and went to live at Hatfield Street, Blackfriars—Ahlborn used to visit me there, and during the last week he lived with me there; we then went together to 95, Borough Road; while there he used to receive letters in the name of Ahlborn, foreign and English letters—I have been to the Post Office in Dover Road with Ahlborn and Soisson when they fetched letters from there; they were addressed to H. Stone, Post Office, Dover Road—at that time they had an office at 15, Queen Street, Cheapside—I have been there and have seen both the prisoners there—I have been there alone for letters at Alhborn's request; I believe they were foreign letters—I removed from the Borough Road to 3, Spencor Street, Clerkenwell—Ahlborn lived there with me also, and Soisson used to come there to see him sometimes, not very often—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my writing; I wrote it at Ahlborn's request. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "1st, September, 1875" (addressed to Mr. Wagner, of Paris, and signed, 'Albor Yuigense and Co., per proouration.') "We are in possession of your</p>

(<hi rend="italic">There were for bracelets, and articles of wearing apparel and furniture.</hi>) I believe they wanted the money—when I was living in Spencer Street, I recollect going with both the prisoners to the Waterloo Station—they said they were going to Paris; I saw them start together in the train—I can't recollect the date, it was the third day after we were in Spencer Street—when they were together they spoke in German or Dutch; I was not able to understand them—the endorsement "Albor Yurgense &amp; Co." on this bill of exchange I believe to be Ahlborn's writing—I cannot see the signature on this (<hi rend="italic">marked F</hi> 1) it is too much obliterated—the endorsement on these two bills (K and L) I believe to be Ahlbon's; also the signature "Albor Yurgense &amp; Co." to these letters (<hi rend="italic">looking at a number marked B D, I</hi> 1 <hi rend="italic">to I</hi> 13, <hi rend="italic">omitting</hi> 7, <hi rend="italic">also M and N</hi>)—the signature "J.

Channon"—the signature "Albor Yurgense &amp; Co.," at the bottom is Ahlborn's writing—this other bill (A Q) drawn by J. Channon, is my writing, also the endorsement, I did that at Ahlborn's request—the other endorsement "Albor Yurgense &amp; Co.," is Ahlborn's—this other bill(A S, 1) is drawn and endorsed by "H. Soisson"—those signatures look like Soisson's writing, also this A S 2 and A S 4; it is the same handwriting—the endorsements "Albor Yurgense &amp; Co." are Ahlborn's—the drawer's and endorser's signature to A S 5, I believe to be Ahlborn's, also to A S 6 and 7—the signature to this letter (A G) from Albor Yurgense &amp; Co. to Messrs. Durrschmidt is Ahlborn's—I have seen this cheque-book (A C) in Ahlborn's possession, either in Spencer Street, or the Borough Road, the endorsement "Albor Yurgense "to this bill of exchange (B J) I balieve to be Alhborn's.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This acknowledged the receipt of the bills, and stated they had been sent on, and as soon as they received the necessary reply a remittance would be sent</hi>) On 22nd July, I wrote this (H), stating that I required 2,500 francs to pay some accounts, and desiring to know if I could reckon upon the same by the 31st—I then received letter I 2, dated 24th July, stating they could not assure the remittance by the 31st, this being a first transaction but that in all future transactions a settlement would be effected at once—on the 7th August I wrote this: "It is now more than a mouth since I have sent you my acceptances, and I am still waiting impatiently for the proceeds of same. Let me know by re<lb/>turn of post what 1 am to think, as I should like to be made easy about it as soon as possible"—on the 12th August I received this. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that they had not yet received an answer from their correspondent, but would next week send the acceptances or the value.</hi>) About this time I received a tele<lb/>gram from Messrs. Robert de Millan, which I have lost; it was asking me whether I had accepted a bill for 1,605 francs to Messrs. Albor Yur<lb/>gense &amp; Co.—I answered by telegram, and on the 14th August I wrote this letter to Albor Yurgense &amp; Co. (<hi rend="italic">This inquired the meaning of the telegram from M. Robert, and urging the remittance of the proceeds of the acceptances.</hi>) On the 17th August I received this letter from Albor Yurgense &amp; Co. (<hi rend="italic">This referred to the telegram as merely a request to know if the acceptances were genuine, and stated that they were still waiting for a definite reply from their correspondent.</hi>) Between the 17th and 23rd of August I received letters from Messrs. Chantrain &amp; Co., of Brussels, with reference to my acceptance of 2,494 francs—on the 23rd I wrote this letter to Yurgense and Co. in reference to Messrs. Chantrain's application, and stating that unless I re<lb/>ceived a favourable reply by return I should apply elsewhere and cancel the transaction—I then received this letter of the 24th August (<hi rend="italic">This stated that' the bill for</hi> 2,494 <hi rend="italic">francs had been entered to their credit on Mr. Wagner's account, but that the other bill had been returned, and asking to be informed whether they should send the equivalent of the first bill or wait for a further reply as to the other.</hi> On the 25th August I wrote requesting them at once to send me the proceeds of the 2,494 francs bill—on the 29th August I received this letter enclosing these two bills, one for 987 francs 50 cents due on the 10th October, and one for 1,426 francs 75 cents due on the 16th October at Brussels, and stating that they hoped in a few days to receive a favourable reply as to the 1,605 francs, upon which a bill for the same would be re<lb/>mitted—the first of these two bills is drawn by Perelly &amp; Co., 83, Rue I'Echiquier; I have searched and can find no such persons, and there is no No. 83 in the street; there are only fifty houses—the bill is endorsed "Pay to the order of Messrs. Perelly &amp; Co.; valued received. Glasgow, Tassie &amp; Co."—the other bill is drawn by Cohen &amp; Tober, no address, accepted by C. Wagner—I never got a penny for that bill, it was returned to me; they were worthless bills—on the 30th August I returned them to Yurgense &amp; Co. in this letter, stating that in default of a satisfactory reply I should take means to regain possession of my acceptances—on the 1st September I received this letter (I 7 <hi rend="italic">already read</hi>), and on the 3rd September another to the same effect—I then received this of the 7th September enclosing two bills amounting together to 2,155 francs 65 cents on Amsterdam and Brus<lb/>sels, and on the 8th September I replied, enclosing the bills and demanding the return of my acceptances—I never got any money, I got back the</p>

               <p>smaller bill—Messrs. Chantrain threatened to make me a bankrupt if I did not pay the bill, and I paid it and received it from them—on the 16th October I came to London, and the City authorities took the matter up—when I sent my bills I believed that Yurgense &amp; Co. were financial agents carrying on a business; I would not have parted with my bills otherwise.</p>

About October and November I and Trafford had observation of the prisoners movements—on 25th November I went with Mr. Wagner and Trafford to Spencer Street, Clerk-enwell—I saw Yurgense come out of No. 3—he went into a Post Office, I followed him and he was given into my custody by Mr. Wagner—the bill marked F was shown to him, and he said "That is my signature"—I took him to the station, searched him, and found on him a military certificate exempting Carl Frederick Ahlborn from service—I went to 15, Queen Street, on the second floor, the name "Albor Yurgense and Co," was painted on the door—the room is 9 feet long and 4 feet wide—I made a search and found some envelopes which I produce, with "Albor Yurgense &amp; Co." printed at the top—that was the whole of the property there except a letter or two, a table and a chair—"Albor Yurgense &amp; Co., financial agents, 15, Queen Street, London, E.C." is on the letters—I found this bill (B J) there—I afterwards went to 3, Spencer Street, a bedroom and sitting room on the first floor—I found Miss Channon there—I made a search there and found six dozen aluminum pencil cases, twenty pawn tickets, twelve of them relating to new opera glasses and the other eight to wearing apparel—I also found these two bills of exchange (K and L), and a good deal of unused note paper headed "C. Ahlborn, 20, Regent Street," also the whole of the correspondence from Mr. Wagner which has been read, and these letters from Chantrain &amp; Co., of Brussels, marked P 1 to P 8—since then I have been to Brussels and to Messrs. Chantrain's offices—I there saw ten letters in the letter book, signed "Albor Yurgense &amp; Co., and headed 15, Queen Street"—they were torn out of the letter book in my presence, and I initialled them—I have since received them from Messrs. Chantrain by post—I produce a letter book that was at Spencer Street, and in that are copies of the letters that I received from Messrs. Chantrian. (<hi rend="italic">This correspondence consisted of applications on the part of Albor Yurgense &amp; Co., to Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer of 67, St. Mary Axe—I know the prisoner Yurgense as Ahlborn—on 23rd September he brought me a parcel of Belgian leather which he said he had purchased in Paris and found that he could not realise what he had given for it—he instructed me to sell it, and requested an advance on it—I advanced him 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Bold the leather which realised 74<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. after deducting the commission.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Yurgense's Defence.</hi> I never gave myself out as a financial agent, but I said there was a certain small commission I could make upon the trans<lb/>action; everything said was as the medium between the two parties, through me the transaction was to be concluded. Mr. Wagner-has told you that as to giving money there never was any such transaction—as soon as I found out that a misunderstanding had arisen between Mr. Wagner and me on that point, I immediately took the necessary steps to withdraw the bill, and refund it to him—what I say now will be proved as you can see by the letters of Wagner, and I hope you will see that that is the case, and then I may depend upon being acquitted on this charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business as the proprietor of some Turkish baths at King's Cross—I am a member of Tattersals and make books on races—sometime before February, 1873, I had been acquainted with a man named Vere—we had had betting transactions together, and I had lent him a sum of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for which he gave me a promissory note—he called on me in February, 1875, and on 23rd March, I attended at some offices at 52, Chan<lb/>cery Lane—prior to that, in February, 1875, I had been introduced by Vere to the prisoner—he introduced him to me as Mr. Rees, his solicitor—in consequence of that representation, I handed to Vere certain sums of money; I did not advance it on the guarantee produced—this letter was not shown to me; I never saw it before I saw it at the police-court—on 23rd March, I had an interview with the prisoner and Vere, at 52, Chan<lb/>cery Lane—I went there with Vere and saw the defendant there—I believed him to be Mr. Rees, the solicitor, as he had been previously introduced to me—Vere said in his presence that he wanted to borrow 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of me, and would Mr. Rees be guarantee for him—I cannot give the exact words, but that was the meaning of it—he said he would—I said they must go to my solicitor, Mr. Apps, and have the business transacted there—Vere and I went to Mr. Apps, and I had a conversation with him in Vere's presence—Mr. Apps went back with us to Rees' office—there was no one in, we waited there a few minutes and then the prisoner came in—Vere said to Mr. Apps "this is Mr. Rees," meaning Johnson—Johnson assented, he did not say anything to the contrary—Mr. Apps asked him if it was true that he, Rees received 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year on Mr. Vere's account—he said "Yes" it was—he then asked him if he would accept the bill with Vere—he said he would do anything to oblige Mr. Vere—Mr. Apps then drew out this promissory note. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "March 23rd, 1875, four months' after date I [<hi rend="italic">altered to</hi> "we"], promise to pay to Mr. Robert Vere on his order 260<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for value received. Thomas Rees &amp; Co. Payable at 52, Chancery Lane.") I know nothing about the "I" being altered to "we"—the prisoner signed "Thomas Rees &amp; Co."—I handed to him a cheque for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., ho had previously had 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from me, and 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he promised me for the accommodation—this (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) is my cheque for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I was induced to part with it by the prisoner representing himself to be Rees, Vere's solicitor, and I thought he was so, I thought it was quite right, as I asked the prisoner when I first went to the office how long he had been Vere's solicitor, and he said two years, and that he paid Vere 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for two years—the 260<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. pro<lb/>missory note was never paid—subsequently, in April, a fresh application for money was made to me by Vere, while the promissory note was still running; I attended again with Vere at the office of Rees &amp; Co.—I there saw the defendant—I said "How do you do," and he said "Very well thank you," and he appeared to know what business we had come on—Vere said that I had come to lend him 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.: I asked Rees if he would accept a bill,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187601310070"/>
               <p>and he said "Yes"—a bill was drawn (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I do not know whose writing it is, but this is the prisoner's signature—Rees or Vere produced the bill already drawn—the prisoner wrote the acceptance in my presence; I handed this cheque for 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Vere—the bill was for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he offered to give me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the money, and I handed him the balance, 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes. (<hi rend="italic">The bill and cheque were read, the acceptance to the bill was "Accepted at our office, Thomas Rees &amp; Co."</hi>) I parted with my cheque and notes in conse<lb/>quence of Mr. Rees guaranteeing it, I understanding Johnson to be Rees &amp; Co., and he said that he had the money quarterly, and he would see that I was paid, I believed him to be Mr. Rees, a solicitor—I thought him to be Vere's solicitor, and that Vere received from him 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—that bill" was never paid—I subsequently gave instructions to Mr. Apps, my attorney, for the purpose of recovering the money; I then discovered Rees to be the prisoner—when I gave the first cheque, I saw Vere and the prisoner coming towards the bank at King's Cross, on a <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> together, 200 yards up Gray's Inn Lane—that was about an hour after I had handed over the cheque—I have seen Vere since—the last time I saw him was on the Sun day night, before the summons was taken out against Vere and Johnson—this case was four or five times before Mr. Vaughan at Bow Street—Vere did not appear on any of the occasions; I have not seen him since, or been able to ascertain where he is.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

She did not go to Mr. Apps' office, but I have seen her—I saw him go and speak to her in Holborn; I cannot tell whether going to or coming from Mr. Apps'—I know nothing about the sister not liking the proposed engagement; if I did hear of it I have forgotten all about it—to the best of my knowledge I know nothing about it—I might have heard of it, if I did I do not see that it has anything to do with this—I have not squeezed anything out of Vere, whatever I had from him he owed it me—the horse he backed did not always lose, sometimes it won—he <hi rend="italic">may</hi> hare had more from me than I from him—I have two books which show the extent of my transactions with Vere; they are not here, they are at my house, 25, Harrington Square—I can fetch them before this case is over, I think—I really cannot tell you whether I won from Vere or he from me till I examine my books—if I laid him against the winner I paid him and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187601310071"/>
               <p>he did not pay me—he owed me 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we had only three or four transactions; there were four meetings—I do not know whether he or I won on the general transactions because I have not searched my books since, and it is about five years ago—I never won 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him on one transaction—there is not a balance of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my favour—I have never said so—the first time I went to 52, Chancery Lane was in February, and on that occasion I went with Vere—I was taken there on 25th February and this man was introduced to me as Mr. Rees, Mr. Vere's solicitor—I refused, on the 25th, to advance 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on getting warrant of attorney to enter up judgment, and I went away and I had a letter from Mr. Vere on the following morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the 26th February was it agreed that you should advance 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., having stated that 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was already due, and that you should take as secu<lb/>rity a warrant of attorney to enter up judgment on three respective sums of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I left it to my solicitor, it was something of that sort-on the 26th February there was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due on an old debt, and I was to advance 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more; it was not 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due, and I was not to add another 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to it, making 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) never came to my knowledge before I was at the police-court—it was produced there by my attorney's clerk—I can account for how my attorney got it—Mr. Cork got it (<hi rend="italic">Read: "</hi> To Josiah Johnson, Esq., 25, Harrington Square.

Yours truly, Thomas Kees &amp; Co.") My solicitor did not, after that was in his hands, prepare a warrant of attorney and send his clerk, Cork, to 52, Chancery Lane, with it—I do not know anything about the warrant of attorney being prepared and taken to 52, Chancery Lane, for execution; I only know that I had not seen it—I was not told afterwards by Mr. Cork or Mr. Apps that when they took it to Johnson he said he could not witness it, for he was not an admitted attorney; I wish they had told me that, they would not have got any more money from me; I did not hear anything about it—I believe that Mr. Cork got it executed and witnessed by an attorney, Mr. Stretton, and paid over 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on my account—I do not remember being at the office, 52, Chancery Lane, in February, 1875, when a Mr. Dear was there—the first time I saw Mr. Dear was at the police-court—I know the man you are speaking of—I do not remember being with Vere in the office, 52, Chancery Lane, when Dear and other persons were present; I will swear I was not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember that while you were so there waiting, Dear and you and the others, that Johnson came in and passed the lobby and went into the room opposite? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was nobody in the office but me and Vere—Mr. Dear did not say "I believe that is Mr. John<lb/>son, I must see Mr. John<lb/>son first, I have important business and I cannot wait"—he was not there—I did not hear a conversation with Dear, and my asking as to the fact that Johnson the clerk, was Johnson, and the betting man was. Johnson; nothing of the kind took place—Dear did not ask me whether I knew a person of the name of Hope Johnson, and whether I could not tell him whether he was likely to get some money out of him, for he owed him a large sum of money; it is all fabrication—it appears that I only left 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with Mr. Apps to go to the borrower; I believed I left 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was cross-examined</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187601310072"/>
               <p>about it—I swore I left 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I believed I did leave 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was a remand, and on the sccond occasion the question was put <hi rend="italic">to me</hi>, "How much money will you now say you left?" and I said "I will swear positively I left 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had never thought about it since, but I had really agreed with Mr. Vere and left 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I thought it was 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., although I saw that document—I believed I had left the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with Mr. Apps, but it was a mistake, I only left 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when I advanced the second sum on the 25th or 26th April Mr. Apps was not with me, I went with Vere alone—I expect the bill was taken already drawn, it was produced ready drawn—either Vere or the prisoner produced it ready drawn—it was accepted by the defendant—I took possession of it after it had been accepted; I am sure of that—I must have taken possession of it, I will swear I did; that is the best of my memory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the contrary, was not the bill brought to you enclosed in an enve<lb/>lope by a messenger named Frederick Jones? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know such a person unless it is the Jones who is a witness in the case, and I never saw him until I was at the police-court—I did not afterwards get that bill from Mr. Vere; Vere did not tell me that he had received it through the hands of a person named Jones, in an envelope; I am sure of that—I did not get it from Mr. Vere out of the office, I got it in the office, and there was not a fourth person there—I was there when the defendant accepted the bill; there is no mistake about that—I am sure I did not get it from Vere sub<lb/>sequently.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I think this is the first time I have been asked about this being handed to me by Vere after I left the office—I don't remember being asked before—I cannot tell to a few pounds which way the result was of my betting with Vere—I should have to search my books, and it is five years ago—I did not bet with him at more than four meetings; the last time was four years <hi rend="italic">ago</hi>, and he had owed me 267. when he left off—I went to the office of Rees &amp; Co. on the 25th, and got this letter from Vere on the morning of the 26th.

Dear Johnson—I am sorry you have had so much bother to-day; I have seen my solicitor again, and will meet you at the Baths, at 12 o'clock to-morrow morning, and will have with me the letter exactly as you wished from him. Although I am comparatively a stranger, permit me to offer to Mrs. John<lb/>son and her niece, my kind regard, and believe me, yours faithfully, R. Vere.") He had introduced me Johnson as Rees, on the 25th, as his soli<lb/>citor—I did not go again when the security was taken—I did not hear, from Mr. Apps or his clerk, or anybody that he was not Rees, but John<lb/>son, not till he had been sued, and I had advanced the money—I never heard of this document till it was produced at the police-court, or of any warrant of attorney.</p>

               <p>and in consequence of other statements he made to me, I went with him and Vere to 52, Chancery Lane—(I don't know whether Vere had come with him, but I saw them together)—Vere walked in first, he took us up<lb/>stairs into some offices at the top of the house—there was a clerk there; I did not notice anyone else—Vere said that Mr. Rees was not in, and asked the prosecutor and myself to go and sit in his room, and we went—shortly afterwards the defendant came in—I don't remember Vere saying anything, but the prosecutor said "Oh, here is Mr. Rees"—I then spoke to the de<lb/>fendant I said "Oh, Mr. Rees, my chent, Mr. Johnson tells me he is about to advance a sum of money to your client, Mr. Vore, and I am in<lb/>structed that Mr. Vere has 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year from, his sister, which comes' through your hands, is that so?"—he said "Yes"—I said "I am also in<lb/>structed that you are willing to guarantee the loan, and that it is proposed to do it by a bill to which you will become, a party;" he said "Yes"—I then drew this bill, "I promise to pay," &amp;c.—it is now "We promise"—the de<lb/>fendant appears to have altered it, but I did not notice it at the time—the "We" was not written by me—after drawing it I got up from the chair, and the defendant sat down and signed it, and upon that the prosecutor handed him a cheque for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think the amount was—I knew nothing. of the man before—I knew nothing more till the note became due—I then issued a writ against Rees on it, and there was an order for leave to appear—there was substituted service—Mr. Rees could not be found—eventually judgment was signed, and then they took out a summons to set the judgment aside—it turned out that in the interim while the three days were running, three days after service, they filed-an affidavit for leave to defend, and they got leave, but they did not serve the order on me—I believed that no such order had been obtained, and signed judgment—it was obtained <hi rend="italic">ex-parte</hi>, and they got leave to appear upon affidavit—the Master made an order to set aside the judgment, because they had got leave to appear—this is an office copy of the affidavit of James Thomas upon which the order was made. (<hi rend="italic">This was the affidavit of James Thomas, of 52, Chancery Lane, staling that a copy order for substituted service of the annexed copy writ of summous was left at Rees' office, on 16th August, in his absence, and that this affidavit was made for leave for Rees, who was suffering from illness, to enter an appearance.</hi>) That was successful—there was another affidavit, stating that the housekeeper had not given them the order—Mr. Thomas is the gentle<lb/>man who was called at the police-court for the defence.</p>

I did not go to Chancery Lane until the 23rd March, but I was aware of my clerk, Mr. Cork, going there—I saw the warrant of attorney that was executed, possession of which was taken by Mr. Cork, about the time that the bill became due—my clerks. have been with me many years—I cannot say whether Cork sometimes passes for Apps, I should think it very wrong; he would not be in my office five minutes if I heard of it—I do not know that gentlemen of the Bar ever speak to a clerk as a principal—I was never called by the name of my prin<lb/>cipal when I was a clerk—I went over to the office with the prosecutor on the 23rd of March; I did not go after the prosecutor and Vere had been there; we all three went together—I am perfectly clear about that—I have no entry of going separately—they produced their Chancery Lane, call book, but that was their book and not mine, and I forget how my name appears in it—when I did see the warrant of attorney I observed that it was not witnessed by Rees, but not at the time, not till the time of the proceed<lb/>ings</p>

               <p>hor did I mention it to Mr. Apps, but I said that the matter had been completed all right—I had nothing to do with the proceedings in re<lb/>ference to the 260<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I made a call after one instalment became due, and saw Mr. Carter, who said that Mr. Rees was away ill, but I did not have the conduct of the proceedings.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I knew on 25th February before I parted with the 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd that the prisoner's name was not Thomas Rees, but I did not know it before; I knew it when he declined to attest the warrant of attorney, not before—I was instructed not to part with the money unless Mr. Rees guaranteed it, but I considered it was a sufficient guarantee when his clerk gave it.</p>

I was a clerk to Mr. Rees during his life—I entered his service on 8th February last year and continued till he died in September—I am at present in Mr. Hope's service, his successor, at 52, Chancery Lane—there is a general clerk's office to which clients come first, the middle office; that is the office which you enter first—I am there and keep the call-book in the absence of the other clerk—the name outside the office door is Rees &amp; Co. and Johnson—that is so that persons who come into the office must see the names—I was there on 25th February—-this is the call-book; I find the name of "Vere and friend" calling at 2.30 on that day—I did not know who the friend was at that time—when Vere called he said "Is Mr. Johnson in?"—I said "No"—later in the day I find Mr. Apps' name as calling at 4.10 alone; he asked for Mr. Rees—I told him that Mr. Rees was not at business, he was ill, but Mr. Johnson would be in shortly—Mr. Apps left, and when the prisoner came in I told him that Apps had been there and he left the office to see Mr. Apps, I believe, and he was absent</p>

I went to Rees &amp; Co., but not at once, not for a month—I went to Hammersmith and lived with a woman, unfortunately for me, for she brought me to grief—I would not have gone to Roes &amp; Co. if I bad known what I know since—I am in their employ now because it suits me to stop there—I do not think I pawned all the woman's clothes—I don't care if she is here—she pawned my clothes; I will swear she pawned the only coat I had to my back—I did not pawn her clothes or take her late husband's</p>

Dear, Esq., 30, and 31, St. George's Place," on this prospectus is all a myth—I suppose there was some intention of bringing out something; you know something is required to enable a man to be a director of a particular company—show me my qualification—my son is not in the office of Campbell &amp; Co. to my knowledge; he was with Mr. Rees, but only a short <hi rend="italic">time</hi>—he might have been there twelve months, but really I cannot tell you the exact time—I have seen "Campbell &amp; Co., Law Agency," put up in Southampton Buildings—I mean to say that I have never seen this prospectus—I have an impression that Rees said something to me one day and I said "No," and I never consented to be a director—I do not know the Llanthony, Oxide, Lead, and Copper Mining Co.

(<hi rend="italic">A notice signed A. O'Brien, stating that the furniture in question belonged to William Dear was put in</hi>).

               <p>prove articles delivered, and therefore I was thrown upon that point and lost my articles; how dare you to say it is a forgery, Sir, I am not here to suffer a sa thief or a forger, Sir—I had to pay costs but I have got the land and the materials, but have not got them delivered yet, and therefore I shall have to bring another action—an agreement properly stamped was pro<lb/>duced be<lb/>fore the Master.—there were no interlineations in it—the Master found against me to a certain extent, but only because I could not prove articles delivered, but he gave me the 1,200 of freehold land and the materials, and I have been waiting seven years for it—I furnish houses for young gentlemen, but not for many young ladies—I have had some of the best customers of the day—I charge hire for the furniture, and deterioration if there is delapidation, but those we have to prove—I do not do much in bill discounting, I believe some of the people I do business with do; I asked you to try a good bill of yours before Baron Martin, and then you might try me, but you have never done it—I never, heard the defendant sing or play—he did not want a piano of me—I forgot whether Brins<lb/>mead &amp; Co. wrote to me about him—I had great confidence in his honesty—I do not know anything about bis giving his evidence on both sides in Dear <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Edmunds—I know I could not get my money out, I sent and paid half a crown the other day, but it did no good—I do not know whether this is the draft evidence produced on the part of Dear <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Edmunds, but I be<lb/>lieve it is Johnson's writing—here is Mr. Miller who was struck off the Rolls at the bottom of it—I had something to do with his being struck off the Rolls—I know Rickaby; I don't know whether he is the secretary of the United Lead Oxide Mining Company (limited)—I am not a director; if he has put me down I have never consented—I do not know whether O'Brien is the solicitor—I did not furnish Campbell &amp; Cos office, I furnished 52, Chancery Lane," but I never saw Campbell &amp; Co. there to my knowledge; I only knew Mr. Rees there as Thomas Rees &amp; Co—I do not know when the premises were taken, or whether they were taken by Johnson; I never heard from him that he took them—I know nothing about the rent or who pays it.</p>

Rees, Esq.—I think it was for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—the defendant objected to sign it, because he said that he had no authority to sign that, but he could sign "Rees &amp; Co."—it was taken away, and he said he would see Mr. Apps about it—no other bill was drawn up—the prosecutor said that he would take it to Mr. Apps—in the course of the day Mr. Apps came,</p>

Dear Sir,—I am in receipt of your favour, for which 1 thank you. I am indeed deeply sorry Mr. J. has so exposed himself."—that is the defeudaut—I do not know in what way he had exposed himself—I do not remember what I was sorry for—I write so many letters I cannot tell you; "And, under the circum<lb/>stances, must ask you to go to his house and claim all the papers which concernme"—those were papers in some actions I had—"Incases now on hand"—those were my own cases in which I was a plaintiff; I swear that, except Child's case—Among others, are the following: "Merryman <hi rend="italic">v</hi>, Kemp;" I was not plaintiff in that—I was not conducting the case, Mr. Collett was; he told me that Johnson had taken the papers to his house—I had instructed Mr. Johnson to bring the action—I was a draper, and used to employ Mr. Collett, I kept him; I paid him liberally—"This is an action in the Exche<lb/>quer for damages for illegal distress for rent"—I was not practising as Collett &amp; Co., I merely did it to keep Mr. Collett going—"Pawson <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> myself, this is an action on a bill of exchange drawn and accepted by Johnson"—Johnson accepted bills for me though I had never seen him—I have many friends of that kind.

That was to Mr. Collett—Mr. Johnson was at that time with Mr. James Russel Miller,. when I wrote that letter—I do not know whether "exposing himself" related to the case of stealing silk at Pawson's—I did not know that he stole silk—I do not know whether Mr. Mascall was charged with anything, I never saw the man; I believe he was charged with stealing silk at Pawson's—Mr. Collett wrote to me—I do not know whether Mascall after<lb/>wards got penal servitude; I was not there; I never saw him—Mr. Collett wrote and said that he was arrested—I was not practising with Johnson, who was practising as Miller, and I had not to transfer, it to Collett when Johnson came to grief; I had not seen Collett at the time, nor Miller—I made a special arrangement that if I wanted any writs sent down they should do it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Corke, Abbott, &amp; Co., 44 and 45, Fore Street, shirt collar, wristband, and front manufacturers—we missed property some time before January—a communication was made to us in December about a boy named Grant who we had, in consequence of which we had our premises searched in January, and a sack containing 123 dozen collars and three and a half pieces of linen was found on the private stair<lb/>case, where it had no right to be—we were unable to trace it further, and discharged Grant—Goods are never sold on our premises in an undressed state—on the 17th January Mr. Westaby, a collar dresser, communicated with me at the police-station, I having put the matter into the hands of the police on the 13th—Westerby produced these half a dozen pairs of Marl<lb/>borough wristbands and two dozen Stanley collars marked "P.S.H. Stanley to pattern 15,"which means the size; "P.S.H." denotes the firm for whom they were made—it is Edwards' duty to cut these collars—this pencil mark is his writing—every dozen we make is marked—there is also a mark on the wristbands—the collars were dressed; they were given to me as a sample only of what Westaby had received—in consequence of what Westaby said I saw Mr. Chilton—Westaby produced this document to me. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Memorandum. London Warehouse Company, Limited, to Mr. Westaby. Sir,—Please dress the collars, &amp;c., you have for us, and let me know when they are ready. R. J. Chilton. Jan. 11, 1876." Jennings communicated with us, I think, on the 17th January, and produced these two invoices: "Dec. 23rd, 1874. Mr. Jennings. Bought of W. Garnham, draper, &amp;c., 41 dozen collars at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." "Dec. 28,1875. Mr. Jennings. Bought of W.

Jennings showed me the goods, and they were mine; he produced the lot—I identify them, they are partly dressed and partly undressed—none of Jennings' goods passed through Westaby's hands—I recovered from Westaby 132 dozen of Stanley collars and 38 dozen of Marlborough wristbands, of which 96 dozen collars were undressed and 38 dozen wristbands were dressed—I recovered from Jennings altogether 72 dozen and five collars and fronts, some dressed and some undressed—I then went with Jennings and three detectives to Garnham's house, Hoxton Street, Hoxton—Jennings went in first and asked for Mr. Garnham, as he did not observe him in the back of the shop—the man pointed him out to us and said "That is Mr. Garnham. Mr. Garn<lb/>ham, this is the gentleman belonging to the firm I spoke to you about"—Garnham asked me to go into the back room, which I did, and said "My name is Abbott, of the firm of Corke, Abbott, &amp; Co.; I have come about some collars and fronts which you have sold to Jennings; have you any more of them?" he said that he had heard from Jennings about them the day previous, he said "I only bought these seventy-seven dozen, which I sold all to Jennings—I have no more"—I said, "Can I look over your warehouse?"he said "You see how I was occupied when you came in, leave it until 2 o'clock, I will then come down to your warehouse" I</p>

               <p>told him I could not do that—before that I asked him where he got them from, he said "I bought them of a man whom I know, but I cannot now recollect his name"—I asked him if he could find an invoice, he looked over a file, and said "I cannot find it"—I then said "Will you come with me now?" he said "No, I cannot, I am too busy "I said "I can't leave you"; he said "Do the police know anything of this, for God's sake do not put it into their hands" I said "They do know something about it" he said "For mercy's sake do not put it into their hands, I am a man with a family of seven children, I will come down to you at 2 o'clock, and will make up your loss "I said "What loss? with you at present it is seventy<lb/>seven dozen, but we have lost considerably over 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he made no answer, and Brett almost immediately came in—the prisoner said that he had sold all he bought to Jennings, and after the police searched the premises, he said "I have bought back three dozen collars of Jennings "he called his shopman, and told him to fetch them—he was taken away in custody, and I went to Moor Lane station, and saw him there—a portion of the property I had seen in Westaby's possession, was brought in, and I identified it—Chilton came to the station, and said in the prisoner's presence that he bought of him the goods he had sold to Westaby—the prisoner made no answer that I heard—he said when the police entered his shop, that he bought the goods of Price and Chapman; and he believed it was Mr. Price, of Glover's Hall Court—we stopped there over two hours, and he searched his invoices twice or thrice over—these Marlborough. wrist<lb/>bands were on our premises on 5th January, they were not button-holed on the 3rd, the size and the cut correspond with thirty-nine dozen which I lost—the Stanley collars were also on our premises on 5th January; I be<lb/>lieve about twenty-dozen were looked out specially.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had the information from Jennings on Monday even<lb/>ing the 17th, and went to the prisoner's premises on Tuesday the 18th—it is a general drapery shop, very fully stocked, with counters on each side—I saw two ladies serving in the shop, and also a young man—I saw one customer there—detectives Brett, Broom, and Butteridge were outside—Tenningb was present during the whole conversation—Stanley collars are common enough by name—there is only a peneil mark on one collar in every dozen, it is to show the particular firm they are cut for—I find in a large number of the undraped collars the letters in pencil—"Marlborough" is the name of the shape of the wristbands—the name may be common—they are not registered in that name.</p>

I received this memorandum, after which I dressed thirty-six dozen of them—in consequence of certain enquiries I produced a sample of them to Mr. Corke who identified them as being stolen from him—when I received the goods in the sack I did not know where they came from—I had not had any transactions with the London Wood Street Warehouse Company for some years—the message was "They are from the Wood Street Warehouse Company, but do not touch them till you hear from them"—I did not do anything to them till I received the memorandum.</p>

I am son of Mr. Corke, one of the firm of the prosecutors—I have seen all the property produced by Westaby—the last portion of it came in on Tuesday night, on the 4th January, between 5 and 6 o'clock, from outdoors, for the button-holing—then the quantity was not complete; there were two dozen to make it so, and I had a row with one of the young girls—I knew it was part of the property found at Westaby's because I took it in myself—it was Marlborough cuffs; about ten dozen came in on the Tuesday; the rest, about thirty dozen, came in on the Monday—I know them by the price given out at, and I am positive they are Marlborough wristbands, and W.R.F. Glasgow—they were made for a particular firm, and they have the letters of that firm upon them—I am able to swear positively upon that, that they were at our premises on the 4th—I am positive about the rest of the property because you will find P.S.H. on a part of the collars—I cannot say whether those goods were ever made or in existence upon the 18th December; the portion upon the 4th January I am positive of—they were given out to button-hole on the 1st.</p>

               <p>of my belief we have made Marlborough cuffs three years, Stanley collars three months—we make the Marlboroughs for one house and the collars for another; P.H.S. one and W.R.F. another—cuffs and collars might have the same name—that particular Marlborough cuff cannot be bought all over the the trade at the same price—we had some goods come in on the Monday—I have a book to refer to, but not here; my word is enough—I did not see the cuffs at Westaby's, I saw them at the police-station—the stitching is done by a machine—I can tell who stitched them by the number.</p>

January I was in the Albion Road, Woolwich, and saw Brown who is a corn chandler come out of his own yard with a horse and cart, I went up to the cart, it was empty—I bid him good morning, and said "Are <hi rend="italic">you going to</hi> market" he said "No," and drove on—I watched the cart, and followed it to the corner of King-Street, and Charles Street, he pulled up there—Burrows was standing on the pavement, he went up to the cart, took it from Brown, went with it into Mr. Barth'syard, and closed the gates after him—Brown stood at the corner of the street berween 20 and 30 yards from the spot—in about ten minnaes Burrows came out again with the horse and cart, and came in the direction of where he had left Brown—I was standing there in company with Gibson another constable—Brown came up to the horse and cart, and they met in the centre of the road—it was dark—I said to Bur<lb/>rows "What have you there "he made no answer—I turned round and saw Brown going towards the pavement again as fast as he could, at a kind of jog trot—I looked into the cart, and saw that it contained four full sacks—I took them to the station, examined them, and found three contained oats, and one bran—I went to Mr. Barth's stable in company with the foreman, and found three empty sacks lying at the top of the ladder—there were other sacks there which were compressed as if somebody had been lying on them—I afterwards went to Brown's honse, and found three empty sacks marked with Mr. Barth's name.</p>

I have pleaded guilty to this charge—before I was taken into custody I resided at 47, Artillery Place, Woolwich, and was in Mr. Barth's employ about six months as yard man to see to the horses and stables—I have only known Brown, a very little while, I had met him three or four times, that was all—I saw him on the Thursday before this Satur<lb/>day, along by the dockyard wall—he stopped me, but I could not stop to have much conversation with him then, and I said I would see him again; I had a horse with me; I saw him again shortly after along by the dock-yard wall, going towards his home he asked if I had got anything I could sell him—I said "I don't know, I don't like to do anything in that way"—</p>

               <p>he said if I had, he would not have it in Mr. Barth's sacks—I said if I did let have any I would have his (Brown's) sacks, nothing else passed between us then—the sacks were sent up to my place on the Friday night, and I took them with me to Mr. Barth's premises in the morning; I got there about 4.30; I chucked the sacks up in the loft and went up to see to the horses—as soon as all the men were out I emptied the corn out of Mr. Barth's sacks, and put it into those that were sent by Brown—I then went out into the road to see if Brown was there, he was not, that was between. 6 and 7 o'clock—I went out again, a little before 7 o'clock, and met him coming along King Street, with his horse and cart—he got out of the cart and handed it to me, and I went in and put the corn into the cart and brought it out again to Brown—he told me to drive down King Street, I knew he was coming that morning, the appointment was made for him to come—he said he would be there about 7 o'clock, or a little after—when I came out with the cart I saw the two detectives standing at the corner by the Lord Whitworth; Brown was on the opposite corner—the detectives came up and asked what I had in the cart—I made no answer—Brown stood about two or three strides away from me, he heard what the detectives said and then he started to run away, leaving me with the cart, he made a kind of a trot, to go as fast as he could, I had met him several times before the Thursday, but not to speak to him much.</p>

I am a pawnbroker in London Street, Greenwich, and also at Lewisham and Peckham—I bought the business at Greenwich in May last, from a Mr. Nash—I took over the whole stock, and engaged the prisoner—he and his wife lived on the premises, and he was manager.—I did not see the child's robe before it was found—I have seen the bed—I purchased one in Mr. Nash's stock that cost 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Mr. Nash's pri<lb/>vate mark was "May flowers"—there was "M.

I can swear this is the locket—this is the book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in which entry would be made of pur<lb/>chases by the prisoner—this is his handwriting upon this page—there is no entry on the 25th September of the coin for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the till money, which I reported to him—Mr. Rawlings keeps the sale book—it is his duty to enter, if the prisoner is himself the purchaser—I remember the stock-taking on the 7th November; the stock was deficient—I made a communication to, Mr. Balls upon that—I was present when the prisoner was called into the room and asked to produce his watch chain; he went into the next room, his bedroom; he was there two or three minutes—I heard Mr. Balls call out to him "Don't take anything off"—I heard a jingling sound—when be came in he showed his chain—there was an old-fashioned seal and key upon it; the key I have seen on former occasions, but not the seal—the coin was not there—I don't recollect whether Mr. Balls said anything to him about the seal and key—there was a something said about the locket—I told him what I knew about it, and he said he had sold the locket to a stranger in the street—he said that it was worth 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said "It cost 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he said "What stuff"—I said "It is false, Mr. Ball's judgment will prove whether it cost 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—the gold coin was mentioned—I told him I had bought it for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said "What is it worth, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.?"—Mr. Balls said You have robbed me of baif-a-crown"—he said he had lost it—no refer<lb/>ence</p>

He was to receive—I believed all he said about "his property," and that is why I parted with my money—he stated that his lawyers were Mr. Harcourt and Mr. James, Q.C.—he used to complain how Mr. James served him, and he got the Government to give it over to Mr. Harcourt—he often showed me documents; some were supposed to be signed by Mr. Cross, Secretary of State, and others by Mr. Chambers, and a few by Mr. Harcourt—I after<lb/>wards lent him 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. after a good deal of persistence on his part—he gave me this I O U for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believed all he said because of his movements and conversations—he would leave my house every day between 10 and 12o'clock" and be back at 5 o'clock, and relate how he had been getting on,</p>
