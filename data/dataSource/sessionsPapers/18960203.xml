                  </hi>. I am in the service of Miss Perry, at 6, Castilian Road, Paddington—about 10 p.m. on January 18th, I went to open the lavatory door and found it closed from the inside; and thinking some<lb/>thing was wrong I fetched a policeman—he sent me to the butcher's for a chopper to break the door in—when I came back the policeman was just going out into the garden after the burglars—I afterwards saw the prisoner being brought in from the garden—the door from the garden to the breakfast room had been closed, but not locked, and the lavatory window was open wide enough for a man to get out of—I keep a supply of beer downstairs—the policeman found an empty bottle in the lavatory; it was just like those we keep downstairs; no bottle had ever been left in the lavatory before—it had been taken from the bottles down-stairs; I knew by the number—to get into the lavatory a man could go through the garden door and the breakfast room, or could get through the lavatory window—after the prisoner was taken to the station the lavatory door was burst open.</p>

On January 18th I was on duty in the Warwick Road about 8 p.m., when I was called to 6, Castilian Road, Paddington—I found the w.c. door locked—I asked if anyone was in there and got no answer—I tried to force the door with my shoulder, and failed—I sent the servant to the nearest butcher's for a hatchet—I saw the shadow of a man sliding down the rain-water pipe outside—I ran out and caught him in the garden, and asked him what he was doing there—he said, "I am come for a night's <hi rend="italic">doss</hi>"—his boots were off—I asked where they were; He said, "By the gate"—he put them on, and I took him to the station—he went quietly—he used very bad lan<lb/>guage on the way to the station, and threatened, when he had done his time, if the servant and me were not dead, he would shoot the pair of us—I charged him at the station; he made no reply—I then went back to the house and forced the lavatory door, and found in it an empty beer-bottle—to get in through the lavatory window from the garden a man would have to climb about ten feet on to a landing window, and then get round and in at the lavatory window—the easier way would be to get in by the door—I could not see from footprints which way he had got in—when I took the prisoner in the garden he was not asleep, but trying to make his escape—his boots were against the gate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a colliery agent—I have known the defendant many years; he is my cousin—he was formerly a partner in the employ of Myers and Co., colliery agents—he entered my employ<lb/>ment on the last day of September or October 1st—he told me if I would employ him he could make a very good business, as the man he was with was bankrupt—I employed him as a clerk at £1 a week and 25 per cent. on the net profits—he said that he had a good connection with a large class of people and also among-shipbrokers—I took a special office for him in Billiter Square, and he came there—he said, about Christmas, that he knew a Mr. Allen who had introduced him to Mr. Seale, who was a ship's husband, that is a storekeeper, who sees to the victualling of Mr. Grant's ships—they are a large firm, and he said that they were not satisfied with the coal they were having and he was negotiating an order, and Mr. Seale would want a Certain amount of commission out of it, and he could not get the order unless he had something to give Mr. Seale, who would expect £10—I objected to give £10 to people I did not know—he said that Mr. Seale would not want the whole amount down at once, and suggested giving him a sovereign, which I gave him on account—he left the office and came back in half-an-hour, and said he had seen Mr. Seale, who took the sovereign and put it in his waistcoat pocket, and said that it was rather small, and he should expect the balance, but he gave the order—that was on January 2nd; and on the same day he wrote a letter from me to Messrs. Grant, of which this is a copy—on January 7th I was told that Messrs. Grant wanted a confirmation in my own writing and I wrote him this letter, and posted it myself. (<hi rend="italic">Confirming the order and stating that a copy would be sent from his office at Cardiff.</hi>) I was in London that day, and the next day, Wednesday morning, when the defendant showed me the same letter returned to me, and said that</p>

               <p>Messrs. Grant were not satisfied with my confirmation, as the details were act out—I saw the India rubber stamp, and that confirmed me that the letter was genuine—I sent another letter from Cardiff, where I had gone to take an office, because the defendant told me that Messrs. Grant would give us a vote, and it would be absolutely necessary to have an office at Cardiff; I went there on the evening of the 8th, leaving my brother Alfred in charge of the office, and posted my letter next morning, but got no letter or telegram in reply—I never saw my letter again—on the 10th I received this letter from the defendant. (<hi rend="italic">This said</hi>, "Do not wire to Grant, I arranged with McGregory about Orient line; Arthur gave me £3 to give him next week.—A. E. Lockyer.") He had said that Mr. Steele had introduced him to Mr. McGregory of the Orient line—on the Saturday I had this letter from the defendant saying that Mr. R. Grant wished to see me on Tuesday—I returned to town on Saturday the 11th from Cardiff, and saw the defendant the same evening, he said that I should have to see Mr. Steele on Monday morning—I went there at ten a.m., and the prisoner said that he had already seen Mr. Steele, who had to go to Tilbury Dock and would not be back till five o'clock—I waited till six o'clock, when I got a telegram signed Steele, and did nothing that evening—on the morning of the 14th I went to the office and the defendant said he had already seen Mr. Steele, who wanted to know whether it would be convenient for me to see him at twelve o'clock—I said, "Very well, I will wait in till 12.30," I waited in, but Mr. Steele did not appear—the defendant came into the office and said, "Mr. Steele will be sure to be round"—I had another en<lb/>gagement, and gave the defendant a half sovereign, so that he could let me know where they had gone—when I went back, the clerk at the office told me something, and I went to Crosby Hall to see if I could see them but could not—about three o'clock I saw the defendant in Billiter Square, and asked him where Mr. Steele was, he said he had gone to the Albert Docks, and had got the order in his pocket—I said, "You go to Fen-church Street Station, and if you cannot find him, I will go with you to the Albert Docks and see Mr. Steele"—he took a ticket, and I saw him off by the 3.23 train, and did not see him again that night—I said that if I did not receive a wire from him by five o'clock I should wait in, and at 5.30 I went to Mr. Anderson's and to Messrs. Grant's and made a communication to them—I never got any order—on the 15th I received this letter from the defendant. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he had sprained his ankle, and ricked his knee, and the doctor would not allow him to walk, and asking for money that lie might take a cab to the office.</hi>) I paid the £1 on the false representation that he was going to give it to Steele to get me the big order.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 9, Gower Place, and am superintendent worker in the Army Clothing Department, Pimlico—on the morning of January 6th, about five minutes to six, I was passing through Seven Dials on my way home, between Little and Great St. Andrew Street—as I was walking along I observed a policeman talking to two men and a boy out-side a public-house at the corner of Great St. Andrew Street—after the policeman had spoken to them they moved on in front of me, then sud<lb/>denly stopped, and the taller man (<hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi>) threw his arm across my chest and the shorter man (<hi rend="italic">Malligan</hi>) struck me a violent blow on the nose and the top part of my chin, and broke away a portion of my tongue which I have not recovered—I did not lose sight of the men after that—I looked for a policeman—the men walked in front of me a distance of seventy paces—I found a policeman, and gave information, and had my nose dressed—I gave a description to two de<lb/>tectives while in the doctor's surgery—I think my nose was broken—I went to Bow Street Police-station—I was there shown ten or eleven men—I failed to identify the men at that time. After a time Malligan was placed in the dock, and I at once said he was the man—I had not the slightest doubt of his being the man—I saw Johnson next month in the dock on another charge, and identified him; I have not the slightest doubt about him—I have no doubt the prisoners are the two men that assaulted me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was very dark at five minutes to six that night—there was not a soul there but the policeman and the persons he was speaking to—it appeared to me that he was ordering them away—the thing that drew my attention was the policeman talking to them—the two men then separated and came towards me, and the robbery was the work of an instant—Malligan placed his hand down my coat, it was buttoned up—he faced me, I had a full view of Johnson's face when the policeman was ordering him away—I did not see his face when he robbed me—at the station I gave a description to the police of the thief—I was only shown one row of men to identify one person—next morning, at Bow Street, I saw Johnson charged with stealing a watch—I did not know what he was charged with—I could then see his face, and I recognised him.</p>

               <p>of certain persons—at half-past eight that evening I saw Mulligan on the Seven Dials—I stopped him and told him I was a police officer, and I was endeavouring to tell him what I was going to take him for, when he put his foot behind me, pushed me back and gave me a violent kick in the stomach; I kept hold of his leg—I arrested him from the description I had received from the prosecutor—I got him to the station, the prosecutor failed to identify him—I then charged him with the assault and the unlawful possession of an expensive hard felt hat which he was wearing; he endeavoured to conceal it, and put a cap on—the prosecutor said "he is the man that struck the blow; I swear to him now I have seen him properly"—Malligan replied, "If I had you outside I would knock your two eyes into one"—next morning I formally charged him with this robbery; he made no reply—next morning I felt fairly well, and fit for duty—the prosecutor gave me a description of two persons.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman in the City, and live at 10, St. Paul's Street, Islington—on Christmas Eve, about half-past six or a quarter to seven, I came out of my house to call a hansom cab—I went down to the New North Road, about six doors off—the cab followed me back to my house—as I went to my steps I saw three men approaching me; I had never seen them before that I know of—I gave some direc<lb/>tions to the cabman—as I turned round to go up the steps to my door I found the three men round me, one to the left, and the other two to the right; one of them, Driscoll, came and looked me full in the face, at the same time I felt a tug at my watch-chain; I kept my watch, but they got my chain, and made off at once—I turned round and looked at the other two, and I caught sight of Ashton, and then made off after Driscoll shouting "Stop thief "twice—the other two had followed me after Dris<lb/>coll; I was knocked over into the road—I got up and looked round, and I could see the smallest of the two go round the corner, and I have never seen him since; the other man stood about fifteen yards off, and watched what I was going to do; I looked at him so as to know him again. It was Ashton, he ran away as fast as he could; I followed him to the corner; I could not see him, and thinking it was a bad job, I gave it up—when I got back the cabman was there; I said something to him, and went into the house—the skin was knocked off both my hands; there was a good deal of blood from both hands; I felt the most pain next day—I went to Maidenhead that night, and remained there till the following Monday, the 29th; I could not leave the house for four days; I went to a chemist's at Maidenhead, and had my hands dressed; I came back to my own house on the 29th—Sergeant Smith called on me; I gave him a description of the three men who had assaulted me, as far as I could, and later that night I was invited to go to the Police-station at Islington to see if I could identify any of the men; there were about eight or nine men there, and I directly recognised Ashton—he was not dressed as he is now; he had a jacket on—when I first saw him he had on an overcoat; I should say the coat he has on now; it was a long light overcoat; he had not that on when I went into the station; after the other men had left, the police gave him back his overcoat; he put it on, and then I could see a once that he was the person—ho said, "If any man will give me time I will do for him, if I swing for it—I should say that the overcoat he put on then was the same that he has on now; it looked to me that night like a dark brown; I believe it to be the same he has on now—on January 1st I again went to the station for the purpose of identifying some one, I saw about the same number of men, eight or nine, and I at once picked out Driscoll as the one that took my chain—seeing the two prisoners now, I have no doubt whatever that they are two of the men who assaulted me on that night—I gave £3 15s. for my watch, I have never seen it since.</p>

I sell ices in the street—I am an Italian, and live in Great Bath Street—on January 15th I was in a public-house, and saw a fight between the prisoner and the prosecutor; they fought again outside, in Clerkenwell Road, and both fell—the prosecutor went across the road, and the prisoner after him, with an open white-handled clasp-knife in his hand—two of his friends tried to hold him back—it was then about 11.40—I did not see what he did with the knife, but I saw the prosecutor afterwards with his throat cut.</p>

I am medical officer at the Royal Free Hospital, Gray's Inn Road—on the night of January 15th the prosecutor was brought in with a wound on the right side of his neck, about three-quarters of an inch long; it consisted of two parts, separated by a small piece of flesh—the back part was over an inch deep, and some important nerves were severed—it went within a quarter of an inch of the carotid artery, and if that had been severed he would have died—this is not the kind of knife I should expect to do it—it healed at once; he was dis-charged in eight days, but he is still an out-patient.</p>

               <p>glass together, and I want to get him home"—I looked at the deceased on the pavement and saw he was unconscious—I saw a little blood trickling from the corner of his left eye—I sent the policeman who had accompanied me to the spot for the ambulance when I saw the man was unconscious—I asked the prisoner how the man came by his injury—he replied, "I want to take him home"—I asked him if he knew who he was—he said, "No, he is a stranger to me"—I said I should not allow him to be taken away until seen by a doctor—I asked the prisoner for his own name and address—he said, "What for?" and turned and walked away—the other man, who took no part, walked away with the prisoner—when the constables Bridle and Hopkins arrived I directed Bridle to follow the prisoner and bring him back—when he brought him back I told him I was not satisfied about the matter, and he had better come to the station to the inspector—the prisoner said, "No, take the man to the hospital"—by this time the ambulance was coming—Phillips came up just after the prisoner was brought back and made a statement to me—the deceased was placed upon the ambulance and taken to Com<lb/>mercial Street Station, where he was seen by Dr. Cameron—he was then taken to the London Hospital—I accompanied him—he was seen by a student, Mr. King, I think—he was quite unconscious on the way, but at the hospital he said, "I want to go to the closet," or "Let me go to the closet."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner's answer to my inquiry whether he knew who the deceased was, was not" We are both pals," nor when I asked for his address did he say, "Why should I tell you?"—Bridle was not present all the time; I do not think he was when I asked the prisoner how the deceased came by his injuries; I am not positive—the distance from the corner of Church Street to the spot where I found the deceased is 112 yards.</p>

                  <hi rend="largeCaps">ROBERT BRIDLE</hi> (201 <hi rend="italic">H</hi>). I followed the prisoner by direction, and brought him back—on the way he said he had had enough of him all the evening, meaning the deceased.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I came up, and found the sergeant with the deceased—the prisoner and another man were standing by—the sergeant said, "Do you know the injured man?"—I understood him they had been drinking together—I did not hear him say, "We are both pals"—my deposition before the Magistrate was read over to me—I could not say whether I said the prisoner said they were both pals—(<hi rend="italic">Read from de<lb/>position:</hi> "The prisoner being asked by P.S. 3, if he knew the injured man said they were both pals. On being asked for both name and ad<lb/>dresses the prisoner said, 'Why should I tell you?")—that is all right—I could not swear to the word "pals"—I have no doubt I swore before Mr. Justice Hawkins that the prisoner replied, "We are both pals," and that the attention of the Jury was called to the fact that the sergeant and I did not agree about that—I have not since agreed with the sergeant.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Inspector H</hi>). About 1.20 a.m. on December 14th, I was in charge of Commerical Street Station, when the deceased was brought in on an ambulance—he was insensible—in consequence of his condition I sent for the Assistant Divisional Surgeon, Dr. Cameron, who came and ex<lb/>amined him, and the deceased was at once removed on the ambulance to the London Hospital—the prisoner was brought in and charged with unlaw<lb/>fully wounding the man—when the charge was read over he made no reply</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189602030031"/>
               <p>—he had been drinking—on searching him I found in his right hand coat pocket this pipe bowl—I called his attention to the absence of the stem, and he commenced to search his pockets, and not finding it said, "I be<lb/>lieve I have lost it, I had a smoke out of it to-night"—I examined his overcoat, and on it found little stains, and in his pocket I found a hand<lb/>kerchief with stains the colour of blood on it—I made a note of his reply about ten minutes afterwards—he did not say, "<hi rend="italic">He</hi> had a smoke out of it"—he said nothing to me about picking up the pipe—Inspector Miller took the charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I found no tobacco or matches on the prisoner, I gave my evidence before the Coroner before the prisoner did—when I said before the Magistrate the prisoner said he had "smoked out of it" the prisoner called out something, I am not able to say whether he said it was false—he said something, and I saw the constable put his hand up. At the adjourned inquest the prisoner made a statement before the Coroner—he said he had smoked out of it. On a subsequent occasion the prisoner put Inspector Miller in the box—his evidence was confined to the state<lb/>ment at the police-station—Mr. Bishop said he should dismiss the charge of manslaughter as he undoubtedly struck the prosecutor, and for that assault he would bind him over in his own recognisances—I said "you have not heard the evidence," when Miller called my attention to it—then. Miller's evidence was given, which was confined to the conversation between the prisoner and me about the pipe—I had given evidence pre<lb/>vious to that—before the prisoner was committed, and said "I had smoked out of it, not he"—I am certain the prisoner said at the station, "I sup<lb/>pose I have lost it—I had a smoke out of it to-night"—my book says so—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "I called attention to the pipe being without a stem—he said, 'I have had a smoke out of it to-night,' and at the same time searched his pockets. He said 'I cannot find it—I suppose I must have dropped it.' ")—that is what I am reported to have said, but to the best of my belief I said what is in ray book—I did not notice any discrepancy—I cannot explain it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Justice Hawkins repeatedly commented on the discrepancy in his summing-up—I am certain the prisoner said "I" not "he"—he did not use the word "pipe," but the words "with it"—the Inspector taking notes of a conversation would take down, as nearly as possible, the words—I did not take a note—I should be surprised if the word "pipe "appeared in Ford's note and not "it."</p>

               <p>December, I was called into Commercial Street Police Station—I found the deceased lying, apparently insensible, on his back—his appearence was consistent with his having been drinking—he was slightly conscious—when the sponge was applied to lave the wound he put up his hand to push me off—there was blood on his face, and considerable mud—the blood came from the inner side of the left eye—I found a penetration of the eye and a fracture of the skull—he was so gravely injured that in con<lb/>sequence of my order he was removed to the hospital—it is possible he could speak after receiving the wound, but under ordinary circumstances it is improbable—he would be more likely to move if drunk.</p>

                  </hi>.

               <p>James Fitt on the 19th and 27th of December last year—on the 27th White was sworn in the usual way—he was cautioned—he gave evidence, which was taken down and signed by him—I produce the original depositions, which were afterwards signed by White—"Frederick White, before the Coroner, upon his oath, saith (having been cautioned and represented by counsel): 'I reside at 22, Green Street,. Bethnal Green. I am a master fishmonger. I knew deceased by sight. I have seen him five or six times. I went into the Bell public-house, Shored itch, to have a drink on Friday, the 13th December, about eleven p.m. About five or six minutes afterwards deceased, with four or five other men, came in. I was offered a drink, and I had it. We stood talking together for some time. Deceased and four or five others went with me to the Spread Eagle in the Kingsland Road, and then we had three or four half-pints of rum to drink between us. We stopped in there for some time, and it was getting late, and we went from there to the Gun public-house, facing, and there we had two or three drinks. I had ale; deceased had twopennyworth or threepennyworth of rum. We stayed in there till closing-time. There was some quarrelling between us all, but I don't know what it was about. Deceased was hopelessly drunk. I had had sufficient. I remember going down High Street after that. I don't remember deceased falling at Church Street. I did not knock him down I don't remember any police-constable coming to us there, and asking deceased if he wished to charge me. I do not remember passing any other constable until we got to the corner of Bethnal Green Road. When. we got to the corner of Bethnal Green Road there were about four men with deceased. I stopped to wait for a 'bus to go home, but I now think the last 'bus was gone. I walked a little way along Bethnal Green Road. Deceased and the other men had gone on before me. When I walked a little way along, then I saw deceased lying on the pavement with his face downwards. When I went to pick him up I found the bowl of a pipe (now produced) which belonged to the deceased; at least I saw him smoking a similar pipe during the evening. I have never smoked a pipe like that in my life. After picking the pipe up, in my excitement, lifting the man about, I put the pipe in my pocket. I have seen the other men before in the company of deceased, but I only know them by sight. I have tried to find them and can't. I was admitted to bail last Saturday. I have never had any money transactions with deceased in my life. The pipe (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was not in my possession at any time during the night until I picked it up. I do not smoke at all. I saw deceased smoking a wooden pipe in the Gun, and also in the Spread Eagle. I did not state in the charge-room, when spoken to by the Inspector as to the stem of the pipe being missing, 'I had a smoke out of it to-night; but I said 'He was a-smoking of it to-night' The Inspector was writing in my presence. I told Inspector Ford I picked, the pipe up when I picked up the man. I believe both Inspectors were present.—(Signed) <hi rend="smallCaps">FREDERICK WHITE</hi>."</p>

I am a printer of 180, Brompton Road—in July, 1894, <hi rend="italic">I did printing for Kennedy to the amount of</hi> £2 4s. 6d.—the account was sent in, and the money was owing in August 1894—about August 22nd or 23rd Bragge came and handed me a letter, which I opened and read—an open cheque was enclosed in it; I believe this is it. (<hi rend="italic">This cheque, on a sheet of paper, was on Stuckey's Bank, Ilminster, for</hi> £6 5s., <hi rend="italic">drawn by H. Stewart M. Bragge in favour of Forrester Kennedy.</hi>)—I was asked to cash it; I refused because I said I did not know who the drawer was—he said, "I am the drawer, and there is a balance at the Bank"—he said, "I am known to Mr. Willmore"—I knew Willmore as a tradesman in the same road—I still refused to cash the cheque—I did not see Bragge again nor Kennedy; the account is still owing.</p>

I am a commercial traveller, of 5, Coverdale Road, Chelsea—I knew Kennedy in 1894—I have seen him in Bragge's com<lb/>pany on several occasions—towards the end of August, 1894, I was in the Bell and Horns public-house with the prisoners; they asked me if I would change a cheque—I declined at first, and Bragge said he was worth some money, and was a schoolmaster in the country, and was up in London for a holiday and had spent all his money, and he pressed-me—he wrote out this cheque in the public-house—while it was being written Kennedy wanted it made out for more money and I would not have it, and it was made out for £3 10s. to me or my order, on Stuckey's Bank, Ilminster, dated August 23rd, and signed H. Stewart M.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Sergeant</hi> 35 <hi rend="italic">City</hi>). On Sunday night, January 19th, I met Andrew Hearne by the General Post Office; he said there was murder taking place in Shaftesbury Place—I went there, and saw a crowd of about 100 people—a panel of the door of No. 6 was broken out—I looked through, and saw Driscoll and William Hearne inside; they had nothing in their hands then—Hannen bad gone to the station with Shears at the time—Driscoll and William Hearne said, "Look here, they have broken our door in; protect us from that crowd"—I got assistance of other constables, and began to clear the crowd away—in consequence of what Joseph Newton said to me, I returned to No. 6—I said to Driscoll and Hearne, whom I saw inside the door, "You have a man in here"—Driscoll said, "No, governor; no man in here, governor"—I said, "I know you have; open this door, or I will force my way"—William Hearne dis<lb/>appeared; Driscoll began to open the door, and ultimately ran to the end of the passage; the door was opened by someone inside—I went in, and saw Newton being brought up from the cellar, assisted by William Hearne and Driscoll and a woman—he was bleeding from the head, and in a semi unconscious condition, very wet, and quite unable to stand—blood had been freshly washed from his head—I said to Driscoll, "You know something about this"—he said, "He came in here for protection, governor"—I assisted Newton to the door, obtained an ambulance and sent him to St. Bartholomew's Hospital—I then went back to the house and arrested Driscoll, and handed him to another constable who took him to the station—he was identified by Joseph Newton—I entered the house, and in the first-floor back room I found William Hearne covered entirely by the bed clothes, as though I they had been thrown over the bed—he was fully dressed—I said, "I want you"—he said, "What is the matter? I am hurt; my leg is</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189602030043"/>
               <p>broken"—I said, "Come out and let us have a look at it"—I took him into the next room and examined his leg, hut could find nothing the matter—as he said it was injured, I got assistance, carried him down-stairs and sent him in another ambulance to the hospital, where the doctor examined him—he was able to walk from there to the station—he remained at the station till the injured man was brought back from the hospital on the ambulance, and then this charge was preferred against him of being concerned in maliciously wounding—while the injured man was lying in the ambulance in the station William Hearne said to him, "If I get punished for this, Charley, I am innocent, as when I brought down that cup of tea to you I was dumbstruck to see it was you"—Driscoll said nothing—Andrew Hearne said, "You may as well put it all down to me."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by William Hearne.</hi> There were a great many people in the court at the time; they were all behaving themselves; inquiring what had taken place—they followed me to the door, and I had to keep them back—you had nothing in your hand when I arrived.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital—on the early morning of January 20th, about 12.30, I examined the prisoner—I found a great deal of blood about him, seven or eight wounds on his, head, two wounds on his face, a large lacerated wound on his forehead, and a very small one on his face—he had a fractured fibula (the ankle bone) on the left-side—the various injuries might have been caused in almost any way; this piece of iron might have caused them—it might possibly have caused the injury to the ankle, but it is very im<lb/>probable; I think a kick is more likely to have produced that—he was conscious, and, I think, sober—I should think those wounds would cause considerable suffering—I should think he would recover entirely in about six weeks now—his leg was put into plaster of Paris, and when that was dried, in about six hours, he was sent home—he is attending as an out-patient—I think his leg will be quite strong in six weeks; one wound in his head is not yet healed, but ought to be in a week or two; all the others have healed—I examined William Hearne when he was brought in—I found nothing the matter with him—he said his legs were broken; they were not—I gave him the electric battery and he walked away.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>)—the meat was corned beef, which was going to be prepared; there were 2 lb., 4 lb., 6 lb., and 14 lb. tins—tins were opened in my presence, some of which were bad—I said I should seize those as being unfit for food—I asked Alexander what was going to be done with the corned beef—he said it was going to be ground up and used for various kinds of potted meats—on looking round the premises I saw a number of tins of salmon and lobster; some had been opened—some the defendants opened at my request—those that were bad I seized—on another bench, opposite this bench, were small tins of meat in a box or case—I said, "Some of these are blown"—they were bulged at each end outwards; that indicates that gas had formed inside and blown the tins out—they were not fit for food—Alexander said, "I know they are a failure"—there were, I think, eighty four tins of bloater paste—some were opened subsequently some of the corned beef was mouldy on the top when the tins were opened—one of the defendants, both were present, said, "Yes, we <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> this meat out of the tin, cut a thick slice about an inch off the top, and smell the remainder"—I said I should seize it—one of the defendants agreed the small tins were</p>

               <p>bad, and said they were going to have them destroyed—I asked them where they purchased the meat, and the salmon and lobster—they said the meat came from Bundock's, and the salmon and lobster from Todd Brothers—I asked if they had any invoices, and they produced these two from Todd Brothers, containing the words, "We will always change any<lb/>thing absolutely useless for you"—I said, "I shall take the whole of these round to Thames Police Court"—that meant all I had seized—I took them, the Magistrate saw them, and they were condemned—I seized four 14 lb., ten 6 lb., eight 4 lb., and five 2 lb. tins of corned beef; also eight-four 2 oz. tins of bloater paste, twelve tins of salmon of from 1 lb. to 2 lb., and seven tins of lobster about the same size—the salmon and lobster may have been 1/2 lb. tins—the total seized was 130 tins—I gave them to our Sanitary Inspector, Mr. Lyon, with the invoices produced and my instruct<lb/>tions; within about a fortnight the articles were examined by him—Alexander described the process of manufacture—he said the corned beef was ground up, and made into various kinds of potted meats; the meat was put into tins, which were soldered down, and subjected to heat, pricked, and after the air was out, re-soldered—all I saw were in tin cases and hermetically sealed—as to some red herrings, I said, "What is done with this?—Alexander said, "Those are ground up, mixed with margarine, which you nee, and made into bloater paste"—on October 3rd, in consequence of information I received from Bastian, I next visited the premises with Lyon—I entered by the same door—I saw in the centre of the premises some cases containing tins of meat and rabbit—on the top of the cases were a number of opened tins; six of these were bad—the defendants agreed that they were bad—I said I should seize them—I asked one of them to open some tins of corned beef—afterwards, both Alexander and John opened twelve, seven of which were bad, and about half-a-dozen tins of rabbit, two of which were bad—whilst John was opening these tins, and the inspector was super<lb/>intending, I went round the premises; on coming back I saw Alexander standing at the entrance of what is marked on the plan as "Coal Store," and there I saw about sixty tins of soup—they were below, leaking and blackened—I said I should seize them as being bad and unfit for food.—Alexander said, "I know they are bad, they are going to be put in the furnace three or four at a time"—I said, "It will take a long time to get rid of them"—one tin of soup was found in the centre of the place near the tins—that was bad—I then requested Alexander to open some more—he said he might open the whole of them, and if they were good they could not possibly use them before they went bad—then I said I should take the whole I considered bad of the meat, the soup, and the rabbit to the police-court—he asked me to give him a note of all I seized—I at first refused, but he said he would not let the goods go off the premises, and I afterwards gave him a note—I did the name in July—he repeated the request, and said if I gave him A note he would get "others," or "good ones" for the ones seized—I said, "Where did this meat come from?" John said, "From Bundock's Alexander said, "No, it did not."—I then asked for invoices, which Alexander refused, and said, "I should like to have this matter thrashed out"—I said, "You will have an opportunity, no doubt, now"—about October 10th I received further information from Bastian, in consequence of which I called at 42,</p>

               <p>Ocean Street, with Lyon—I went in at the same door—I saw John Munro standing close to a bench—I said, "Have you any meat on the premises for me to see?"—he said, "No, only bloater paste, which you see we are making"—I looked round the ground-floor, including the Coal Store, and Lyon went the other side of the premises—on the bench was a large mass ground up—a mixture—John called Alexander down stairs—then Lyon called my attention to another part of the premises on the ground-floor, marked on the plan, at the end of a passage, close to the w.c.—behind a door I saw a number of tins of meat stacked up and opened—the inspector, Alexander, and myself were then in the yard—I said, "What are these?" indicating the meat that was stacked—Alexander said, "Oh, those are all good but two"—I examined them, and found eight out of eleven which I considered unfit for food—a number of large closed tins were lying in the corner unstacked—I said, "What are these?"—he picked up several, examined them, threw them down again, and said, "These are all right"—I said, "Open some of them for me"—he absolutely refused—I said I should do so myself, and Lyon began to open some—we opened six, four of which were bad—I said I should seize the lot, those that were unopened as well, the 4 and the 8—he said, "They are a very bad lot for the Magistrate to see, but they are good"—he picked up one of the four and smelled it—he said, "I shall have an opportunity of refuting this"—I said it was bad—he said, "I would swear to them in any court in, England"—I said, "You will be taken to the Court, and at two o'clock this afternoon you will have an opportunity"—became to the Courtat two o'clock with his solicitor—the Magistrate examined and condemned the meat—Alex<lb/>ander did not make any objection—I saw two canes tied with rope—I said, "What are these?"—he said, "They have nothing to do with you"—I said, "I shall see for myself," and I pulled the top off the cases—I took out-several small tins of potted meat with labels round them like <hi rend="italic">these</hi>, which I took off. (<hi rend="italic">Two labels were, produced, one of potted tongue and one of chicken, on which was</hi> "Palmer Brand," <hi rend="italic">a trade mark of a Palmer or Friar</hi>, and, "A Delicious Relish; Palmer's Bombay Works, Ocean Street, London, E"—I opened four or five—I said, "These are bad, and unfit for food"—he said, "I know they are; they are returns"—that was returns to them—I seized forty tins of potted meats and one tin of rabbit—one case con<lb/>tained nine dozen and another six dozen of assorted potted meats—there were 221 tins altogether—I left on the premises five of corned beef, which I found all right—on 3rd October I seized twelve 6-lb. tins of corned beef, one 4-lb. tin, and two 2-lb. tins of rabbit, sixty-one 2-lb. tins of soup—seventy-six tins; in July 130 tins—I saw no bloater paste left on the premises in July, only salmon, lobster, and tinned meats—on October 3rd I do not remember any soup being left; there was a quantity of beef, and probably two cases of rabbits—the corned beef seized was a dark colour, black in places, and had an offen<lb/>sive odour.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> If the bad meat were mixed with good food it would destroy it—it would make it unfit for food in time—if some of that seized were mixed with a large quantity of good meat it would probably neither smell nor taste after a time—the good would become bad in time—I mean it would not blow out for probably a week or a fort—</p>

               <p>night—that is the shortest time I can think of—the blowing out of the tin is one suspicious circumstance—it would put me on my guard—there was no difficulty in detecting that the meat was bad—the furnace would not influence it—I do not suppose any human being would purchase soup in the condition this was—it was like water—it had some fatty substance—I had visited the place some months before July 9th—the defendants said that any time I came I should find bad meat on the premises, and I said it would be my duty to seize it—I asked them what they did with the bad meat, they said their practice was to return it and get fresh tins in their place—I was not told that skilled men were employed to test everything that was used—I saw others there—I know nothing of Howse—a small fraction would turn out bad—I was not told the first lot had not been examined—I did not know when it had come in—I saw an invoice of July 4th, and one of July 9th of Todd Bros.—when I had said the potted meat was bad one defendant said, "I know they are"—they said something had gone wrong in the process—I do not remember their saying the tins were defective—I made this note of what took place on July 9th, the same day (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—the invoices were given to the inspector—I made inquiries of Todd Bros.' manager the next day—the soup tins held about a quart—nothing was said about the soup being intended for sale—nor whether the tins found in the passage had been examined—there was no roof to that part which was an extension of the passage outside the factory—I had no interview with the defendants after the 10th—I took no proceedings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I report to the Vestry; they ordered the prosecution on the advice of their solicitor—they meet every fortnight—I have made no experiment as to how long it takes for meat to go bad—the defendants called no skilled person to test the meat at any interview—nor suggested such a person was on the premises—bad soldering of tins would not account for the meat going bad—I was cold there were other invoices than the two produced—no others were produced at that time.</p>

Stanler, 150 and 151, Fenchurch Street—I have had eight years' experience in buying tinned meat, and buy 8,000 or 10,000 cases of tinned provisions in a year for them—this invoice A, shows five cases of corned beef, without saying the size—they are sold in 1 lb., 2 lb., 6 Ib. and 14 lb. sizes—2 lb. tins are about 14s., and 4 lb. tins 14s. to 20s. a case; 14 lb. tins are 30s.—there are sometimes twenty-four tins in a case, and sometimes forty eight—you cannot purchase corned beef at 12s. a case and get honest meat—the price on invoice E is 10s. a case of 6 lb. tins; the price of them is 20s. to 28s.—the next is three cases of 1/2 lb. lobster at 8s.; the value of that is 40s. a case; it is one-fifth of the wholesale market price—nearly all salmon is in 1 lb. tins; it was possible to buy that at 15s. last July—F does not say what number of tins—here are two cases of tinned rabbit; they are generally 1 lb. tins, at about 7s. a dozen—the price here is 10d.—I could not buy it sound at that price—we have acted as agents for the sale of Palmer's goods for about ten months—it is the practice to allow for tins of bad meat; we sometimes have them back and sometimes not; the average of returned goods is not more than one per cent., and upon Palmer's goods returned it is about six per cent; the total dealings we had with Palmer's are 1,482 gross supplied and 83 gross returned; that makes up the six per cent.</p>

I am an analytical chemist, of 19 and 20, Aldgate, and Fellow of the Institute of Chemistry of Great Britain and Ireland, and of several scientific societies, and public analyst of the Whitechapel district, and hold other public appointments—I have for many years had experience in the examination of animal matter in the various stages of putrefaction, and am acquainted with the chemical changes which take place—I have heard Dr. Taylor's description of these articles—in my judgment they were absolutely putrid—it is possible, by heating putrid meat and flavouring it with spices, to remove the taste and smell, and it would then pass as good, but it would probably be poisonous—it might keep for an indefinite period, assuming that all the germs of putrefaction were destroyed, but if a small quantity of air was left be<lb/>hind, putrefaction would re-appear; the time would depend on the germs left behind and the temperature in which it was; in some cases it would show germs of putrefaction in three days, and in other places three months—if the meat had mould on the top, none of it would be safe to eat.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It is possible so to treat meat that the objection, would be removed; you would know it as cooked meat; and, with flavour<lb/>ing, the public would not recognise it, but it would still retain the poisonous matter, which would be deleterious to health—it is practically impossible to destroy all the germs, but it is possible to neutralise them over a period of three months; the principal process is great heat to destroy the animal matter—by using water which contains chalk they get a higher heat than with plain water.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the defendants in this case—my father's name was Donald Munro—he was engaged in this business up to July last, and I was brought up to it—I am now twenty-six—my brother was over me, not this brother—another brother was employed as a general workman—I took the management on July 27th, after which I had the control of the business, and my brother John assisted me—Palmer had carried on the business which my father acquired, and his name was always continued in the business, which is that of preservers and packers of potted meat and soups—our staff varied in winter, but it was about fifty in the summer—after July, Howard was employed as <hi rend="italic">chef;</hi> he had a special know<lb/>ledge of the work; he came to us from one the biggest houses in the land, Peck's, in Snow Hill—I was the buyer from July 26th; sometimes I could buy as many as 100 cases at a time, sometimes I could buy only small quantities—the bulk of the meat comes from America—shipments arrive every week; sometimes they are small, and sometimes very large—from July to the end of the year I bought about 800 to 1,000 cases—the meat so bought is brought on to the premises direct from the seller and packed in a warehouse, and when we are going to use it the things are all opened, and it goes before the <hi rend="italic">chef</hi> for examination, and if he finds a bad one he puts that on one side—when the whole of the parcel is examined, the bad ones are returned to the seller and credited to our account, or others given in the place of them—no meat is allowed to be prepared for food before it has passed the <hi rend="italic">chef</hi>, after that it is taken from the tin, put through a machine, put on a bench and spices added to it, and it again goes through the machine; it is then taken from the machine-room to the filling-out machine, after which it is soldered down and then examined for leaks; they then go to the preserving tank and are boiled in water at boiling point; the steam is turned on; they are then taken from the tank and pricked in a small hole to allow the air to escape; the hole is then re-soldered, and they are put back into the preserving tank until they are preserved sufficiently, and the tins are wiped before they go upstairs—we have thousands of customers—the manufactured stock was kept on the top floor, the bulk of it, and some in the larder, which is on the ground floor, referred to as the passage—we made from 10,000 to 12,000 tins a day, and the turnover from July to December was about £17,000—I have purchased meat of Bundock, Todd, Steade, and Bishop, which is one of the biggest houses in the trade—we do not buy of McCall; we cannot buy large enough—I have bought good meat at those prices from all those people, and below those prices—some tins are spoiled in the soldering process; we very often find a leaky tin sent us; it floats on the water, but the contents would not be bad—we take back bad tins at any time—we sent out six or seven million tins between July and the end of the year, and we have not had one complaint as to the condition of the meat—the name "Palmer" was not on all the tins we sent out; some wholesale people prefer their own label put upon them, and we have them printed for them, but on the others the name is Palmer—Dr. Taylor came on July 9th—tins sometimes give from bad soldering; anybody who passes and sees a tin floating, takes it out and it is sent to Stevens' shoot, or burnt in the furnace—as to stock</p>

               <p>returned, customers sometimes put it in a damp place; that has more effect on them than anything, and at times they are placed in a grocer's window near the gas, and almost baked; but whatever the fault is, we take them back, even if caused by the customers—it is not to our interest to have returns; it damages us; it is not necessary that the contents of the tins should be bad that they should be credited—one wit<lb/>ness Perrins never communicated with me, though I was still supplying him with large quantities; we sent them a quarter of a million labels of a special brand just before this prosecution—Dr. Taylor came to our place on three occasions but never examined the stock; on the second occasion, October 3rd, he looked at a few tins in the stock room and found nothing, and went down again; he found it was all good, and took nothing from there—on July 9th eighty-four tins of potted meat were seized, they were on a stove in front of the preserving tank by themselves entirely separated from our stock—they were all what we call traitors; none of them were intended to be sold—the bulk of our tins which would go to the public were on the first floor, but, of course, there is always a large amount of stock downstairs, because it is coming out of the tank all day; but as soon as it is manufactured it goes upstairs—the sixty-one tins of soup were found three feet from the boiler door—there is a passage where coal is kept; that is where they were found—the contents might not have been bad, but the tins were—they were going to be burnt—we should not put them on the fire while we were using steam—the other lot came from customers; those were the two oases which were taken from the yard, and contained tins of potted meat—I showed them to Dr. Taylor; they must have been supplied some time before, because it was an old label—we had no intention of re-selling them; we sometimes examine returned tins, and if we found any of them good we should have to re-lacquer and re-label them, and we should not feel justified in doing that—six tins of corned beef were on top of a stack of cases labelled "bad"—they had been condemned by the <hi rend="italic">chef</hi>—when Dr. Taylor asked for the bad ones we sent for them to the back yard, and brought in thirteen or fifteen tins of corned beef, which had already been opened and condemned by the <hi rend="italic">chef</hi>—the doctor then asked for other tins; we opened some others, and one tin the doctor said was bad, and I said that it was good; we had an argument about it, and eventually the doctor left it behind—those tins had not been opened before, either by me or the <hi rend="italic">chef</hi>—the lot brought from the yard came from Dunlop, and the others from Todd Brothers, on the same day that the doctor came—nothing had been done to them before he arrived; they were on the van, and we had no opportunity—as part of the same purchase from Todd Brothers, there was a quantity of calinon and lobster which came in that way—an invoice was produced that day—the lobster we bought was from a lot Todd Brothers had had; it was a parcel made up of odd tins; odds and ends, and others were damaged in the side, and would not sell in a shop—the lobster turned out better than the salmon—we gave a fair market price for the corned beef; I have bought it since, and I could buy it to-day—there is no difficulty whatever in getting good tins from people whose tins we object to—it would be impossible to put bad meat with good, one taint of sour-ness would turn a dozen tins bad—invoices were sent for, and we gave them—there was another visit on October 3rd—the thirteen tins seized</p>

               <p>that day came about October 1st, from Webster's—they are in a large way of business with regard to meat—this is their invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Mr. Webster is here—on October 3rd we had some hundreds of tins in the factory—the cases opened that day were opened in Dr Taylor's presence—none of them had been examined by the <hi rend="italic">chef</hi>—we were asked to open particular tins selected for the purpose—I told the doctor he might open any number of tins, but we should not be able to use them before they went bad—we can only use a certain number of tins a day, and we are not making meat all day, we are making bloater paste—we begin work at seven a.m., and the doctor came at eleven; we like to use the meat the same day as we open it—we had eight cases of rabbit in stock from Webster's, which represents 192 tins, and two tins were found—Webster brought a tin of rabbit a few days before, as a sample; we opened the tin, found the contents good, and bought the rabbits, but we kept the sample tin to see if the bulk corresponded with it; it was thrown under a bench—the doctor opened about eight of the other tins, which he selected, and found one bad one; the tins were still in the cases just as they were delivered—we had the sample tin open several days be<lb/>fore, and it was rotten, but we had to see that we got the same sized tin as the sample—the tin was brought in, and opened, and found to be good—the price given for them was the price at which we could buy them good—on October 3rd, when the six tins of soup were spoken of, we had 18,000 tins in the larder upstairs—that is not an open place by the w.c., it is beyond the office—when Dr. Taylor came on October 10th, we had between 400 and 600 tins of beef on the premises, some in the passage, some in the factory, and some in the larder—there were tins of meat in the yard which had not been examined—we had had a consignment of meat from Webster that day, and there was a consignment of 2 lb. tins of beef from Stephen Bishop on the safe—I cannot say when that had come in—there were three stacks of tins in the yard, just put down, which had not been examined, and another lot which had been turned out of the cases and not examined, and another lot which had been examined and not passed, found not good—the good ones were either standing open, or had been taken into the factory—some of them had been examined when the doctor came—I came down and saw the doctor in the yard—he opened quite fifty tins on the third occasion—between thirty and forty were found bad, and he took away five or six—they were bulged and pricked—the doctor asked me to open tins; I refused; I had given him every assistance, and had already told him that we wanted the matter thrashed out—he left two cases and some odd tins open and good—I say that what the doctor says is not correct—he opened the tins in the yard and handed to me what he said were, good, and we put them just inside the door, and the bad ones he had put in the passage—I had in my possession when he went tins which had been passed and taken into the factory, and tins opened while he was there and passed; and, further, we had sent in on the evening of his visit of October 10th a van-load of beef which we had on the premises; he did not care to examine the meat that was in the factory, but he came in at the factory door and saw it; he made direct for the yard, and after he had done with the yard he went away—forty or fifty cases were not opened; we cannot decide upon them without opening</p>

Gumming and Co.'s and Arthur and Co's, of Barbican, and with a firm on Snow Hill, and at Bolton and Noel's—those are persons well known in the trade—my duty at Ocean Street was to examine all tins returned after they were opened, which was always on the ground floor, and those not fit for use were cast on one side—my strict injunction from Mr. Munro was that I was not to pass anything that was not perfectly good, and good stuff was to be returned for them—I carried out those instructions, and good tins were given in</p>

Tins in a day if we are working from seven a.m. to nine p.m.—we examine at all hours of the day—the girls do that, but I have to pass the meat before it goes to the machine, and before passing the contents into the tins I sometimes come across a bad one. I might reject two or three tins of corned beef a day, or five or six after the girls have opened them—there is co limit—the floaters are not bad, it is good stuff—one box of small tins in October were all floaters without labels, but I cannot tell you how many were in a case—I will swear that a box of floaters was seized—one of the cases seized on October 10th contained all floaters—they had no labels, and could never have been sent out—some of them were only half full.</p>

                  </hi>. I was the petitioner in a suit for divorce from my wife, which came on for hearing in December, 1894—the Queen's Proctor afterwards intervened, and that intervention came on in November, 1895—on the first trial of the suit counter-charges were made against me by my wife—I went into the witness-box and made a general denial of the charges—at that time no charge was made against me with any person in Besborough Gardens—when the Queen's Proctor inter<lb/>vened, he alleged adultery with some person in Besborough Gardens, and also with Mrs. Robertson about December 6th, 1893, and alleging that I had visited her about Christmas, 1892—in November, 1895, I was present with witnesses to meet those allegations—I did not go into the witness-box about Besborough Gardens, but I did not admit it—I think it was the next morning after the decree had been rescinded that I consulted my present solicitor about the proceedings for perjury—I was present when the prisoner gave evidence, and also the prisoner, Ellen Rock. (<hi rend="italic">The evidence given by the prisoner Brown was put in and read; it in substance alleged that while in the service of hrs. Rawle, on December</hi> 26<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1893, <hi rend="italic">he was sent for to</hi> 73, <hi rend="italic">Egerton Gardens, to assist at a luncheon party, and that he there saw Mr. Cox with Madge Robertson, Miss Rawle, Mr. Cox, and two other gentlemen, one called Hoppy, with certain photographs on the mantelpiece, etc.</hi>) I have never in my life been inside 73, Egerton Gardens—I have never spoken to or been in the company of Miss Rawle—I know of a man nicknamed Hoppy; I do not know him personally—I was not in his company in 1893—I have never been in his company except in the hunting-field—I have never been in Mrs. Robert<lb/>son's company, either about Christmas, 1892 or 1893—I think the last time I was in her company was about 1886 or 1837—1887 probably—she was one of my witnesses at the Divorce Court—I had not been in her com<lb/>pany since 1887 until I saw her in Court—I was not in London at Christ<lb/>mas, 1893—I left London about December 17th or 18th, and went to Paris to attend a Commission to take evidence on one of my wife's charges, and I then proceeded to Cap Martin, Mentone, where I remained till January 4th in the following year—my solicitor, Mr. Greenwood, went with me from London, and Mr. Burke and my son, Raymond, and Mr. Miller, a tutor—we stayed together at the Hotel Maurice, Paris, and my son, Mr. Bourke, and Mr. Miller went on to Mentone with me—while at Mentone I corresponded with my solicitor in Paris and in London—I think he returned to London—I was in Paris at the taking of some evidence on the Commission in relation to this suit—I had never been such photographs as the prisoner described at Mrs. Robertson's I had no knowledge of any photographs of mine being there—I have been photographed in a jockey dress—I used to ride as a gentleman jockey and I have been photographed in a foraging cap and undress uniform—I don't know of their having been sold.</p>

               <p>general denial of the charge—I was not cross-examined—six months afterwards the Queen's Proctor intervened, he left it to the last time—the prisoner and Miss Rock were not my witnesses, they did not take any part in it—they have not been connected with any private inquiry agents—I think four charges of adultery were made against me by my wife—I contested the Queen's Proctor's case up to the time I went into the witness-box; the case went on for three days, I think—I did not know these two people, they said they knew me; I know they did not, but Brown may have seen me, or pointed to me in Court and said, "I know you," but I did not know him—when the Queen's Proctor had judgment I was saddled with all the costs of the proceedings—I was a little annoyed—this is my prosecution, in the interests of justice and the public—I think there were two or three applications before Mr. Vaughan granted the summons—I did not apply personally, I was represented by my solicitor—I think he applied three times—I had heard what the prisoner had sworn, every word of it; he said he had been sent for by some servant of Mrs. Robertson, or Miss Robertson, I think he gave some name, to wait at table—I did not inquire whether he had been sent for I did not know anything about it—we knew that there was a party; he mentioned in his evidence that a servant of Mrs. Robertson's came for him; I think he said Miss Shaw—I think the prisoner said the Queen's Proctor sent for him—I am very angry with the Queen's Proctor; I think I have not been treated fairly—my representative saw Miss Shaw; I saw her myself—I do not know where she is now; I have no idea—Rock was a servant of Madame Middleton; so I understood; she was not a servant when I knew Mrs. Mid<lb/>dleton; that was the first time I saw her; I could not say who the servant was—in the defendant's statement he explained how he went to Miss Middleton's house; no doubt he was sent for and did come there—I had not been to her house, 33, Egerton Gardens; it was No. 67—she is a lady I had met in town; I spoke to her once when having supper at the Continental, and I saw her once at a club called the Gardeners—I should say that this lady did have a a luncheon party; I take that for granted—I have no doubt that the prisoner was sent for and did wait; and no doubt Miss Rawle was there, and two gentlemen whom I knew; I know who they were; I think one of them is in trouble with Dr. Jame<lb/>son at Pretoria—he is a short gentleman with a clean-shaven face; the other is one that was there, he has come back; I think he is called "the criminal"—his appearance has been described; I never had him described to me; I am told he was a fair man—I have heard that he is not a bit like me; a lady told me so—I saw Miss Rawle at the Court while the Queen's Proctor's case was going on—she is one of my witnesses; I had not spoken to her then; there was no reason why I should not have spoken to her; I have a slight acquaintance with her—I under<lb/>stand that Mrs. Rawle went to see the prisoner after he gave evidence; and the woman, Miss Rock, after she had given her evidence; I can't remember the details; something of that kind was said—Miss Rock was another servant of Miss Rawle's, a fellow servant of the prisoner.</p>

I live at 12, Ovington Gardens—I know Mrs. Robert<lb/>son, who is also called Madge Middleton—in 1893 she lived at 73, Egerton Gardens—I was present at the Divorce Court in November last for the purpose of giving evidence on Mr. Cox's behalf—it is not true that I was at a luncheon party in Egerton Gardens in 1893—I was never in Egerton Gardens in 1893—as far as I know I do not think there was any luncheon party there at Christmas, 1893—I believe I heard at that time that Mrs. Robertson was ill—I was never at any luncheon party in the presence of Mr. Cox—I had never spoken to him up to the time I saw him at the Divorce Court—the prisoner was in my service as a manservant—Ellen Rock was also my servant in my husband's time—they were in my service up to about a year ago last Christmas, 1894—I think I discharged them in that year; they were with me in 1893; I think they were with me from three to four years—I cannot quite tell; three to four; I almost think it was three, both of them—on Boxing Day, 1892, I went to lunch with Mrs. Robertson—the prisoner went there to wait on that occasion—there were two guests besides Mrs. Robertson and myself; two gentle<lb/>men; I am quite sure only two; Mr. Cox was not one of them—there were no photographs of Mr. Cox on Mrs. Robertson's mantelpiece at that time—I have never seen any photographs of Mr. Cox in my life—I am quite sure there were no such photographs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cotton merchant in Laurence Lane—among other things I deal in Silesian cloth—in the early part of January I sold four rolls of Silesian cloth to Mr. Peacock for something under £5; there were from 80 to 86 yards in each piece—that cloth was given to an employe, Taylor, to take to Mr. Peacock, who lives at Camber<lb/>well—Taylor came and gave my manager certain information—this is one of the rolls.</p>

I live at 40, Napier Street, Hoxton, a tenement house—Velven occupies the top rooms upstairs; I occupy the parlour and kitchen—on Saturday, January 4th, someone gave one knock at the door; our friends knock once for us, and three times for the upstairs people; but a stranger would not know that as there is nothing on the door about it—I went to the door and saw the prisoner—I did not notice whether there was anything by the kerb then—he asked for Velven—I said, "You had better knock three times"—he did so—I left the door open and went away—I think Velven came down, I am not sure—as soon as I got in the kitchen, I noticed a truck just opposite the door, with four blue things, like these rolls, on it—it was between nine and ten in the morning—I saw them again on the following Tuesday, when the prisoner came again, about the same time in the morning—I was in the area, and looked up and saw him—I did not see if anyone was with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Brabbington, a pawnbroker, of Wardour Street—I know France as a pawning customer—on December 30th France pledged this clock with our manager for £1—he asked £1 5s.—on January 1st he came in and said, "I want to see this clock" I took the ticket to the manager, who said, "Is this your property?"—France said, "The man sent me to pledge it, Mr. Williams"—the manager said, "Go and fetch Mr. Williams"—he went out—France came back some time afterwards by himself, and wanted to know what was the matter—he can talk English—the manager told him to fetch Mr. Williams—he came back some time afterwards with Lewis, and then said he would fetch a policeman to clear himself; he wanted to know what was the</p>

               <p>matter—he was asked to explain how he became possessed of the clock, and he threw down some tickets and said he would fetch a policeman—Lewis stopped in the shop—a policeman came back with France and took him into custody—I had not seen Lewis before—the other tickets did not relate to property pawned at our place.</p>

About 1.30 on 1st January I was called to the George and Dragon public-house, Greek Street, Soho, by France—he there accused Lewis, who was at the public-house, of giving him three pawn tickets concerning stolen property—Lewis said nothing—I took him to Brabbington's, in Wardour Street, where the manager examined the tickets and identified them as relating to stolen property—he identified France as pawning this clock—France said, "That is quite right; I did pawn the clock"—I took the prisoners to the station—on the way Lewis said, "I bought those pawn tickets of a man I know by sight."</p>

On January 1st I went to Brabbing<lb/>ton's, and saw this china clock—I afterwards went to Vine Street Police-station, where I saw both prisoners—I told them they would be taken into custody for committing a burglary at 14, Earl's Terrace, Kensington—Lewis said he gave these two tickets, and in fact all the tickets to France to sell, and he bought them of a man he did not know—one of the tickets related to this skeleton clock, and the other to the knives, pawned at Aldous' in Berwick Street.</p>

I was with Travis, on January 1st, when the prisoners were arrested—I told France he would be charged with Lewis, with breaking into this dwelling-house, and stealing £30 or £40 worth of pro<lb/>perty—he said, "I did not break into any house, the clock was brought by a man to my address on the 30th about 11 a.m., and he asked me to pledge it at Brabbington's, Leicester Square, for £1; I did so, and gave him the money and also the ticket; I was not in the neighbourhood at the time the burglary was committed"—Lewis said, "I shall get out of this; I did not break into any house."</p>

I am the wife of George Brandon, and live at Leighton Buzzard—on 19th December I went to the Holloway Mortuary and there identified the body of Maria Chipperfield—I had known her all her life as Maria Clarke—my husband and I had adopted her when she was two years old—her mother lived in London—the girl lived with us as our daughter until December, 1893, for fifteen years; she then went up to London to take a situation as barmaid—she came down to see us at Leighton Buzzard and stayed with us for a few days, and the prisoner came to see her from time to time—she came to us again on the 13th, and stayed till some time early in December, and on the 7th she left and went to London—I next saw her on the 17th December, when she returned to us with the prisoner as her husband—I had previously received a telegram from her—they said they had just come from Cork, that they had been married there—they stayed with us that night—in the course of the evening he showed us a razor, which he said he had bought at Cork-next morning she was not very well; she went back to bed, but ultimately they went to London by the 1.40 train—I saw them off to our station—they then seemed to be on very good terms—she was a right-handed girl.</p>

If you had told me a week or two ago I could have had everything ready, so I hope you will consider this as best, and postpone it for two days, it will not make much difference, will it? Mother is very nasty about it; I shall be glad to get away from here again. I hope you got home all right last night, as I did.

It makes it so late when I get over the other aide. I shall not be in to-night, as I have some business to do at Stratford after I have finished. I hope you will not go with anybody else of an afternoon. I shall not take May out again in a hurry. I always told you that she was no class.

I thought when I came in on Sunday morning there was something on, else for my not wanting to take you out in the afternoon. I should only have been too pleased to do so; but as it was such a wretched day, and being a short Sunday, I did not think you would care to come. I have 'turned over a new leaf, and feel much better for it. I want you to meet me at the Bank to-morrow at 2.30, I have something I wish to ask you. It is not very nice for me to come and see you when you are making arrangements with other fellows. It it just the same; if I were in your place you would not like it. Anybody would think I was a fool. I thought after what you told me last Sunday you would be all right. I had no sleep all last night through you. I think it is very unkind of you to go on like this, when I am trying to do my best for you. I have been greatly upset lately without you making more trouble. I was going abroad, only I put it off for you. You know I love you, and would do anything for you. Of course, if you do not like me, I would rather you tell me than to make a fool of me. I can assure you that since we made it up I have not been with one girl. I shall not say any more at present, so trusting you are quite well, I remain, yours truly, A. <hi rend="smallCaps">CHIPPBRFIELD</hi>."—"126<hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi>, Bermondsey Street, S.E., London, November 13th, 1895.—Dear Annie,—It was unkind of you not to turn up the other afternoon. It was not because you could not come, because I saw you looking out of the window, and the same when I was on the 'bus coming back. One thing, I was not put out, as I had to come to the City Road. I do not know why you want to be so nasty towards me lately; I know I have said some nasty things to you when I have been half drunk, but it is no use to keep thinking about old sores. I have apologised to you, and I am sure it will not happen again. Will you write, and let me know, per return, if you will come out on Sunday if fine, or, if not, Tuesday next, so as I can make arrangements? You know very well that I love you, and it greatly upsets me by your being so off-handed. Do not forget to write.

                  </hi> (427 <hi rend="italic">N</hi>). On the evening of the 18th I went to Bar<lb/>tholomew's Hospital, and remained there in custody of the prisoner—he spoke to me that evening, I was in plain clothes—on the 19th he touched me on the arm, and said, "Have you seen my wife?"—I said, "No"—he said, "She is in the mortuary"—I said, "Oh!"—he then said, "I wish it was me instead of her, for she was a good girl—we were married on Monday, and came to London on Wednesday; took a cab from Euston and stopped at a <hi rend="italic">pub.</hi> just outside the station, and had a drink, and then stopped again at the White Hart Public-house, Liverpool Road. I left my wife there some time, and went to try and find a <hi rend="italic">pal</hi> of mine, Frank Cannon, but could not find him. I got in the cab again, and we drove down Essex Road. I remember we were all right when we passed the Brewers' Public-house, you know where I mean; but I don't remember anything after that, only drawing the razor across my own throat. I suppose I must have cut her throat; but, my God, I should not like to think I did. I bought the razor in Cork, as I had been there about a fortnight, and I had been shaving myself: I bought a brush, too. Did not you find it?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "We were going to call at my father's house in Annette Crescent, and then go to where we were going to stay"—that was all that was said on the 19th—on the 21st he spoke to me again—he said, "The inquest on my wife was to-day, so my sister said. Do you know what the verdict was?"—I said, "No, I don't"—he said, "I wish they would let me see the papers, but they won't"—I said "Oh, won't they?"—he said, "I should be a lot easier in my mind if they would"—I don't suppose I shall be out of here before Christmas, shall I?"—I said, "I am sure I could not say"—"Ah, well," he said, "I don't want to be, for I can have my friends come to see me here, and they would not allow me to see any at Pentonville, would they?"—I said "I don't know"—he spoke to me again on the 2nd of January—he then said, "Well, there is one thing I like about you that are watching me, you policemen, I mean, you have never asked me any questions about this job, and I have not said anything particular to you; what I have said you are not going to say anything about it, are you?"—I said, "Yes, there are some things will have to be mentioned"—he said, "What I said to you?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Well, that is not much."</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I knew the deceased girl; I knew her when she was a barmaid at the Star; she and the prisoner kept company, and walked out together—I used to go to the Star with the prisoner; I never usred the house; I have seen her and the prisoner together, when she was behind the bar—I have never spoken to her about the prisoner when he has not been there; once I did—she did not say that sooner than marry him she would kill herself—I heard her say that she wished to Christ she was dead; that was not in connection with her marriage to the prisoner; some time before. I and a friend were speaking about how she was going on at the time the prisoner and her were keeping company—she did not say, "I wish I was dead "in reference to her approach<lb/>ing marriage with the prisoner; we said to her, "You are enjoying your<lb/>self all right" and she said, "No;*I wish to Christ I was dead"—that was about four months before she left her situation—I could not tell you about the date; I don't keep dates—when I heard she was found dead in the cab of course that expression came to my memory; I say that was about four months before her marriage—she did not seem excited when she said it; she seemed tome all right—I said, "What do you mean?" and she said, "All right," and nodded her head and walked away; that was the only time she said that in my hearing—she did not strike me as excitable—I have never been with them when they were walking out together; have been with them for a drive; I did not notice that a little thing would put her out—I can't say that I have ever seen her very cross, or out of temper—I had known her about two years; during that time I have never seen her out of temper—the prisoner did not tell me that he was going to get married—I have met him at the Star; I generally saw him at the Two Brewers; that is not far from Annette Crescent.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an M.D. practising in Essex Road—on December 18th, about eleven p.m., on returning from visiting, I found Dr. Gray at my surgery, and the deceased woman; she was then dead—the prisoner was also there; he was bleeding from a wound in his throat; it was such a wound as might have been self-inflicted, it went from left to right, just about the middle of the larynx, across the front of the throat, transversely—after attending to his wound I sent him to the hospital—afterwards, on December 21st, in conjunction with Dr. Gray, I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the body of Maria Chipperfield—when I first saw her she was wearing gloves on both hands—they had been taken off when I made <hi rend="italic">the post-mortem</hi>—there was a cut on the forefinger of the left glove—I found a wound on her throat, it was three inches and a-half in length, commencing an inch below the angle of the jaw on the left side, half an inch from the inner side, extending obliquely downwards, and to the left; it was deep at the commencement, and got shallower as it pro<lb/>ceeded, and the skin was at last divided on the left—it was about half an inch deep on the right; it had divided the left vertebrae and the branches of the external carotid artery, and divided the windpipe—that wound was the cause of death—there was a wound on the forefinger of the left hand, commencing at the knuckle on the thumb side, a slice was taken off—it was difficult to say in which direction; I could not tell; looking at the glove, I should say it was from before, backwards; there is the flap of a cut in the glove, which shows that the cut must have been that way, away from the thumb, not towards it; from the general appearance of the wound I certainly say that it could have been self-inflicted—it could have been inflicted by another person—the cut on the finger might have been inflicted either way—from the character of the wound alone I should say it more resembled a self-inflicted wound than a homicidal one—it seems more probable that a woman would scream after having a wound inflicted upon her than having inflicted it herself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was examined twice before the Magistrate—on the first occasion I was shown this glove—the scream leads to the opinion that the wounds were not self-inflicted—leaving out the scream, I am of opinion that they were self-inflicted—if the scream was after the cut, I should say it was self-inflicted, on the ground of the oblique direction from right to left—I have examined the glove, and the cut on the finger; if she took the razor in her left hand, and drew it across her throat, that would account for the appearance of the wound—the cut on the glove is</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189602030085"/>
               <p>below the knuckle—the direction of the flap of leather alters my opinion, it could not very well be done in that way—I saw the glove before I gave my evidence before the Magistrate—I only said it might possibly have been done so, but very improbably; that bit of leather is the only thing that makes me change my opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I said at the Police-court, "The wound on the left hand must have been done by the sharp part of the razor, and could have been done if the woman was holding the razor in her hand"—at the time I said that I had not in my mind the direction of the wound, as is now indicated by the flap of the glove—I now say that changes my opinion—in my judgment, the wound on the neck could have been inflicted by a person sitting beside her in the cab—I adhere to that—the wound on the finger might possibly be produced by her putting up her hand to protect herself—I adhere to that—I also say that the oblique direction of the wound from above downwards leads me to think it might have been self-inflicted, that it would be more probably caused by a self' inflicted wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. That would entirely depend upon the position of the person—if a person was lying on a bed the cut would be right across; if otherwise it would be more obliquely upwards—if the person were higher than the person sitting by the side probably the wound would be more transverse than obliquely downwards—a wound inflicted by another person is generally horizontal; that would depend upon the position of the parties towards each other at the time—I was examined before the coroner before I gave evidence* before the magistrate—the coroner asked me, "Do you think a woman would scream after inflicting such a wound upon herself?" and I said, "I think it improbable"—I still say if it was self-inflicted it must have been done with the left hand; if inflicted by any one else I could not say whether it was with the right or left hand; if the woman was sitting on the left hand, it could be done—if sitting in that position it would be impossible to use her left hand, in that case I think it would be done farther back, it would depend upon how much he was in front of her; if the man got up and stood in front of her, that would account for it; there was luggage on the seat in front.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the Westminster Hospital and lecturer on forensic medicine, of 7, The Sanctuary, Westminster Abbey—I have had a very large experience in surgery generally; I have heard the description of the wounds found on the deceased both on the throat and the finger, also of the wound on the prisoner's throat, also the evidence as to the woman screaming—in my judgment it was probably not self-inflicted—it was such a wound as might have been caused by a man sitting or standing by her side in the cab—in my judgment it was probably so caused—the obliquity of the direction of the wound does not, in my judgment, make it in the slightest degree improbable; it indicates nothing except the relative position to each other; I mean, if the man was above the woman at the time, the obliquity would be downwards, because he would cut away from himself; if he was on a level very likely it would be transverse, and if he was below the level it would be probably up<lb/>wards—I have seen this glove, and heard the description of the wound there—in my opinion that was not a wound likely to have been caused by the woman herself on her own finger, in my judgment it would more likely to have been caused by the razor being drawn from above down-wards, across the finger from the thumb, from inside towards the end of the finger—if she had put up her hand and the razor had caught the hand before it had caught the throat, that would be the cut that would be made—the screaming does not help me in forming my opinion, inasmuch as I have never heard a woman scream after cutting her throat, and I have never seen it written.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I say if the wound was self-inflicted it could only be done by the left hand, taking the wound alone; possibly a left-handed man might inflict such a wound—the incline particularly shows me it was not done with the woman's left hand—the glove was stained with dry blood a little, not much—I cannot imagine that such a wound would be caused by the razor being held in the left hand, not even if the razor slipped, I have tried it—my idea that the wound was not self-inflicted is not based upon a hypothetical position of the prisoner in the cab, my opinion is based upon the wound itself; it might have been caused by a person sitting or standing, either way—a person who saw the dead body, and saw the glove on the hand would be in a better position to form a judgment than one who had not seen it, if one had not had an accurate description—of course we do not know that all are skilled as to forensic medicine—I am not basing my opinion upon the evidence of persons not skilled—I consider they are not skilled in this matter; that is my opinion.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">These were signed by Kemp, and marked, "Refer to drawer</hi>") I also sold him a diamond ring, price £6; he was to have it on approval till next night, Sunday, as I was going to Liverpool—I have obtained back all the jewellery supplied to Kemp—on the Saturday morning, after he had selected the jewellery for himself, Clark came in and Kemp said, "This is the gentleman who wants the jewellery"—he examined some, and made an appointment at the same place at seven p.m; I went there and found Reece, Kemp and Clark—before that Kemp said that Clark had plenty of</p>

Burrell as directors—they each had a qualification of five shares; Major Claridge's were given to him by Kennedy out of his 900; Dr. Burrell was going to pay for his, I understood—I received no money from either of them—I don't think the five shares were ever given to Dr. Burrell—rafter about two months I got letters from Claridge and Burrell, resigning; I showed them to Kennedy—we had no dealings with the City Bank, Bond Streets who were named as the company's bankers; nothing was ever paid in or out—I did not get one halfpenny of my salary—I asked Kennedy for it; he always put me off—I took the furniture on August 31st, and sold it; for £10, which I kept in lieu of salary—I saw Mrs. Emily Wilson; she was appointed manageress of the Bond Street Branch; but it was never opened—I think, if money had come in, the branch was to be started at once on other premises—I saw this prospectus of July 20th, 1894—I have here the agreement of July 17th, 1894, between Kennedy and the company,</p>

I live at Blackpool, and am a widow—in May, 1894, my attention was attracted by this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>, to which I replied—I received this answer from Kennedy on May 15th, 1894 (<hi rend="italic">asking her to call, and stating that a small sum would have to be invested as security</hi>)—I desired to obtain employment where the duties were light—I came to (own, and saw Kennedy at 4, Abingdon Villas, and afterwards went to 31, Wool Exchange, where I saw White—Kennedy told me I had been appointed as lady superintendent to the company at £4 a week, but that I should be required to find £200 as security for the money that passed through my hands—I returned home, and on May 21st I forwarded a cheque for £100 to Mr. White—I received a letter of May 22nd from Kennedy, acknowledging the receipt of the cheque for £100 by White—I afterwards forwarded a second cheque for £100 on May 24th to White—on June 1st I received this acknowledgment from Kennedy. (<hi rend="italic">The receipt was for the balance due for preliminary expenses in accordance with the agreement; and the agreement was that in considera<lb/>tion of her providing</hi> £200 <hi rend="italic">towards the preliminary expenses of promoting the company the would be appointed superintendent at</hi> £4 <hi rend="italic">a week, and receive</hi> 200 <hi rend="italic">shares as security.</hi>) I sub<lb/>sequently came to town, and went to 4, Abingdon Villas and Bond Street—no business was done there—I got no employment—I asked</p>

White was the company promoter—as far as I saw he was really the active person; he was to find the money—I understood that from Kennedy all along—White was to finance and promote the company—Kennedy always expressed the belief that, if the money was found, the company would be a paying concern—he said he had many promises through White and others that the shares would be taken up—he expressed himself on several occasions disappointed that the pro<lb/>mises had not been fulfilled—he was always in hopes—both the cheques I sent were payable to White's order and crossed, and were paid bearing his endorsement—I did not talk over the matter with Mr. Deighton, my solicitor, before I parted with either cheque, I did afterwards consult him—I took no proceedings to recover the money—the Public Prosecutor communicated with me about last December; up to that time I had no idea of taking proceedings against Kennedy or any one else.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer, of 9, Gracechurch Street—I registered the American and Parisian Massage Co. at White's request, and, subsequently, at his request, did printing for that company—between May 25th, 1894, and April 11th, 1895, I printed about 17 different prospectuses, each containing alterations, at White's direction—I printed 500 copies of one prospectus, when the premises were opened at Bond Street—I printed this book of 250 share warrants in June, 1895, at Kennedy's request, and gave it to him when he called—the prospectuses were paid for, the share warrants were not—these are specimens of the prospectuses.</p>

I had known White for some years, and had done a great deal of business for him; all the orders for printing the prospectuses came from him—I printed the 500 prospectuses in 1894, when the office was in Bond Street; the other prospectuses were limited to proofs; they were substantially the same, the principal difference was the names on the front—I had no orders from Elton—about May, 1895, I saw Elton who asked me if I knew White, and whether he was respectable—I said as far as I knew he was all right; I had done a great deal of work for him, and he had always paid me—he is a company promoter—I think Elton did not know him up to that time—I think I asked whether he was going to pull the company through, and he said he believed he had got some one to put money into it, and he hoped to do so—I only knew by sight Mr. Trimnell whose name appeared on some of the prospectuses as solicitor.</p>

I have no occupation—I live at 5, Bathurst Street, W.—I saw an advertisment in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> at the beginning of 1895, and in consequence went to Sherwin White, 31, Wool Exchange—I was looking out for a directorship—I had some conversation with White, and he suggested I might become a director of the American and Parisian Massage Company—I went on one or two occasions to his office, where I saw Miss Shakespear, Mr. Bragg, Dr. Torrance, Walker and the prisoners—about middle February, 1895, there was a meeting at White's office at which I and the prisoners and Miss Shakespear were present, Dr. Torrance being in the chair—there was a discussion that the vendors offered certain things to be sold, and suggested that a place should be opened in Jermyn Street and branches opened in the country—the Jermyn Street place and the branches were to be a going concern before the company took them over—Dr. Torrance suggested that, and that was agreed to by the other directors present—I was not aware I was a director—I invested no money in the company; no one did, so far as I know—I received a letter from White and went to another meeting—I went to Jermyn Street once, at the invitation of one of the prisoners; nothing was going on there; there was some furniture in the house—I saw Miss Maclean there—Kennedy went with us there—I don't believe the name "American and Parisian Massage Company" was up outside then; afterwards I think it was—on another occasion there Kennedy told me that Miss Maclean was a friend of his wife—on one occasion, as I was leaving, she asked me, in Kennedy's presence, whether I thought the business would be a success—I said I could not tell; or words to that effect—Kennedy was behind me on the stairs, and he sort of pushed me, and hurried me on, Miss Maclean being left on the landing—on another occasion I saw Miss Clarke at Jermyn Street—I asked Kennedy about her, and he said she was lady manageress, I think—I was never a director—I think I heard Miss Maclean's name mentioned at the meetings at</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MARSHALL</hi>. My first acquaintance with White was when I answered the advertisement in the paper—Dr. Torrance did all the talking at the first meeting, which lasted from one and a-half to two hours—I believe Miss Shakespear had a massage practice to dis<lb/>pose of, or some connection among people who liked that treatment, and that that was the object of her meeting the directors on that day—the company did not want to take over the business in Jermyn Street till Kennedy had got things into working order—I would not be concerned in what I knew to be a swindle—I considered it to be a perfectly <hi rend="italic">bona-fide</hi> concern at the time; I did not trouble about information; I simply answered an advertisement and went there—the time was chiefly occupied in going through a draft prospectus that was put on the table; Dr, Torrance went through it and made some alterations—I did no criticism of it—I was not a director then, I went with a view of being a director—when I found there was nothing to sell I did not trouble much about it—I attended at Coleman Street after that because Mr. White wrote me some letters—I wrote on February 7th, 1895, "On the conditions arranged between us I shall be glad to become a director of the American and Parisian Massage Com<lb/>pany"—on that date I was prepared to become a director—if it is stated in the depositions that I said the day I was appointed a director may have been March 15th, it is correct—I dispute that I was appointed a director—I saw a prospectus with my name as a director; I understood it was only a draft, and that none were issued to the public—I cannot say if a resolution was passed on March 15th, 1895, that Mr. Trimnell's resignation be accepted, and that Mr. Elton be appointed solicitor to the company; if it is down it was—I understood I was to be qualified by having a certain number of shares presented to me—my interest in the company was to be <hi rend="italic">nil</hi>—I was willing at that time that my name should appear as a director—my remuneration was to be a guinea at each meeting—no shares were ever allotted that I know of—a resolution was passed on May 16th, "That the appointment of Mrs. Norris as secre<lb/>tary be cancelled, for the reason that she has not fulfilled the qualifica<lb/>tion"—I dispute that I was a director—at the first meeting it was settled that when the vendor established the thing as a going concern we would take it over; as we had not taken it over, I can only surmise that the company was not constituted—I received a cheque for £2 2s., but I dispute that I was a director—I had that money for the trouble in going there as a prospective director; the waste of time—mention was made of Mrs. Norris, but I don't remember any suggestion being mode that her money should be returned to her—I remember a resolution on May 22nd</p>

               <p>that Kennedy be appointed a director to join the Board after allotment—I resigned my connection with the company soon after June 7th, 1895, when Elton resigned his position as solicitor—at one of the meetings Elton said he had engaged Miss Maclean—he did not have notice on behalf of the company to engage a lady manager—the arrangement between Kennedy and the company was that he should engage the staff, and that the company should take to it when the company was completed—he did not mention the terms on which he had engaged her.</p>

About the beginning of 1894 I became acquainted with White—I received a communication from him, and went and saw him at Coleman Street—at the beginning of 1895 I attended a meeting at which Lowdell, White, Kennedy, Miss Shakespear, and some other proposed director were present—I had received a draft prospectus before I went, and had gone through it; it was something like this one; the names of two directors were written on it—my name was there, but they did not know who I was for they put me down M.R.C.S.—we discussed this prospectus at the meeting, and the articles of association, and when that had been done I asked White what Kennedy bad got to sell for this large sum—he said he had some skin wash or something, which I said was perfectly worthless; I did not countenance it at all, and I told him I did not think that was worth consideration—I said, "Is there any business to sell to the com<lb/>pany?"—I was referred to Miss Shakespear, who was present—either White or Kennedy said that she had a connection as a masseuse—I asked her had she a business to dispose of—she said she had a good connection with the medical profession, and she thought she could concentrate it if a place was established—I said, "You will establish this business first; when you have a business to sell, I will reconsider the matter; until then I will not have anything to do with it—both my brother directors acquiesced in that; and White said, "Now, Miss Shakespear, you hear what you have to do;" and then the matter terminated, and from that day until June, when I got this letter from Elton, I heard nothing of the company—that was my whole connection</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Stating that he had no idea the Massage Company was in existence; that he had said he would join it if it was formed, but that he had heard nothing of it since.</hi>) I called and saw Elton, and I afterwards saw Kennedy—I asked why my name appeared on the prospectus. I received no explanation—I said, "Under the circumstances I must request you to write me a letter stating that my name was used without my knowledge and sanction, and you must undertake to have all the prospectuses destroyed on which my name appears, and not to solicit subscriptions on those prospectuses"—I received this letter from Kennedy to that effect—I also went to White and requested him to see the chairman of the meeting at which he said the directors were appointed, and get him to write me a similar letter—he would not do that, but he wrote to say the chairman had signed the minutes of a meeting stating that I had not been appointed a director—I had no knowledge of money being obtained from Mrs. Wilson, Miss Clarke, Mrs. Norris and Miss Maclean.</p>

Lound, solicitor, of 11, Great Turnstile, Holborn—I had the letting of 132, Jermyn Street, for the owner, Mr. Wharton—on November 30th, 1894, the first and second floors of that house were let to Miss Shakespear—the solicitor acting for her was Henry Elton—her references were Elton and Lewis—I sub<lb/>sequently ascertained that Lewis was Elton's clerk—the rent was £110 a year, and the lease was for five years and a-half—on January 22nd she wrote-suggesting that she should assign her interest—I saw Elton and it was suggested that Miss Shakespear being unable to carry out the terms of her lease, it should be surrendered, and that he was in treaty with parties to take an assignment—I received this letter from him of February 5th. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he was in treaty with the American and Parisian Massage Company with reference to the lease of the premises.</hi>) I wrote to Elton as to the circumstances under which the lease had been obtained, and in con<lb/>sequence of my threatening to take proceedings, I received this letter from him. (<hi rend="italic">Hoping that his client would be able to make some arrangement in the course of a few days.</hi>) Miss Shakespear paid nothing—I saw Elton, and then received this letter of February 12th, when Kennedy's name first cropped up. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that an agreement between Miss Shakespear and the authorised agent of the Company had been signed, and asked for the usual license to assign.</hi>) On March 1st, 1895, the assignment was exe<lb/>cuted to Kennedy, Elton being the witness—I communicated, with a reference, J. Sinclair Kennedy, of Londonderry—so Kennedy got posses<lb/>sion of the premises—he did not pay any rent when it became due—I first got some money from him about May—I was paid £11 1s., for my costs in reference to the assignment, by this cheque of April 23rd, drawn on the National Provincial Bank by John Mackenzie—this cheque for £27 10s. on the National Provincial Bank, drawn by Mackenzie in favour of Mr. Wharton, was paid for rent in May—that is all we were paid—I distrained for the rest after June—we took possession, and Kennedy executed a surrender.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Maisonette, Brentford—in Sep<lb/>tember, 1894, I saw in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> this advertisement to which I replied, and I got into correspondence with Kennedy—shortly after I went to see Kennedy at Oakley or Redcliffe Square. (<hi rend="italic">The advertisement was for a lady to receive and interview ladies, salary</hi> £4 <hi rend="italic">a week, of good appearance and address, and in a position to invest a small amount of capital.</hi>) Kennedy told me a company was being formed for massage treatment; he handed me a prospectus to read—he said I should obtain good interest for money, as it was likely to be a very good concern, and there was nothing <hi rend="italic">infra dig.</hi> about it—he said all the directors were men of good position, and would bring good interest to bear on it; that the lady who was going to take a position in it must be able to invest a small amount of capital—I asked him what capital he thought necessary—he said he had not thought anything about it, but equivalent to the first year's salary; it was a guarantee of respectability, and he thought he might say about £200—he said, the company would be a gigantic success, and would pay at the very least 40 per cent.—I was to interview people who came—I noticed the name of the City Bank in the prospectus—there was "Lady Superintendent" without any name being given; he said my name would be put there—I was to send a cheque for the amount I invested, and was to receive 40 share warrants—I said I should require a reference—he said he could offer me 100 if I liked—I said I should like to consult my solicitor, and that he should see the promoter of the company—Kennedy then gave me the name of Shir win White—an arrangement was made for my solicitor, Mr. Woodbridge, to see White—I had a communication from Mr. Woodbridge, and after that saw Kennedy again, and told him Mr. Woodbridge had no faith in the company, and had advised me, the same as my other friends, against investing in it—he said that was absurd, evidently they were jealous; he said of course, a solicitor was always very cautious, and erred on the side, if anything, of over-caution, that he had an uncle a solicitor, who was the same; but it was perfectly genuine; in a manner it was a speculation, naturally—after hearing what he had to say, I was over-persuaded by him, and agreed to let him have the money—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is an agreement between me and Kennedy as a student of medicine who has agreed to sell 40 shares in the American and Parisian Massage Company, and obtain for me a situation at £200 a year; but he said he was a doctor—I sent my solicitor's cheque for £200, and endorsed it to the order of Kennedy and White to whom I had it made payable—it has been paid—I got warrants for forty shares on red ink forms—I also got what purports to be an extract from the company's books, "Resolved that Miss Bertha Jane Clarke be and is hereby appointed secretary to the company at a salary of £200 per annum"—I had seen the prospectus—I afterwards wrote to Kennedy and enclosed a prospectus with the name filled in—I wished to adopt my mother's name, Mulcock; and it was so settled "J. Mulcock"—I wrote to Kennedy once or twice between December and May, but did not see him; I got a telegram in May and went to Jermyn Street and saw him, and asked him what he wanted, he</p>

Cannot you come on Monday?"—I saw him on the Monday at Mr. Elton's office, Chancery Lane, that was the first time I had heard of Mr. Elton—Kennedy introduced me to Mr. Elton as solicitor to the company—I said that I had £200 invested and I wished to know if it was all right before I invested any more—I asked Mr. Elton if it was a genuine concern—he said, "Yes, if it is once started it is a genuine concern, an absolute certainty"—he introduced me as the lady-superintendent—it was in con<lb/>sequence of what passed in Jermyn Street, that I went to Elton—I paid a cheque for £100—he wanted me to get my friends to take shares—I said no, if anyone had to take up shares, it would be myself—I drew a cheque for £100 a day or two afterwards, and it was arranged that I should send it to Elton's office; but Kennedy wrote to me and asked me to send it to him, to save delay—it was my own cheque—I received a letter from Kennedy in reply—he promised to let me have the share warrants, but I never got them—I received this letter from him on June 18th. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that in consideration of her advancing a further</hi> £100 <hi rend="italic">to aid in completing the premises, he agreed to hand her more shares, and to re<lb/>fund the money advanced, if the company were not successful.</hi>) I several times went to Jermyn Street, beginning in May I believe—sometimes I went two or three times a week, sometimes a fortnight or three weeks would elapse between my visits—the premises there were partially famished—I never saw any massage being done there—I went by appoint<lb/>ment with Kennedy, relative to opening the business—Kennedy wanted to borrow more money; he said friends who were going to invest were abroad, and most plausible tales—he mentioned Mr. and Mrs. Lee as people of very high position, and with a great deal of money, they were abroad—he wished to start the business as soon as he possibly could, and if I would let him have the money he would give me high interest and make over shares in the company to me—he did not fix a sum at first, then he wanted £100 and the £50, and then he asked me to pay the rent of the premises in Jermyn Street—before I invested the second £100 I told Mr. Woodbridge, and he said I was very silly—I heard of Miss Maclean through Mr. Lowdell—I told Kennedy before I invested any further money I desired to know who Miss Maclean was, and he wanted to know how I had heard of her, and I said Mr. Lowdell had written about her; he considered it was a great piece of imper<lb/>tinence, and how did Mr. Lowdell get my address?—I said I did not know except from White—I wanted to know who she was, and Kennedy, after a great many excuses, said, "Miss Maclean is to sleep on the premises; she has taken up shares in the Company, and for that she is to have the privilege of sleeping on the premises," I suppose as a sort of caretaker—I did not agree to put in an extra £100; he got no more from me—at the end of August 1895, Kennedy came down to see me at Brentford—I said I could not understand his coming down to see me; I thought it rather peculiar; and he said, well, it seemed such a shame that such a good thing as the massage business might prove to be should break up com<lb/>pletely for the sake of a few pounds; would not I consent to give a little more money?—I said I was letting my house for six months, and I wanted all my money for current expenses—he said could not I let him have a little—I said, "No"—after some hesitation he took</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189602030103"/>
               <p>out a paper from his pocket—I said, "What is that?"—he handed it to me—I laughed when I saw it—he asked if I was hysterical—I said it was strange; my friends had said he would do it—it was a bill of exchange at three months for £200, which he wanted me to accept—he said his wife would sign, and would be answerable for it, but she had not got it just then; but that when her brother came of age he could dispose of his property, and if anything went wrong he would return it in full; but it could not go wrong—I said I could not do it, but I would think over it, and he left me the paper—he came the next night, and I told my maid to say I was not at home—then I had letters from him saying that it was very important—I went into Derbyshire and heard nothing more of him—the first night after my return I had a letter from him asking for an appointment, and at last I saw him—he said everything would have to be sold up if I did not see him at such and such an hour on a cer<lb/>tain day, and so I went up—I said I could not sign—he called his wife in, and they talked to me, and ultimately I put my name to the bill—I had a letter from his wife in which she agreed to be answerable for £100—on the following Sunday I talked to my brother about the bill; and afterwards my brother came to London and saw Kennedy, who gave a sort of explanation—my brother asked him if he had the bill and might he see it (He had tried to pass it with Mr. Harrison)—he handed it to my brother who destroyed it—my brother forbade Kennedy coming to my house, so he sent his wife instead—I had no communication with him after that—I had no part of my salary—I had no work to do—I did not get a farthing of ray money back.</p>

I had only one interview with, and no letter from, Elton—before I saw him I had been to Jermyn Street, and seen the premises—the only words of his I am certain of are, if once the company was started its success was an absolute certainty—I could not be certain of anything else—he may have said that, as far as he could answer for it, it stood a good chance of success; but I know he said that if it started its success was absolutely certain—Kennedy had had £200 in 1894, before I saw Elton—the matter of the £100 was arranged with Kennedy in Elton's office; it was agreed I should direct it to Kennedy at Elton's office; but Elton wrote that, to save time, he preferred me to send it to his private address—Elton said to Kennedy, "This lady has already invested £200, and she is appointed lady superin<lb/>tendent"—I parted with my money in consequence of what Kennedy said entirely—the last hundred I should not have parted with had not someone else told me it was genuine; thereon, Kennedy told my brother it would open in three days, certain—I parted with my money in conse<lb/>quence of what Kennedy said, but he said it in front of Elton, who was a solicitor—I thought at first it was simply to obtain the post—I should not have paid the second sum if only one man had been there—I should have had to obtain someone else's opinion—Mr. Woodbridge said to me, "I am an old-fashioned man of business"—I exercised my own judgment, and chose to advance the money, but I was influenced by the fact that Elton was a solicitor, and gave me thin advice.</p>

               <p>£50 a week with two or three assistants—I never speculated before, and shall not again—I thought I was going to make a good thing by investing this money; I understood what 40 per cent, means—I first went to Jermyn Street at the end of February or beginning of March, 1895—the premises were incomplete, no business was being carried on; the decora<lb/>tors were in—I saw no towels or goods being delivered—there was a place for a bath—there were things in the waiting and reception rooms—I went several times—I had then parted with £200—I did not make up my mind then that the company was a fraud—I did not think I had really lost my money until I resigned my appointment—I believed exactly what Kennedy told me, and that if sufficient money came in, or if it were once started, the company would be a financial success—I first met the priso<lb/>ner's wife in June or July, 1895; she was introduced as his wife—she said her husband was such an honourable man he would not have anything to do with anything otherwise; that he refused invitations to dinner because he was unable to return them to the people who invited him—I first came to the conclusion that I had been defrauded after my brother destroyed the bill—when I told my brother about the bill he said, "If you don't go and get that bill back I shall go to Scotland Yard"—I went the first thing on Monday morning to Harrison because Kennedy had told me he was going to discount it for him—in September 1895 after I asked for the bill back, but before it was destroyed, I gave Mr. Wood-bridge instructions to prosecute Kennedy—he said Miss Maclean was first—Kennedy said the furniture was to be put in by Barker of Kensington, and that the delay was owing to their dishonourable conduct—I spoke to my friends of what I was going to do; they said I should not do it—White was not the chief spokesman as to the success of the company, not so much as Kennedy—I only saw White once and Mr. Woodbridge saw him once—Kennedy made infinitely more impression on me than White.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cashier in the Bond Street Branch of the City Bank—in July, 1894, Mr. Faithful suggested to our manager the opening of an account with us in the name of the American and Parisian Massage Co.—I was shown a prospectus like this—we consented to our name appearing on it as bankers of the company if the preliminaries were satisfactory, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, that the certificate of incorporation be exhibited, and enquiries to references as to respectability, and the genuineness of the concern—no money was tendered; no account was opened—on Septem<lb/>ber 3rd, 1894, our manager, Mr. Mullins, wrote to Faithful withdrawing our name, and after that date the company had no authority to use it as that of their bankers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a confidential clerk in the employ<lb/>ment of Messrs. Barker's, Kensington High Street—about the end of March, 1895, I was instructed to make enquiries about Kennedy, and I saw him on several occasions—at that time we had done certain work at 132, Jermyn Street, and received orders for further work—after several conversations I told Kennedy we should require a considerable amount paid down before we completed the amount of work he had ordered, which was about £120 worth—I agreed to do the work on condition that £40 was paid down, and the balance paid by two instalments, one at one month, and one at two months—I then went to Elton's office at Kennedy's suggestion—Elton said he had no money to pay with; an appointment was made for the following morning, 27th April, when I saw the prisoners at Elton's office—I then received four £10 notes from Elton for which I gave a receipt—Elton was very anxious that I should give an undertaking that all work and orders in hand should be completed within a very short time—I absolutely declined to execute the orders by any given time, as some contingencies might arise that might prevent us carrying out the orders, some of the goods being special goods, massage couches and so on, to be specially made—I should think we had done about £60 or £70 worth of work when that £40 was paid; when we stopped work we had done £135 altogether; we had exceeded the contract—we only got the £40—our firm received further orders for work to be done—at the beginning of May I saw Kennedy, and pointed out that We had done work to the extent of £135 on the £120 arrangement—he was very anxious that we should go on and complete the work—we had orders amounting to something like £70, more than that at the time—his explanation was that as soon as we had completed the things a company could be formed, and with the shareholders' money we should be paid—before I applied for the instalment of £40 I called on Kennedy, and pointed out that the contract had been exceeded by £15, and we had another £70 order in hand, and he promised to let me have a payment—I called several times, and he made various promises to send money to our office, and then, on May 30th, I met him at the corner of Chancery Lane one day, and he said, "I have a cheque in my pocket for you now;"</p>

               <p>and we went into a public-house, and he handed me Mr. Mackenzie's cheque for £35 on account of the £120; it was met—we continued to work; the plumbers were fitting a bath—we did work altogether to the extent of £170, and we got £75 in all—we got judgment in the County Court by default for the instalment of £40—it is still unsatisfied; the other amount we have not obtained judgment for.</p>

The £75 worth of work would complete the orders which had been given, including the bath—we supplied a lot of furniture—there were two massage couches, six were ordered—the other £75 would have completed the orders which had been given; I cannot say it would complete the furnishing of the place—it included one bath; the fittings were provided and the bath delivered, but Kennedy objected to it and it was removed, as it was not the class of bath he ordered—then the difficulties about the instalments occurred, and we did not supply it—I sued Kennedy for the balance—I did not regard Elton as a debtor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow—in March, 1895, I was stay ing at Bristol—on March 12th I saw this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> for a lady secretary for a company, preference given to one willing to invest a certain amount—I answered that—on March 19th I received a letter signed Forrester Kennedy. (<hi rend="italic">Asking her to meet him next day at Elton's office.</hi>) I came to. London the next day, and went direct to 55, Chancery Lane, about four o'clock—I there saw the prisoners—I said I came in regard to the letter and advertisement—they showed me this prospectus with the names of directors, and bankers, and solicitor, and the auditor and the regis<lb/>tered offices—I read it through—they both asked if I was willing to invest money to obtain the post of secretary—I said I would willingly invest money if it was a <hi rend="italic">bona-fide</hi> thing; I said that I could not afford to lose my money—I was most desirous then of getting employment—they said I should receive a salary of two guineas a week, my engagement to begin in ten days' time—I should have to do secretary's work—it was optional where I lived—they wanted me to in vest £100—I said I had not got it to invest—they asked me how much I could pay down, and I said £50—Kennedy said, "When will you let me have the other £50?"—Elton at once said, "Let that be at Mrs. Norris's convenience"—I said my money was at my bank in Plymouth, where my home was—I said that after I was in receipt of the salary I should be allowed to pay the balance at my convenience; that I could pay it out of my salary, and I ultimately agreed to do so—it was suggested that I should go and see White at the Wool Exchange the same evening, and I went there with Kennedy about</p>

               <p>5.30 or six—I was introduced to White—I asked him if it were a <hi rend="italic">bona-fids</hi> thing I was entering into; and he assured me it was—Kennedy was there all the time—as well as I remember, he asked me to draw a cheque on a half sheet of paper, as I had not my cheque-book—I drew a cheque on a piece of paper to Kennedy's order, and he endorsed it—I then went with Kennedy and had some refreshment—I went back to Elton's office, but found he had gone—I then went back to Bristol the same night—I read the whole of the prospectus, including the part about Miss Shakespear's large connection—they furnished me with the stamp for the cheque on the blank sheet of paper—I signed an agreement at Elton's office before I went to White's; it was written while I was there. (<hi rend="italic">The agreement was she should advance money, and receive vendor's shares and the appointment of secretary.</hi>) Some days afterwards I received a letter from Kennedy asking me to remit him some money—I received these letters from Elton. (<hi rend="italic">The first stated that he had taken a flat for her, and would be glad to know what steps she was taking. The second stated that, owing to Mr. Lowdell having to leave town, the Directors' meeting could not take place the day before; and asked her to send</hi> £50 <hi rend="italic">within the next ten days.</hi>)—I made no promise to pay more; I distinctly said I could not pay the money; the arrangement I made was to pay the other £50 out of my two guineas a week—I told White I could not pay the other £50—I also received this letter from Kennedy.

(<hi rend="italic">Stating that unless her dishonoured cheques for</hi> £40 <hi rend="italic">were taken up and the equiva<lb/>lent value paid by Monday the Directors would, at their meeting, cancel the resolution under which she was appointed secretary.</hi>) I became alarmed, and came to London, and went to Elton's office, and saw the prisoners—I replied to their letter that I had not the money to meet the cheques for £40, and preferred the agreement to be cancelled and for my £50 to be returned, with the expenses of my journeys to town—before I drew the £50 I showed Elton my pass-book,</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MARSHALL</hi>. Kennedy was the spokesman at first when I was handed the prospectus and asked what I thought of it—I saw Lowdell's name on it—I understood that as soon as the place was fitted up and furnished it would be started as a massage institution, and that would be in about ten days' time—and they asked if I would be prepared to enter on my duties at that time—he said Barkers of Ken<lb/>sington had the furnishing in hand, and he expected it would have been completed by that time—my salary was to commence from the 25th.—I did not know anything about massage—I had no doubt from what Elton and White told me that it would be a successful thing—from what other people said I conceived a favourable idea of a system of establishing a place of the kind—I daresay I was at White's for an hour and a half—I was anxious to hear what he had to say—he went into it thoroughly, all the time was taken up about this matter—although the agreement was signed at Elton's office before I went to White's there was an under-standing that it was not to take effect unless I was satisfied with what White said as promoter—I relied a good deal on what White said—I paid the £50 cheque in his office to White's order, and handed it to Kennedy—my other cheques were handed to Kennedy—before I left Elton at his office, he said "Before you pay your money, you had better go and see White, who is the promoter of the company"; that was because he could give more information about the company and about the undertaking generally than anyone else—I understood Elton was acting as solicitor to the Company; and I applied to him as to whether it was a <hi rend="italic">bona-fide</hi> company, and he assured me it was; as solicitor to the company I thought I could depend on him—at Bristol they wanted me to sign share warrants, and I did sign some, not all, and they took them back—I said I could not pay another £50 in a fortnight's time—the cheques for £25 and £15 were not given on the same day—I wrote a letter to the effect that I would see whether my bankers would give me a small overdraft—I think I drew cheques for £15 and £10 at Bristol, and a cheque for £25 at another time—I wrote and</p>

               <p>asked my bankers for an overdraft in Elton's office, and at his request, he dictated the letter—I have a small annuity—that was when I drew the cheque for £25—it was after I was told that the money would be required for completing the furnishing that the suggestion was made about the £25 cheque, and I believed they wanted the money to help the furnish<lb/>ing—after giving the £25 cheque I went to Jermyn Street several times; the first time was some time in May—I met Kennedy once on the stairs; that was the early part of May, I think—the place was partly furnished—I asked him why the business had not been started, and he said he could not get the place furnished, that Barkers had been delaying with the work.</p>

I paid attention to what Kennedy said; it induced me to part with my money—I daresay I asked Kennedy how much money I should have to invest in shares, and he said £100—I said I had not £100 to invest—my annuity is not sufficient for my main<lb/>tenance—I was not desirous of speculating; my idea was to obtain an engagement with good remuneration, as I thought, and I parted with my money because I thought I should gain good wages; I should not have done it otherwise—on the strength of what the prisoners and White told me, I believed that if money was forthcoming from the public it would be a successful concern—I handed the £50 cheque to White, and he handed it to Kennedy—I understood White was the motive power in forming the company—I relied on what he told me to a very great extent, not altogether.</p>

I was in March and April, 1895, the licensee of the King's Head, in Aldersgate Street—I had known Kennedy for many years—about April, 1895, he came with Elton, whom he introduced as the solicitor for the Massage Company—Kennedy asked me to cash a cheque for £25, which it was explained was given by a lady, who was obtaining a situation in the company, and buying some shares—it was written on a half-sheet of paper, which made me hesitate—I afterwards advanced £5 in gold on it to one or other of the prisoners—I paid the cheque into my bank—Elton assured me it was a good one—next day the prisoners called and had refreshment, and I advanced a second £5; I afterwards advanced a third £5; £15 in all—a few days afterwards the cheque came back, marked "N.S."—I went to Elton's office on April 17th and made a complaint about it, and asked to be repaid—the prisoners and Lewis were there—Elton was very much put out about it, and could not understand it—Mrs. Norris was sent for, and when she came, Elton asked her about her balance—a little later she fetched her bank-book, which showed a balance of £12—she then drew a cheque for £10, which Elton handed to me—it was paid in and honoured; that left me £5 to the bad—I was to be paid that when they got it; they said there was a lot more money expected—a few days afterwards Miss Maclean was brought to me, and there was a conversation about some Scotch shares she had, and I arranged with my bankers to realise them—I took her to the manager and introduced her—a little while afterwards I learnt from the bank that £120 had been received, and I went to Elton's office, taking my cheque-book—a statement of what was to be paid was drawn up by Elton—later on, in the presence of the prisoners and Miss Maclean, I drew this open cheque for £82 in favour of Elton or order (that was cashed the same day at my bank); this cheque, for £11 1s., in favour of Mr. Lound; a cheque for £2 to Kennedy; £20 was given to Miss Maclean, and the balance of £6 19s.

                  </hi>. On December 21st last I was living with the prisoner at 10, Alnwick Road, West Ham—I had been living with him for some months—we occupied a front room on the first-floor—on the 21st he went out to work as usual; he worked in the docks—he came home at some<lb/>thing past seven or half-past six—he went out again, and stayed out till half-past eleven—I was up in Miss Marchant's room—he was not sober, he had had a drop to drink—we had a few words because he did not take me out, and I began to put on my things to go out—I said I would—we had a struggle, and in the struggle the revolver went off—I was trying to go out—I had left Miss Marchant's room, and came into my own room—he said I should not go out—I attempted to put on my hat, I could not get it on—I did not see anything in his hand—he prevented me from putting on my hat, he pulled it off, I had not the chance to put it on, and then he fired the revolver, and I don't remember any more—he did not say anything before he fired—I was at the back of the door when he fired—he was in the same place, close to me—I was hit in the neck—he fired twice, the first one did not hit me—I had never seen a revolver in his possession before that day—I was taken to the Seamen's Hospital, and remained there till January 29th; when he came home that evening we were on good terms, and when he went out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the Seamen's Hospital, West Ham—I helped to take charge of Jane Young when she was brought there on the morning of December 22nd, she was suffering from a 8-in. shot wound in the left side of the neck, the bullet had passed through the neck into the left side of the throat; it has never been extracted; I expect it had fallen out from the mouth—she remained in the hospital in a very dangerous condition for some time—she was not discharged till January 29th—at the same time I examined William Marchant—he had three wounds, one on the right arm, one on the right side, I think the three were produced by one shot, the bullet had passed just below the skin of the arm and then struck the side, causing two wounds, and then came out—I extracted the other bullet from the side and handed it to the inspector—the man was in the hospital up to the 4th January, he was never in a dangerous condition.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabman, and live in Sturgeon Road, Surrey Gardens—I have known the prisoner for the last eighteen months—on January 6th I saw him outside the King Lud, Ludgate Hill—he asked me to have a drink, which I did—I asked him how <hi rend="italic">Nell</hi> was, meaning Mrs. Ayres—he said she was well, and as fat as butter—I said, "I heard say she was starving"—he said it was a lie—I asked him who was looking after her—he said he was—I said, "How about the money?"—he said, "You know I had a pony and trap out of it."</p>

On the 17th I arrested the prisoner in Shoe Lane; I read the warrant to him—he said, "I am fully prepared for it, I knew that the warrant had been issued, I drew the money and signed the receipt at the instigation of Mrs. Ayres; it was in this way, when Ayres went away he left £19 with his wife; she was out shopping down the Walworth Road when she had her pocket picked of all the money; she had four children to keep, and being destitute and knowing there was money in the bank she suggested to me that I should draw some out; the notice of withdrawal was obtained and signed by me, and I handed her the money"—I made a note of it at the time—when charged he made no reply—when I read the warrant to him I said the amount was £75—he said that was quite correct.</p>
