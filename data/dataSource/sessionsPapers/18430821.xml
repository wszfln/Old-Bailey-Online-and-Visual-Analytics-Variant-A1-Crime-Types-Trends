                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Wooding, a chandler, in Frith-street. About a fortnight before the 14th of June, the prisoner, who was a stranger, called, and asked if I would buy some butter—he said it was very excellent Dorset butter—I told him to call again, which he did in a week or fortnight, and on the 14th he brought a pan of butter into the shop—the top of it looked very good—I was busy, and did not examine it further—I bought it on the strength of his assurance, and paid him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—I cut it next morn<lb/>ing, and found the top was very good Dorset, but underneath was very bad—I cannot call it any thing but cart grease—we made no use of it—the good butter did not extend above half an inch—I was obliged to throw it away—it smelt very had, and was quite a different colour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of a labouring man, and lodged in the prisoner's house for eight years—the prisoner is married, and has a boy named John James, and a girl named Elizabeth, who was two years old on the 19th of July last—the boy is older—the prisoner kept a shop in the general line—be<lb/>fore this occurred, he was repeatedly saying that he was coming to great poverty and distress—I should say for six months before, continually, from time to time—on the morning of the 19th of June I was up stairs, in my own room, and heard screams of murder from the prisoner's bed-room—it was the prisoner's wife—I hastened to the door—the cries continued as I went, and while I was at the door—when I got to the door I heard a scuffling, like some person pulling, as if they were scuffling with each other—the door was locked—I waited till the prisoner's wife opened it—I then saw the prisoner scuffling with his wife—I saw the prisoner holding up a large chopper or axe, trying to cut his own forehead—he had cut it before I entered the room—he was bleeding from the forehead—he said nothing, nor did his wife say anything to him—I saw the little boy lying in the crib by the father's bedside, and the girl Elizabeth was sitting up in the bed, with a wound in her forehead, bleeding very much—I did not say anything—I took the axe from the prisoner's hand, and we fell in the scuffle, me, his wife, and himself, in scuffling to take the axe—we did not say anything—we screamed very much for assistance to come in—the boy had three cuts on the side of the head—his wife called out for a doctor to be sent for—she was hurt in the fall, but was not cut at all—the prisoner did not say a word—he laid apparently lifeless on the ground after the fall—that was from the cut that he had given himself with the axe, from loss of blood—the wife was quite exhausted from struggling with the pri<lb/>soner—she did not say anything—I knew what had occasioned the mischief to the children, from the prisoner having the axe in his hand; and his wife said that he had done it—that was when he lay apparently lifeless on the ground—he could not understand what was said at that time—she had not said anything before that, further than "Oh dear," and was in great trouble about the children—she did not say anything when I came in first—she was then trying to get the axe from his hand—he used to behave very kind to his children generally—I never saw anything to the contrary—on the 10th of March, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I had seen him in the water<lb/>butt in the yard, with his head down and his feet up—there was sufficient water in it to have drowned him; but I gave an alarm, and several of the neighbours came to his assistance, and pulled him out—I discovered him ac<lb/>cidentally, as I came out of my own room and went into the yard—I sup<lb/>pose he had been in about three minutes—he was quite sensible when the neighbours got him out—after that, his manner was different to what it used to be—he was always pleading poverty, and saying that he would come to distress—that was his general tone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am twenty-one years of age, and am sister of the deceased—I lived at home with my mother. I went to the house in Wentworth-street about three weeks before Eliza was taken ill, on account of Sarah being ill—I was with Eliza the night she died—I was there on the Tuesday evening, and remained all day on Wednesday—she was aware she was dying—two or three hours before her death, she said, "Is my eldest sister here?"—I said, "She is up stairs"—she said she had something heavy on her mind, and she could not die without she revealed it—I asked her what she had got to say—she said, "First call them all down"—I called them all down into the room—when they came, she said, "The kick he gave me up in your room, Sarah, was the cause of my death; the brutish treatment I have met with from him no one knows"—that was said about four o'clock in the morning, when we were alone, when they were all there—she said <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Facey had been the cause of her death, the kick he had given her—after they went up stairs, she said, "For God's sake, take me up to my sister's room"—I asked her whether she was happy—she said, "I have one thing to say, let me be re<lb/>moved into my sister's room, for God's sake"—at that time she was in her own room—I asked why she wanted to be removed—she said that the prisoner had threatened her so, that he said he would be her murderer if she told us any thing about him, if she told any of her sisters—about four o'clock in the morning the prisoner was lying in one corner of the room, asleep, on a drugget—she rose up in bed, and asked to be removed to him—he instantly placed himself against the window, and said, "No, I shall not remove you," and called her a bad name—I was sitting with her, and said, "Never mind, dear, lay down"—the prisoner placed himself against the door, and said, "Oh, I wish I had had three months, instead of one, this job would never have hap<lb/>pened."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in partnership with Mr. Hart. I attended the deceased—I first saw her about the 21st of July, in bed, at No. 49, Went<lb/>worth-street—she was then labouring under inflammation of the bowels, quite at its advanced stage—I prescribed what I thought available, but I had no doubt at that time that gangrene had already commenced, and that no reme<lb/>dial treatment would do, that it was a hopeless case—I visited her every day till the Wednesday on which she died—I think she was aware that she would die for three or four days before her death—she clearly knew that she was dying on the Sunday—I was rather surprised to see such indications of so severe a disease in so young a person—I thought there must be something beyond the ordinary symptoms of disease, and asked her on the Sunday if she had been the subject of any violence—I should not expect such symptoms in such a subject unless from violence—she seemed to consider her case quite hopeless, and that she should die very speedily—she seemed to be quite in a desponding state of mind—I believe she had been told that she was in a hope<lb/>less state, and that her recovery was not at all probable—she appeared aware that she was on her death-bed—she told me that she had been pushed in the breast, by a black man, named <hi rend="italic">Black Jack</hi>, in a public-house row—the pri<lb/>soner was in the room at the time, but said nothing—I think he was present on every occasion when I went to see her—I attended her till her death—she was so scanty of clothing that her person was observable—there was no bruise or mark on her breast—the indications of gangrene increased, and she died on the Wednesday evening—I saw no marks of violence of any importance in any part of her body—there were some bruises on one leg, but nothing to lead to her death—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I found the intestines ex<lb/>cessively inflamed, with patches of gangrene, or mortification in different parts—in tracing the convolutions of the intestines downwards, I arrived at the secun, and it was bound down to the side by inflammation, in such a way that the course of the alimentary canal was completely obstructed—it was adhering to an abscess which seemed to be connected with the ovaria—the ovaria appeared to have been lacerated, and that laceration to have been followed by ulceration, and an abscess had formed there, and spread—the left ovaria was perfectly healthy—the womb was larger than in its unimpregnated condition, but on examining it internally, I found unequivocal evidence of recent abortion—I think a person in a state of pregnancy, receiving a violent kick at the bottom of the stomach, would probably have inflammation of the ovaria such as I saw—I can scarcely imagine that a disease at that early age, would occur in that part, especially as I found the left ovaria perfectly healthy—the symptoms I saw were such as would result from such a cause—I hardly think it possible they could have arisen from natural disease at that age—disease of the ovaria scarcely ever occurs till a more advanced period of life, and where natural disease occurs there, it is not common to find one ovaria healthy—I saw no marks of a kick or violence, but I think most likely the external mark would disappear—the fact of there being no external mark, does not lead me to suppose that the inflammation of the ovaria could not have been occasioned by external violence—the fall might have caused the laceration, the rebound after receiving the kick—Mr. Hart attended with me at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and attended the patient two days before I saw her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was called to the deceased on Thurs<lb/>day, the 20th of July, by the prisoner—I found her labouring under disease as Mr. Byles has described—I attended the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and coincide with Mr. Byles' evidence in every particular—I told the prisoner on the Tuesday evening before she died, that I did not consider she would live twenty-four hours, but not in her hearing—the prisoner and one of her sis<lb/>ters in the room, told me on the Tuesday when she was nearly dying, that she had something to communicate respecting the cause of her illness—I re<lb/>turned to the bedside, and asked what it was she had to say—she made no reply, which I attributed to weakness—the prisoner then said that about three weeks previously she had received a blow in the chest from a black man, which had very much frightened her, that she thought it had brought on a miscarriage, which was the cause of her present illness—I then asked the deceased if she heard what the prisoner said, and if it was true—she said it was—in the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination we found marks of recent miscarriage—that was not likely to have occasioned the injury to the ovaria—there was an abscess in the substance of the ovaria which was not likely to have been produced by miscarriage—I do not think it at all likely that a blow or push in the chest could have produced the appearances I saw—if she had received a violent kick three weeks before, that would account for the injury.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 16th of August, about eleven in the morning, I saw the prisoner Gilson at West Ham, fighting with my son William—I did not see the first of it—whether it was by arrangement I do not know—two constables came up, and Gilson ran away—my son went into his lodging just by—I went to the Angel to have a pint of beer—Gilson came there and challenged my son to fight him in the marshes at Temple Mills at seven o'clock in the evening—they fought, and my son got the worst of it—I saw my son come up very weak at the last round, and saw Gilson hit him on the side of the head—I had asked my boy not to fight, but he said if he did not he should be called a coward—I tried all I could to stop it—my son fell—Underhill picked him up several times, and stood behind him—he was his second, and carried him on his back to his lodging in Angel-lane—he was bled, but died—he had been fighting about a quarter of an hour—he was taller than Gilson and very thin.</p>

Between twelve and one o'clock I saw the prisoner standing at Mr. Braham's, and in a minute or two afterwards he passed my window with another—one of them said, "We will have a run for it, at any rate"—I looked out, and saw Mrs. Braham standing at her door, exclaiming, "They have taken a silver watch"—I followed the prisoner and his companion through seven dif<lb/>ferent streets—I passed the other, and pursued the prisoner, who kept run<lb/>ning till he came into Mile-end-road—he then stopped running, but kept walk<lb/>ing at a gradual pace—I followed him to Dog-row—I let him turn the corner, and then collared him—the officer came up and took the watch from him.</p>

About two o'clock in the morn<lb/>ing, on the 20th of July, I was on duty near Burial-ground passage, Padding<lb/>ton-street, and heard two females crying "Murder" at No. 7, Grafton-court—I went to the house—the door was shut—I knocked at the door—I heard several blows inside—the prisoner opened the door a little way—I asked him what was the matter inside—he said, "You b—, if you interfere with me I will murder you"—the cries of "Murder" still continued—I stepped back and sprang my rattle—I did not notice anything in his hand—I was in the court when I sprang my rattle, several yards from the house—he shut the door—Rogers,</p>

               <p>another policeman, came up, and accompanied me back to the house—I found the door open when I went, and Rogers followed me—I saw the pri<lb/>soner soner standing a little way in the parlour, with a knife in his left hand—on seeing us come in, he said, the first bl—y policeman who entered the room he would rip his b—guts out—he then stooped and picked up the poker with his right hand, and struck me a blow on the cheek with it—it knocked me down, and I lost my senses—when I came to, I found myself in a chair in the house, and sergeant Bennett there—he had got hold of the prisoner—I was attended by a surgeon—the prisoner appeared drunk.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable D</hi> 77.) I was on duty near Grafton-court on the morning of the 20th of July—I heard a policeman's rattle, and went into the court—I met two women crying "Murder"—it was about two o'clock—I saw Owden at No. 7 in the court—I went into the house, and saw the prisoner standing inside the front parlour with a knife in his left hand—I believe he was in liquor—he said be would rip up any bl—y policeman that came into the room—there were two children in the room, but no women there—I have known the prisoner some years—I said to him, <hi rend="italic">"Jem</hi>, you know me very well, be quiet, we don't want to hurt you"—he immediately caught up the poker, and struck Owden across the cheek with it—I saw the blood flow—Owden immediately fell back—he struck at him again, but did not hit him, as sergeant Bennett warded off the blow—it hit Bennett on the knuckles—he struck with the knob end of the poker I am certain—he then struck me across my arm with the poker in the same way—he had his left hand hanging down, with the knife in it, and he immediately raised it at me—I immediately struck him across the arm with my staff, and he dropped the knife.</p>

               <p>struck him on his arm with his staff—I got up to him as quick as I could, and collared him—we took him into custody—I was not there half a minute before Owden's cheek was struck—the prisoner was not struck before he struck the blow, while I was there—there was an attempt to rescue him which we resisted, and took him to the station—as he went along he said it was in consequence of his coming home, and finding a man in bed with his wife—he appeared to be tipsy—he said he wished he had killed the b—, meaning the man—I saw him at the office the same day—he said nothing about the man being with his wife then, nor the knife—he was sober then.</p>

                  </hi>. I hawk things about for my father, Aaron Hart. On the 26th of July, between one and two o'clock, I was with my father in a bye lane at Wood-green Common, in the parish of Tottenham—White came up, and asked what I had to sell—I said "Knives"—I uncovered my basket to show them—he took up a knife and looked at it—Smith asked him for it, and took it out of his hand—I asked him for it, and so did my father, but he put it into his pocket, and both walked on towards Rhodes farm—Smith said, "If you follow me, I will give you something else," and my father would not go farther—I went about half a mile to Wood-green for a policeman—we went round about two miles to Wood-green—I found the prisoners in about an hour and a half lying asleep in a beer-shop—the policeman took them.</p>

The prisoner lodged in our house in April last, during which time Patience Witts came to stay for a few nights—I had some conversation with her in the prisoner's presence, respecting the Saving's-bank—Patience Witts began talking about it first—they began <hi rend="italic">chaffing</hi>, and we had a little <hi rend="italic">romance</hi> about her bank—she said she had a sum of money in the bank, in St. Martin's-place—she had three boxes which were kept on the landing—I saw her deposit book one day as she was putting her clothes into a large box—she said she kept it at the bottom of her box—she said that in the prisoner's presence—the prisoner staid at my house about a week after Patience Witts—she then went into the country by railway—she gave me half-a-sovereign on leaving—I remember a parcel</p>

On the Saturday before the Monday she went into the country, I was walking with her in St. Martin's-place, and she said, "That is where Patience Witts keeps her money"—she said, "Let us go there"—I said, "What is the use of going there unless you have got the bank-book?"—she said she wanted to know which door they went in at—I said, "The front-door, I dare say."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Barthram, of Russell-street. On the night of the 27th of July I was at my father's gate—I saw Mrs. Longley pass—the prisoner and two other lads followed close behind her—my sister called my attention to them—I saw Mrs. Longley go up by Mr. Smith's—I followed her—when she got to Mr. Smith's, the prisoner and the other two lads were following her close behind—she crossed over on the Pavement of Mr. Smith's house—on her turning the corner there the pri<lb/>soner turned round and said, addressing the lesser lads, "Now is your time—the</p>

               <p>there probably three-quarters of an hour—he had received a wound in one side—he was in a state of faintness, breathing with great difficulty, and suffer<lb/>ing exceeding pain, saying he wished it was over, meaning he wished he was dead—the wound appeared to be mortal, as far as I could judge from the appearances—I did not see him afterwards—the gentleman that called on me was the same description of person as the prisoner—but I could not abso<lb/>lutely venture to swear he is the same individual—I believe he is the person—he is very like him, but I cannot say more than that—I did not particularly notice him when be came to me, and I see a great many faces.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 1st of July, I was in a rickyard, near the Brecknock Arms, at ten minutes or a quarter past five o'clock—I heard three reports of firing, and shortly after I saw a man in a dark frock-coat and a silver band round his hat in the cricket-ground, beckoning me to come to him—I went to the cricket-ground, and saw a carriage called a brougham there—I took charge of it for a short time for the coachman—I took the carriage out of the cricket-ground, by their signalling me, to the highway—when I got the carriage there, there were some labouring men bringing a wounded man out of a wicket gate, out of the target-ground—I also saw the prisoner there, and Mr. Gulliver—I am quite certain about the persons—I rode on the box of the brougham to the Breck<lb/>nock Arms; and after they refused to take him in there, we carried him to the Camden Arms—while I was at the Brecknock Arms I saw a mahogany case, about fifteen inches by eleven, and two and a half or three inches deep, taken from under the seat of the driver, and put into the brougham—the pri<lb/>soner put it in—the brougham then went away, and the prisoner with it—I assisted in taking the wounded gentleman up stairs at the Camden Arms, and laying him on the bed.</p>

I heard the report of what I considered to be one pistol, one report, and I heard the call "Doctor" immediately afterwards—in fact instantaneously—I turned round, and ran up to Colonel Fawcett who was lying wounded on the ground—Mr. Cuddy was standing near him—at least the gentleman that I consider to be Mr. Cuddy from report—the gentleman that had come down with Colonel Fawcett—he was standing with one of those thin upper coats on—it was the same gentleman that I mentioned before—Mr. Monro had at that time just run up to Colonel Fawcett—there was something said about levelling—levelling a pistol—Colonel Fawcett said that—he said he was not levelling at him, or was not covering him—I do not know which words—it was a word to that effect—Mr. Monro said, "Oh, Fawcett, I thought you were levelling at me, or I thought you were covering at me," or words to that effect—for my attention was so exclusively devoted to the wounded man, that I am not very positive, but they were words to that effect—they meant that.</p>

On the 6th of July, the day the Queen held a drawing-room, I saw Miss Jessie come in from a Walk, between twelve and one o'clock, I think—I had not seen her go out—shortly after she came home, the prisoner rang the bell—I answered it—he asked me if that lady who had just entered the house had lost any thing, as he had just picked something up at the gate—I went and spoke to Miss Jessie, returned, and told him she had not lost any thing—he said he was sure it was hers, for he had picked it up close by the gate—he held his finger in his hand, as if holding something—he said he should not show me what he had found, as it was his intention to advertise it the following morning; if the young lady found she had lost anything, and looked in the newspaper, she would there ascertain what it was—he asked if the young lady lived there—I said she did—he then left—his hair was very thick over his face, but it is now shaved off—he had a very large beard, both on his upper and under lip—I was ex<lb/>amined before the Magistrate—he had his beard then—on the 20th of July, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I heard the coachman's bell ring—I then received this letter from Mary Chandler, the coachman's wife, and</p>

On Monday, the 17th of July, I was in Kensington-gardens with mistress's child, and saw a tall stout man there, with a high forehead and long mustachios, and a great deal of hair on his chin, over his lips and below—the prisoner is the man—his mustachios are now cut off, also his whiskers and beard—there was nobody with him—I took him to be a foreigner, and could not think what he was looking at—he was on a seat, on the right-hand side—he did not get up, but looked very hard at me—I was playing at ball with the child—I went down to the bottom of the garden, and came up again—he was then on a seat on the left hand—he looked at me very hard—I came straight out of the garden—I know Miss Emily Hopper, she had been in the garden that Monday, and spoke to mistress's child, on the left-hand side of the garden—on the next day I went to the gardens again, and saw the prisoner and a woman with him, about the middle of the gardens—the woman stopped me and said, "What a pretty child"—I said, "Yes, ma'am"—she asked me the little girl's name"—I said, "Fanny Puddick"—the prisoner then asked me, was not Mrs. Puddick a friend of Mrs. Hopper's—I said I did not know, as I had not been there long—he then asked, was not that Mrs. Puddick that lived round in Porchester-ter<lb/>race?—I said "No; Mrs. Puddick, my mistress, lives here, facing the gar<lb/>dens"—he then asked, "Was not that Miss Hopper speaking to the little girl in the gardens yesterday?"—I said, "Yes, sir"—he then asked how many Miss Hoppers there were—I said I only knew two, Miss Emily and Miss Jessie—he asked their names before I told him—then he asked if there were any more—I said, "I do not know"—the woman then asked the child to kiss her, and she did not like at first—he said no more, and I passed on—I recollect his telling the woman that was Miss Hopper speaking to the child yesterday in the gardens.</p>

If you wish to read my letter to your sister, you can do so; but if it is shown to any other person, her character is blasted. She knows what I mean, and I dare say you do the same; at all events, you can guess the cause of her being sent into the country. If this fails in reaching you, I shall send one through the channel of Mr. Ross's family. Your obedient, <hi rend="smallCaps">RBELL</hi>. All communications must now be sent to me at 39, Somerset-street, Portman-square.

I saw you leave Derby-terrace this morning, and one of my men accompanied you to the end of your journey, and will remain there until I relieve him. It cer<lb/>tainly appears as though you cared very little about your reputation, or indeed that of your family, or you would have made some proposal to buy my secret long before this; but perhaps you have not fully understood me. I will, therefore, be as plain as possible with you; and I expect you will give me a decisive answer before twelve o'clock on Tuesday next.

               <p>me, and hare all your friends know your mishaps? Your father, I suspect, knows it, by his removing you from home; but whether or not, I shall tell him all, as well as the rest of your friends and neighbours, unless you pay me for holding the secret. I have used you too well; for had it been some persons, they would have at once disclosed all; but I feel anxious to give you a chance of saving your reputation from utter ruin, and yet you neglect the opportunity I have given you. My object was merely to wish to save your character from being blasted; but if you don't care about it, let me know, and I shall apply elsewhere. Perhaps you think that my word alone will not be credited; but I am fully prepared for this, as I have several witnesses, all of them respectable householders, ready to identify you, should my word be doubted; but I know you dare not compel me to produce them. At present none of them know who you are, or where you live, but all of them can iden<lb/>tify you from a hundred others. In fact, one of them is a gentleman living exactly opposite the house; both him and his wife saw you several times, and he knows both your face and that of your friends. You had better let him see this, and hear what he says. I don't suppose he would like the affair known either by your father or in the public papers; but this will be the case, I assure you, unless my expenses are immediately paid. I do not wish to compel you to pay me, if you do not feel anxious to do so, as I am quite sure of being paid by some one or another. I merely give you the chance of purchasing my secret, which you will admit is worth knowing, This is very kind on my part; but, as I said before, I would rather sell my secret to you, and save you from ruin, than sell it to others, who would ex<lb/>pose you and your family. However, do just as you please. Should you not write before twelve o'clock on Tuesday, I will explain all to your father and your brother, besides all your friends, both in the neighbourhood and elsewhere. Besides, the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Satirist</hi> newspaper would gladly purchase a secret so well authenticated as mine is. This certainly would amuse your friends. Your having neglected to write has compelled me to send this to your sister Emily; and if she reads it, it will be your fault. You know my determina<lb/>tion, and I will only refrain from exposing you when you have made me some offer for the expense and trouble I have been at. In case I am out of town, you must write to me, 'care of Mr. Hamilton, 39, Somerset-street, Portman-square.'—P. S. Your sister has carried a very high head with my messenger; but I dare say, when all is known, she will be glad to hold it a little lower. An advertisement may perhaps bring you to your senses."</p>
               <p>"To Mr. Hopper.—Somerset-street, Portman-square, July 27.—Sir, I beg to inform you, that I have received instructions from Mr. Robert Bell, of George-street, to subpoena a daughter of yours, Miss Jessie Hopper, as a witness against a brothel in this street, which Mr. Bell and others have authorized me to indict at the ensuing Session, and which brothel your daughter has frequently visited during the last two months, in company with an officer, who will also have to appear as a witness for the prosecution. As I imagine you are ignorant of these proceedings, I have thought that the better plan would be to inform you of Mr. Bell's intentions, before any further steps are taken, in so disagree<lb/>able a case; and I would advise you to put yourself in communication with Mr. B. immediately, as it is his present determination, in case I should not be able to serve your daughter with a summons, to produce his witnesses in Court, to prove that your daughter visited the house for an immoral purpose, Therefore, whether she appears in Court or not, the exposure will be equally as great.

I am governor of the gaol of Newgate—the prisoner was brought in on the 5th of August—he then had a beard and moustachios—his appearance is very much altered since then—last Monday I saw him in the cell-yard, and drew the attention of the Sheriffs to him—he had then been shaved, and had a handkerchief tied round his face—I observed to him that he had shaved himself, that the turnkey had put into my hand a knife, which I produced, and I asked how he had got it into the gaol, as it is the practice to search prisoners, when they are brought in, to take from them any weapon they may have about them—he said that he had it at the New-prison, scraping his nails with, and that a prisoner there told him he would not be allowed to bring it into Newgate, but if he was desirous of doing so, he could put him up to a plan by which he might effect it, and that was, by concealing the blade between the sole of his boot, which he told me he had done, and had come in with it in that way—he said that was the knife with which he had shaved himself.</p>

I live at Wapping-wall, and work for a ship<lb/>ping master—on the 4th of July I was at the Coach and Horses, High-street, Shadwell, about three or four o'clock in the afternoon—two sailors went in with me to get some half-and-half—the prisoner who was there asked them for some beer—one refused, the other said, "Give her a drop"—the prisoner then took the pot and glass and handed them round with the beer—the sailor said Come, you have not had any beer, old man, yet;" and while he was putting the pot over to call for more, the prisoner took a silk handkerchief out of his pocket and placed it under her arm or shawl—I said, "That won't do, <hi rend="italic">'stow</hi> that; if you want to rob anybody, you must rob them at home, don't rob</p>

On the 26th of August I and a friend had been out, and on returning felt rather thirsty, and went into the Bedford-Arms to have a glass of porter—the prisoner was there, and a female who had lodged with her had a bunch of flowers, she asked me to smell them, and gave me one—the prisoner then became very angry, and used a great many blackguard words, then struck me on the left temple with her first, and after that took up a carpenter's mallet which was on the table I believe, and struck me on the left temple with it—I had not struck her—I fell, and do not know what happened after—I believe she was a little in liquor—we had had a few words four or five months before, but nothing to signify—I cannot tell why she struck me with the mallet—she keeps a brothel, and is like me as well.</p>

                  </hi>. I went to the public-house with Mrs. Taylor—some workmen were doing repairs—I saw a girl there with flowers—she asked Taylor to smell them, and I believe she took one—some words passed between her and the prisoner—she said, "You are very fast in taking the flowers"—Taylor said, "They have nothing to do with you—they do not belong to you"—the young woman said, "Do not have any words about them"—with that I believe the prisoner struck Mrs. Taylor with her fist—the landlord came in, and there was a wrestling together—Mrs. Taylor said she had a fight first herself, but I did not see it—I saw them struggling—the</p>

               <p>landlord tried to part them—I saw the prisoner strike her with a mallet and put her out—I went to put my shawl on the bar, and when I returned they were fighting again at the bar—it commenced in the tap-room—she struck her with the mallet about two minutes after striking her with the fist—they both struck at the first, and the landlord parted them; that was when she struck with the mallet—Taylor threw off her bonnet and shawl after the first blow was struck.</p>

I examined the prosecutrix, and found a contused wound on the right side of the head, with corresponding swelling on the op<lb/>posite side, a bruise under each eye, and several abrasions of the skin about her face—the wound on the head might have been inflicted with a mallet—those on the face I consider to have been done by the nails—we consider all wounds on the head dangerous, for fear of inflammation—the skin was broken superficially, and there was effusion of blood under it—there was no concus<lb/>sion, nor any thing very serious—she may not he said to be out of danger now, taking into consideration her habits of life.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, and live in Leadenhall-street. On the 26th of June, about a quarter to three o'clock in the afternoon, Meyer came into my shop and asked me to show him some rings—I did so—he selected one at five guineas, and desired me to substitute some rubies for the emeralds—he left me a ring with a crystal in it, requesting I would put a garnet in it—the ring cost about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., independent of any stone—there were some rings in a tray lying near where the prisoner was standing—I should think 300 or 400—before he left the shop, from an intimation my brother gave me, I entertained some suspicion—my younger brother followed him, but did not succeed in tracing him—I did not think myself justified in seizing him at the time—I afterwards found that a diamond ring was miss<lb/>ing, worth twenty guineas.</p>

On the 26th of June, some time before three o'clock, Meyer came into the shop—my brother showed him some rings—I observed one of them was missing, and followed him out of the shop, and immediately caught sight of him just after he passed Lime-street—he had got some short distance—he joined Berg under the portico of the India-house—Berg could not see the shop from where he was placed—when Meyer joined Berg, he entered into conversation with him for about a minute—they were then standing at the door of a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I did not see anything pass between them—they separated—Meyer walked on a little further and hailed a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, with his stick pointing westwards—he got in and we drove off towards St. Paul's—when I returned, Berg was in the other <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and the horse's head was towards Whitechapel, but still stationary where I had left it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. James Stedman, linen and woollen draper, No. 44, Bedford-street, Strand. On Friday morning, the 28th of July, about a quarter after nine, the prisoners, Williams and Young, came to the shop and asked to look at some calico to make a wrapper—I showed them some—they complained of it not being stout enough—I showed them canvass which is made for wrappers—they purchased a yard and a half—while I was serving Young, Williams took five pieces, containing about twelve yards of woollen cloth, from the shelf—he carried it out of the shop under his coat or cloak which was hanging on his arm—he handed it over to Morris, who remained outside—he had not been in at all—Williams afterwards returned into the shop, and put the things straight on the shelf, which he had disturbed—the two afterwards left the shop together—I immediately pursued them, stopping to put nothing away—I called for the police, but they had received information from some stranger, and were following them—they went down Maiden-lane, which is about three doors from the shop—they were walking—Morris was seized in the lane—he threw the cloth down in the road—he was taken to the station—the other two ran away, but were pursued by a policeman—Williams was taken at the end of Maiden-lane—Young ran down the Strand and was secured—Young bought half a yard of</p>

On the 8th or 9th of March, the prisoner came to me, and brought a bill—I believe it was the 9th of March—he brought this bill with him, and stated that he wished it to be discounted—he said it was the bill of Henry Bush, of Bristol, a most re<lb/>spectable merchant in that city—he mentioned Baldwin-street, or some such street—he said one of the partners was in the town-council of Bristol—I then asked him who had recommended him to me—he said his solicitors, Ford and Savage, of Henrietta-street, Covent-garden, who are persons I know very well—I asked him to leave me the bill, to make inquiry—he said, "I will tell you something, Mr. Samuel; if you like, I will take a cab, and ac<lb/>company you to Ford and Savage, to satisfy you what I have said is right"—this I think was between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning—I went with him up to Henrietta-street—we both went in—the clerks said neither of the partners was there—the prisoner said, "It is rather unfortunate; I want the money, as I have bought a lot of cabinets; will it do if I bring you a letter from Ford and Savage, to save you the trouble of calling again"—I said, "Yes, perfectly so," and we parted—he took the bill with him—in the afternoon I received this letter and bill from Ellis, my clerk—the prisoner came next day, and asked me if I had read the letter—I had the letter and bill in my hand—I said my clerk had read it to me, as I could not read English—I asked him why Mr. Ford's name was not to the letter—he said Mr. Ford was not at home, and he thought one of the partners would do—(<hi rend="italic">letter read</hi>—"9th March, 1843.

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What countryman are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was born in Dublin—I have been at sea since the 28th of July, 1821—I was three years at sea then, on board a merchantman, trading to the West Indies—I then left the sea, and went with my father, who was in the corn business in Dublin—I staid with him till he failed, in 1831, and then I came to London, and shipped on boad the <hi rend="italic">Lady Nugent</hi>, to Bombay—I came home in 1832—I went out again in the same ship, and came home in 1833—I then went out to Sidney—I have not had a ship all the time—I was out of a ship from last December, at Shields, till I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Marquis of Huntley</hi>—I have been out of a ship before, but I have always had a ship pretty regu<lb/>larly—I lived at the south side of Shields—I forget the woman's name I lodged with—she lived in Lower Thames-street—I came to London from Shields in December—I could not get any work from December to April—I was at the Destitute Sailors' Asylum part of the time—I was without money—I had clothes to cover me—I had no jacket—I was ragged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you apply to Mr. Charles Lavey in April last, begging of him to get you a ship, stating that you were in a ragged and destitute condition, that you had no place to lodge in, and had been walking about the streets all night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never told him I was walking about the streets all night—I did not tell him I would be obliged to him to get me a ship, that I was in a ragged, destitute condition, and had no place to lodge in—nothing of the sort passed—I was spoken to first by the prisoner's husband as I was walking past the shop—I was not walking past in rags and without shoes—I had shoes—I was not altogether in rags—my shirt was not torn—Charles Lavey did not send John Eels on board the <hi rend="italic">Marquis of Huntley</hi> with me to get three or four days' work till he could find me a ship—the old man sent me down that morning—Eels went with me—I had not seen Charles Lavey at that time—Charles Lavey was not in the habit of paying me from day to day my earnings on board the <hi rend="italic">Marquis of Huntley</hi>—the captain did not desire me to quit the ship because I was so ragged that he could not receive me—nothing of the sort—he never complained of my condition at all—I knocked off work when I found I did not sign the articles—the captain said, "As you have worked on board the ship, you may continue to work to-day"—he did not say he would not sign articles with me, because I was so ragged—I have never run from a ship—I and three others were sent on board the <hi rend="italic">William Brandt</hi> at the same time, at Commercial Dock—we were all shipped by the captain there—I had no clothes from Mrs. Lavey, or any of the family, until after I went on board the <hi rend="italic">William Brandt</hi>—I was not supplied with any apparel in order that I might be in a condition to go on board the <hi rend="italic">William Brandt</hi>—after being shipped, I and the other men returned in the waterman's boat to Shadwell, and went to Lavey's shop—I did not then select clothes for the purpose of my voyage on board the vessel—I did not select things amounting to 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I believe it is the custom to pay the waterman something who gets a man a ship, but I was never shipped in such a way before—I have heard it is customary to give 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the waterman—no articles selected by me were tied up in a handkerchief—I did not go from thence to the Golden Eagle—I did not go to the Golden Eagle at all, nor stay there an hour or an hour and a half—I did not return to the shop by the direction of Lavey, nor did he say to me, "Come, Yates, I want you to sign your note"—I did not say I was all of a shake, and could not hold the pen, and ask whether making my mark</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184308210083"/>
               <p>would not do as well—(I was perfectly sober, unfortunately I could not get otherwise, I had not the means)—Charles Lavey did not upon that say, "That will do, come in, and do it at once," or "do it directly."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Charles Lavey then write something on the back of the note, and did you take the pen and make a mark on it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never saw the note—when I got the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I said I was going down to the ship—I never heard him say he would send down my things—two days after, some things were sent on board to me as the vessel was just quitting the dock, by Eels—he did not give me the bundle—I would not have it—he offered it to me—he went on board the vessel to Gravesend—the captain came on board about six or seven in the evening—I do not know the name of the waterman—I never saw him before or since, till I saw him here—I did not select any clothes in his pre<lb/>sence—he never came to me as I came out of the Golden Eagle, and said, "I want my 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I did not say, "Stop a bit, I shall get the money for my note"—I did not go into Lavey's counting-house, or back room, with Murgatroyd, the waterman—I was never in it—Murgatroyd did not say, on my putting my mark on the note, "Why, you signed your name to the ship's articles, why don't you sign your name to the note?"—I did not say I could not be bothered to write then, and that my mark would do as well, nor any thing to that effect—Charles Lavey did not pay Murgatroyd 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on my account, in my presence—I do not recollect Murgatroyd saying, when I first saw him that day, "Yates, where have you sprung from?"—I did not reply, "From the straw-house"—I had come from my lodging in Rosemary-lane that day—I do not recollect the party's name—it is a barber's shop, opposite Dock-street—I paid fourpence a night—I'had got work in the Lon<lb/>don Dock, now and then, sufficient to pay my lodging—I did not tell Murgat<lb/>royd I had come from the straw-house, that I was ready to go anywhere, and would give him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if he could get me off—this note is for more than half a month's advance—half a month's advance would be 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I know Henry Gardiner—I do not know whether he is the man that took me and the other sailors on board at the Commercial Dock—I had a bundle when I went on board there, containing a shirt and pair of trowsers—I lodge with Gardi<lb/>ner now—I do not recollect seeing Gardiner on board—I did not receive a bundle from him on board—I never said to Gardiner, in speaking of this charge, that I had been persuaded to do this; that I would go through with it, as I had begun, as I had an idea of making a good thing of it—I never said, "If I do anything, I shall not take less than 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Gardiner wanted me to take 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and go away to Southampton; and I was taken by the arm yesterday, and told a lady wanted to see me—I had nothing to drink on the day it is said I signed the note—I was not inside a public-house that day—I paid for one pot of beer for some persons that befriended me, but I did not go after it; they brought it me, and that was all I had to drink—I came ashore from my voyage last Sunday fortnight—I hurt my back getting out of the ship, and did not make any complaint about this before the Magistrate till this day week—I then went to the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The agents of the owners made the complaint before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and they conduct this prosecution—they stopped my money—Gardiner did not offer me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to keep out of the way, but he said he thought it would be given if I would keep out of the way—he said I might as well take it—I declined, and yesterday a stout man came and took me by the arm, and said a lady wanted me across the way—I had no jacket before I went on board the <hi rend="italic">William Brandt</hi>—I had nothing but what I stood upright in, and my shirt and trowsers, which I redeemed from my lodging—Rayner</p>

                  </hi>. I am captain of the <hi rend="italic">William Brandt</hi>, jun. In April last I applied to the prisoner, who is a slop-seller, to ship me some men—I left with her some advance notes, filled up and signed by myself, and per<lb/>fect, except the endorsement of the man that was to receive the money—their names required to be filled in—this was one of the notes I left—I saw a shopman of the prisoner's on board the vessel at Gravesend, with a bundle of clothes—Yates did not take any clothes from him to my knowledge—I did not receive any clothes from Yates which he got from the shopman, and lock them up in my cabin—I could have supplied clothes to some of my men, if they wanted them; not to all—I always carry some with me, to supply my men with, as I sail to a cold country—I heard something respecting Yates's ad<lb/>vance note, in consequence of which I wrote to the agents in St. Helen's-place—I never saw Yates put his cross—I see the name, "Thomas Yates," written on this note—I was not present when that was done—I have been in the prisoner's back-parlour—I was never present there when Yates put his cross to this paper—I put my name to it there, but not in Yates's presence—I filled up five or six—I never was anywhere where Yates put his cross, or saw the names of Charles Lavey and Thomas Yates written.</p>

Adolphus and Henry Brandt, who are agents for the <hi rend="italic">William Brandt, jun.</hi>, and have to pay the advance notes that are issued by the Captain, on account of the ship to the seamen—the prisoner came to our office sometime in April, and presented this note for payment—we had had advice from the Captain not to pay it, as the man said he had not endorsed it—we told her we had such advice from the Captain, that he had stopped the payment of the note as Yates had not endorsed it, and we promised to write to the Captain—she then went away with the note—she returned in two or three days, I believe at the latter end of April, or the beginning of May, and threatened that if we did not pay the note, she would place the matter in the hands of a solicitor—Mr. Brandt told her in my presence that we had received a letter from the Captain, and that if she took the money she must take it on her own responsibility—she agreed to take the money, which she did, gave her name</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner is my mother—my father and her have carried on business in Shadwell, as slop-sellers for seventeen or eighteen years—it is part of that business to supply sailors going on voyages with clothes, and to procure them ships—if they have no money to pay for their clothes, these notes are usually given—they are signed by the Captain of the vessel in which the sailor embarks, and ought to be countersigned by the sailor—these notes constantly come into our possession—I first saw the pro<lb/>secutor about a month or three weeks previous to his going with the <hi rend="italic">William Brandt</hi>—he came to our house and asked if we could get him a ship—he was in a most deplorable state, with neither hat, jacket, shoes, nor stockings—I got him work on board the <hi rend="italic">Marquis of Huntley</hi>, for which I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day, and his victuals—he was there three days, and a quarter—an applica<lb/>tion was made at our office to procure seamen for the <hi rend="italic">William Brandt</hi>—I spoke to the prosecutor about it, three or four days after he left the <hi rend="italic">Marquis of Huntley</hi>—he had been sent ashore, and was still in a most deplorable condi<lb/>tion—Captain Grotian brought me four of these notes for the purpose of pro<lb/>curing seamen—four men, of whom Yates was one, were brought to our shop by Murgatroyd, the boatman—it is usual to pay 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per man to the boat<lb/>man for shipping, and their waterage extra—I sent Eels our shopman with</p>

               <p>he could write and would not, and that makes him bring this case here, I suppose—he did not take it in his own hand—he had the top, and I held the bottom part—I wrote "Thomas Yates" after he put his mark; after he touched the pen to the mark—the mark was made at the same time—the name was written first—we both had hold of the pen at the time the mark was made—I wrote my own name, "Charles Lavey"—I generally write it at the top, and sometimes at the bottom—I wrote that afterwards—Murgatroyd is not in my service—he does a little work for us now and then—he was waiting for his money at the time this was done—I would not give him the money till Yates had signed his note—he was standing leaning against the counting-house door—Eels was about the shop, but I think he brought Yates in, and he then stood alongside at the time—there was one on each side of the door, to the best of my belief—I know they were both present at the time I was writing—Murgatroyd was leaning against the door, and Eels was standing on the left side of him—he was in the shop, because there is not room for three to stand in the counting-house—he was close enough to see what was going on—they both saw it—I would not pay the money till the receipt was on the back of the note—I did not write my name then—I think I wrote that at Mr. Brandt's office—I went there, not with my mother, but alone—I went to re<lb/>ceive the money for the note.</p>

"—Yates said, "It will make no difference, my mark is just as good; I scarcely ever sign a note," or something to that effect—eight sailors out of ten make their marks—I made no remark to Eels or Murgatroyd about it.</p>

On the 7th of August, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was coming home from work, and saw the prisoner's wife quite tipsy, and another woman leading her—she crossed the street, swearing most awfully, and said, "Have you not got a warrant against my husband?"—I said, "No"—she collared me, and gave me three or four blows at the side of the head, and scratched my face—I caught hold of her arms to keep her from doing so—she was very tipsy, and fell three or four times—I could not get loose of her hands—she tore the sleeve out of my jacket, and likewise tore my waistcoat—my wife came out, and by some means I got in doors—before I could hardly get in, the prisoner came rushing up, swearing awfully, and said, "I will have his life"—my wife and daughter tried to shut the door against him, but he got; his foot inside—Lunn, who lodges in the house, came up, and said to him, "What do you want here, kicking tip a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, why don't you go home?"—he said, "I will have his life before I go away"—when Lunn got inside, and tried to shut the door, with my wife and daughter, I ran up stairs, and got a staff—I made a blow at the prisoner with it as he was trying to get in at the door—it did not hit him to my knowledge—the staff was taken out of my hand, and fell on the floor—he up with his hand and cut my head with a knife—he and his wife then made another rush, and he, and his wife, and I, all fell down together—they were outside the door when they made the rush—we could not shut the door be<lb/>cause he had his foot inside it, and his back against it—we fell just at the step of the door, in the door-way—he and his wife caught hold of the hair of our heads, and pulled us down—the man, my daughter, and I—several people then came up and took them away—he struck me with the knife over Lunn's head or shoulder—my daughter was then in the passage trying to keep the prisoner out, trying to shut the door against him—I went to a chemist's and had my head strapped—it bled very much.</p>

On the 17th of August, about half-pact eleven o'clock at night, I was going over Blackfriars-bridge, and saw the prisoner on the parapet, with her legs over—I said, "Are you going to drown yourself?"—she said, "What has that to do with you?"—I said, "You had better come back"—she directly came back, caught hold of some gentleman's arm that was coming over the bridge at the time, and went down Blackfriars-road with him—about half-past three, I saw her again on the same parapet—she had then thrown herself but some female had hold of her clothes—her apron was down on the stone that projects over the parapet—we got her over, and I fetched the police—she seemed to have been drinking a little.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of John Mills and Henry Withers, Hosiers and glovers, in the Poultry. About nine o'clock at night, on the 22nd of July, there was a pile of hosiery inside the door—I saw them all turned over—I ran out and saw the prisoner and another woman running—I took the prisoner seven or eight doors off—we brought her back—I asked my employer if there was anything missing—he said "No"—the prisoner passed to the door—the policeman saw her putting something under her shawl, and stopped her—I afterwards saw the handkerchief—this is it—it is my masters'.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at the Windmill Inn, Bushy-heath.

               <p>first said she bought it for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and that it was lined with white silk, but she had sold the white for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., so that it had only cost her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I must know who the woman was, because I could swear to the silk—she then told me she had it from a person in Suffolk six or seven years ago—I offered to write to the lady—she objected to that, and did not give her name, but said she would write to her herself—I insisted upon her fetching the silk, as I could swear it was mine—my little girl and servant went with her to her home to fetch it—I pointed out some marks by which I knew it—I told her the consequence if the policeman was to know it—she then went to the po<lb/>liceman to see herself righted, and brought him with her—I afterwards went with the policeman to Mr. Hatton's, where I found a part of my property in the room where the prisoners slept—it consisted of a pair of drawers, a nightcap, and some other things now produced—these drawers are mine, and had been kept in a chest in the same room where my silk had been—my house is in the parish of Harrow-on-the hill.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Jane Perry put in a written defence, stating that she had bought the gown eight or nine years ago, of Mrs. Bryanton, of Stradbrook, in Suffolk; that the other articles she had taken home to mend.</hi>

                  </hi>. I got my discharge from the army on the 8th of May—I went to lodge at a house in Red Lion-court, Poplar—the prisoner was mis<lb/>tress of the house—I was told it was a lodging-house—women used to come there, but the prisoner gave me a room to myself—I was out all day—on the Saturday night the prosecutor came to the house with a girl of the name of Sutee—they came into the sitting-room—I did not see the prosecutor, after Sunday evening, till about half-past-six o'clock on the Tuesday evening, when he came in with the prisoner and another woman, who, I believe, sold fish—he had been drinking—I could not say he was drunk—he sat down on the bed—the prisoner sat on a chair—the other woman sat down close by the door—after some time the prisoner asked if he was going to send for anything to drink—he put his hand into his waistcoat pocket and pulled out two sove<lb/>reigns, a half-sovereign, and two half-crowns—she called me as a witness, and I saw the money—I could not swear it was that money, but I saw it was gold—she went down, and brought up a pint of beer, a pint of cyder, and half-a-pint of rum—all the company drank together—I saw the prosecutor begin to fumble about his pockets, and I heard some money jink in his pockets—the prisoner said, "I think he has more money in his possession"—she got up, put her hand into his pocket, and took out fourteen sove<lb/>reigns, and called me as a witness to take notice of it—the prosecutor was not very drunk then, not till after the prisoner went out again—she did not drink anything before she went out, or give him anything—I saw some beer, cyder, and rum poured out all together by Sutee—I could not say whether the prisoner poured any out—I only saw one tumbler handed to the prosecutor, and that was by Sutee—I only saw him drink out of that one tumbler after the money was taken from his pocket—he then threw himself backwards across the cot—the prisoner then went out, and returned in an hour and a half, as nearly as possible—I was in the room all the time—she had showed me the money in her hand before she went out, but she had not said what she meant to do with the fourteen sovereigns—when she came back she asked me to strip the prosecutor and put him to bed—I put him to bed—he went to sleep, and, the prisoner went out—it was then about half-past twelve at night, and she returned about half-past five in the morning—she then awoke him, and they both went out together—she asked him if he was going up to London to buy some things—he said yes; and when the prisoner returned she had some new things with her—she was given into custody about half-past five on Wednesday, I believe by Mrs. Tierney—the prisoner was at that time in a public-house—the policeman called me in, and pointed her out—he asked me whether that was the woman who committed the robbery—I said that was the woman who took the money from Thomas Hickey.</p>

On the morning of the 15th of July, at a little after eight o'clock, I was dusting the warehouse—two persons came in—one of them inquired for a situation, and he had been annoying me before for about a fortnight—I then began to sweep the pavement outside—one of the neigh<lb/>bours' young men came and told me a person had gone into the warehouse—I went in, and found the prisoner with two 10lb. bundles of cotton in his hand, stooping down behind the door—I was going to strike him, but missed him—I said, "What brought you here?"—he said nothing, but jumped up, and a scuffle ensued—he struck me several times, and we rolled out into the street together—he did not carry the bundles of cotton out, but he had carried them about five yards from the pile that they had been on to the door—they were the property of Messrs. William, George, and Joseph Strutt, of Derby, the manufacturers, and Mr. Pearce is the agent.</p>

                  </hi>. I, my father, and my brother, are in partnership toge<lb/>ther, as cap-makers, in Houndsditch. We occupy five houses behind ours—Griffiths was our clerk and foreman for three years, down to the 8th of July—Lethborg came into our service about three years since, and left about the beginning of January—his wife had been taught the trade on our premises—on Saturday, the 8th of July, I received information which caused me to have inquiries made about some goods—I received a communication from Griffiths—I was not aware that Lethborg was the proprietor of any shop in the same line of business—I went to Lethborg's shop within an hour after I had re<lb/>ceived the communication, with two officers—I found there were caps there of what we call No. 132, and some we call naughts—Lethborg's shop is in Worship-street—I found him at home, and took him into custody—I told him it was for receiving stolen goods—I searched his premises, and found a number of cap-tops and other things—we purchase them in this state—we could not miss them, our stock is so very large—this worsted plush is ours—here is a piece of gingham that I believe to be ours—it has our mark on it—this other piece of plush I have no doubt is ours—I asked Lethborg who marked these things—he said he did—I asked for the pattern—he pro<lb/>duced one, which was too large, and then he said he must have lost it—I asked if he could not tell me where he bought the gingham—he said he could not, but it could not be ours, it was commoner than we used—I ex<lb/>amined, and found it was of the best quality we ever used, and is made for us—I asked where he bought the cap-tops—he said, "Of a man over the water"—I asked where—he said he could not tell, but he had been to his house—I asked where his house was—he could not tell—I asked whether it was near Southwark, Westminster, or London-bridge—he could not tell—I asked the name—he said he did not know—here is other property, which, from the appearance and trimmings, I have no doubt are ours—I never knew two houses that trim exactly alike—they all make a difference in the man<lb/>ner of trimming—there are some things here which I do not like to swear to—I believe the whole of the articles mentioned in this indictment to be ours.</p>

I knew the prisoner two years ago, and she went to reside with her friends in the country—she returned on the 22nd of June, and staid nine days with me—she was in the kitchen, and I told her to set the table for dinner—I had three sovereigns, one half-sovereign, two half crowns, a sixpence, and a ring in the drawer—about half-past two o'clock in the day I left the keys in the drawer a little while—I went into the back kitchen to wash—I returned, and took the keys out—I did not look whether my money and ring was then safe—I went out to hang out my clothes, and left no one in the house but the prisoner and the servant—when I retained the prisoner was gone—I went to my drawer about half-past five, and mined the money and ring—I had a good way to go to hang my clothes out—I might be gone an hour and a half—this is my ring and locket—on the 16th of July, I and a friend met the prisoner in the City-road—we accused her of the robbery—she said she was sorry she had done it—I said, "So am I, Eliza, I did not think you would have done it"—she said, "Nor did I, will you forgive me"—she took the ring off her finger and gave it to me—my daughter keeps a lodging house—she lives with her husband—she has not lived in West-street for some time—I do not keep a house of accommo<lb/>dation.</p>

I went to the street door and saw the prisoner, the other man left the house, and they were just joining together—the prisoner stood stock still at the post, the other man went to the left towards Brunswick-square—I watched him a few minutes, till the policeman came in sight, and the prisoner took to his heels—I said, "Follow that man, he has been in my house"—I desired him to search him—I went home, and found these coats and trowsers were lying on the bed in a heap together, and the bed partly made—they had been removed about a yard and a half, and had been unhung from the hook on the door—I had shut the door on the single lock—the things belong to my lodger, Frederick Thomas George Crees.</p>

I hope you are very much better; I have not been happy since I left your house"—I said, "Emily, I am sorry to say I have been robbed of a vast quantity of glass, china, lace, and cambric"—she said, "Glass and china, lace, and cambric; I never saw any at your house"—I said, "You forget yourself; have you any of my things in your box?"—she said, "No"—I said, "Have you any objection to my looking into your box?"—she said, "You may, with the greatest pleasure"—I said, "Perhaps Mrs. Faulkener and her daughters will accompany us"—Emily then said, "No, you shan't look into my boxes without a search-warrant"—a policeman was then called—he went up stairs—Emily gave some things to him from her own box, and said, "These are my mistress's"—I have looked at them all, they are mine—I have brought a great many things to match with them—I went to the police-office at Kensington with her—I asked what she had done with the other things that I had missed, and she said they were at her mother's, Sarah Barber—I went there—the policeman said he came to look for stolen goods of mine—Sarah and her daughter-in-law said they had not anything in the house—on which the policeman searched Emily's boxes, and found some soap, candles, and other things—I saw a great quantity of linen—there were some things in the window-seat, two bottles of sauces, a candlestick, some glasses, soap, and a lantern were found in the cupboard in Sarah's room—she said she knew nothing of them—she did not open her daughter's boxes—that she knew nothing of those things which were found in the cupboard—I can de<lb/>cidedly say these things are mine—these glasses, which were found in the cupboard, my husband bought at the Duchess Dowager of Rutland's sale—I have brought some others to match them—I have missed them from my stock—this tumbler I know—these two bottles were found in the cupboard—one contains whiskey—I cannot swear to these bottles of sauces, they were found in a box at Sarah's—I did not know the boxes.</p>

I hid myself close by the yard—they could not see me—I was looking through the win<lb/>dow of a house—I could see all over the King's Arms yard—about nine o'clock I saw Mr. Gray's cart come to the premises—White was with it—he fed his horses with some mixed victuals, which he took from the top of the cart—he then went into the house—Borham was in the yard, attending on the horses—he fed them with some new hay, which be took from the top of the cart—in about half an hour he fed them again, with some more new hay—he then went in—he and White came out together, and bad some conversa<lb/>tion, which I could not hear—White got on the top of the cart, and handed a full sack down to Borham—I gave Samuel Benton the signal, and he went to the spot in the private stable, where Borham went to—I saw the sack in the stable, and took it, and Samuel Benton took Borham—White was at the top of the cart—I told him to come down—he got down, and said he was going to feed his horses again—I told him I should take him on suspicion, as I had seen him feed his horses three times before—the sack contained about two bushels and a-half of mixed victuals.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Anderson, and live in Old-street. My husband is an engineer—I carry on a lace and fancy business. I engaged the prisoner on the 29th of April, 1842, to sell my goods—when he received the money he was to bring it to me—I was to allow him 7 1/2 per cent. on the money he brought in—among other customers, he mentioned to me the name of a Mr. Jay, of Regent-street—he had goods from me at va<lb/>rious times, which he said were for Mr. Jay—in the beginning of Sept. he said that Mr. Jay wanted credit—his goods had been sold for cash before—I consented to let him have three months' credit—there were more goods than usual went to Mr. Jay at the beginning of this year, but I did not get the money that I expected, and I told the prisoner I would go to Mr. Jay—he said he would rather I should go, as he had asked so repeatedly for the money, and Mr. Jay had made so many excuses, that he could not pay it, that it was very irksome to him to ask any more for it—my solicitor wrote first to Mr. Jay, and then in June I applied to Mr. Jay—on that day the pri<lb/>soner came, and I asked if he had brought any money from Mr. Jay—he said, No, Mr. Jay was going into the country, where he had some houses, and he should receive the rent for them, and he was to go on Monday for the money—I saw no more of the prisoner till he was taken into custody—I</p>

The whole of the money I have paid you during that time was what I bad taken in the shop—I have frequently been obliged to sell the goods at considerably less than cash price, on purpose to get some money for you, hoping to be able to keep it up till the latter end of next month, when I shall have some money, as I am then going to be married to a young lady at Gravesend, who will be of age then, and I shall have some property to receive, &amp;c."</p>

I had some fowls and two tame rabbits—Freer had lived with my father as ostler, and left about a month or five weeks ago, to go to live about three hundred yards from our house—the fowl-house was fastened with a latch which could be opened outside by a person who knew how to do it—he had seen me open it—I do not know Kendall—on the 4th of August I fastened up the fowl-house—there were nine fowls and two tame rabbits in it—next morning, about five o'clock, I missed eight fowls and a rabbit, and there was some blood on the ground—I went to the station, and found them—I am quite able to say they were mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to John Wells, a pawnbroker, in Broad-street, Bioomsbury. On the 5th of August I missed a coat, which I had seen safe about an hour before—I saw the prisoner scuffling with a man about two hundred yards from my master's—I went up, took the coat from bim, and gave him in charge—when he got about fifty yards, he slipped out of his coat, and got away from the policeman, and was not taken till a week after—this is the coat—it is my master's.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Harper's-mews, Theobald's-road—on Tuesday evening, the 15th of August, I was opposite Mr. Gunton's shop—I saw the prisoner and another person walking backwards and forwards—the prisoner then stood at the corner of the shop—we went over to Lamp-office-court and saw the prisoner take the bundle of things from just inside the shop door, and give them to the other one, who was at the corner of Chapel-street—he went up Chapel-street in the dark, and the prisoner after him—we followed them round Bedford-row to Red Lion-square and told the policeman—the other one then chucked down the bundle and ran away—the prisoner did not run—the policeman took him—he said, "I cannot walk along the street without these young vagabonds giving me in charge"—I knew him before.</p>

On the 15th of August I left my jacket on the table where I lodged—I missed it the same evening—I went to the Britannia saloon in search of the prisoner the next day, and accused him of stealing it—he said if I would keep him from trouble and out of the policeman's hand, he would make the jacket right to me, and told me to go further up the street that the crowd should not know what was the matter—I walked up about half a mile, then stopped, and asked him about the jacket—he began at high words—the constable came up and asked what was the matter—he said there was nothing the matter—he then told me if I went up a little further he would tell me all—the jacket has never been found—after I gave him into the hands of the police he told something.</p>

The prisoner was my journeyman—the glasses which are the subject of this charge were kept up one pair of stairs in the glass-room—he would have ready, access to that room I put great confidence in him—on the 17th the had to go out with some pattern glasses—I ordered him to get his patterns ready, which he did while I was at breakfast—when I returned he had got his basket ready—I told him to wait a minute, and to get two old patterns of blue cups and saucers to take to another person—while he was doing that I put my finger into his basket, and found there was something—I said, "Never mind that, we shall have some more"—I went to the end of the shop, and called out, "How many patterns have you got?"—he said twenty-nine—he then left, and I followed him—when I got to North East-passage, Wel<lb/>close-square, I saw a policeman—I desired him to go and stop the prisoner—he stopped and asked what he had got in his basket—he said, "Nothing but some patterns"—I felt in his basket, and said, "You may take him to the station"—when we got there I examined the basket, and found twenty-nine patterns, and these eighteen publicans' dram glasses—he said it was a trick, that any of the men in the house would hang him, and some of them had put them there—these are the glasses—there are three different sizes, six of each—they were at the bottom of his basket—he could not have put the twenty<lb/>nine patterns in without knowing these were there.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my sister, Mrs. Sarah Thornhill, in the parish of West Ham, Essex. There is an orchard at the side of the house, between it and a row of houses, called the Printers'-buildings—the nearest house of that row is about a hundred yards off—they face West Ham-lane—there is a passage down the side, along the back, and up the middle of the houses, with a wall about eight feet high—on Saturday night, the 24th of June, I went to bed about half-past ten o'clock—the house was then safe—I was awoke by the policeman, about twenty minutes or half-past two—I found the back door open, and a hole bored into it, about the size of a quil—the door was not forced open—it was opened from the inside—some tiles were taken off the roof of the back kitchen, and a hole cut through the ceiling, by which a person could get through—the back kitchen communicates with the cellar, and we had lately had some bottles of Marsala, and spirits in stone jars placed in the cellar—when I came down in the morning I went with the policeman into the orchard—it was just getting light—we saw some tracks, and followed them—they led to a corner of the wall opposite the Printers', buildings, and by the side of that wall in the orchard I found about three dozen of wine in bottles, a loin of veal, some gooseberry-pies, and the princi<lb/>pal contents of the larder—on the wall were some bottles of wine in a basket of ours, which had been in the back kitchen—we lost the tracks at that place—I afterwards examined the cellar, and missed from it four gallons of brandy, and four gallons of gin, in four stone bottles, and about a dozen and a half of wine besides the quantity we recovered in the orchard.</p>

It is the last house but two before you get to the orchard surrounding Mr. Vooght's house—Mr. Craske was out on Saturday night, and did not come home till between one and two o'clock on the Sunday morning—about that time my aunt told me something—I went to the back window, and saw a person on the wall surrounding Mr. Vooght's house—he remained there a great while, it seemed to me—it was not half an hour, but I was so frightened at the time, I cannot recollect—he was sitting right on the wall, and I could see his arm keep going over the wall backwards and forwards, as if he was taking something over—I believe that man was Wilks—I had seen him once or twice before as he passed the door—I do not know where he lived—he got down in front of the wall—his face was then turned sideways to me—I have</p>

I am a farmer—I live at Deddington, in Kent—I have used the Nag's Head, Borough, for thirty-eight years when I came to town—I left home on the 13th of July, and had five half-sovereigns and some silver in a bag—I went through Sittingbourne, and there received three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, nine sovereigns, a half-sovereign, and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., t and arrived in town about eight o'clock in the evening—I supped with the landlady, and went to bed</p>

               <p>about twelve—I was quite'sober—when I came in in the evening, I felt my money quite safe in my left hand pocket—I doubled my breeches up, and laid them under the bolster—I had buttoned my pocket—I awoke next morning about four o'clock, just looked out of the window, laid down again, and went to sleep—I awoke by hearing a noise like the jingling of money—I said nothing for a few seconds—at last, thinking I heard somebody on the left hand side of the bed, I called out, "Who is there?"—I put the curtain aside, and there stood "boots" (the prisoner) by the side of the bed—I said, "Halloo, are you come for my shoes?"—he said, "No, I came to call you," and that he was ordered to call me at five o'clock—I said, "I gave no orders"—I saw him distinctly, and think it impossible I can be mistaken—I knew his voice, and saw his side face—he walked out of the room, saying, "I have made a mistake then, for I had to call somebody"—being one of the servants I did not at first think anything of it, but in a few minutes I examined my trow<lb/>sers, which I found just where I had put them—the pocket was not turned out, but unbuttoned and drawn up towards the top, and my bag and money were gone—I got up, went down stairs—I sat in the coffee-room, and gave him my shoes to bpush, which he did—he put them down, and turned to go out—I then asked him why he came to call me—he said he had not been in my room at all—I told him I had lost a parcel—he said he knew nothing of it—I then told him what it was—he said there was more in the house than him, there was sweeps sweeping the chimney, and people had got up and left about five o'clock, he did not know who they were, and there was another servant—I said, was he up?—he said "No"—he asked if he should call him—I said, "Do as you please"—he said, "It might be another person"—I said, "No, I am satisfied it is you"—I then considered I might as well see the other, though I was certain of him—I said I should go and stop payment of the notes—when I returned the waiter and prisoner were both there—when I saw the waiter I was positive it was not him—when I charged the prisoner with it about six o'clock he said, "Have you searched? you may have dropped it in the room; you was out in the evening, perhaps it might be picked out of your pocket"—I said, "No, I am quite certain it was safe when I went to bed"—the chambermaid afterwards produced my bag, containing three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—the gold was gone—I had been at the Nag's Head last June, but should not have known the prisoner if I had met him in the street before that, as a servant of the house—I am satisfied he is the man who was in my bed-room.</p>

I keep the Old Red Lion, in Bridgt-stwet, in the parish of St. Mary, Lambeth—on the rooming of the 4th of Aug., I went to bed about two o'clock—I examined the house previous to going to bed—there is a door leading to the stable—I fastened that myself by two bolts, and shut down all the first floor windows—after retiring to bed, I was alarmed by hearing a policeman call me by name, and ringing the bell—I opened the window, and after hearing what he said, I went up stairs, called my waiter, and immediately came down stairs—I beard somebody, as I thought, trying to open the front door which faces the water—there are two fronts to my house, the back-door leads to the stable—the stable yard is generally open all night—when I got down stairs it was quite dark, in consequence of the house being cloied—I went towards where I heard the noise, and seized hold of somebody by the collar—I could not recognise him at that time—the man I seized, said, "You have been robbed, Sir, I am looking for the thief"—I said, "If that is the case, no harm can come to you;" at the same moment, I re<lb/>ceived a violent blow at the back of the shoulder—I could not tell what it was with—I then seized the man tight by the throat—I could not tell who he was at that moment—I then received another blow, on the temple, at the side of my eye—it did not quite stun me, but made me feel rather stupid—I</p>

               <p>then caught him tighter, and put my legs round him, and flung him on the top of the kitchen stairs, on the landing, level with the ground floor—I threw myself on him, and held him till assistance came—the policeman B 53 came from the stable yard with others—somebody brought a light which enabled me to see the man—it was the prisoner, Huggett—I was upon him—I did not loose my hold of him at all—I am quite positive he is the person I first seized, and am sure he is the man who struck the second blow; because, while I held him, I felt his arm come against me—I saw nobody else when the light came—I then went into the bar, and found it strewed with various things—some silver spoons and forks were bent, and thrown about the bar—I found the bar door had been opened which I had locked at night, and taken the key to bed with me—I found the bar window had been forced by a crow-bar—I found one of the first floor windows open, which I am positive was shut when I went to bed—it was merely kept down by its own weight—I found the dust on the stone of the balcony scraped away by finger<lb/>marks, and the marks of a shoe with a nail—the balcony is about nine feet from the ground—a person could easily get up there, and from there get to the window—from a small cupboard in the bar, I missed three silver spoons, and a five shilling paper of copper—my bar-maid's work-box was forced open—the tills were emptied of four sixpences, and about four shillings of copper money—nearly five pounds weight of cigars were taken from inside the bar—I found many of them strewed about the passage leading to the stable yard, and one bundle, unbroken, in the stable yard—two stairs below where I struggled with Huggett, I picked up a life-preserver; and the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. packet of halfpence I picked up where I threw Huggett—the life-preserver was close to the spot—about ten minutes after I went down stairs into the cellar, with the policemen, and heard a policeman say, "Here is another man"—he was in the cellar—we found the prisoner Jones in the coal cellar—after he was taken, we were searching among the coals, and on turning them over, found a crow-bar, which I afterwards fitted to the bar window, and it answered the marks exactly—I do not think any of the prisoners were in the house the previous night—the back-door was fastened before I went to bed.</p>

On the 14th of Aug., about half-past three o'clock in the morning, my attention was called to the prose<lb/>cutor's house, by seeing Palmer and Lutchford talking together at the foot of Westminster-bridge—when I got up to the corner of Stangate, Lutchford came towards me, and said he thought there was something wrong at Mr. Mackintosh's, we had better go round to the back, and see if it was safe, which he did—I went up to Palmer—he said something to me—I looked to see if there was any light through the doorway—it was all in darkness—I then went to the side door and heard some whispering and footsteps more from the direction of the bar towards the side entrance, leading to the landing of the stair-caseat that moment Lutchford returned and stated something—I sent him back again—after a short lapse of time I called out to Mr. Mackintosh several times, and as I rang the bell Mr. Mackintosh opened his bed-room window—I told him I thought thieves were in the house—he said, "I thought I heard them a quarter of an hour ago"—the next moment I heard the swing door which leads to the back entrance of the premises pulled back—it works on a pulley, and when the door closes again the pulley makes a noise, which would let me know that the door was closed—about a minute afterwards one of the witnesses came up to the corner of Stangate, and called out to me to send further assistance—I then sent Palmer round to the back of the premises—shortly afterwards I saw Lutchford in the road—he called out to me for assistance, in consequenoe of being stabbed by a knife—I ran to his assistance, and saw Trenate in the act of standing over him, and Lutchford hanging on to the waistband of his trowsers—Trenate had a knife in his hand—Lutchford was on the ground—he turned over twice while I was running from the bridge to where he was lying—I hit Trenate a blow with my fist on his head, and the knife fell down on the left, and he fell to the right of Lutchford—I secured the knife and the prisoner the next mo<lb/>ment, before he got up from the ground—at the same moment there was a cry for further assistance at Mr. Mackintosh's—a drayman came up, and being a man I knew well, I asked him to take charge of Trenate, which he did, after I disarmed him—I then returned to the house, knocked at the door, and was admitted—when I got in I was told something by Banister—I</p>

On the 21st of July, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I desired him to go into the counting-house, and told him to take off his hat, which he did—I found these nails in it—there are 4lbs.—they had come from the cooperage, which the prisoner had possession of—he had no authority whatever to take them away—they were precisely the sort of nails that we use in coopering tallow-casks, which was his occupation—he was going off the premises.</p>
