                  </hi>, I reside at Liverpool, and am managing partner in the firm of Rylands, Seddon, and Co.—I recollect the ship <hi rend="italic">Richard Rylands</hi> leaving England last summer about June or July—she was bound for Calcutta—the prisoner was the captain—J. Ogle and Co. of Calcutta were the consignees—the prisoner would receive the freight, and give a receipt for it—it would be his duty to remit it to us in bankers' bills—these letters are the prisoner's writing—(<hi rend="italic">These letters were dated Calcutta</hi>, 5<hi rend="italic">th December</hi>, 1863, <hi rend="italic">and 9th January</hi>, 1864, <hi rend="italic">to Messrs. Rylands and Co. Liverpool, the first stating that in conjunction with Ogle and Co. he had chartered the ship with rice for the Mauritius, and enclosed a</hi> 500<hi rend="italic">l. Bill of Exchange, forwarded by another captain</hi>)—This other letter of 8th February, 1864, is the prisoner's writing—it is dated The Hoogley, Calcutta (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—I believe this paper, purporting to be the appointment of Mr. McFarlane as captain, is the prisoner's writing—it is dated 5th February, 1864—I was not aware of that appointment until made aware of it by the agents—we were not made aware of it by the prisoner until he arrived at the Mauritius—this letter is the prisoner's writing—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated Mauritius</hi>, 5<hi rend="italic">th April</hi>, 1864; <hi rend="italic">it alluded to the appointment of Mr. McFarlane as stated in a previous letter, and stated that the prisoner's own health was so much shattered that he doubted his ever recovering; that small pieces of bone came from his leg, and wounds in his neck and cheek were still open</hi>)—This letter refers to a previous letter, communicating the fact of Captain McFarlane's appointment—I never received such a letter—the other letter, dated Aden, 17th August, is the prisoner's writing, and this memorandum—(<hi rend="italic">The letter stated that his health obliged his remaining at Aden, and that he had forwarded the Calcutta accounts and vouchers</hi>)—(<hi rend="italic">Memorandum read:</hi> "I received 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the agent at Mauritius, and lodged it in a mercantile bank, in exchange for which I received a bill on myself; three days after my arrival I called at the bank,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186407110004"/>
               <p>and got the bill endorsed, and afterwards had it cashed; the proceeds I lodged in two banks at Stockton-on-Tees for safety; 2,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the Stockton and Darlington Bank, and 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at Backhouse's. This amount, 3,900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. belongs to the owner of the ship, with the exception of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. belonging to myself. I paid 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to the broker in Loudon for discounting the bill")—I first heard of the prisoner's arrival at Marseilles from the French police—I do not remember the date—I heard of his arrival in England from the police; I can't remember the date; I think it was after the 13th—he never communicated with us after leaving Aden—I never saw or heard of him till he was arrested—it was his duty upon receiving the Bill of Exchange at the Mauritius to endorse it and forward it to us—supposing he had neglected his duty and brought it with him to London he ought to have forwarded it to us immediately on his arrival in London; he had no authority to discount it—I know nothing about this letter (produced—I never wrote it—the signature is an imitation of mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> At the time the statement was made by the prisoner were you aware the money was in the Stockton Bank? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I had obtained that information from Inspector Carlisle of the Liverpool police—I have received the 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. minus the discount, since the prisoner has been in custody—there was nothing due to him for wages, I am certain of that—he had a certificate of service—he had never served for us before—this was the first voyage he had been on our account—the voyage was from England to Calcutta-Messrs. Ogle and Co. were the agents for the charterers at Calcutta—they were not our agents; they were agents for the ship—when the prisoner left Calcutta for the Mauritius he went as supercargo, from his statement—the captain he appointed is not here—there is no one here from the Mauritius; I believe Mr. John Ogle is in London—the vessel was chartered from Calcutta jointly by Ogle and Co. and the prisoner—this 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was sent by the captain of another ship through the prisoner—the prisoner did not remit any more than one Bill of Exchange from Calcutta—I do not know whether upon a fresh captain being appointed abroad the agents write to the Registrar-General—I have been in the shipping trade from ten to fifteen years—the balance of the freight was left in the hands of the agents at Mauritius—it still remains there—I can't speak to the amount—the agents advised us of it, and paid the disbursements of the ship out of it—I don't recollect the balance; it was a small balance—it was more than 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does that balance and the 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. make up the whole of the freight? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and the money the prisoner advised us he had received—he sent us an account accounting for the money he received in Calcutta—the freight which he received at Calcutta was nearly 5,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that is all accounted for-in the captain's account he only accounted for 165<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received in the Mauritius-that was the account sent from Aden.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Fletcher, Parr, and Co. ship brokers, of Leadenhall-street-we were brokers to the Rylands—I chartered the vessel myself, and have seen all the accounts sent from the agents at Calcutta—the accounts before me do not give any credit for the freight at Calcutta—this (marked G) is the captain's account; it only gives credit for 485<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the other document is merely a freight list, showing that 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the probable freight to be earned by the vessel from Calcutta to the Mauritius, receivable at Mauritius.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

I have been an inspector of police, and am now employed by the Mint under the sanction of Sir Richard Mayne—I went to 4, Gilbert's-buildings, Islington, with Inspector Fife and Sergeants Leather and Elliott—I placed myself at the front-parlour window, while Fife and Elliott forced open the parlour door—I looked in at the window and saw the male prisoner in his shirt sleeves stooping over a bright fire, and the female prisoner was stooping; I could not see what she was doing, but she seemed employed—they must have touched one another—Isaac had something white in his hand, wrapped up in this pad (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); it is an article used by coiners as the mould becomes hot when the metal is poured in—he threw down something white on the floor which appeared like plaster of Paris; the mould separated, and I saw something white drop from it—he stamped on the plaster, and I then raised up the window—Sergeant Leather got in by the window, and Fife broke the parlour door in—I collected the dust from the floor; it was plaster of Paris—I saw the female take something off the fire, which I believe to be this iron spoon, bent in the form of a ladle; she ran from the fire and put her back against the door which Fife was forcing open with a sledge hammer, the force of which pushed her nearly to the middle of the floor—I saw Isaac take something bright from the corner of the table, and throw it on the fire—I took a bucket of water and threw it on the fire, which put it out—I then searched the cinders and found three sixpences, quite hot and unfinished; also this <hi rend="italic">get</hi>, which was so hot that I could not hold it—I also found some white metal such as is usually used in coining, and this piece of antimony, which is used to increase the weight and give it a clear ring—I found some wash, and all the necessary implements for coining—I found this sixpence on the mantel-shelf with plaster of Paris in it, and in the fragments of what he threw down I found some metal quite hot—we also found some plaster of Paris in powder and pieces of glass on which moulds are made—I found some white sand in</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor in Rood-lane, and am a London Com<lb/>missioner for taking affidavits—previously to the present year I had known the prisoner—I knew him when he was a clerk at Mr. Holloway's, who was a client of the firm in which I was a partner—he used to bring letters from Mr. Holloway and take answers back—on 20th May he called upon me with Mr. Sack, and produced this deed and an affidavit, and he asked me as a London Commissioner to swear Mr. Sack to the affidavit—he asked me at the same time if I would have any objection to attest Mr. Sack's signature to this deed as an attorney—I asked him if Mr. Sack had any other solicitor—he said that there was no other solicitor employed, and knowing something of him, I did not object to attest the execution of the deed by Mr. Sack—the deed was not then in the same condition as it is now with reference to the word Becker, Mr. Becker had not then executed the deed, and the words, "Philip Becker and," were struck out of the attesting clause in my office, and I attested the name of Sack—the initials here A. C. are not in my handwriting—I did not give the prisoner or any other person any authority to affix those initials—the name here, "Anthony Carr," is not my handwriting—my name appears here in two places in which it has not been written by me—this is not my handwriting (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Deed or instrument referred to in the affidavit marked with the letter A made before me, this 30th day of May, 1864, Anthony Carr, Commissioner for administering affidavits in Courts of Chancery,"—this writing on the back is not mine either—from the day I attested the deed I never saw it again till now, and I did not see the defendant again until the Registrar of the Court of Bankruptcy made an official communication to me—the signature "Anthony Carr," to this affidavit marked B, is not my handwriting, nor has it been affixed with my authority—this signature to the certificate underneath the schedule is not my handwriting (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Bankruptcy Act of 1861, Philip Becker and Her<lb/>manu Sack, carrying on business at 38, Endell-street, Bloomsbury, provision merchants, make oath and say as follows," <hi rend="italic">it purported to be signed by Philip Becker and Hermann Sack, and the attesting clause was as follows:</hi> "Sworn by both the deponents at my office, 25, Rood-lane, in the City of London, this 2d day of June, 1864, before me, Anthony Carr, a Commissioner for administering oaths in Chancery.")</p>

               <p>altered it, I should, probably, not have charged him, if it had been on the same day, I should have excused the fee—the fee is very small, one shilling and sixpence for each oath administered—the signature to this affidavit is very unlike mine—they are both very unlike my signatures—I think it re<lb/>sembles the writing of the body of the document—it is desirable to have the creditors' names on the face of the deed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registrar in the Court of Bankruptcy, and am at the bar—I remember the prisoner coming to my office in Quality-court—I believe it was on 27th May—he brought me a deed, which I believe to be this one, but I had not occasion to look at it—he brought me this one again on a subsequent occasion—I find here, "Philip Becker," struck out, and subsequently "Philip Becker" added—there is a seal opposite each name—it would appear as the deed now stands, that it had been executed by Becker and Sack—the initials A. C. are immediately over the P in Philip—I returned the deed on 27th May, and subsequently kept it—on that day the prisoner brought to me a registration-stamp of ten shillings, and an affidavit verifying a deed which I believe to be this deed; immediately on his presenting to me the papers, I noticed that there was a blank where the amount of property distributable under the deed ought to have been inserted, and I drew his attention to that fact, and told him that I could not take the papers, that it would be necessary for him to have the amount filled in, and that the debtor should be taken to the commissioner, and the affidavit re-sworn—he took the papers away, and brought them to me again about ten minutes afterwards—I asked him whether that affidavit had been re-sworn, and he told me that it had—I asked him whether he had taken it to Mr. Carr, and, I believe, he first told me that he had done so—I reminded him that Mr. Carr resided at 25, Rood-lane, and that having regard to the distance between Quality-court and Rood-lane he would not have had time to have gone there and returned, and I also brought to his notice the fact that the ink was not dry—he then said that he had by accident met Mr. Carr at the law stationer's in Quality-court—that the amount had been inserted in the affidavit, and that the insertion had been initialled by Mr. Carr—I noticed that the initials A.C. were placed in the margin immediately opposite the alteration—as there was no evidence on the face of the affidavit that it had been re-sworn I returned it to the prisoner for the purpose of having it re-sworn—I gave him back the deed, and he took all the papers that he had brought—he came again to me a day or two afterwards, and brought the affidavit, which is the subject of this indictment, marked B—I believe this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this contains the statement as to the the amount of composition—I looked through all the papers which he brought with this, and found that they had the appearance of being correct—I noticed that the certificate, which appeared upon the copy deed, appeared to have been signed by Mr. Carr himself—this is it—"I hereby certify that the above is a true copy of the composition-deed, made by Philip Becker and Hermann Sack, of Endell-street, Blooms<lb/>bury, provision merchants, and I further attested the said deed as their</p>

               <p>solicitor. Anthony Carr." The copy corresponds with the original—it would appear to have been executed by Becker as well as by Sack—the documents the prisoner brought were technically correct—I compared the signature to the exhibit, which appeared on the copy-deed, with the signature of Mr. Carr at the foot of this certificate, and they appeared to be in the same handwriting—I then asked the defendant whether the name of Anthony Carr, which purported to be only a copy of his signature to the exhibit on the original deed, was in Mr. Carr's handwriting, and he told me that it was—I then asked him if he understood my question, as I told him it was most unusual for the solicitor signing the certificate to sign also the copy exhibit—then he told me that they were all in the handwriting of Mr. Carr—I believe I then showed him every signature, and asked him whether he was certain that all of them were in Mr. Carr's handwriting, pointing to them one by one, and he told me they were—I then impounded the deeds—I saw the defendant five or six times altogether.</p>

Q.</hi> The affidavit that was presented on the first occasion was returned to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the informality was, not having the amount of the composition—previous to 20th May, there was an order of the Court of Bankruptcy that the signature of the debtor should be attested by the solicitor—that was under the Act of Parliament—the recent order is, that deeds should be presented by a solicitor to the chief registrar—before that order, a great many deeds were presented by persons who were not solicitors, the debtors themselves occasionally—on an average from twelve to four<lb/>teen deeds a day are registered.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, in partnership with my father—some years ago, when the firm was Miller and Carr, the defendant was in the habit of coming to our office frequently; nearly every day—he was in the employment of Mr. Holloway, who was a client of ours—I became acquainted with the defendant's handwriting, and I know Mr. Carr's handwriting—the initials, A. C, on this deed are not in the handwriting of Mr. Carr, but they are in the handwriting of the prisoner—the words, "Anthony Carr," on this part of the document are not in the hand<lb/>writing of Mr. Carr, but they are in the handwriting of the prisoner—this, "Anthony Carr, a commissioner for administering oath in the High Court of Chancery," is not in the handwriting of Mr. Carr, but it is in the handwriting of the prisoner—the whole of these others are in the handwriting of the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at 74, Sun Street—the prisoner came into my employ in January last, and staid till June—his duties were to dispense medicines and to visit patients in my absence, and when I sent him—on 14th June he was as usual in the shop in my employ—I have a consulting-room behind the shop—I left the shop on that afternoon a few minutes before 4—the prisoner was then there in charge—I left 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the till, in a little box concealed from everybody but the prisoner, and some small change in the till in the table-drawer in the consulting-room, which was locked—I left a cash-box containing 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver—1<hi rend="italic">l</hi> of that was in sixpences—I returned about 9 o'clock on that day—the prisoner was absent—I found only Jane Crisp, the servant, there—I found the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. gone out of the till; the other money was left—I found the key, which ought to have been in a place only known to the prisoner and myself—I had left it there—I was very busy then, but next morning I found two papers in the shop which I was sure I had left in my cash-box, and I went im<lb/>mediately to the drawer, and found it had been forced open, and all the cash taken out—the prisoner did not return; he ought to have stayed till 11, if I was out—I instantly gave information to the police—the prisoner's salary was a guinea a-week, with board, except breakfast—I had a character with him, which I find since was a false one.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was coming from my sister's place to see my grand<lb/>father in Northampton-street, and when I got to the parcel office at King's-cross Smith (<hi rend="italic">see next case</hi>) came up and said, "Halloa, Davis! where are you going?" I told him. He asked me if I was in work. I said, "Very little." He said that he was doing better than work, and living like a gentleman. He put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a handful of half-crowns. He asked me if I would take one into the baker's shop at the corner. I said, "No." He said, "You need not be frightened; do you mind sending a boy in?" He told me to call a boy and send him in, and give him a slice of cake and a penny. I did so, and Smith came over to me again, and said, "You see it is all right; they cannot hurt you." I offered him the change and he would not take it; he told me to send two separate boys in, and be sure not to send the same boy in twice, but to ask the boy whether he was the same boy that went in before. When I saw the policeman coming I was frightened and threw the half-crown down. He took me, and I told him about Smith, and that he had more bad money about him. I had not the slightest intention of doing this when I left home.</p>

               <p>shop at the time he bought the boots, but he did not recognise any; he gave them the benefit of the doubt—I recognised Walker by his build and his stature, and that was the pair of boots I sold him—I remembered that he was a tall stout man, his beard was dyed at the time; it is altered now, it was a deal blacker—he had a pair of leggings on, and I noticed when I fastened them, that he had a very stout calf; it measured about sixteen inches round—I sell a great many boots, perhaps eight or nine pair a day, and sometimes seventeen or twenty—others serve besides me—when I told Walker these boots, I made a certain remark to our manager—I entertained no doubt about his respectability, or I should not have changed the note—the private mark in the boot is No. 9—I recognise the mark and the man's make—there is no No. 9 in this boot, the perspiration from the foot has disfigured it; it has been there, it is more plain in the other—I could swear to these boots from a hundred makers—the 9 is the maker's number—the object in putting a number is to distinguish different journeymen's work—we manufacture a great many boots, and we have other shops of our own that we supply which may have boots of the same number—other shops may have boots with the same number, but not that particular man's make—it is very seldom that two men make alike—a man accustomed to tie business knows the different workmen's work—I believe those boots to have been made by No. 9—I am employed as an assistant; I do not make boots, I sell them—I have been an-assistant about fifteen years—I never made any boots—I do not know the name of the man that makes No. 9—I can get it—he has made for us a long time; that is the reason I know his take so well—no doubt some of his boots have been sold at other shops—that was the only pair of that kind sold that day at our establishment—we have twelve other shops—we do not supply other shops besides our own—we do no wholesale business—I adhere to my statement that until the moment that I pointed out Walker at the Post Office, I had no conversation about him with any one in the room, except our managing man; not a word was said—I did not point him out when I went in because he had dyed his whiskers—I said, "That is the man, I am sure," and directly he stood up I recognised him, and said I could swear to him—I am prepared to swear to him positively—I swear positively that the man who bought these boots from me had a black beard—I cannot be mistaken in the beard; I can swear that the man who came to our shop and bought the boots had a black beard; I mean when I saw him at the Post Office he had a black beard; when he bought the boots he had a light beard—I call his beard now a light beard, lighter than it was at the time he came to our place; I mean lighter than when I saw him at the Post Office, and his hair also is much lighter.</p>

Flatau, with whom I communicated, and on the Wed<lb/>nesday following Mr. Jacob Flatau and I went to the shop, and asked to see some men's boots—I looked at the marks on the uppers, and knew that they were my own cutting—I had an officer waiting outside, and Mr. Flatow went to the door and beckoned him in—twenty-nine pairs of boots were then produced, the uppers of which I recognised by my own mark of the size.</p>

Nathan, ladies' and gentlemen's boot and shoe maker, 31, Prospect-place, Cambridge-heath, Victoria-road;" that is the place where I went with Mr. Flatau, and first saw the boots—this is the other card, "Clark, wholesale boot and shoe maker, 90, St. John's-road, Hoxton."</p>

I keep a boot and shoe shop at 19, Duke-street, Ald<lb/>gate—I have known the prisoner five or six years—I was in the shop in June when Mr. Jacob Flatau and the officer came there; I was out when they called, but when they came back I saw them take these boots (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had purchased the upper leathers of those boots of Arnow two or three months before—I saw Arnow at the station, and stated in his presence that I had purchased them of him; he denied it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you charged with receiving these things, knowing them to have been stolen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I was not guilty—on my oath I did not know that they were stolen when I received them—I gave half-a-crown for them—they were worth about four shillings and sixpence—I knew where Arnow was employed as a servant, and first of all I did not believe he came honestly by them, but he told me that he went to sales and bought job lots, and that satisfied me, as I believed it—he satisfied me directly after I bought them—I did not go to his employers—I do not keep books—I made no memorandum when I bought them—I have known him five or six years, but have not been buying of him all that time, because he went away at one time—he satisfied me that he got them honestly when he first sold them to me—I do not know whether he was then employed at Flatau's—I have known him to be employed there off and on, between five and six years, but he went away from there—I bought uppers of him then—he told me that he bought at sales when I first bought of him, and I never made inquiries afterwards—I did not see Messrs. Flatau or any one in their employment—I do not buy at sales—I never saw the prisoner in a sale room—when I went to the police-station I first knew that they were the property of Messrs. Flatau—I bought the uppers, not the complete boots—I have known of uppers being sold at a sale; there was a sale at Spitalfields, and I saw uppers sold there—I do not know whose property they were—it was not a bankruptcy—I have beard a good deal of uppers being sold at sales—I knew another instance at the West End, and I have seen sales in the paper, but have not attended them—I do not manufacture uppers—I have also purchased of Mr. Jones, of Bishopsgate-street—I give five and ninepence for the best quality—the cost to the manufacturer of those I give four and sixpence for would be about four and threepence, but you could get them up cheaper than you could buy them.</p>

I have only been five years in London come December next. was never in a position to see Mr. Farrar, until I had been a year in London; for one year after I made his acquaintance, I sold him several parcels; and since then, I have had no goods suitable for him to purchase.

I am a comb-maker, at 3, Queen-street, Chelsea—I know the prisoner as a horn presser and polisher—he has been in my father's employment—on Sunday, 5th June, he came to my place—I had seen him on the previous Tuesday, and he asked me if I could do with some ivory pieces to manufacture combs, as he was in a position to get some pieces, and supply me with three or four gross a week—I said, "Yes;" and he said he would bring me a gross on the following Sunday as a sample—he came on the Sunday, and brought me a gross and four pieces of ivory, for which I paid him twelve shillings—these are the things—it is not customary to sell pieces of ivory in this state—on the following day, I communicated with Mr. Carter, of Primrose-street, upon the subject, and on the Tuesday I saw the officer Smart—I wrote a letter on that day to the prisoner, making an appointment, and met him on Wednesday at a public-house, nearly opposite the London Tavern, from about half-past 7 to 8 in the evening—I told him that I could do with some more pieces—he said, "How many would I have, as he was unable to get them without three or four days' notice"—I said, "I should like two gross; when can you bring them?"—he said, "I can't bring them before Sunday, but I shall by then, and it will not interfere with my work"—he then made an appointment to bring me two gross on the Sunday—I did not see him again till the following Monday, when he was in custody—this description of ivory, in my judgment, is worth from twenty-five to thirty shillings a gross.</p>

At 11 o'clock, on the evening of the 21st June, I was on duty in Clifford-square, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor—the prisoner first came out of a doorway, and the prosecutor came out of the same doorway directly afterwards—he said, "She has got my watch"—I laid hold of her, and he did also—I produce a watch—I saw her pass something into the prosecutor's hand, and I got the Watch from him—the prisoner said, "For God's sake do not lock me up, for the sake of my children; I have not got the watch"—I said, "No, I saw you give it to him."</p>

I am a hosier, carrying on business at No. 131, New Bond-street—between 10 and half-past, on the night of the 21st of June, I was in that street—I was perfectly sober—I was walking from Piccadilly towards Oxford-street—I saw the prisoner at Long's Hotel—she asked me if I would lend her a light coat which I had on—I turned round, and walked back—at the corner of Burlington-street she asked me to treat her—I said I should do nothing of the kind—we walked on beyond Burlington-gardens—I did not notice any other persons—when I got to the corner of Cork-street, some men came behind, and pinioned my arms—the prisoner pushed aside, and I saw my watch-chain drop; she was then in front, close to me—she then ran away—I ran after her to the corner of the next street, about a dozen yards—I then laid hold of her, and the police-sergeant came up—I did not see my watch until I got to the police-station—I had had it in my hand, but had not seen it—the prisoner put it into my hand—she said at first she had not got my watch; then she handed it back, and asked me not to lock her up—the watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my watch.</p>

POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was anything said about you having to collect money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he said he was a debt-collector as well, and I should have to collect a good many debts—nothing was mentioned about the money on that occasion—a few days afterwards I went by appointment to Magarigle's office, in Farringdon-road, and saw him and Broughton there—we went into Magarigle's private room—Broughton stated the nature of what I was to have to do; that I was to receive 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week to commence with, and wanted me to be bound for twelve mouths—Magarigle took down in writing the terms which Mr. Broughton offered, to enable him to draw an agreement out—Magarigle said, "By-the-bye, you will want a deposit," and Broughton said, "Yes, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said I should have a deal of money to collect on account of the directory, likewise to collect debts; and he had a tradesman's book with him, which he showed me, and said, "You will have a good many of these to collect"—there were names and amounts—I said I should be prepared to deposit the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told Magarigle that if I deposited my money I ought to have security—he said he did not suppose that I should get consols for my security—Broughton was not present at that time—Magarigle said if I left the case in his hands he would see that I was righted, so that in case of Mr. Broughton's death, or anything occurring to him, he would get a man to stand in with him in the agreement, to sign the agreement—I did not agree to go into the employment for a month in the first instance—at first, when the draft of the agreement was made out, it was for twelve months, and he told me to sign that the same evening; and he said, "It is merely to authorize me to draw the agreement"—that was a memorandum—I signed it with the understanding that it was merely to authorize him to draw the agreement out—this agreement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was afterwards prepared—I signed this about the end of November, at Magarigle's office—Broughton was present when I signed it, and he also signed it—Keighley was there; he was introduced by Broughton as a respectable tradesman—it is witnessed by J. Magarigle and E. H. Keighley—at that time I told them that I did not think I should like the work, and I would rather give it up altogether—that was before I signed this agreement, and after I had signed the other, which was in Magarigle's possession—Broughton said I had put him to great inconvenience; he had lost his time, and it was some expense coming up and down by the train, and that he had provided a respectable tradesman to sign with him, and he was prepared to sign then—Magarigle said I was putting him to inconvenience as well, because he thought Mr. Broughton's place would exactly suit me, and he had turned two others off—I offered to go and find one or both of those parties for them, but they said they did not consider that would be business-like, after they were once turned off that they should be sent after again—Broughton then left, saying to Magarigle, "Never mind, I will see about it in a different way"—I took that at the time as a threat to take legal proceedings against me, because I had signed the other paper—when he had gone out I asked Magarigle what Broughton meant, and he did not appear to know, but brought up the other paper that I had signed before, and said, "Here is your own signature"—I said when I signed that paper he told me it was merely a formal affair, to enable him to draw the agreement out, and asked him what I had better do—he said he had been telling me several times what I ought to do, trying to get me out of the scrape, that I should enter into the engagement with Mr. Broughton for a month, and at the end of any week I could give notice to go; he could provide Mr. Broughton with another man to succeed me, that man should have 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposited, and if I failed in getting my 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Broughton, I should have that 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I should be doubly righted—I then signed the agreement; it was altered from twelve months to one month by Magarigle, at his office, in the presence of Broughton and myself—Keighley was not there then; he came in afterwards—I wanted Magarigle to sign it as a witness—he did not appear to like that much; however he did afterwards—when Keighley came in, Broughton said to him, "This is considerably altered"—he looked over it and said, "Yes, I observe it is"—Broughton said, "Will you sign it?"—Keighley asked whether he should get into trouble about it, or something like that—Broughton said, "No," and then Keighley wrote his name at the back, and this, "In the event of Mr. Broughton not fulfilling this agreement, I undertake to do so. E. H. Keighley"—that is Keighley's writing—I afterwards paid Magarigle 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was a cheque drawn by Lord Fortescue—I proposed to take it to Coutts's bank to have it changed, but Magarigle said as he paid his bankers for cashing his cheques it would save trouble, and he would undertake it, and Broughton agreed that that should be done—"This agreement is a receipt for the money," is written on the agreement—on 1st December I went down to Sydenham for the purpose of fulfilling my engagement—I took lodgings there at a beerhouse, just at the corner of Paxton-park—I remained down there eleven weeks—I did not see any office there; Broughton lived in a house—I saw him from time to time, and went to his house, and he some<lb/>times called upon me at my lodgings—I was employed to take down the names and addresses of the inhabitants of Penge, Lower Norwood, and Upper Norwood—he said he was going to publish a directory of that district—I wished to leave as I did not like the work, and I asked Magarigle on several occasions to find a substitute for me—I gave Broughton the due no<lb/>tice, a month's notice, I believe the first Saturday after I went there—no sub<lb/>stitute was found—I did not get any salary while I was there—I was expecting to leave at the month's end—I did not ask for any salary—I had several interviews with Magarigle, and he told me that as I had not paid my commission for getting the situation, he had not exerted himself in getting a substitute—I had written to him previous to that, and said that if he had told me I would have paid it at once—I had not got the money with me at the time, but I called the following morning and paid him a guinea—before that I received this account for one guinea in this letter, asking me to forward the amount of the enclosed account—I got no receipt for that guinea, some other part; was in the office at the time—Magarigle then said he would exert himself to find a substitute; no substitute was found—I told them I was very anxious to get away, as I wanted to go into service again, and that was the time of the year gentlemen's service was to be obtained—I said I was doing no good to myself down at Sydenham—I never got my 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, back—I left in February—I was there eleven weeks and three or four days—I stopped till the Saturday—I did not ask for the money exactly—I understood that Magarigle was to find this substitute to go on with Broughton's work, and I asked several times if he was forthcoming—on the last occasion when I called upon Magarigle, he put his hand upon my shoulder, threatened to turn me out of his house, and forbade me to come again—that was because I annoyed him about this substitute—he said he had never been annoyed so much in his life by anybody—that was the last occasion I was there—(<hi rend="italic">The agreement was read, dated 28th November, and was between William Broughton of Paxton Park, and Colin McVean, who was to have </hi>78<hi rend="italic">l. a year, payable monthly, and to give one month's notice if he wished to terminate the engagement It contained a receipt for the money paid, and a guarantee signed by Broughton and witnessed by Magarigle and Keighley</hi>)—I got 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Broughton after I left; that is all I received.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 23, St. Mark's-crescent, Clarendon-road—at the end of January, or beginning of February last, in consequence of seeing an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph,</hi> I went to Magarigle's office in Farringdon-road, Snow-hill—I saw him, and asked what the busi<lb/>ness was—he said to establish a local paper; that he was acquainted with, a gentleman at Sydenham of the name of Broughton, a person of very great influence, who was well known to all the gentry and clergy in the district, and he thought there was a great prospect of its success—he said that Mr. Broughton had brought out a directory—I said I did not think the prospects of a local paper were very good alone—he said it was not to establish the paper alone, but also to establish a house and land agency business—I was to pay 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down, and to receive 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month, 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I entered into a written agreement after I had seen Broughton—I saw him first at Magarigle's office—I asked him the nature of the business; he said he thought it would be a very good thing, but the business part of the arrangements he could not speak to me about, that was Magarigle's affair—this is the agreement that was entered into between us, dated 11th Febru<lb/>ary. 1864—it was drawn up partly by my solicitor, Mr. Jackson, of Lincoln's-inn-fields, from instructions given to me in the first instance—I paid 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on deposit before the agreement was entered into, and after it was signed I paid Magarigle 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Broughton's presence—security was mentioned beforehand; I wanted to know what security I should have for the money—Magarigle said, "Well, that is rather a difficult matter; I can't offer you consols, or anything of that sort; if I produce two first-class tradesmen, you will be satisfied with that?"—I said, "Yes, I should be satisfied"—he agreed to provide one security and Broughton was to provide the other—Magarigle introduced me to Mr. Cox—I went with him somewhere to the other side of Blackfriars-bridge, to Cox's barge-yard, I think, in Wharf-road—when I had got Cox's signature, I said, "It remains now for Mr. Brough<lb/>ton to get his security," and when I called at the office Magarigle said that Broughton's security had been and signed the bill—when they gave me the bill there was Mr. Keighleys name on it—I cannot remember that Magarigle said who Keighley was: I never saw him till he was in Court the other day—after signing the agreement, and paying the money, I went to the office in Farringdon-road for two or three days and Magarigle told me I had better go round to the different house-agents, and ascertain what property was to be let about Sydenham and that neighbourhood—I had my salary paid regularly every month—I went on 11th February, and left about a month before this case came before the Court—I had three payments of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I have not received any portion of the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. except that—I left in cones<lb/>quence</p>

               <p>said that money was required in most of them, or all, I cannot say which—I asked then what the money was for; I cannot recollect the words exactly; I understood that you wanted my money as cash security, and what was to be done with it was to be left to the discretion of Mr. Broughton—Brough<lb/>ton's name was not mentioned the first time I saw you—you showed me some of the situations, and explained that money was wanted for cash secu<lb/>rity—I said I had no money then, and I came again about a month after—you read me a lot of businesses out of a book—I said that I wanted some thing in Liverpool—for private reasons I did not want anything near Ports-' month or London; I said I wanted to get clear away from London, and you proposed to send me to Glasgow—after reading a number in the book, you came to Mr. Broughton's affair; it was not read out first, or from the book—I can't remember whether you advised me to go down and see him—I would not swear whether I went down or not—from your description of the business, I thought it was just what I wanted—my first distinct recol<lb/>lection of Broughton was going down with yourself from the London Bridge station, and I then went down with my intended wife—I was not married then—I recollect having a trip into the country well—I told you I did not like the little place Broughton had taken at Sydenham—when we were all to<lb/>gether at your office, you said, "Now, gentlemen, as you have agreed on the terms, I must ask you for a deposit"—I had no money then to spare—you said you asked me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to close the bargain, as there were several others after the situation; that was just a week, I think, before I paid the deposit—when the agreement was made, I brought my wife to the office, and it was written in her presence—I said to Broughton, "How about security?" and you said you would be responsible for it, or something to that effect—you never asked me what you were to have if you became security; you asked Broughton—I don't recollect his saying that whatever was fair between man and man you should have—you did become security; you were to have a certain consideration; it is so mentioned in the agreement in black and white; the agreement was read over, and I signed it—I was satisfied with you as security, I thought you had money—you said that you bad 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the <hi rend="italic">Sydenham Chronicle,</hi> and you wanted me to establish a paper there in connexion with you, and to establish an agency business there; I declined that kind offer, because you wanted 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. instead of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.'—after I paid the money, and before I saw you, I told Broughton I was dissatisfied with the way matters were going on—on the Sunday that you came to my house, I called you a swindler, and complained to you in very strong language—you telegraphed to me on the Saturday, that you were very busy, and could not come down—I happened to pass your office on the same day, and you were leaning out of the window, very busy; there was another there with you—when you and Broughton came to my house on the Sunday evening, you said, "People have teen talking," and I said, "The fact is, Mr. Magarigle, I have been told I am swindled out of my money"—I had been told that—I called you a swindler directly after that, and you jumped up and Said, "Oh, I am used to those sort of things, I often kick a man down my stairs"—you said your position and business left you open to a good deal of animadversion; an agent is always open to that—you were summoned to appear at Guildhall; it was on that occasion that I told you what Broughton had said, that he had never received a penny of the money, and you called him a liar and an old fool—I came up the stairs to your office with him, and tackled the pair of you together—you asked Broughton what he meant by saying that, and then took him into your private room, and had a conversation with him—I told</p>

               <p>you then I was going to Mr. Lewis—I was in a great passion, and I rushed down the stairs over to Mr. Lewis's office, and went with Mr. George Lewis to take out a summons—I recollect your saying that you thought I had no reason to complain, as no salary was due to me, and that Mr. Broughton had been of great service to me—I don't know that an office was taken for meat Deptford, I was never asked to go to Deptford till you were in Newgate—I don't know who it was for, except for some other poor victim—I wish I had seen Stubbs's people a little bit sooner—I have been bankrupt since this affair—I attribute it mostly to this transaction with you—I say two months' salary is due to me; my not receiving that was not the cause of my bank<lb/>ruptcy—I have not been pressed by my friends for this 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was not provoked by my bankruptcy to take proceedings against you.</p>

I live in Hoy-street, Plaistow—on 29th June, about half-past 11 at night, my landlord sent for me, and I found my box broken open—I missed a coat, a pair of boots, a cap, and a handkerchief, which I had seen safe at 20 minutes past 10—I went into the backyard, and, while I was talking to the policeman, I saw the prisoner come into the backyard—I asked him if he had been breaking my box open—he said that he knew nothing about it—I gave him in charge—I found in, my box this piece of a knife blade (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which was not there before—the lid of the box was very much cut—I went with another constable to the yard of another house, and found my coat and boots—the walls are only three or four feet high, and a person could get over.</p>

I keep the Timber Hoy inn, Deptford-creek-road—between 10 and 11 on Friday night, 10th June, I saw the prisoners—Lock came into my house, and asked for a glass of stout, which was two pence—he tendered a counterfeit shilling, I gave him change—I did not like the look of the shilling when I took it, but I was busy at the time, and I laid it on one side; when he had gone I looked at it again, and found it was a bad one—I put it in my pocket, and followed him; I saw him going up the right-hand side of the road, and when he got a little way up he made a noise with his mouth, and Johnson, the other prisoner, came across the road from a female to him. I then followed close after them, and they went into Mr. Mashin's house together, I went in; they had just called just called for half-a-quartern of gin, and Mr. Mashin was looking at a shilling which they had tendered for it, and talking to them about it—when I came in he sent for the police, and the prisoners were given in charge—I gave the shilling Lock had given me to the constable, Belcher, before I left Mr. Mashin's.</p>

I am the wife of Mr. Roberts, of King's Head-yard—we live in the same house with George Knight and his father—on a Satur<lb/>day morning, early in last month, the prisoner came to the house at twenty minutes or half-past 8, while my husband and I were sitting at breakfast—he entered the room, and exclaimed, "Is Mr. Knight within?"I said, "No, sir, he is not, he has gone out" He said, "I mean Mr. Knight" I said, "Do you mean young Mr. Knight?"that called my attention to him, and I saw that it was Mr. Hubbard, who George had formerly lived with. I denied his being at home—he said, "His younger brother has just told me that he is at home". I said, "Wait a minute, I will go and see if he is in bed" I went up, and saw George Knight lying in bed—the prisoner followed me, and exclaimed, "Is that him?"I said, "I do not know, I</p>

               <p>think it is" He rushed in, seized the bedclothes, took a pistol from his side, held it up, and said, "Now I am going to be hung". I said, "Ob George, pray for your soul! Pray don't!"The prisoner instantly put the pistol in a slanting direction, pulled the trigger, and fired it—George Knight's face was partly naked, and partly covered over with the clothes—the pistol was pointed at his head I anticipate—I do not think the muzzle of the pistol was more than the length of a person's hand from his head—I left the room immediately, threw the window open, and gave the alarm of "murder"—I saw blood from the left side of Knight's head, both before and after I left the room—I found two bullets in the pillow, one in the floor, and eight shots when I cleaned the room.</p>

Q.</hi> How late were you up that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Till nearly 12 o'clock—I got up at about ten minutes past 8—there is a clock at the further end of the passage—I denied George being at home, because I knew nothing of his having come in—there is no street door; there is a large gate, and we live over the stable—there is a private door certainly, but there is our private door, which is kept closed and fastened, but whether the other is, I cannot say.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, M</hi> 220). On 4th June I was called at half-past 8 in the morning, and the prisoner was given into my custody—the prosecutor was lying in bed bleeding from the left ear—the prisoner gave me this pistol (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it has a rifled barrel. I told him the charge as the prosecutor lay in bed, and he said, "George, if you survive this, I will serve you the same again". I found this slug in the pillow, and some small shot; the sheet and the bed and bedclothes were riddled by the shot; I also found a mark in the pillow where the slug had been—I found on the prisoner three bullets, some powder, two percussion caps, and a small piece of iron, supposed to be used as a ramrod—the bullets found on him will go into the pistol very easily, but the one found by Mrs. Roberts will not—this piece of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was undone by the magistrate—I have compared it with a piece shown me by Mrs. Roberts, and they correspond.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of 3, Trinity-square—on 4th June, I was called to the King's Head, and found George Knight standing in the room partly dressed and bleeding from the left ear; there were three distinct wounds, one in the cartilage which was very slight, two appeared to be made with small shot, and one with a larger missile, it was an abrasure of a a quarter of an inch in extent; the others were clear cuts, and did not go through the ear—the marks were such as might be caused by shot discharged from a pistol—if any of them had penetrated the skull, I should say they must have proved fatal.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 2, Plough-court, Rother<lb/>hithe—the deceased Alexander Hanghey, was my nephew; he would have been seventeen next September—he was very tall for his age, between five and six feet; his corpse was the full length—on Tuesday evening, 3d May, I called him out of my back kitchen, and asked him to mind the shop while I conversed with a lady in my back parlour—he left the shop for three minutes, and when he returned he was in a fainting condition, and two little girls came and told me something—I examined him, and he was in a frightful condition; the blood spirted out like a fountain from his thigh; he lost two quarts of blood, and never stood up again—he died on 16th May—he never had a day's ill health before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Dr. Tregene, and am a student at St. Thomas's Hospital—on 3d May I was called to the last wit<lb/>ness's house, and found the boy Alexander Hanghey in a very low condition from loss of blood, and suffering from a punctured wound in his right thigh, about three inches above the knee—I should think nothing but a knife would do it—there was a cut in his trouser? Corresponding with the wound</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186407110089"/>
               <p>—it was a dangerous wound from the loss of blood—I found on the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination that the wound was an inch or an inch and a half deep—he lost a very large quantity of blood.</p>
