I also produce two captions applicable to them; the Oyer and Terminer, and the General Gaol Delivery; they are applicable to the whole of the indictments, and are filed with them—that is the usual practice—it appears that the indictment was found on 14th May—die names of the Com<lb/>missioners are set out—Mr. Russell Gurney is among them—all the Alder<lb/>men are in the Commission—there is a minute in our book, made at the time, of a plea of "Not guilty," and alto upon the indictment, "Surrenders! and puts himself"—Day was on bail—that is the usual note made upon the indictment when a party pleads "Not guilty"—on the face of it, it is "sur<lb/>renders and puts."</p>

Roberts.'</hi> Did you, in consequence of that letter, go anywhere at five o'clock?—Yes. Where?—By the Ben Jonson, at Stepney. What was the date?—The 31st of March. Was that the day you got this letter?—Yes. When you got there did you see Richard Roberts?—No. Did you see the prisoner while you were waiting?—Yes. Did he say anything?—Yes, he asked me if my name was not Harriet Newman, I said, 'Yes;' he asked me if I was not waiting there for Richard Roberts, I told him, 'Yes;' he told me if I came with him he would take me to Richard Roberts; I asked him what was the reason Richard Roberts did not come himself; be told me he was ashamed to come himself; I told him that he might well be ashamed to come himself; I followed him down by the <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi> Jonson, and there he stopped. Yes?—He beckoned a <hi rend="italic">cab<lb/>man</hi> from the stand, took hold of my arm, and told me I must go with him;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185112150003"/>
               <p>the cabman came up and took hold of my arm. Did Day take hold of your arm?—Yes, and the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi>, too. Did you object to that?—Yes, I screamed, and told him I would not go with him. Well?—Three men and one woman came up and asked the young man what they were going to do with me; he said it was nothing to do with them, I was his wife. Did they get you into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—Yes. Who?—Day and the cabman. What happened then, did the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stop, or drive on?—It drove on very fast. What became of Day?—He was in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with me, and the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man was on his seat. After you had been in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> a little time, did Day do anything to you?—He held my hands while he put a handkerchief over my mouth. What hap<lb/>pened after that?—I do not remember anything more till I found myself on a sofa in a large house. Do you know where that house is?—No. Have you been able to find it?—No. When you came to your senses, did you see anybody? Yes, I saw a young woman sitting opposite. Do not tell us what she said, did she give you anything?—She asked me if I was any better; I said I did not know I was ill. Did she give you anything?—No. Did she afterwards?—An old lady came and gave me a glass of something; the young woman asked me if I knew where I was, I told her, 'No.' Did the young woman herself give you anything?—She gave me a knife. And at the time she made a communication to you?—Yes. After that, did you see an elderly woman?—Yes. What did that woman say to you?—She told me I must stop there all night; when she first came into the room, she came into the room with a glass in her hand, and she told me I must drink that, and then I should be better. Did you take any of it?—Yes. What was the effect; what happened to you?—I did not feel the effect of it directly. How soon?—Directly I drank it I made an attempt to come out, but the old woman stopped me. What else?—I held up the knife to defend myself. After you were stopped, what happened to you?—There were three gen<lb/>tlemen came running down-stairs when the old woman made a noise. Had you got the knife in your hand?—Yes, I was then in the hail. Did one of those men speak to you?—Two of them came up and spoke to me. What did they say?—They forced roe back again into the room. What did they say?—In the struggle I cut one of them over the hand with the knife. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COMMISSIONER GURNKY</hi>.

Did you get into the room again?—Yes, and the knife fell from my hand, and the old woman put me on the sofa again, and said I should not leave the house. What else happened?—They tried many times to get me up-stairs. Did you continue to resist?—Yes. Do you recollect a watch and chain?—Yes. What happened?—One of the gentlemen put it round my neck. What did you do with it?—I threw it on the ground. Did you, after that, see Day again? Yes. In which room?—(<hi rend="italic">inaudible</hi>). How came he into the room?—One of the gentlemen called him. Do you recollect how he called him?—No, I do not know. Did either <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the gentle<lb/>men order Day to do anything?—To go and bring a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>. In what condition were you as to your senses?—My senses seemed very much stupified. Were you in a condition to distinguish the features of anybody?—Yes. Were you in a condition <hi rend="italic">to</hi> distinguish the features of Day?—Yes. Did you go to the door?—No, Day came into the room and said if I was quiet he would take me to my father; I then left the house, and went into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> along with Day. Did Day say anything to you while you were in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>?—I asked him the reason why he took me there; he said it was only for a <hi rend="italic">spree</hi> with his <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi>. Did he say anything more?—Not till he got me into a very dark street, and the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was stopped, and Day got out and told me he would</p>

               <p>walk the rest of the way home with me; the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> drove off; he walked a small distance?—Yes, and put a direction in my hand, and told me I must find my way home the best way I could. Yes?—He then left me. Well, what became of you?—I found the use of my limbs all leaving me, and I sat myself on the step of a door. Up to this time had you any notion what the time of the night was?—No. In what condition did you become afterwards?—I know nothing till I found myself in the hospital. In the house, just recollect what was said by either the men or the women?—The young woman told me, if I was a respectable woman she would advise me to go out of the house. What did the old woman tell you?—I must make myself happy there for the night, for f should be made a lady of. Did any of the men ask you to do anything?—Yes. Anything you felt improper to be done?—Yes. Where did you find yourself next morning?—In the hospital. When did you see the person you say drove you in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> again?—At a beer-shop, in Holywell-lane, on a Saturday night, the Saturday following. Where there a number of persons there?—Yes. Did you point him out as the person who had taken you in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>?—Yes. Did you give a description of the clothes which he wore?—Yes, corduroy-trowsers, and a black coat, and a black neck-handkerchief. Was he dressed in the same way when you saw him before the Magistrate?—No. The night you saw him in the beer-shop, was be dressed the same way?—No.</p>

Did you throw tumblers at them?—Yes. And then they found it was no use, and they called Day to bring back the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>?—Yes. Now the letter you received, was it in the handwriting of Roberts?—No. Whose handwriting was it?—I do not know. Come, you know what has taken place; whose handwriting is it?—I do not know. Do you know Mrs. Woodfield?—Yes. How long?—A long time. Nearly all your life?—No, not so long as that. A good many years? I have not been at home long to know her. Now, tell me who wrote that letter?—I don't know, no more than baring it come to the house. Who wrote the letter?—I do not know.

Was that when she went to get money?—I do not know what she went for. Did you ever live with your aunt?—Yes. Where?—At Brentford. How came you to leave her?—Through a fall out. What was the fall out about?—Because I fetched beef-steaks instead of mutton<lb/>chops. Do you mean to say that on your oath?—Yes. On your oath did not your aunt accuse you of stealing?—No. Be careful; did not your aunt send you away because you had robbed her?—No, sir, she did not. Do you ever go to see her now?—Yes. When?—I dare say it is about three months ago since I have seen her. How long is it since you lived with her?—A twelvemonth. Did you ever stay out three nights from home?—Never; I staid out one night, at my grandmother's. Did you ever attempt to drown yourself?—No, sir, I did not.

What did you go to your aunt's for about three months ago?—To see her. How long did you stay, a minute?—No, sir, I staid all day. Do you mean to say you have ever been allowed to go to your aunt's house since the time you left, having lived five years with her?—Yes. Was your aunt at home?—Yes, Now, did you say to Mrs. Woodfield, 'Don't <hi rend="italic">split</hi>, for God's sake, for I shall be a ruined young woman? '—I did not. Did Mrs. Woodfield ever write any letters for you?—No. Upon your oath, has not she several times written letters for you at vow request?—Never; I never spoke to the woman till she came to my father's house; all that I knew her by was telling fortunes. Did you call on Mrs. Woodfield and ask her to write some letters, one addressed to you, and another addressed to your father?—I did not. Did she ask you why yon wanted those letters written?—No. And did you answer, 'It is only a lark, Mrs. Woodfield, with Richard Roberts and a lot of us? '—No. And did you say, 'You must write it in a man's hand, for my young man's hand will be known, and spoil our <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>? '—No. And did she not write the letters, and did not you take them for the purpose of putting them into the post?—No. Did not a person open the door to you, and did not you say, I want to see Mrs. Woodfield, I want a letter written? '—No. Did Mrs. Woodfield come to you before the last examination of the prisoner and entreat you not to go up and appear?—No, sir, it was after the first examination; she said she had beard the case in the paper, and that father would want a little of her assistance; she came to father's house; mother told her she knew nothing about it; she said she could give him a <hi rend="italic">lift</hi>, one which would take him across the <hi rend="italic">herring-pond</hi>; mother said she knew nothing about it, it was in the solicitor's hands; and she told me she did not mind taking a false oath for any one for a shilling. Was not one letter written in blue ink, by Mrs. Woodfield, for you?—No. I ask you once more, did not you say to her, 'Don't <hi rend="italic">split</hi>, for God's sake, for I shall be a ruined young woman,' and did not she say, 'You don't mind ruining the young man? '—No, there was no such conversation between us; she wanted me to go to her house and have my planets told, and then I could find out the writing. <hi rend="italic">Re-examined by</hi>

How came you to go with her to Day's house?—By her persuasion; she asked me to go and take a walk with her, I said, 'No;' she said she wanted to see Mrs. Ellen, and I went, and then she asked me to show her the house. Was that all that passed between you?—She told me, going along, that she would help me over it, and she would give him a <hi rend="italic">lift</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am a nurse at the Free Hospital, Gray's-inn-lane. I recollect, on the morning of 1st April, Harriet Newman being brought in—she was in a perfect state of stupor, and perfectly helpless—her limbs were perfectly useless—her gown was torn out of the gathers—I afterwards saw the gown at the trial; it was then torn—she was brought to me at 2 o'clock in the morning—Mr. Tindal Robson, the house-surgeon, was not called at the time; he was then very ill in bed—she recovered so as to be able to speak within an hour after she came in—I went to Mr. Robson, and he gave me orders what to do—I believe he is now in Wales—I do not know how long he has been there, but he has left the hospital three or four months—she gradually rallied and became more rational from the time she came in op to about 10 next morning—she was a great deal more rational then than when she came in, and that increased;. she became more conscious—I did not con<lb/>sider her rational an hour after she was brought in, although she could speak; she only asked for something to drink—it was not until 10 that she had any conversation with me—she then made a statement to the house-surgeon, Mr. Robson, in my presence—that was the first time she made any statement that was gf any particular notice, nothing—that I could make anything of—I was not before the Magistrate on the examination of William Day.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> She was brought into the hospital at 2 o'clock in the morning, was she? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; quite in a state of stupor—I consulted with the surgeon, and described her symptoms—he ordered me to undress her and put her to bed, and put a bottle of hot water to her feet, nothing else—he did not see her himself till 10 next morning—she gradually rallied up to that time—I went to his bedroom to let him know how she was every hour.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any smell of liquor, or of a drug of any kind, about her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was a peculiar smell, but it was not the smell of spirituous liquors—I have no idea what it was the smell of; it was nothing like chloroform, I think—I have no reason to say that it was—chloroform was mentioned when she made her statement to the house-surgeon at 10 o'clock—she did not men<lb/>tion chloroform before that—she made some rambling statement before that, but nothing, as I said before, that I could make any sense out of till she said it to</p>

               <p>the surgeon—she said something about a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>; that was between the hours of 2 and 10—I cannot say exactly at what part of the time—no one was present with her but myself that I remember—she remained in the hospital five days—she was gradually recovering from the stupor—between 10 and 11 next day the house-surgeon gave her an emetic, and she was very sick—she com<lb/>plained of headache—she complained of headache before the emetic was given—the smell was something like peppermint—it was a peculiar smell, but I really could not take upon myself to say what smell it was—I have frequently seen chloroform administered—the length of time in which it takes effect is according to the strength it is given, according to what the patient will bear; sometimes the effects will last till the next day—it is sometimes necessary to repeat the application to continue the stupor if the patient does not take it well at first; if the patient does take it well, it will last, I should say, about half an hour, or an hour, or not quite so long—the stupor does not come on immediately on the application, sometimes in five minutes, sometimes in ten minutes; some will take it much quicker than others—I never saw an in<lb/>stance where chloroform was administered, and stupor came on in an hour or two afterwards—I have been in the hospital very nearly two years—she was in every appearance as a person would be were they in a state of intoxication, perfectly helpless and perfectly senseless—as I said before, she gradually recovered; and when she gradually recovered she complained of a severe headache—that is not an uncommon consequence, either with chloroform or drink—chloroform will leave the same effect, a sickness and headache-vomiting very frequently follows upon chloroform—she did not vomit until after she had had an emetic, but complained of great sickness—chloroform generally produces sickness without an emetic—there are medical drugs that would produce stupor; an overdose of laudanum would do so.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there still that peculiar smell you have talked of that you could not say what it was, but something like peppermint? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was; but I could not say what it was, nor I believe could the house-surgeon either, and he strictly examined it—I kept it until he came—I do not re<lb/>member what remark he made upon it—I think he said she might have been drinking; there was nothing in it, but she might have been drinking—it was something to that effect, I cannot tell the exact words—it was said in her presence—I am not able to give an opinion as to how long the smell of a drug would be perceptible in the contents of the stomach.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a money lender; I occasionally reside in St. Martin's-lane. In Oct. last, application was made to me for a loan, to be advanced to James Gillard, and I in consequence called on the prisoner on 28th Oct., at 17, Winchester-place, Pentonville—I inquired at the door for Mr. Ion, and was shown to the prisoner—I asked him if he was the landlord</p>

               <p>of the house; if he rated the house—he told me he had been landlord of the house upwards of two years—I asked him to produce his rent and taxes receipts, which he did—this paper is one of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I acquainted him with my business, that his name had been put on a promissory-note to become security for one Mr. Gillard—he said he was quite agreeable—appli<lb/>cation had been made for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but not liking the other party who was put on the bill, we accepted the prisoner's responsibility for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many deposits had you received? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You cannot tell that way; I commenced with 3,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., when I first opened betting, and left with about as many farthings; but I had money deposited with me for other persons, about 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say you paid that out of the money deposited with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Having lost all my own; on the race previous, I lost 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Am I to understand you paid your own debts out of the money deposited with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A portion of the money was deposited with me, of the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I have paid 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the rest was made up of my own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COOPER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How is the deposit made? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By calling and taking a ticket, and paying their money, those who deposited 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. did get something, those who deposited 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I gave 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., those who deposited 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I gave 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., those who deposited 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I gave eighty—that was not on the principle of first come first served, it was on no principle at all; I should have thought that subject was quite worn out, it is quite threadbare in the Courts—I charge five per cent interest for twelve months for all money—before I started this, I was a journeyman shoemaker—I had something like 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. left me by my mother.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COCKLE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said there were some other receipts produced for rent, did the prisoner say anything about them at the time he produced them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he said he was quite ashamed that Mr. Gillard had mixed up his name with a disreputable fellow like this in Westminster, who had no receipts to show—Mr. Ryan, my clerk was with me, nothing was said about payment of the rent, or arrears of rent—it was at the last Chester Cup that I lost the money, on 29th April, or 1st May, 1851—I have replaced the whole of the 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I am speaking with regard to the tickets, on which people would have claims—they would produce a ticket to receive the amount I advertised to</p>

               <p>give—they are nearly all in—I did keep a betting list at that time—what I mean is, it took me nearly 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to replace the 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we have only lent 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that is on the responsibility of the prisoner—we did not accept the other person, but took the prisoner as security for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when there are two securities, it is joint and several surety ship.</p>

I remember the loan to Mr. Gillard, and remember seeing the prisoner on the subject, in Mr. Dwyer's presence, when we went; on 28th, to 17, Winchester-place, Pen<lb/>tonville, Mr. Dwyer asked the prisoner if he was the landlord or householder of that house, he said he was—he asked how long ho had been so, and I think he said something about two years—he then asked if he had receipts</p>

               <p>for his rent—he said, "Yes"—he asked him to show them to him, and he produced several pieces of paper purporting to be receipts for his rent—he also showed Rome receipts for rates—I was near enough to see some of them—I think the one produced is one of them.</p>

Jackson, the carrier, brought me a parcel, which I opened—it contained some boots, a cap, and some mutton, which weighed 1 3/4 lb., some soap, and two onions—I believe they were all mine—I did not see the mutton cut off my meat, but I am as convinced as I am here that they were mine—the parcel was taken from my house, but I did not see it taken.</p>

               <p>some mutton, two onions, and some soap—I accompanied Mr. Cole to his house with the parcel, and placed it behind the sofa—I saw the prisoner after<lb/>wards—I asked her if she had taken a parcel to Mr. Jackson's, the carrier's, that morning—she said she had—I asked her what it contained—she said an apron and a pair of boots—I asked her if there was anything else in it—she said there was a nap and a letter, and she did not think there was any<lb/>thing else—I told her to recollect herself, and asked her if there was any meat or eatables in it—she said, "Yes, some mutton"—I asked her how she came by it; and, after a short time, she said she bought it at Mr. Wade's, the butcher's—I asked her what she gave for it—she said, "10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I spoke to her about the soap—she said she took that from Cole—she said since she had been in Mr. Cole's service she had bought a number of things, and she did not know that she was doing any harm in taking the soap and mutton—she acknowledged that that was the parcel she had taken to the carrier's, and said she was going to send the things to her sister.</p>

On 28th Nov., I examined the lead on the wharf after looking at the book—I missed three pigs and a half, or about that quantity—I afterwards saw that lead—it was shown to me by the inspector—I can swear that they were what was missing from the wharf—the half pig was compared with another half pig—I know nothing more of the prisoner than by seeing him on board the <hi rend="italic">Albion</hi> barge, which came to the wharf on 27th Nov. with a cargo of hops, in the afternoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I was master of the barge <hi rend="italic">Albion</hi>, from Maidstone. The prisoner came with me to the Red Lion and Three Cranes Wharf, on Thursday, 27th Nov.—the barge was discharged there—the crew consisted of Frederick Gill yard, my mate, and the prisoner was third man on board—after the barge had been discharged, we went away at 6 o'clock in the morning of 28th Nov.—we dropped down to Horselydown—the barge was at Horsely-down when the officer came on board—I know the locker and the bed cabin on board—the locker was used for timber, gear, chains, ropes, and blocks for the use of the barge—the prisoner had charge of the locker—I and the mate slept in the aft cabin—a maul was shown to me; that was generally kept in the iron locker—I did not know anything of the lead being on board—the prisoner had nothing to do with the discharge of the cargo; he was to clear away—Mr. Todd's men got the cargo out.</p>

I was going along Broad-street, Bloomsbury, and I saw a clock exposed for sale at a broker's shop—I found it was mine, the one I had lost—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I am quite certain of it—I have not seen the other things.</p>

I am a member of the firm of Crowder and Maynard, solicitors to the assignees of this bankruptcy—I know the defendant—he is the person who was a bankrupt—I see his handwriting—the declaration of bankruptcy is, I think, attested by his own solicitor, Mr. Kearsey; but I know his handwriting—the one that is here is a copy only, the original document is filed—I find his writing on these proceedings, on his last examination—I was present when he signed that—here is an affidavit of Mr. Keaney, verifying the copy—this is the original affidavit—this is the original examination signed by Boyd—I can swear to his handwriting to this original examination—no act has been done, to my knowledge, by the bankrupt, to annul the proceedings, certainly not—there has been none—he was in the United Kingdom at the time of the adjudication—this is the statement; it is signed by Boyd—it is a statement of sales, deposited or pawned, by Isaac Boyd, from 1st Jan., 1849, to June 26th, 1851—it is a part of the accounts</p>

               <p>given in on his passing his last examination—the last item is Fordarti's; at the end of the account—I produced an account of sales; one of the items in the account which he signs is "deposited or pawned"—I find here, under the head of "of whom bought," Allipson and Co. "when," March 27th; "number of pounds," 160; cost 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; "with whom pawned or deposited," Attenborough; "when," May 17th, 13th, and 24th; there are three dates, May 17th is on a line with what I am reading; "sum received" 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; then it says, "on hand" "with R.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185112150037"/>
               <p>did not record it in writing, but his attention having been since drawn to it, he desired that a memorandum should be made, which has been done long since the prosecution—it was made within the last two or three weeks, in consequence of his attention being called to the fact that there was no written direction; but in the first instance I received his direction verbally on the day the bankrupt passed his last examination, 2nd Oct.—I may mislead you; I will say further, it was brought to me by my clerk the other day to be approved of—I produce the bill of exchange for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that came from the assignee as part of the bankrupt's papers, therefore it was paid on 11th June—there is no statement on the proceedings of what was done with the money got from Drakenford's on 11th June.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you speak of pledging, you speak of that which is distinct from pledging at the pawnbroker's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think there are but two persons with whom pledges are made, Drakenford and Attenborough—I do not know that Attenborough cannot receive such sums under the Pawnbrokers' Act, or that they are matters of specific agreement between the parties—Drakenfords are not pawnbrokers, they are silk-dealers—Allipsons are my clients; nearly all the silk-merchants are—I do not know from Allipsons how much money they received during the time I have been speaking of, from the bankrupt—I do not know that 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been paid to Allipsons—I did not attend the examination before the Magistrate, my clerk did—the statement from which I have been reading, is from the accounts of the prisoner—the Act of Parliament on which this prosecution is instituted, passed in Aug. 1851; several of the items contained in the accounts are before the passing of the Act; the first pledge stated here is 14th June, 1849; as to which transaction it appears by the same accounts that the goods were redeemed from Attenborough's in Aug. 1849—my impression is, that Mr. Dodson was the broker for Fordarti in this transaction, through whom the sale was effected—supposing the assets in the balance-sheet to be realised, they would show 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—I was the bankrupt's solicitor in 1847, this statement was furnished voluntarily by him, there was no holding back of any sort, nor has there been throughout the whole transaction.</p>

                  </hi>. I am salesman, in the employ of Allipson and Co. I have been so sixteen years—Mr. Allepson's Christian name is Martin, there is only himself in the business; he is a silk-merchant, of 9, King's Arms-yard, Coleman-street—I know the defendant, he is a silk-manufacturer, and carried on business at 20, Spital-square—the business of a silk-manufacturer is to convert the silk into goods—on 27th March I sold the defendant 166lbs. 8 ozs. of Piedmont orgazin silk, at 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it came to 249<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the custom of the silk-trade, with reference to credit, is cash in fourteen days, or a bill at five months, it depends on circumstances—if the manufacturer pays cash in fourteen days, be has the privilege of the discount which is 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent, or he can pay the whole amount at five months; this was settled on those terms—he did not pay cash in fourteen days, but bills were given.</p>

               <p>left it, and went next morning, when he said he would take it at 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the usual terms—that is the way we generally deal; the salesman goes round and shows his samples, and the manufacturer gives his orders.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not on this occasion press him to take them, and mention an instance of a man named Vanut, who was buying silk of you, and getting a profit by the re-sale? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never said anything of the sort—I very likely told him that the markets were getting up; I cannot recollect whether I did or not, I may have done so—I dare say about 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has passed into the hands of Allipson and Co. from the defendant.</p>

I am not in any other employment, but act between the seller and the buyer—I am in the "habit of obtaining samples of the dealers, and go round to the manufacturers and obtain their orders—I take the sample with me; if the sample suits I then make a purchase of the merchant—I do not deliver the goods—I con<lb/>tract for the buying, and receive a percentage—on 7th June I went to the defendant's place of business, and showed him a sample of silk calculated for his trade, that of a manufacturer—I said to him, "This is French <hi rend="italic">orgazin</hi> "—I knew it was very well adapted to the purpose of being manufactured for a par<lb/>ticular article, which I knew he was making at that time, called <hi rend="italic">moire antique</hi>, a very rich article—we had a great deal of conversation about the quality of the silk, as it is absolutely necessary for the manufacture of the article.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Tell us what the whole of your conversation was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said, "I have got a sample of French orgazin that will answer your purpose in the manufacture of this article which I see by me," looking at what I saw in the shop—he examined it, as is customary, very minutely, thread by thread, and</p>

               <p>said, certainly, it was a very perfect, good article, and he should have no objection to buy it—the price was 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb. in the first instance, but he left me to do the best I could in purchasing it at the lowest price, and I went to Messrs. Fordarti and Co., the merchants, and got it for 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb.—the defendant desired me to purchase it at the best price I could—he said he meant to apply it to the purposes of his manufacture, the rich article, the <hi rend="italic">moire antique</hi>—the bale, was to be sent in on Monday, the 9th—I told Messrs. Fourdarty the kind of article he was making, and what he wanted it for, and on that I obtained the silk, and the bale was sent in—I saw it in his warehouse on the 10th—that was the last I had to do with it—I had applied for credit before, on account of Boyd, of Fordarti, and had purchased a bale for him of them about twelve months ago, similar to this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he refuse to take the silk over and over again? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he did object to take it two or three times—he said the price was excessively high—we had a great deal of conversation—I have knows him for thirty years, and always thought very highly of him, and considered he was one of the best manufacturers in Spitalfields for that particular article—he did not several times decline to take the goods, not in this particular instance, not this particular bale; he declined to take it at the price two or three times, but I succeeded in persuading him to take it.</p>

BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you say to him to induce him to take it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said, "I am quite certain this article will suit the purpose of your manufacture, and I know you stand high"—he said the article would suit him—he examined it very minutely, and found it a very good fabric and very good thread, and he ultimately said, "I shall leave it with you, Mr. Dodson, to make the purchase.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">contended that this was a question for the Jury; he urged that the false pretence need not originate with the Defendant, and might yet be such an active pretence as came within the Statute; the activity contemplated by the Statute was that of the mind, that a tradesman might obtain goods by false colour and pretence whilst sitting behind his desk, whilst a mere swindler would go to the shops of traders for that purpose; that it would have been the duty of the defendant to state that he was insolvent, and so place himself out of the supposition that he was trading honestly; but as he did not do so, he was acting under a false colour and pretence of carrying on business; and further, that if he obtained the silk, not intending to work it, but to pawn it, the colour and pretence would be false.

                  </hi>. I carry on business in partnership with Mr. Tatlock, as silk-men and brokers. On 15th April I had a transaction with the defendant on my own account—I went to him, and found him in his warehouse, in Spital-square—I said I had got a sample of foreign thrown tram for sale, and asked him if he was a purchaser—he said, "Yes"—I showed him a sample, and asked him 29<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound—he consented to take it at that price—there was 981bs. net, 99lbs. gross, which came to 142<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on 17th April I saw him again at his warehouse—exactly the same sort of conversation and dealing took place, and I sold him a parcel of 2391bs. of Italian <hi rend="italic">orgazin</hi>, at 29<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which came to 343<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at the usual credit, five months—I had a transaction with him on behalf of Mr. Fellows—I cannot tell you the date; I think it was 16th April; but I sold him the only parcel of silk Mr. Fellows sold him—it was 249lbs. and some odd ounces—I have not cast it out, nor the price—I sold it for a gentleman, and therefore we had not the price—I went to him as a broker, and showed him the sample—I went to him in all cases; he did not come to me—I cannot say what he said when I showed him the sample, but he consented to take the silk at the price I offered it at—when I left his warehouse I went to Mr. Fellows, and informed him I had sold his bales—our porter is here to prove the delivery, if it is required.</p>

               <p>the female was not there—we sat down, and eat some bread; and the prisoner said, "<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>, let us come and see if we can find Harriet;" and we went to her mistress's, where she used to work at slopwork—she was not there, and the prisoner said, "Let us come to the Duke of York, in Brick-lane"—we went there, and found her sitting in the tap-room, with three other women and two men, drinking—she was rather tipsy, and the prisoner asked her if she would come out a minute, he wanted to speak to her—after asking her two or three times, she said, "I shall not come till I have eaten my pie"—about ten minutes after she had eaten her pie, Matthews again asked her to come out—she came out, and they went outside the door, and the prisoner asked her would she come home and go to bed—she said, "No; I will go in and bid them good-bye first"—she went in, and sat down, and poured out a glass of gin and drank it, and likewise handed the prisoner one, and he drank it, and sat down on the corner of the table, smoking—about ten minutes after they had come in there was a bit of a quarrel between the prose<lb/>cutrix and another female, and the prosecutrix pulled off her bonnet and shawl, and began fighting—the prisoner was then standing at the fire, at my side—they left off fighting, and the prosecutrix sat down with the other female, about three yards off Matthews—Matthews walked up to the prosecu<lb/>trix, put his hand into his right coat-pocket, pulled out this white-handled knife, and drew it along the prosecutrix's throat, just under the left chin—the prosecutrix sat on the form, bleeding, and then she was laid on the floor, and she kept crying out, "Mother, mother! <hi rend="italic">Jim, Jim</hi>!"—the prisoner came to me, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>, I have done it; go and get a policeman"—I said, "Done what?"—he said, "Cut her throat; go and get a policeman"—I know the knife; I have been in the habit of seeing it for five weeks or a month, while I have worked for the prisoner—it was generally kept on the table—I had seen the prisoner sharpening it that morning with a little file—he then tried it on a bit of wood, and said, "It will not cut now."</p>

                  </hi>. I am married, and live at 39, Middlegrove-street, Com<lb/>mercial-road. On Wednesday, 19th Nov., the female prisoner came and took a parlour on the ground-floor—I asked her how many she had in family, and she told me she had one baby at the breast. On Saturday, 22nd, she came and took possession of the room; she brought the baby with her—I did not see the male prisoner till the Sunday, and I there saw another little girl at the window—I first saw the deceased child on the Tuesday evening; I believe her name was Bridget—I heard the prisoners call her so—she appeared about a year and nine months old—the female prisoner came home intoxicated that evening—I followed her into the room, and saw the deceased in the room with her head in a basket, and her feet on the bed; she had nothing on but a dirty night-gown with short sleeves—I took the child up, went to the mother, and asked whose the child was—she did not answer me till the third time of asking, when she said it was her child, and she was the mother of three—the child seemed very languid through neglect and want, it appeared nothing but skin and bone; its little back was like feeling a piece of wood; it was very dirty, and looked as if it had not been washed for a full week—I asked her if she would allow me to take the children down-stairs and warm them—she said I might, and I took Mary Jane and Bridget down to the fire; there was but little fire in her room—I gave Mary Jane her tea, and gave Bridget some sop, which she ate ravenously—the male prisoner came home some little time after—I opened the door for him; I invited him down-stairs, and showed him the state the child was in, my husband told him it was starved, and I told him it would be a charity to take it to the workhouse—I asked him to go up and make his fire, and get his wife to bed, and take the children up-stairs—shortly after he went up-stairs, and I directly heard some quarrel<lb/>ling and screams of murder from the female—I went up; there was no light there, my husband carried one up—I asked the male prisoner if he had got any candle, he asked his wife if she had any candles—I do not think she made any answer, but I cannot be positive—the children were down-stairs at that time—he asked his wife for some money, and she gave him her purse; there was 61/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and two halfpence in it—I fetched a candle with a halfpenny, and then left them—I heard them quarrelling again several times—I took the child Bridget up-stairs, and gave it to the father, and the other child went up with me afterwards—shortly after, the mother left the room, and said she should not return that night—I begged her to stay at home with her husband and children—she refused to do so—she went out and took the baby, and I saw no more of her till next morning, when she came in from nine to ten o'clock—her husband went out shortly after her, I opened the door to him when he came back—he had a piece of paper in his hand, with apparently a piece of meat in it—I do not know what he did with it—I went to the room in the morning to inquire how she was, and asked her if she would quit the room as that day, and I would give her the week's rent, as I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185112150055"/>
               <p>was so annoyed by the nuisance—she turned round and looked at the chil<lb/>dren, and said she wished they were all dead, and she would not be with her husband one hour—I did not go into their room on the Thursday—the mother was out the <hi rend="italic">biggest</hi> part of the day on the Thursday, and I saw nothing of her; but in the evening I heard them jangling together as usual—on the Friday night I went and complained about the door being so con<lb/>stantly open, and said I hoped they would quit to-morrow—the woman said she would not quit that week; the man said I was not aware of the trouble they were in, and the female then told me that the two children were dead—I then went into the room, and saw the child Bridget dead, and laid out upon the table with a small chemise on—it had a black bruise from its hip down its leg—I asked what was the cause of it, and the father said it was a death-blow—the mother pointed to the little girl, and said, she was in hopes she should have buried that before the other one had died—she did not express particular regret at their deaths.</p>

               <p>or not I cannot say, but there were certainly not sufficient morbid appear<lb/>ances about the child to have accounted for death of themselves—I should say it had certainly not had any solid food for thirty-six hours before its death—I judge of that, from not finding any solid matter in the intestines; it would take that time to pass solid food through the system, unless there was any diarrhoea existing—I am ignorant whether there was diarrhoea or not—there was much less flesh upon the person than there ought to have been in a child of that age—I believe the water in the brain arose from a want of a proper quantity of blood, still the hooping-cough might have caused it, I cannot swear which it was—the child was labouring under dilatation of the air-cells, which shows that it was either then or had recently been labouring under hooping-cough—I did not hear it cough—it is clear it must have had hooping-cough for some little time—I have no doubt the whole appearances were caused by hooping-cough and want of food combined—I believe she died from those causes combined; want of food alone could not have caused the dilatation of the air-cells, or other appearances—the child was not suf<lb/>ficently emaciated to account for death from starvation alone—I should say the hooping-cough could not have gone off for a very long time, or the dilatation of the air-cells would have diminished; it must have been comparatively recent.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does hooping-cough prevent a child from having much appe<lb/>tite? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sometimes, but not generally; it is rather the reverse sometimes, because a child usually vomits its food with each attack of the cough, and therefore, as a rule, takes more food to make up for the quantity vomited—I do not think there would have been such a complete absence of food in the intestines if the child had had food given it, and had vomited it up again, and then been re-supplied with food—I think there must have been a greater or less absence of the administration of food after the vomiting, but not sufficient to kill by starvation alone—it would have been more emaciated if it had died of mere starvation.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shorthand writer. I was present in the Court of Exchequer on 24th and 25th Nov. during the trial of Boulton <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Healey—I took a shorthand note of the evidence which the witnesses gave on that occasion—I remember the prisoner Boulter being examined as a witness on that cause—I have my notes here (<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>): "<hi rend="smallCaps">THOMAS BOULTER</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEA</hi>. You are the plaintiff in this action, Mr. Boulter?—Yes, I am. And you carried on business in the month of June last, and have done so for many years at your house, No. 53, Albany-street, as a fruiterer and greengrocer, I believe?—Yes, Sir, I did. You are also one of the inspectors of weights and measures on your district?—Yes, I am. Now how long had you lived in that house, No. 53, Albany-street, pray, from twenty to twenty—on e years?—Yes, about that time in March last it was. When you first took that house, what rent did you pay?—80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, sir. And had you at that time some back premises which you have not had lately?—Yes, Sir, there were some back premises at that time. Was the rent altered to 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year when you gave up those back premises?—Yes, it was altered from 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year. How long was that since?—Six or seven years. Since that time, since six or seven years ago, your rent then has been 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?—Yes, that rent. How have you been in the habit of paying your rent?—Generally I sent it every quarter; my wife generally paid. Now we understand that a distress was put into your house in June, 1851, in June in the present year, for rent said to be due, amounting to 87<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.?—Yes, that was it. Now was there any rent at that time due?—Yes, there was one quarter due. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON PLATT</hi>. Was there rent amounting to 87<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. due at that time?—No, my Lord; there was only the rent for one quarter due at that time. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEA</hi>. Do you remember getting this receipt for rent to Christmas, 1850? look at it.—Yes, this is it; it was given in February last. Now did you receive that receipt from the defendant, or was it handed to your wife by him?—My wife paid that money to the defen<lb/>dant. Had you just before then given your wife 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay this quarter's rent?—Yes, I gave it her on that day. Whose handwriting is that receipt?—It is in the handwriting of the defendant, the whole of it. Do you remem<lb/>ber the words of the receipt? <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON PLATT</hi>. Mr. Pollock had better read it. The receipt was here read as follows: 5th Feb., 1851, Received of Mr. Thomas Boulter the sum of 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the amount of one quarter's rent for a house, No. 53, Albany-street, due at Christmas, 1850. George Healey.' <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON PLATT</hi>. Is it to Christmas last?—<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUMPHREY</hi>. No, to Christmas, 1850, and it may be explained the way in which it came to be so written. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEA</hi>. Now then, do you remember in the month of Aug. last year, 1850, having any application made to you by the defendant, by the defendant's son?—You are right, by the son. Where was that appli<lb/>cation made?—In my shop. What was it?—The son called and said that his father had a large sum to make up, and he asked me if I could pay a part of that quarter's rent in advance. When the son made that application to you in the month of Aug. last, what did you pay him?—10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON PLATT</hi>. For the rent pot then due, but for the quarter then running; is that what you mean?—Yes, my Lord; the rent was not due at that time. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEA</hi>. When the quarter's rent became due, what did you pay?—I sent 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the balance of 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and have a receipt for it. Is this the memorandum which Healey, jun., gave you when you gave him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?—Yes; this is the memorandum (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—'Memorandum. I have this day received of Mr. Thomas Boulter the sum of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in part payment of one quarter of a year's rent, for which I intend to give a stamped receipt on pay<lb/>ment</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185112150063"/>
               <p>of the balance, Henry Healey, for George Healey.' When the Michaelmas rent became due, was the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the balance, paid?—Yes; my wife took the money; Healey was not at home, and she left the money, and a few evenings afterwards he sent the receipt. Do you know what became of that receipt?—I do not; all the desks were turned out at the time of the distress, and I suppose I must have lost it when the brokers were there. Do you recollect the contents of that receipt?—I think so, very nearly. What were the contents?—It was this: 'Aug. 10th, 1850. Received of Mr. Thomas Boulter the sum of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in part payment of one quarter's rent to Michaelmas; 'and then it went on:' Nov. 4th, 1850. Received also the sum of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the balance of 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a quarter's rent due Michaelmas, 1850. George Healey.' Well, when that receipt came, did you see it, or did your wife take it?—No; I was in the parlour; my wife was gone to bed; she was confined. Was her brother there, Bushell?—No, Butcher. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON PLATT</hi>. Have you searched for that receipt?—Yes, my Lord, but we cannot find it anywhere. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEA</hi>. That receipt came to you in an envelope, did it not, can you find that envelope?—Yes, but we cannot find the envelope. Was this letter with it, did this letter come in the envelope?—I really think it did; I have seen it before, and it is in the handwriting of Healey. Now when the distress took place, did you find some papers strewed about the place that had been in the desk?—Yes; I believe I picked up that paper on the shop floor. Did you know enough of Healey to know what speculation he was in?—No, I never heard from him anything about it. Had Healey at any time prior to the distress being put in, or within three or four or six months of that time, ever made a claim upon you for arrears amounting to 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?—He has never asked me for rent this side of Christmas; I never paid the rent; my wife paid it. Now just before this distress was put in did Healey make any application to you for any arrears?—No, not for any at all. Did he ever claim or say a word about arrears when your wife paid the money?—He never hinted about it, nor did I have any letter. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON PLATT</hi>. He never applied for any arrears of rent, then?—I do not know that he ever asked for a quarter overdue; I do not recollect his calling for any arrears of rent. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEA</hi>. Not any?—No. Now about the time that the last quarter became due, had you seen Healey?—Yes; about four times, I should think, before the distress came in. Had you on any or all of these occasions any conversation with him about the payment of the money?—No, nothing of the kind. Had Healey obtained a tenant for the back premises after you gave them up?—When he took the back premises my tenant was in them, and he remained there for one or two years. Well, did Healey ever get a tenant afterwards?—No, he never did afterwards? Now tell me, had Healey ever given you notice to quit?—Yes; he had done so twice. When was that?—In the year 1848 or 1849, I cannot say which, but I could tell if I saw the notice. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON PLATT</hi>. Why did you not go out in accordance with the notice?—Because, my Lord, he came and asked me to remain. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEA</hi>. Is this the first one, Michaelmas, 1849?—Yes. When was the second?—This is the last notice to quit, at Lady Day, 1851. There was a second notice; this one of 28th Sept., 1650, gives the plaintiff notice to quit and give up his possession at Lady Day next; so that there were two notices of six months, one to quit at Lad; Day, 1850, and the other to quit at Lady Day, 1851; now after having received both of these notices to quit, you, at Healey's request, remained?—Yes, I did. Now when the distress was put in, had you received any notice of it?—No; I was away from home</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185112150064"/>
               <p>at the time. Who was there?—My wife and the lodgers, and my children. What age are your children, and how many have you?—There are four of them, and their ages are from one to four years. How long have you been married, then?—I have only been married six or seven years. Your wife was there when the distress came in; were there any lodgers there also?—Yes, several. Was a Mr. Vasey there, one of your lodgers?—Yes; he has been a lodger of mine sixteen or seventeen years. He occupied the upper rooms?—Yes; he paid 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week. Was there a lady of the name of Buxton a lodger also?—Yes; she occupied the drawing-room and two bedrooms, for which she paid 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week. Was there a lodger of the name of Nesbit?—Yes; he had gone out as the lady came in; he had been there six or seven years. Has he made application to you since to come back?—Yes; he wanted the floor he had had if I could let him have it. Well, now did the brokers, when they came in, take everything?—Yes; they left scarcely any<lb/>thing. As to the furniture, you purchased that from time to time, I suppose?—Yes, we bought it as we wanted. How much did it cost you?—It must have cost me as much as 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Had you any occasion at any time to consider what the value of it was?—No, never. Did you insure it?—Yes, always. For what amount?—For 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., of which 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was on my stock-in-trade. Then the whole of this furniture and stock-in-trade were taken away by the distress?—Yes, everything. Have you ever heard what they were sold for?—Never. Have you ever received any part of the money, any part of the proceeds of the sale?—I have never received anything. Were there any things taken which are not in that notice if—Oh, yes. a great many things. Was there any inventory?—I made a memorandum of the things. You say you made a memorandum of the things?—Yes, I did. Have the goodness to look at this paper, and tell me how or when you made that list; was it after the distress?—It was immediately after the distress-van had gone. Now tell me the things that were taken that were not in the inventory? (The witness read a long list of articles which he stated had been taken, but which had not been included in the inventory). Now I understand that those articles you have named were not in the broker's list?—No; there were 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—worth of things taken away which were not in that inventory. What condition was your furniture in?—In very good condition. Now tell me what became of the lodgers?—They, my wife, and all the family, had to get other places, while Mr. Vasey remained with me till the people had removed all. Did this proceeding injure you in your business?—My business! why, I have no business at all now; it has ruined me, and I under<lb/>stand my landlord has been to different persons, and been telling different things against me. When these things had been taken away, what had you and your wife to sleep upon?—Nothing but a bag of straw, which we have sown up in a canvas bag; we have nothing else. Do you mean to tell us that at this long period since the distress you and your wife have had nothing more than a bag of straw to sleep on?—Yes; we have had nothing else. And your children, what have they had to sleep upon?—Hay put into a lemon-bag; they get in, and have my old clothes to cover them up with. Then everything that was necessary for comfort was taken away?—Yes, everything. Had you a good business prior to this distress?—Yes, a very good business. Now, before this distress, what was the value of the good<lb/>will of your business?—I was offered 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it some time ago, which I told my landlord of.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUMPHREY</hi>. Now, Mr. Boulter, you have occupied this house twenty years, you say?—Yes, Sir. And when</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185112150065"/>
               <p>you have paid your rent you have had a receipt for it?—Yes, always. Have you any of those receipts here?—No, I never kept them; I never kept more than two or three by me. No! you have had notice to produce your receipts; have you any of 1848 or 1849; have you any of those receipts?—No, not one of either year. Except the last receipt which you have produced, then, you say you have none?—No, not one. Have you given any receipts or any writings to your attorney?—None but that one. What then has become of the others, may I ask?—I cannot tell. But you have given in one, and have kept the notices to quit, and the other little bit of paper; how comes it, then, that you have none of these receipts?—I do not know; I have not got them; if I had any of them in my possession, they were lost out of the desk at the time of the distress. Have you no book which will show your pay<lb/>ments?—No, no books, but a sort of day-book for my customers. lack you any books in which you kept an account of your payments; suppose you paid 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to any one, in what book did you put that disbursement down?—No, I kept no account of that sort. And you have no book in which you enter what you pay?—No, only what I kept my customers accounts in. Are those books at your house?—Yes, those I saved. Now you say you paid your rent regularly each quarter?—Yes. Now will you undertake to swear, take care, whether since the year 1848 you have paid one single quarter, the whole of the rent for the quarter at once; take care, for it is very important you should mind what you say; have you from the month of Aug., 1848, ever paid your full quarter's rent at one payment?—Yes, certainly, every one. Now, then, let me call your attention to another matter; you have had an action, in which a Mr. Davis was your attorney; now did you not enter into an agreement with Davis to pay his bill of costs by instalments, of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month?—No. Be cautious bow you answer; had you any agreement with that gentleman to pay the costs by instalments?—No. Have you paid them all?—Yes, in twelve months, as I agreed. Where does Mr. Davis live?—In Boswell-court. Did you give a consent to give a Judge's order?—Yes. Now I ask you was not that a Judge's order to pay 52. a month?—I do not know; I paid it all at once. What, do you mean to say that you paid it all at once?—Yes, except what was paid as the case went on. Now you had an action of false imprisonment?—Yes. Now I ask you did you not give a Judge's order to pay the costs due to Davis by instalments of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month? (no <hi rend="italic">answer</hi>) Well, how much was it; was it 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?—Say about 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Was it as much as 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?—Yes, it was. Were you not to pay the amount by instal<lb/>ments?—How? no; I paid it all at once. Now attend; did you not, in the year 1848, agree to pay Davis his costs by instalments?—No. No; why, did you not agree to a Judge's order?—Yes, something of the sort. And that Judge's order was given in order for you to pay Davis's claim by instal<lb/>ments of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month; was not that it?—I cannot say; I was to get the bill paid in such a time, and I paid it all at once. Now we have been speaking of the year 1850, when your landlord gave you a receipt for the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?—Yes. Well, he sent you the receipt you stated, and did he not at the same time write to you this letter? (<hi rend="italic">no answer</hi>) Was not this before Michaelmas?—I think it came after Michaelmas. Was this inclosure to you a notice to quit?—No; I did not receive one. Why, attend; the letter says: "I must beg you to pay attention to the notice I sent you, as I am so pressed by the result of my speculation;" was not that notice here alluded to the very notice?—No. What was the notice to which he begged to call your atten<lb/>tion?—I suppose that was a notice to bear in mind that there was an inten<lb/>tion to get rid of me; I suppose so; that never came with a notice to quit</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185112150066"/>
               <p>the place. You were so good a tenant that you paid your rent beforehand?—That was what he said. Was that what he said when he gave you notice to quit; had he not remonstrated with you over and over again upon letting your rent get into arrears, and told you he could not permit it, because he had nothing else to look to but his property?—I never heard him say so in my life. How comes it that you have this memorandum of his son's, which is comparatively unimportant, but that you have not any of the receipts?—I cannot say, Sir; it is a hundred to one that I had those. And still have them?—Yes; I picked them up in the shop. Will you swear that every single quarter's rent from Aug., 1848, has not been paid by portions, every single one except this one?—I cannot swear; I will not swear; I do not think it was in instalments previous to that. Will you swear that every single one was not?—Swear it, yes, I will swear that the last five or receipts were not paid by instalments. I will give you the dates. Dec. 1848, 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; Jan. 4th, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; March 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,;—May 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; July 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—; Oct. 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; Dec. 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—; Jan. 1850, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I ask you whe<lb/>ther every one of these was not paid by instalments?—Let me hear some more of that; I do not recollect anything of these instalments. Upon every receipt you had, was it not entered as he speaks of here; that he entered on the receipt the time at which it was paid?—I cannot say he entered it; I know it has all been paid, and paid in quarterly payments, not by instalments. Upon the receipts he gave you, were there not entered the very days and times at which you paid the money, whether altogether or in portions?—Perhaps there might. Have you any doubt?—I have no doubt he has made an entry of all the sums I paid. I want to know whether upon your own receipts there was not entered the same as on this which you have sent in; whether he did not put on each the day when it was paid?—As they were received they were written; dates put upon them, but there were no instalments paid in 18.50, but the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; all the others were paid quarterly. I have not asked you of 1850, I ask you of 1848?—I do not recollect 1848. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON PLATT</hi>. He swears that the last five were not paid by instalments. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUMFREY</hi>. are quite sure of that? <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON PLATT</hi>. The in<lb/>stalments might have been the other way. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUMFREY</hi>. I only want to know whether they were paid in one sum or not. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON PLATT</hi>. He says they were, except the one in August. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUMFREY</hi>. Did he explain to you how it was he gave you notice to quit?—He told me he was a dam<lb/>nation fool for doing it, and his friend told him so at the same time; a gentleman of the name of Beale. A damnation fool for doing what?—Giving me notice. He gave you two notices?—Yes, he did. Although you paid your rent, as you describe, always regularly?—Yes. Did your landlord, Mr. Healey, in the month of April, 1851, call upon you, and ask you to pay him some money on account?—He did not. You are sure of that?—Yes. Did he tell you he had made a mistake, he found, in writing the receipt, and that the receipt which said up to Christmas, 1850, should have been Christmas, 1849?—No, never mentioned it to me. He never asked you to pay any money on account to reduce the amount you owed him?—I never knew there was any. Did he or did he not ask you in April, 1851, to pay some money, and reduce the amount you owed him?—No, he never asked me anything of the sort, or any one else from him. You paid his son in August, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which you say was beforehand; I want to know whether after that August his son did not apply to you frequently to reduce the amount of rent you owed his father?—No. You will swear that?—I will swear that. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON PLATT</hi>. I think you say you did not pay the rent with your own hand, but your wife</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEA</hi>. You say he told you were as good a tenant as he had had in his life?—Yes. On what occasion?—He said I had been the making of him, and he had been the making of me; I do not know what be meant. Did he ever give you any reason for giving you notice to quit?—No, he did not; no more than when I asked why, he said he was a d—d fool, and he was told so at the time; that something struck him at the time that he would do it; that was the only reason. How long have the back premises been unlet?—Since I gave them up. How long have the back premises been unlet?—It might be four years; they were separated from my premises after the landlord took them."—<hi rend="italic">On the</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">th Nov., during the sum<lb/>ming up of the Judge, Thomas Boulter was re-called by</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a publican; I keep the King's Head, in Cumber<lb/>land-market; I have lived there twenty years. I have a few houses in Albany-street; amongst other tenants, the prisoner was the tenant of No. 53—the rent, when the premises behind were attached, was 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—after they were detached, the rent was 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was payable quarterly—up to 1846, the prisoner paid his rent pretty well, and in quarters—after 1848, he ceased to pay so regularly, and was getting more and more in arrears—at Christmas, 1849, four quarters rent was due—at Christmas, 1850, before, I was paid 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in Feb., there were seven quarters due.</p>

               <p>that, and I had better go to mine—I then replied that my course was clear—I saw nothing but proceeding by distress for the rent; and in June, I caused a distress to be levied on him for five quarters' rent, the last of which was the March quarter, 1851.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, on the solemnity of that oath you have taken, did you ever receive any money whatever for those quarters from Christmas, 1849, down to March, 1851? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never; not any sum, either in whole or part by him<lb/>self, his wife, or any person on his behalf, not any sum nor in any way—10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to my son, on account of the quarter due at Michaelmas, 1849—I did not often send my son to get these arrears—I pretty generally went myself—I received the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which completed the quarter to Michaelmas, 1849, on the 4th of Nov. 1850.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. M'MAHON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you explain how you have written in your own book to Christmas 1850, and changed it to 1849? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was what I did write, but I made a mistake—on the 5th of Feb. 1851, receiving one quarter's rent due at Christmas 1849, I put it by mistake 1850—the last entry previous to that was on the 4th of Nov., "Received from Mr. Boulter, the balance of one quarter, due at Mich. 1849, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. "—it is not the fact that instead of four quarters being due at Christmas, 1849, there were only three quarters—there were four quarters: I will swear that—I swear that on the 25th of Dec. 1849, there were four quarters rent due to me; I am positive of that, there is no mistake about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In you own book here is "Dec. 22nd, 1849, 53, Albany-street; received 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on account part payment of one quarter due at Lady Day last"—do you now swear that to Christmas, 1849, there were four quarters' rent due? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I should suppose there were three quarters and a part due—the next item in my book is 11th Jan.—it was written on 11th Jan., 1850, or it might be the 12th; it was about that time—on 11th Jan. 1850, there were three quarters rent due from Mr. Boulter—I received 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on 19th March, 1850; 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 10th Aug.; 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 4th Nov., and 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 5th Feb. 1851—when I distrained there were only five quarters due, it was pretty near on to a sixth, but there were only five due—when I distrained on 21st June, 1851, there were five quarters due, and no more; I am sure of that—I have no entries in the cash-book that apply to this matter except such as I have transferred into this book—there are no other memorandums as to the amount of rent due at Christmas, 1849, or 1850, than what you see here—the rent has generally of late years been paid by Mrs. Boulter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a saddler, of Long-lane, Smithfield. I have known Jackson and Goult since July—Jackson tint came to my shop on 14th July, represented himself as a black saddler, and brought two saddles with him, which I bought—on 29tb Sept. they brought a pair of tilbury tugs—I cannot say whether they came together, I know Jackson came, but whether Goult came or not I cannot say—I am referring to extracts from my books—this entry of 29th Sept. is not in my writing; but I have an indepen<lb/>dent recollection of that transaction—they generally came two or three times a week—I had two or three deals with them on 29th Sept.; and on one of those occasions Jackson represented that the articles they brought were saddlery fur<lb/>niture,. which they were disposing of in consequence of giving up the manu<lb/>facturing of harness, and the articles appeared to be such as they would have in that business—I think Goult was then present, but I cannot say—I had no suspicion of them, because I had dealt with them a long time for saddles; they were saddle-manufacturers—they continued bringing me articles down to 11th Oct.—on that day I purchased two harness Baddies, and a gig whip, of them—there is an entry here of it (<hi rend="italic">referring to hit book</hi>) in my writing—about the middle of Oct., the 10th or 18th, they brought me quite a different description of goods, which appeared new, and as though they came direct from a warehouse—I said, "This is quite a different sort of furniture to what you brought at first; how did you become possessed of this?"—I think they were both present then; I know Jackson was, he was the principal man<lb/>Jackson said, "The fact is, we are manufacturing saddles for Eldrid" (I knew that to be the fact); "we get a very tidy price for our work, but we are com<lb/>pelled," or "required, to take a part of it out in furniture:" and in answer to a question I put, they said that in consequence of getting a better price from Eldrid, they were able to make a sacrifice on the furniture—under those circumstances I did not hesitate to take the things of them, because I knew they worked for Eldrid—I see by my book that they came again on the 13th, either one or both of them, I cannot say which—Jackson was the principal man, and he came more than the other—I cannot tell what I bought on that occasion exactly, but I paid them 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on 16th I have, in my own writing, "Goult, three pair of wooden girths," which I purchased of him—in Nov. I sent my man named Springett to Mr. Eldrid; and in consequence of what passed between Mr. Eldrid and me, on 10th Nov., I ordered four pairs of spurs, I think, of Jackson—I think they were both present; but they were brought by Goult, and I paid him 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. fur them—I sent the spurs to Mr. Eldrid—on 11th Goult brought another pair of spurs—that was the last transaction.</p>

I remember Jackson bringing two saddles to our shop, in July—he did not, on that occasion, tell me his name; but he afterwards brought goods, which were purchased of him, and he had them entered in the name of Goult—he afterwards came with Goult, and said, "I have brought my partner down with me, and if he brings a saddle down, and you pay him for it, it will be just the same as paying me for it"—on 13th Oct., I saw both Jackson and Goult in the shop; they brought some furniture, consisting of buckles, and a quantity of girths—the buckles were of the same character as these, and I am sure these are some of the brown girths; I cannot say as to the linen girths—they were together, and helped me to tie the girths in pairs—I paid them 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—they said, "We are likely to do a little business with your <hi rend="italic">governor</hi>; we are get<lb/>ting some furniture in barter from a man in the country"—I said if they served us as cheap as anybody else, 1 dare say Mr. Duffield would buy of them—I recollect Jackson bringing some tilbury togs on Michaelmas-day, for which I paid him 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they both came together after that, and brought</p>

               <p>saddles, and also furniture—the saddles generally had the terrets in them, but manufacturers generally send them in without furniture—an addition was put on the price of the saddles on account of the terrets—I cannot say how much I have paid them altogether; I have paid them on several occasions—I recollect one day paying them two sums, each of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on 30th, I paid Jack<lb/>son 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and on 31st, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., both sums to Jackson—I went to Mr. Eldrid on 31st, and in consequence of what took place between us, we ordered some spurs, and it was after that that the prisoners were taken into custody.</p>

I have been the only person in the business since 30th Sept.—I was not in the business at all previously—the partners then were my father and Mr. Gray—Ovens was in my employ—it was his duty to open the shop at about 7 o'clock, but there was very rarely any custom before 9—if Ovens sold or parted with any articles of the description produced, it would be his duty to enter them—I have searched the book, and find no entry of the articles—if Goult or Jackson had purchased any of these articles, that ought to appear in their Saturday night account—I looked through the bills, and found none of the articles entered that were sold to Mr. Duffield—Mr. Wood, the solicitor, called to see Mr. Gray, Mr. Gray was at home, said he was engaged, and could not see him; and sent that message down by the servant—Mr. Wood had been before that, but I had not seen him—Mr. Wood was very much annoyed that Mr. Gray would not see him, and made some remark—I saw Mr. Wood again next day, Mr. Gray was not at home; Mr. Wood said he did not care, it would all go against us at the day of trial—he behaved rudely to my father, and I gave directions if he called again they were to answer him "Yes" or "No," but answer no other question.</p>

I was in Goult's employ—Jackson worked there—Goult was the master—I have frequently seen Ovens at Goult's, sometimes three times a day, in the last five or six weeks before Goult was taken—when he came I was sometimes sent out—I never saw him bring anything but once; that was a parcel of hog skin, a bit of patent leather, and a pair of scissors; and about a month before they were taken, I saw Ovens bring some girth<lb/>chapes and buckles—he said they were 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Jackson said the girths were for Mr. Duffield's men—on the morning Jackson was taken I saw him looking at a pair of spurs—I came up while he was looking at them—I looked at them—he said they were very nice spurs—I said they were very nice spurs, and he said, "You need not say anything"—while I was at dinner, the same day, Jackson and Goult were token into custody—about 2 o'clock Ovens came in, and Jackson's sister told him they were token into custody—Ovens sat upon a stool, and said, "It is all up with me!" and told Jackson's sister if there was any loose brown paper with their mark on it, she was to burn it—I went and saw Goult in prison, at Mrs. Goult's desire, but I should have gone whether or no—when I saw him he told me to keep my tongue between my teeth—I have seen terrets at Goult's but not like these produced—two pairs of terrets we had came wrapped up in basil and serge—Jackson brought one pair, and Goult the other.</p>

I went to bed about a quarter to one o'clock, the house was then secure—I was awoke about three, by a policeman, went down-stairs as quick as possible, and found the back-door leading to the yard, open, and the hinges wrenched from it—I cannot say whether the door was exactly off, but violence had been used—it was secure when I went to bed—I had noticed it particularly, because the house had been broken into the night before, and I had had extra bolts put on—there is a window in the yard, looking into the kitchen, a pane of glass had been taken out from there, close to the safe, which adjoined the window—I had seen that about 8 or 9 the night before—I had a piece of pork weighing about 5lbs. and three small pictures in the safe—the door was fastened, not locked—to open it a person must have come inside—the pork and three pictures were not there at 3, but Greathead showed them to me, asked me if they were my property, and I recognised them as having been taken—I have been shown where the prisoner lives, it is not far from my place.</p>

On 30th Nov., about 3 o'clock in the morning, I received information, and went to the prosecutor's house—I examined the back-door, and found several marks on it, which had been made with some blunt instrument—between 4 and 5 I went to the prisoner's house, which is forty-six yards from the railing at the back of the prosecutor's house; I have measured it—if a person wanted to go from the fence to where the prisoner lives, he would go across Three Colt-corner, and then come round into Hare-street—the place where the prisoner was taken has been pointed out to me; a person would have to pass that spot—I went to the prisoner's house, and found him lying on a bed with all his clothes on except a coat and hat—it was then between half-past 4 and 5—I cannot say the time exactly, as I was delayed at the prosecutor's examining the place—I knocked at the door—his father answered it, and T said I wanted to see George—I went into the room, and said to him, "Put on your things, and-bring the same poker with you that you had before"—he pointed to the fire-place—I said, "Get them yourself"—he then got this standard and the poker, and said, "This (<hi rend="italic">the poker</hi>) is the one I was stopped with, and this (<hi rend="italic">the standard</hi>) is the one I threw down in the passage"—I took the poker and the standard as well to the prosecutor's premises, and compared the marks on the outer-door with these instruments—I found five or six marks which it fitted into exactly, be<lb/>tween the door and the door-post, and likewise the hinges outside the door where it had been placed in between the hinges and the door—the impression on the door corresponded with this in size and form—to the best of my opinion, the indentations I saw were done by this instrument, or another very similar to it—I examined some foot-prints from the back of the prisoner's house to the back of the prosecutor's—they had to go over about four different yards, I should say, where they had broken away the palings—I could not tell in which direction the foot-prints were, on account of its being a frosty night—it was only where the ground had broken that I could see the mark of a heel—the only thing that led me to think they went from the prosecutor's to the prisoner's was that there was a railing fresh broken at the end of the pri<lb/>soner's yard, and there was some fresh dirt upon it as if it had been grazed off the sole of the boot in getting over; had they been coming the other way, I think the dirt would have lodged on the other side—to the best of my belief, that railing had not been broken many hours—in the next yard there were railings quite recently broken, and the nail was forced out with the wood—I took the prisoner into custody about 5 on the Sunday morning—I searched him, and found 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. upon him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's sister. I remember the evening he was taken, he came home from work about 6 o'clock—he was mending his nets by my table, and just before 10 I went out—he catches birds on a Sunday—I returned just before 12—he was not in then—he came back about 2 with the first bird—I think there were two young men outside: I heard their voices; I did not see them—my mother was not able to see them—he put the bird down, and went to his young woman's for another bird—he came back in about 25 minutes—I opened the door to him, and he had another bird—my mother had just gone into the yard—in about four or five minutes I heard her cry, "Thieves! bring a light!"—I took a light, and gave the prisoner the poker—he said, "Give me two, one is not enough," and I gave him the standard, and went out with him into the yard—he wanted to get over the pales: my mother would not let him—he came out of the yard into the passage, threw the standard into the passage, and said, "Father, father! here is one for you," and went into the street—I afterwards heard he was taken, and saw him with the policeman—my father dressed and went to the station—we have all been examined at the police-court—the poker and standard were in their place when I came back at 12—they were not moved from the fire-place till he moved them—he has been in constant employ.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the standard loose generally? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We generally use it to stir the fire; I recollect using it after 12 o'clock on that evening—it was the standard I handed him, he took the poker himself—he was by the fire-place then—my mother was in the back-yard then, and my father was in bed—I ran out into the back-yard with my brother—my sister-in-law was there, she does not live in the house; she lives up at the West-end; but it was very foggy, and mother persuaded her to stop all night, and she was undressing herself by the fire—she was to sleep with me, in the same room—all the rest of the family were in bed—my mother could not see the persons that came home with my brother—I did not see them—I did not go out, and they did not come in—the door was open when my brother came home the first time, and I let him in the second time—I do not know whether there were two, or three, except what my brother told me—I heard their voices, nothing more—I could not say by their voices who they were; I did not pay much attention—my brother was very seldom in the habit of being out at 2 o'clock in the morning—my mother had not gone out to the back-yard above a minute when I let my brother in; she could not have got further than the yard—she went to the back-door, and I let my brother in at the front-door—he said the second time, he brought the bird from his young woman's—when I saw the policeman with him it was two or three doors from father's house—my father picked up the standard, and put it into the fire-place, before he went out—I did not see him put it into the fire-place, but I saw him pick it up in the passage, and take it into the room—it was in the passage, close by the stairs—my mother was in the passage at the time he picked it up—he then put on his trowsers, and came to the street-door—when my brother cried, "Father, father!" I was in the passage against the street-door, and then my father came out at the street-door—he had his trowsers on then—he is a fender-maker—we are in the habit of being up late on Saturday evenings.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Mare-street, Hackney, and am agent to Mr. Moore, the owner of the house, 18, Ann's-terrace. The prisoner Walker called on me on 25th June, to ask about the house I had to let—the rent was 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum—I asked for references, and agreed to let him the house, subject to the references being satisfactory—he referred me to Mr. Palmer, 15, Milman-street, Bedford-square, and to Mr. Stevens, 18, Penton-street, Pentonville—I went to 18, Penton-street, next day—Mr. Stevens was not at home—I saw the prisoner Buckle—she told me her name was Mrs. Stevens, that Mr. Stevens was out, but perhaps she could do as well—I told her I came to inquire the character of a man named Walker—she said he had lived in a house of theirs in the Wandsworth-road for twelve years, they had always found him a very good tenant, and I should do the same—I do not recollect whether there was any name up at the house in Penton-street—I went to Milman-street, where I saw the prisoner Stainbridge—he came into the room—I said, "Mr. Palmer?"—he said, "Yes"—I said I was referred to him by a Mr. Walker, who was about to take a house of me—he said I should find him a very good tenant; he had known him many years, and he was stopping in his house till he could get into this house of mine—he said he had come from the country, and he brought him into the room afterwards—in consequence of this I took Walker as a tenant—he took possession, I think, on 28th or 29th of June—I was told by the police that the house was empty on 30th Sept.—Walker had called on me a few days previously to ask if the landlord would sell the house—he said his wife would give 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I</p>

Josiah Viney—I am agent for other houses—I generally send my clerk to inquire about the references, but in this case I went myself—I think the house in Milman-street was a ten-roomed house—it had a plate on the door, with the name "Palmer" on it, very much rubbed—I saw Stainbridge, and thought him a respectable man—I never saw him before—I am able to speak to his being the man—I recollected him when I saw him at the police-station—I said, "That is Walker"—I then saw Palmer or Stainbridge—I had not seen him before that I know of—when he was at the station he was dressed as he is now—when I saw him at the house he was dressed very genteely, like a gentleman—it was a week before quarter-day that Walker called on me to ask if the landlord would sell the house—I referred him at once to a Mr. Newby; he holds the ground-rent; he let it to the Rev. Josiah Viney, and he let it again to Mr. Moore—the key of the house was sent to me by the parcels' Delivery Company three or four days after they left—it was directed to me.</p>

The prisoner Walker came to me a few days prior to 1st Sept.; he told me his name, which I took down on paper, and desired I would wait on him at his residence—he gave the name of "C. R. Walker, Victoria-park"—he required a set of harness for a pony—the price of it was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he told me he was a retired surgical-instrument maker, and his wife liked the resi<lb/>dence so much that she would purchase it if she could for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if they would take that money for it—the harness was delivered on 18th Sept.—I should have fitted the harness on, but he said the pony was ill, and had been bled—before the harness went home, Stain bridge came to my house, as groom from Mr. Walker, to know if the harness was completed—he looked at it—he said nothing against it—I took it borne on 18th Sept., and on 22nd Walker called on me—he did not pay me, but purchased a whip for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he did not pay for that, but ordered some brushes, and other stable utensils—my bill was 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., less 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he did not pay for anything—the last goods were sent in on 27th Sept.—I did not call for the money; as I was returning from town I saw the house was closed.</p>

Mr. Bur<lb/>dett"—the letters were sealed, and on handing them to the Magistrate, Burdett objected to any letter being opened, and threatened an action to whoever should open them—the Magistrate directed them to be opened, and they were read—on the next examination certain other letters were produced by the officer directed to the Rev. Mr. Burdett, and Charles Burdett, Esq.—I wrote other letters and posted them, and in reply I received these other letters and some enclosures—one letter I received from Leek, in Stafford shire, had this enclosure, one from Manchester had this enclosure, two from Dublin had these two enclosures—one from Halifax had this letter enclosed, ano<lb/>ther from Manchester enclosed this letter—I also produce these papers—I wrote to the persons from whom these letters came, which were addressed to Burdett.</p>

On 1st Dec. about half-past 11, or 12 o'clock, the prisoner came to the bar alone for a glass of half-and-half—he was served in my presence—a short time after another young man came in—he said, "Halloo!" and called the prisoner by some name, I think it was <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>—the other man had a glass <hi rend="italic">of</hi> ale—in two minutes afterwards, two others came in—they spoke to the prisoner, and the other—they were all talking together; they appeared to know one another—the prisoner then asked if I would allow him to wash himself—I said, Yes, and took him into the kitchen, which is about twenty feet from the bar—I left no one in the bar, but the three other persons in front of the bar—I showed the prisoner where to wash himself—I came back to the bar, and one of the last two that came in asked me if I sold peppermint—I said, I did not—they then said, "What is that in that cask on the bar?"—I said, it was spruce—they said, they would have 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth—it was what is called Dantzic spruce—I served them with half-a-quartern—they then asked for some hot water—spruce is generally taken with water—I had a fire-place in the bar, but I had no water there—I went to the kitchen to get the water—the prisoner was still washing—I brought the water to the bar, and it was put with the spruce—they said it was too strong, and I must get more water—I went to get more, and when I came back the one that said it was too strong was gone—that excited my attention, and I put the glass on the bar, and went in the bar parlour, and the cash-box was gone—I had seen it there when I first went for the water—when I went in the bar-parlour I had left two standing at the bar, but before I could turn round they were gone—they did not give me a chance to say any<lb/>thing to them—I went to the door, and came back, and called to a person who was in my kitchen—I said, "They have stolen the cash-box"—the prisoner could hear that very well, and he came up the passage and said, "I will run after them"—I said, "No, you won't"—the person that I called took hold of him by the shoulder—and I went to the door to keep it shut—the prisoner got from the person who had hold of him, in a violent manner—he came to the door and pushed me on one side—he did not hurt me much, but he got out and I could not prevent it—I did not go out, but my husband was coming along and he saw the prisoner go out of the house—there were plenty of people very soon round—there was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the cash-box—I have never seen it since.</p>

I had lived with him between Stonehouse and Hastings—I had left that place and came to town—I took a room at Mr. Wickers, 7 Straits-mouth, Greenwich—I had lived there two or three weeks before 26th Nov.—I lived with a man there—on 26th Nov., between 12 and 1 o'clock, I came from my own room into Mr. Wickers' shop—while I was there my husband came in—I had not seen him from the time I had left Hastings—when he came in he said, "Here you are, are you, you b w?"—I said, "Don't make a noise here, let's go up-stairs and talk"—I went up-stairs, and my husband followed me into my room, the back room on the first floor—when he got in, he locked the door, took me round the waist and threw roe down, and bit a piece off my nose while I was on the ground—he then said he would serve me out for what I had done—he pulled me up by the hair of my head—he hurt me by pulling me up—he pulled me up altogether, by one hand—he took the poker from the fireplace, and gave me six blows across the head with it—he cut my head in six places—I tried to get out of the door—I did</p>

               <p>not scream out at first: I did at the last blow—the blows were in succession, one after the other—while I was trying to unlock the door, he kept giving me blows with the poker across my legs—he had said, while he was hitting me on my back, that he would break my legs—he hit me on the back after he had fait me on the head and before he hit me on the legs—I managed to get out of the room, for the lock was only put on temporarily, and I broke it off by force—I ran down-stairs and into the next house, and out into the yard—there is a fence in the yard—I do not think I got quite over the fence—that fence is adjoining to a lane—my head was bleeding—I saw a police-man, and he took me into Mr. Wickers' kitchen—the doctor was sent for, and he examined my wounds—my husband was sober—I had not struck him at all before he threw me down, I had not any chance to do it—I had not taken up the poker before he struck me with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Nelson-street, Green<lb/>wich. I was sent for to Mr. Wickers' on 26th Nov.—I examined Mrs. Sandford's head;—it was covered with blood; and on cleansing it, and washing the blood away, I found two wounds on the fore part of the head, and two on the hinder part—they were cut wounds, and were bleeding—one of them was large, about two inches long; one a very small one, and the other two a middling size—the long wound was on the fore part; it was not very deep—the wounds had been inflicted with a blunt instrument—I think they could have been inflicted with a poker—her left eye was bruised, from a blow of some sort—a small portion of the tip of her nose was bitten or torn off—I think that had ceased bleeding—it was a flesh wound—the wounds on the head were ordinary flesh wounds—flesh wounds are not dangerous under ordinary circumstances,, but they might become so from what might happen afterwards—there were marks of bruises on both her legs—I could not tell with what they had been inflicted—they appeared to have been recently done—there were several bruises on both legs, near the shins—perhaps the largest was about the size of a half-crown—they were the result of severe blows near the</p>

               <p>middle of the <hi rend="italic">leg</hi>—I dressed the wounds, and attended her for a fortnight—she is now quite well in health, but the nose is not well—there will always be a mark there—a piece about the size of a horse-bean is gone—a bite would certainly have inflicted that injury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Would a fall do it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; there will always be a scar or a mark on the nose—it will always be observed—some part of it has been made good, and it may be made better—the wounds on the head were flesh wounds; the smallest was about half an inch—there were no par<lb/>ticular circumstances in this case to make them dangerous—the bruises on the legs were numerous, but not large—a small wound might produce a large flow of blood.</p>

At the end of Oct. or beginning of Nov., in consequence of what my son told me, I went to Cross-street, Beth<lb/>nal-green, respecting the letting of the house—I there saw Reid, Hamilton, and his wife—I told them, in consequence of their calling at my house the day before, I understood they wanted the house, and I had called to know if it suited, and likewise for a reference—they said it would suit them, the wife showed me their present rent-book, which was well paid up, and the father said he had just come home from tea in the <hi rend="italic">Poictiers</hi>—a few days afterwards they called on me, gave me a deposit, and in a few days after that Reid called for the key—about a fortnight afterwards Hamilton called on me about some taxes that bad been called for—I afterwards called at the house, and saw somebody sitting at the fire who may have been Clifford, but I can<lb/>not undertake to swear it was him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am unmarried, and reside with my sister, Mrs. Cowling, at 3, Asylum-road, Old Kent-road. She is a widow, and is the tenant of the house—at the time this happened the prisoner had lived there about a fortnight as servant—on Saturday morning, 6th Dec. I awoke, and went to the prisoner's door about 7 o'clock—the door was ajar—she was not up—I called her; she answered me, "Yes, ma'am, I will get up"—I then went to my bedroom—it was a very cold morning, and was very dark—in a quarter of an hour or twenty-five minutes she came up to my bedroom, and said, "Ma'am, I wish you would come down to see the back parlour table-cover, there is something the matter with it" in a very strange way—I was then in bed—I said, "What can the matter be? has any one been in the house?"—I went down, and looked at the table-cover—it was a cotton plaid, and was not quite half burnt—the embers were warm and smelt very fresh—the table was warm, the tinder was warm—I took it up in my hand this is the table-cover (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I immediately went up to Mrs. Cowling's door, and awoke her—she accompanied me down stairs to see the cloth—in the prisoners presence Mrs. Cowling said, "You did it"—she said, "Me, ma'am! how could I?"—we then went up stairs to dress, and while we were dressing, the prisoner came again to me, and said, "Do, ma'am, come down, and look at the front parlour; it is in a dreadful state"—we had not seen the front parlour when we were down before; the folding doors were shut—I went to Mrs. Cowling, we both went down together, and the prisoner followed—we opened one folding door, and could not see for smoke, except that there was a fire under the piano—I saw the valens of the curtains broken in two, and in the fire, and the whole of the curtain in ashes, except one breadth—there bad been twenty-two yards in the curtain—it was more, woollen stuff—I saw all my music-books burnt, also the portfolios of loose music—all my music was burnt, except one thin bound book—I folded the rug in two or three pieces, and put it on the fire on the floor, under the piano<lb/>forte—I found these matches on the floor, and some in the middle of the floor in the front parlour—the carpet was burnt where the ashes of the curtain had fallen—Mrs. Cowling, myself, and a little girl between eight and nine yew old, were in the house—I found the house as I had left it the night before—the fire was in two places, perfectly distinct from each other—the front and back parlour windows are twenty-seven feet from each other—when the fire had subsided, I found one <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the boards under the pianoforte was burnt—there was no hollow burnt in it, but it was all black, and the carpet was burnt.</p>

The deceased was brought there on the morning of 4th Nov.—he complained of a pain in his right side, in the situation of the liver and kidneys—he was suffering from haemorrhage of the urinary organs—he died on 16th Nov.—I afterwards examined his body—there was extensive lacera<lb/>tion of the right kidney; the liver was diseased, and there were three ribs broken—I cannot say whether the diseased liver was the effect of the injury, or any other can—he had jaundice, and it might have come on from internal causes—the cause of death was the laceration of the kidney—the three broken ribs might have had something to do with it—it must have been the result of outward violence—there was no appearance of outward violence—laceration of the kidney is easily produced; it might have been produced by being thrown out of a gig—that is a probable cause, especially if it was with such violence as to break three ribs at the same time.</p>

I shall feel much obliged if you will inform Miss Hall that I received a letter this morning from her aunt at Carlisle; she is very poorly, and wishes to see her niece as soon as possible, as she is of expected to live many days. I would advise her to make the best of her way to her aunt, and not delay one moment. I am happy to find that Miss Hall will not sell the four acres of land situated in Folly Close, as it will, in the course of two or three years, be worth three times the money Mr. Price has offered her for it, and her aunt is now far advanced in years, and not expected to live long; and at the death of her aunt she will come into full possession of Hadley Farm, which contains 130 acres of freehold land, and at present lets for 360<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; but if Miss Hall would appoint some person as an agent, the farm would let for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, as the land is good, and the farm in good repair. I am, dear Sir, yours respectfully, Thomas Henry Wood.") The prisoner said her aunt was a very aged woman, eighty years of age, or upwards, and lived at Carlisle, and at her death she would come into possession of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she said she should have 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Wood in a few days, and asked me to receive it for her—I said she had better receive it herself, or get some friend to re<lb/>ceive it for her—she said she could not read or write, and if she got any one it would be some petty shopkeeper or the woman where she lodged, and it would not be quite safe; so I then offered to receive the money for her, and wrote to Mr. Wood, giving him my Christian name, and then it was I received the letter I have produced—when I received the letter I told her she must immediately go to Carlisle—she said she could not do so until she received the money on the following Tuesday—I said she must not wait for that, as her aunt was so unwell, and I advanced her 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was about an hour before the train was to start, and she took the money in such a dilatory manner, she seemed so dilatory in starting, that I felt sure she would lose the train, and I took her to the station myself, and saw her off in the train—I then wrote again to Mr. Wood, and the letter was returned to me through the Post Dead-letter Office—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">read—addressed, "</hi> Thomas Henry Wood, Esq., 13, Royal-crescent, Bath," <hi rend="italic">endorsed</hi>, "Unknown." "Palace<lb/>wharf, Lambeth, 26th July, 1851. Sir,—I received your letter of 24th inst. upon reaching town yesterday at 6 o'clock.

I saw her off by the quarter to 9 train, which would be due at Carlisle at 5 minutes to 8 this morning.

                  </hi>. I live at 84, Bridge-street, Greenwich—I saw the prisoner at my house, in Greenwich, on 1st Nov., to the best of my knowledge—there was a female with him, whom he called his wife—he took apartments for himself and his wife, and for another friend, and his wife—he said his friend was an engineer, and he was to come on Monday week to work at Mr. Joyce's, over the way—he said he was not so fortunate himself, but he hoped to be set on at Mr. Perry's—he did not say what his name was, but some days after he asked me if a letter came in the name of Newton would I take it in—I said, "Yes"—he and the woman remained with me ten days—during the time he was there I did not address him by any name—I very seldom saw him—his wife waited on him—I addressed his wife by the name of Mrs. Newton, and his friend and his wife passed by the name of Wilson—they came the same day that he did—I did not take any letter in.</p>
