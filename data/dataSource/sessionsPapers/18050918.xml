               <p>Court. Q. Could you see over the warehouse? - A. No; I could see when the prisoner came out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Q. Was there any bark kept in that warehouse? - A. Yes, in the two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that room locked or opened? - A. Locked; the key of that room was tied to the others; he took the keys when he went to the warehouse, and when he came out from the warehouse, I observed his pockets filled with something bulky; when he got to Paternoster-row, he asked me if he might take the senna I had sent him for up one pair of stairs; I told him he might, and I would go and assist him in weighing it; he went up stairs, and I went after him, and during the time he was weighing it, I perceived that his pockets were extended; he then asked me to go out for a short time; I permitted him; I told him I would answer for him during his absence; I told him to take the senna with him, and leave it on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. When he left the house of the prosecutors, what did you do? - A. I ran into the accompting-house, and rang a bell that goes into Mr. Manley's house; he went out, and I followed him; when he had got about fifteen yards from the door, I told him I wanted him, and he came back with me into the shop, and Mr. Manley came into the shop at the time; I told Mr. Manley that he had got something about him; a constable was sent for, and he was searched, and there was found on him one pound four ounces of Peruvian bark in his pocket, and one pound six ounces in his breeches, wrapped up in a piece of cloth, which he took out himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told the prisoner that day to get any bark? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a part of the prisoner's duty to go into the bark-room? - A. No; the charge of the bark-room was given to another man by Mr. Manley.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you distinct servants for bark and senna? - A. Not for senna; one man goes for bark only by Mr. Manley's order.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Q. What did the prisoner say? - A. He said he was very sorry for it, he was guilty, and he had some bark in his lodgings; we went to his lodgings, and there we found twenty-five pounds of bark.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. How long has he lived in the service of the prosecutors? - A. About eight or ten months.</p>

I returned her the same change again, and she put down the guinea; I did not miss the guinea till Mr. Wood, a grocer living opposite, came in, not many minutes after she was gone; he asked me what change I had given the woman that was gone out; I told him for a guinea; he asked me if it was a good one; I looked for it, and it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body else been in the shop? - A. There had been several people in the shop; I went out after the woman, and asked her for the guinea; she told me that she had not got it; Mr. Webb came up, and she delivered the guinea into his hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the guinea again? - A. No; I know it was a good looking guinea, I cannot say it was the same guinea again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Are you sure that nobody had been near the counter to take that guinea? - A. There were several people in the shop, but I never saw the guinea afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. There had been several people in the shop at the counter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Any one of them might have taken the guinea for what you know? - A. They had not gone out of the shop before Mr. Wood came in.</p>
               <p>- WEBB sworn. - I was in conversation with a friend nearly opposite the prosecutor's; I live in Threadneedle-street; I saw the last witness running as if she was pursuing of a woman; I did not know her at the moment, I followed to see what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance had she got? - A. About fifty or sixty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner running? - A. No, walking very quietly; I came up to her when the last witness taxed her with the fraud; she denied it, and I told her for certain I should take her back to the shop: going back, after we had gone about ten yards, she said she hoped she had not made a mistake; she put her hand into her pocket, and seemed as though she felt herself very much astonished, and gave me the guinea.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You say, she was walking very gently? - A. Yes, and she went back very readily with me.</p>
               <p>NAHUM WOOD sworn. - I suspected the prisoner, and I went over to Mr. Lemon's to inform them.</p>

             sworn. - I am a publican, in Newgate-street: The prisoner came into my house, and requested the favour to leave the basket till Monday; she said she was going to take it into the country to a town called Kent, to a lady; she said, a lady in Fleet-market gave them to her; I put my hand in the basket, and saw four fur<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180005"/>tippets; the constable searched, and found who the property belonged to; I detained her and the property.</p>
               <p>- sworn. - I am a constable; I went into four or five shops to find the owner of the property; the prosecutor came, and owned the tippets directly.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The person whom I suspected to have robbed me of them, I think the woman by some means or other got them from him; I had some suspicions of my porter, that he had stolen them from me, and gave her the basket, it is my porter's basket; they, between them, wanted to make money on them; they are my property, they have my shop-mark on them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going down Fleet-market, and I met this woman; she asked me if I wanted a job; I said, yes, and thank you too; she told me where to carry it; I went on, and forgot the place; I left the basket; I wanted to see if I could meet her again; this man looked at the basket, and had me taken up.</p>

I then said to the prisoner, give me the man's watch, I believe you have got it; she denied it; on searching her, I found the watch under her right arm, which I then took into my own possession; I then said to the prosecutor, have you lost any thing else; he said, I have lost two seven-shilling pieces and some silver, but to what amount I cannot say; I found them in the prisoner's possession, I produce the property. (The property identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutor.) Had you been with the woman at all? - A. Yes, I had been with the woman under the hay-stack.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your watch might have dropped out of your pocket? - A. No, it could not have dropped out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the 28th of July, I met the prosecutor on the common about nine o'clock in the evening; he asked me where I was going; I told him, home; he asked me to have something to drink; I told him I would have something to eat; he asked me if I would take him somewhere to sleep, he said he was so drunk he could not go home; he then said to me, stop a bit, have you got my watch; no, says I, I did not know that you had got a watch; I beg your pardon, says he. I did not think that you would have taken it. He then asked me again to take him any where to lye down till the morning, he did not care where it was to be safe; I took him where there was some new hay, and then he gave me two bundles, and I covered them all over with the hay; he fell fast asleep, and I fell asleep likewise. After I had been asleep, I felt the hay move; there was a sailor there that had dragged the bundles from under my head; I then jumped up, and found the bundles on the ground; the sailor picked them up, and the bag with the seven-shilling pieces, and ran round the factory; I told him the things belonged to the young man that was asleep; I was standing close to the gate when that man came and took me with the property.</p>

             sworn. - I am a Prussian: On the 10th of August, I was in company with the prisoners at the sign of the Amsterdam Arms; there were about thirty-five of us sailors; we were waiting for a gentleman to put our names down for a ship. We went into that public-house a little after four o'clock in the afternoon; the prisoners asked me if I would take a walk with them, which I did, at about half after four in the afternoon; we went from the Amsterdam Arms to the half-way house; I went in, and asked for a pot of beer, and these two men and I drank together there.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go out of that house? - A. Between eight and nine o'clock, and then both the prisoners came out of the house with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know these men before? - A. No, I never did; they both of them went with me into <placeName id="t18050918-9-crimeloc44">Stepney fields</placeName>

               <p>Q. Where was Ferguson at the time, while Read was easing himself? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who that man was that gave you a knock on the head, and knocked you down? - A. I cannot know.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Ferguson at that time? - A. He was in the fields easing himself; the man that knocked me down said, you b - r what do you do in these green fields; he said, strip; I said, for what shall I strip; Read and Ferguson left me for about two or three minutes before I was knocked down; the man that knocked me down took every thing from me, and left me the same as I was born of my mother; he told me to take my clothes off; I told him I would not; a man took hold of me, and took my clothes off.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a second man that came up? - A. I cannot know that, I think it was the man with the black hair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the man that knocked you down? - A. No, I did not; I had not so much time.</p>
               <p>Q. If you did not see him, and had not time to look at him, what reason have you to think it was the man in the black hair? - A. That is the man that was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of him at the time you were knocked down, so as to recollect he was with the man? - A. No, I was senseless.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you senseless? - A. I cannot say, I was knocked down as a butcher knocks down an ox.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect their taking your jacket off? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know whether there was more than one man - did you observe or see any thing at the time? - A. I saw nothing more than two men that were with him at the time; they took all my clothes off, and ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. After your clothes were taken off, and you were stripped, did you see any body go away? - A. I was almost out of my senses; they left me in the water in the ditch; I did not see who ran away, I got up, and went to the half-way house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180007"/>Q. What things were taken from you? - A. A jacket, a waistcoat, a shirt, a pair of trowsers, shoes, stockings, and hat, my protection box, with my protection in it, three guineas and a half in gold, and a silver watch; I have seen my shirt, jacket, and trowsers, since, at the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you drunk or sober? - A. I was as sober as I am now; I had only a pot of beer the whole day, and in the half-way house they forced me to have some gin, but I threw it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember whether it was dark or light? - A. After I was stripped in the fields it was moon-light, it was then about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You were at two public-houses - remember what you said this moment, you were as sober as you are now; you were in the public-house all day? - A. Yes, I was; I was waiting for a gentleman to put my name down.</p>
               <p>Q. You drank no more than a pot of beer; I ask you whether you were not the person that paid for the gin? - A. Yes; I did not drink any of the gin, I threw it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you buy gin for the purpose of throwing it away; why, if you had not liked to have drank it, your messmates would have liked it? - A. They are no messmates of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a sailor, and they are sailors; were not you three and a great many more hired to go to Southampton to bring up a ship into the river? - A. There were some people there that I knew, but not these two men.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that they were to be messmates with you when you got to Southampton? - A. Yes, that I was told; they put their names down as well as me.</p>
               <p>Q. On the next day these two men were found at the public-house? - A. No, it was on the third day; they were found at the sign of the Amsterdam Arms.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the house to which you regularly put up, all of you, to go to Southampton? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore these men going there were sure to be found by you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Since you have been robbed, you have been in company with Mr. Rogers; had you any conversation with him about the two prisoners? - A No, he called me out of my house, and took me to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Rogers say to you he would shew you the two men that robbed you? - A. No; he asked me if I should know them when I saw their faces.</p>
               <p>Q.Nothing was found belonging to you upon either of the prisoners? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Did not you say at the office that the man that knocked you down had a white jacket on? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never got your watch again? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the prisoners were searched? - A. Yes, and Read took a knife out of his pocket, and said, d - n my soul, I will cut that b - r's throat.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever heard any thing about a reward - did not Mr. Rogers tell you there would be a reward of forty pounds, in case you convicted these men? - A. Mr. Rogers told me nothing; I do not know there is a forty pounds reward.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You say the man that knocked you down had a white jacket on - did you see that man that knocked you down? - A. Yes, that is the man with the black hair, Ferguson.</p>
               <p>Q. What coloured jacket had he on? - A. A white looking jacket.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you had been drinking with the prisoners at the public-house, had you observed what coloured jacket Ferguson had on? - A. He had a blue jacket on then, and when he returned after he had left me, he had a white one.</p>
               <p>Q. That is your conjecture? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you see either of the two prisoners? - A. On Saturday night, the 10th of August, between nine and ten o'clock; I was going to Mr. Curtis's, the Bee Hive, in Nightingale-lane, to look after a young man; I saw the two prisoners there drinking together.</p>

             sworn. I am beadle of Queenhithe ward: On Saturday, the 3d of August, I went to Mrs. Richards's at one o'clock at noon to take charge of the prisoner; the moment I looked at the prisoner she dropped two caps out of her right hand pocket; I searched the pocket and found one cap in it, I asked the prosecutrix if that was her property; her reply was, she would swear to it; she then shewed me the caps and the cloak which the prisoner had given up: I asked the prosecutrix if she had lost any thing else; she went up stairs to look; when she returned she said she had a seven-shilling piece in her possession up stairs, and it was gone: I told the prisoner I must search her further; she said, I will not give you the trouble, and she pulled out a seven-shilling piece folded up in a piece of paper. I produce the articles. (The articles identified by the prosecutrix.)</p>

Having a suspicion that he stole the book, I sent for Mr. Rowe, while he was in at the pawnbroker's; Mr.

               <p>Q. What book is it? - A. It is the History of the Church and State of Scotland. I produce the book. (The book identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

He came and asked for a check for Mr. Littledale, and said that he was at a neighbouring coffee-house; I was going to give him a bundle of checks, they contain about twenty-one in number; he said, he did not want that, but merely a single check, which I gave him; he then went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him again? - A. Some little time afterwards, on the same day, a person, whom I believe to be the same, came back, and that person I believe to be the prisoner, came back, and said he had made a mistake, that Mr. Littledale wanted a bundle of checks; we have two sorts of checks, one that is in slips, and one that is in sheets; I gave him two of the sheets.</p>
               <p>Q. Which contained how many checks? - A. I do not know, several; they should and generally do contain about an hundred, but they sometimes fall short; I gave him two sheets, and then he went away.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you look at it? - A. I did; as soon as I saw it, I suspected the hand-writing of the check.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the signature, or the body? - A. The signature; I asked him who he received it from, he said Mr. Foy.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You suspected the signature? - A. Yes; I then took and compared this check, which was in my hand, with some others in the house which we had paid, I was then satisfied it was a forgery.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. In point of fact, that was the man that gave you the check? - A. Yes, he went out, and he returned with the prisoner in about a quarter of an hour; the check I gave to Mr. Watson.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did Mr. Watson afterwards return it to you? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same check, that Mr. Watson<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180011"/>returned to you, that you received from the porter? - A. I have no doubt of it, I marked it.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the person that presented the check and the prisoner came in afterwards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In what distance of time? - A. In about fifteen minutes afterwards the porter and the prisoner came in, they then went into the back office, and what past then was not in my hearing, and Mr. Watson went with the porter and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. You still remain of the opinion, as you were at first, that is not the hand-writing of Mr. Littledale? - A.Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you acquainted with the hand-writing of Messrs. Littledale and Foy? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen them write? - A. Yes, frequently</p>
               <p>Q. You having an opportunity of knowing both their hand-writing, having seen them write frequently, are you of opinion that it is not the handwriting of either Mr. Littledale or Mr. Foy? - A. I am perfectly of the opinion that it is not the hand-writing of either.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You say you are perfectly satisfied that it is not his hand-writing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not perfectly satisfied at first that it was not their hand-writing? - A. Yes I was perfectly sure, else I should have paid it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say that you compared it with other checks? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why should you have compared it if you were of the opinion before that it was not their hand-writing? - A There was no doubt in my own mind when I compared it.</p>
               <p>Q. One would think when a man was satisfied he would not have compared it - do you mean to say you were perfectly satisfied when you first saw it? - A. Yes, I would not have paid it if I was not perfectly satisfied.</p>
               <p>Q. You say this check was out of your hands, did you mark it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you marked it after you got it from Mr. Watson? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You received it back from Mr. Watson, and you marked it then? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q.Then after Mr. Watson tendered it you, in order that you should know it at a future time, you put a mark on it, you put no mark on it before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you undertake to swear to it unless you had marked it before, you only know that Mr. Watson told you it was the same check? - A. I will swear that I am perfectly satisfied in my own mind that it is the same check.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You have said that you were quite satisfied that the signature of that check was not the hand-writing of Littledale and Foy - are there any other persons in that house authorised to sign checks? - A. No.</p>
               <p>JOHN WATSON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. Q. You are partner in the house of Littledale and Co. I find, Mr. Watson? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect Mr. Liall putting into your hand a draft that he received from the porter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards returned it to Mr. Liall? - A. Yes, in about twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the draft that you returned to him was, to your knowledge, the same that you received from him? - A. Yes, I am sure it was; it was never out of my sight till I returned it to him to make a mark on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the hand-writing of Messrs. Foy and Littledale? - A. I do. (The note handed to the witness.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the hand-writing of either of them? - A. It is not the hand-writing of either of them, to the best of my belief.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not authorised to pay to any other signature in their name than their own? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was he running? - A. Running up Cornhill; he was in the street, I ran after him, and cried out stop him; he turned round, and came up to me; he asked me what I meant by calling after him; I asked him what he meant by running away; he said, he was going to Bishopsgate-street; I said, I would go with him to Bishopsgate-street; when we came to Bishopsgate-street, I asked him where he was going; he said, to Winchester-street; I told him that was not his way to Winchester-street; then I told him if he did not submit to go with me to the banking-house, that I should call for assistance; then I laid hold of his arm, and brought him to the banking-house, and then I delivered him into the hands of the gentlemen of the banking-house.</p>

               <p>Q. And you have no doubt of the person that came out of the coffee-house, and told you the gentleman was writing a letter, was the same person you brought back to the banking-house - is that so? - A. Yes.</p>

No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are one of the Marshals of this City? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sent for in June last to the banking-house of Messrs. Sikes, Snaith, and Co.? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the day did you go to Messrs. Sikes, Snaith, and Co.? - A. About three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the prisoner there? - A. I did, in the back accompting-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner given to you in charge? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what conversation took place between the prisoner and any body you heard? -</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Did you make him any promise? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Nalder. Mr. Watson informed me, in the presence of the prisoner, that the young man, meaning the prisoner, had been guilty of a forgery; he told me to stay a little while, for he had sent for one of his partners who had signed the check; I remained there for some little space of time, and presently the gentleman who is in Court came.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Littledale then presently came? - A. Yes; and at the time the conversation took place between Mr. Littledale and Mr. Watson, the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180013"/>was not present; Mr. Watson came back to me in the presence of the prisoner, and said that I must take him into custody, and said that he was satisfied that he was guilty of the forgery; I immediately went to search him, and in his pocket I found these checks.</p>
               <p>Q. How many sheets are there? - A. Here are two, (they are termed quires,) and one half sheet; they appear to be checks of Messrs. Snaith, Sikes, and Co. I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what he had done with the other checks? - A. He told me that Wilmott had the other checks, and he was the person who had drawn the draft.</p>
               <p>Q. That was before you found them on him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. He told you before the search that Wilmott had the checks? - A. He did so.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to state that Wilmott had the checks? - A. Mr. Watson asked him what became of the other checks.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. And then afterwards you searched and found the checks which you now produce? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which he said Wilmott had? - A. Yes, he said Wilmott had the rest of the checks, and in the origin of the business I understood from him that he had the draft in question from a man of the name of Wilmott.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. You say that he stated to you, or that you understood, that he had the check from a person of the name of Wilmott? - A. He did, when I asked him the question how he came by the checks, he repeated that he had the checks in question of a man of the name of Wilmott.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Elliott.) Q. Do they appear to be checks from your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe them to be the same checks that you gave to the prisoner? - A. I delivered some checks of the same description as these to the prisoner, I believe; they seem to be the same quantity of checks, I gave him two quires.</p>
               <p>Q. How many are there? - A. Here seems to be two quires, excepting the half sheet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. (To Mr. Watson.) Q. What conversation had you with the prisoner respecting the check? - A. When the porter came back with the prisoner, I desired them both to walk into the back accompting-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you say it would be better for him to tell? - A. I said nothing at all about it; I then asked the prisoner where he had got that check; he said he had got it from Mr. Foy, who was at John's coffee-house; I thought it right to send a person immediately to John's coffee-house to see; he did not appear to be there, and after some time I sent to Mr. Littledale to satisfy myself; I questioned the prisoner again; he then said he had it of a Mr. Wilmott, or some name like that, who lived in Goodman's fields; I then enquired of him about the quires of checks that were supposed he had taken in the morning; he said he had given those to Mr. Wilmott; the City-marshal found them, as he has stated.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called ten witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Do you live near the prosecutor? - A. Almost opposite: On the 28th of July, between six and seven o'clock, I was going up stairs, I looked out of the window, I saw two men at the gate trying to open it, and one said to the other, cannot you open it, and the other presently said, hang it, it is broke; in about ten minutes after I looked through the window again, I saw the prisoner at the bar, (he was one of the two men I had seen before,) he was then by himself, leaning on his arm, looking over his left shoulder, at the one pair of stairs window in Nichols's house; the window was open, and when he saw me he drew back; I made no alarm, not knowing the family were out. About four o'clock I was going for a pint of beer, I saw the prisoner at the bar and another man walking together up and down the street before Nichols's gate; I saw them as I went for the beer, and as I came back.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner a person that you had ever seen before? - A. No, I never saw him before that day; I am positive I saw him in the house, and I am positive that he is the person I saw walking with the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Nichols when he came home, or did you afterwards see the gate open? - A. I saw a crowd about the house, and the alarm was given that the house had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see the prisoner again? - A. On the next day, when he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. At the first time you saw, or you supposed you saw, the prisoner, his back was towards you - was it not? - A. Yes, his back was towards me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was that when you were going for the beer? - A. The first time I saw him was when I was going for the beer, I saw his face then perfectly, that was about four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. When you saw him at the gate, his back was towards you? - A. Yes, but he turned his face about.</p>
               <p>Q. To give you an opportunity of knowing him - have you heard any thing like a reward, and that you will be entitled to a share if this person is convicted? - A. No, I never heard of a reward.</p>

Yes, I passed it between five and six in the afternoon; I spoke to Mrs. Nichols and her husband before they went out. In the course of an hour I passed the house again, I saw then two young men standing at the gate, one something shorter than the other, they were trying to open the padlock at the gate.</p>

In the evening I went to the Belvidere, there I saw the prisoner at the bar in the bowling-green, and a person of the name of Gale was with him; Goodall, who is a witness, said, that is the man I saw in the street; when he saw me, he walked out, and when he got to a turning that goes to White Conduit House, he walked as fast as he could, and seeing Stanton come up to me, he ran into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180015"/>fields; we pursued, and took him; Stanton knows no more than I do.</p>

               <p>Q. Had there been any appointment by Mr. Breeze to meet you on Sunday, the 28th of July? - A. Mr. Breeze said he would call on me that day: I met him in West-street, where I live, near three o'clock; when I met him I told him to go to the George, that Nelson was there; I went there in about a quarter of an hour afterwards, when I believe it was near a quarter after three: I found Nelson sitting there, Breeze, and his son; I staid there with Nelson till half after six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did Breeze stay? - A. Till near about five o'clock, they went away, leaving me and Nelson there.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

On the 8th of August I went out at one o'clock, and I did not return till nine o'clock at night, and when I came home I found my door double-locked, as I left it; but the ceiling was broken before and behind; I did not see it that night, I went to bed and slept until the Hatton-garden officers came and awoke me; they told me to get up and look if there was any thing amiss; I did, and found my chest half open, the box broken, and nothing in it but a parcel of bad halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you left in the chest? - A. There were ten bundles, with two pounds in each bundle, in silver and copper; the officers told me to dress myself and get up, they had got them snug enough. I had seen my chest on the 8th of August, the very instant I had dressed myself, just before I went out, because there were four shillings in the corner of it which I took out and locked the chest again, and all the money was there then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the parcels in it? - A. Yes, and counted them. They had cut the string of my keys and kept two of them; every week I lost something or other since they lodged with me, which has been a quarter of a year, and

               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing else? - A. I lost a shawl that I had bought in Oxford-road, from the head of my bed, and they took a night-cap with my name on it and stop thief in full length.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you found any of your things again? A. Only the money which is here (they have spent the rest), the shawl, and the cap, they were at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned home were any of the prisoners at your house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the four persons you have described lodgers at your house at that time? - A. Yes, they were, and they were lodgers off and on for this half-year.</p>

               <p>Q. How many lodgers had you in the house besides these? - A. No person at all in my apartments but these.</p>
               <p>Q. How many apartments have you? - A. I have a back and a front room.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no more than two rooms? - A. These were particular to myself; they used to sleep in the front room, all four in two beds.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did Price sleep? - A. He rented a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180017"/>little room of me, and he pretended he had lost the key; his room was within a yard and a half of my place.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it adjoining the front room? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you more than these three rooms? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many rooms had you altogether? - A. I have nine or ten both large and small; there is a room here and a room there, in a gallery over stables in a coach-yard, they broke through the ceiling of my chamber to get into my room.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you how many lodgers you had there at that time in the other apartments, besides these five? - A. They were all out; I had locked the rooms up; they walk out by day and come home at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any hope of getting any reward by indicting as you have done? - A. I am both stupid and ignorant.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to see how far this stupidity and ignorance goes. - Have you not indicted them as you have done that you might get a reward? - A. I do not know whether I would or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not hope you would? - A. I hope in God I would.</p>
               <p>Q. How much do you hope you would get? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You can reckon how much seven times forty would amount to: You know seven times forty pounds would amount to a great deal of money? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you hope to get that? - A. That lies to the gentlemen, but not to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you hope to get forty pounds a-piece for all the seven? - A. No, no: I would not wish to get it.</p>
               <p>Q. You just now said you hoped in God you would? - A. I beg your pardon, I thought it was my own money.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, had not you the hope of getting forty pounds a-piece? - A. I would not wish it.</p>
               <p>Q.You would not take it if it was offered you? - A.These are cross questions to pass to an ignorant old woman.</p>

In consequence of this information, I went to No. 7, West-street, Seven-dials, and I there saw the property which is stated in the indictment, and which is my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say you have lost these from your premises? - A. I have no doubt of it, because there are few in the trade, and each in the trade have their own patterns, and the person who makes the patterns is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner? - A. He has lived with me six years; he is a servant of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What wages did you give him? - A. He could earn in six days 3 l. 9 s. his wife was an apprentice to me, and is a most deserving woman; she is in the habit of earning about a guinea a week.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. These are of a particular sort: Do not you know Mr. Newton; does he not use the same patterns? - A. There are one or two patterns that he may use, but I have no doubt of the whole of it being my property.</p>
               <p>- DAVIS sworn. - My husband is a brass-founder, No 7, West-street, Seven-dials. On the 15th of August last, about ten in the morning, the prisoner at the bar brought some brass to sell as old brass, I weighed the brass, it weighed eighteen pounds and a half, it came to one pound and a half-penny: I called Mr. Saunders from the work-shop to give me a one-pound note, and he gave me a two-pound note; I went out to get change, and Mr. Saunders saw the brass laying in the shop, and he supposed it to be stolen; when I came in, I gave the prisoner a one-pound note; Mr. Saunders asked the prisoner to let him indorse it, and directly Mr. Davis came in. This is the brass, and I am sure the prisoner is the man that brought it.</p>

I have seen them at the Distillers Arms public-house just facing where I live; I saw Perkins put his hand into the gentleman's right hand pocket, and take out his handkerchief; Thompson was along with him at the time; when Perkins had taken the gentleman's handkerchief out of his pocket, he put it in his bosom, and they both ran away down St. John's-court into Chick-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure these are the two men? - A. Yes, I am certain of it, and I informed the gentleman of it; as I was going home I saw Thompson go down Field-lane; he went into a shop, and offered the handkerchief for sale.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer of Hatton-garden: On the 8th of August, from information, I went to the Distillers Arms, Saffron-hill; the prisoners were pointed out to me; I did not find any thing on them; when I handcuffed them, they said, if ever they got their liberty, they would take away the boy's life.</p>
               <p>Perkins's defence. I belong to the Tower-hamlets; I had just come from my regiment, and finding nobody at home I went up to the Distillers Arms to get a pint of beer; the boy first pointed out another man; I was then in the yard, and the boy pointed out me afterwards, and said, that is him.</p>
               <p>White. He made his escape through the back window into the privy when he saw us.</p>
               <p>Thompson's defence. I am totally innocent of the crime; I am very well informed that Mr. White bribed the boy, and promised to buy him a hat if he would swear the same at the Old-Bailey; he gave him sixpence then.</p>
               <p>White. I gave him sixpence to buy him some bread and cheese; the boy was hungry, and had no money: I never promised him any thing.</p>

               <p>- HAYCOCK sworn. - I am a carpenter: On Monday night, the 8th of July, I was out for the purpose of looking after depredators; on Tuesday morning, near two o'clock, we met this man with these four faggots on his back tied up with a cord of his own.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from Mr. Lucas's farm? - A. Not quite half a mile; I stopped him till seven or eight more came up of our party, and then we took them away from him, and hid them till the morning; we knew the man perfectly well, so we set him at liberty; we asked him where he had them from; he said he had them from Muswell-hill.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. This man has a wife, and how many children? - A. A great number; he lives about a hundred yards from the spot where I took him. (The faggots produced and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. Q. You are house surgeon of St. Bartholomew's hospital? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember on the 11th of September, this month, a person being brought in there to be examined by you? - A. On the 12th of September, between twelve and one o'clock in the morning, when I was called to the man, he was dead; he had a great many bruises upon his face, and a small wound on the left side of his head, and a little cut on his upper lip.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you open the head? - A. I did; there was nothing unusual in the appearance of the head; I examined his head, belly, chest, and neck.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you apprehend was the cause of his death? - A. I cannot speak positively; I should suppose he died from these blows.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the blows occasion his death? - A.I cannot say; people sometimes immediately die after receiving blows, and nothing is to be seen on the body but the blows.</p>
               <p>Q. Would he have died otherwise, if he had not received these blows? - A. I cannot take upon me to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you more particularly describe the effect of the blows? - A. The bruises were no more than a person might or do get in boxing; I cannot speak of what they were capable of producing; they might produce nothing in some persons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. We understand from you, sir, that you found some bruises on the deceased? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any of those bruises of that nature to produce death? - A. That is a very difficult question for me to answer, yes or no.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. A man shoved down might be under some particular circumstance so affected as to occasion death? - A. Truly.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether these bruises would ordinarily occasion a man's death? - A. I cannot tell with what violence these blows might have been struck.</p>
               <p>Q. I mean by those appearances that were to be seen? - A. They appeared like nothing but common bruises; I feel it difficult to answer positively, I cannot say positively what was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Q. When you find a wound, you are able to state some connection between that wound and the cause of death? - A. Not always, most commonly we are.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these bruises of the nature likely to produce death? - A. One was from a blow on the head.</p>
               <p>Q. A blow on the head might or might not produce death? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot state whether they did or not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not cases occur of sudden death, where, upon examination of the body, you cannot find out the cause? - A. Certainly.</p>

On the 17th of August in the forenoon, between eleven and twelve o'clock, he came to our shop and offered six desert-spoons to pledge; he asked 18 s. on them; I was positive he had stole them, and looked at them some time; the prisoner said, if you do not like them, give me them back and take my watch; I told him that I should not do that, I suspected that he had come dishonestly by them: he hesitated for some time, and then he told me they were his master's, and that he was going to lay the money out for the use of his master: I told him I knew his master had not authorised him to do any such thing: at last he told me Mr. Taunton was his master: I sent to his master. I produce the spoons; they are worth two guineas as old silver. (The spoons identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             is bleeding! I saw Mrs. Ryan with the poker in her hand; I catched Ryan by the arm, and wrenched the poker from her; I went between them and lifted them both up; they scuffled together, and went towards the door; Ryan took hold of a quart bottle and went behind the door and swore she would be the death of her.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the bottle; did you take it out of her hands? - A. No, another woman took it out of her hands; I took hold of the deceased, turned her out at the door, and put her in her own apartment, and Ryan went down stairs with the child in her arms.</p>
               <p>Q. The deceased was well enough to go up stairs? - A. Yes, she was, and she came down stairs, and pushed the door open to go after Ryan: I washed the deceased, and cut the hair from the wound, and put her to bed. The next morning she went to work as usual.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that did she die? - A. In about six weeks afterwards all but one day.</p>
               <p>Q. How was she between the scuffling-time and the time of her death? - A. She complained about her head: I did not take particular notice of her, because she came home rather in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times had she been in liquor between the time of the scuffle and the time of her death? - A. I cannot tell; I saw her once or twice.</p>

               <p>Q. She used to drink a good deal, I understand? - A. She got drunk once or twice after, I understand.</p>

             sworn. - I am surgeon to St. Bartholomew's hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you inspect this woman at the time of her death? - A. I did; I opened the head; I found an abscess on the left side of the brain.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the occasion of her death? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that owing to the blow? - A. I firmly believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. Her getting drunk afterwards might contribute to it? - A. I should suppose so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. It is impossible for you to say, from the distance of time, that she died merely from the blows? - A. No, it is not impossible, because the wound had not healed when she was brought into the hospital, and it evidently appeared there was mischief done to the head.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose a person got intoxicated, might not that contribute to it? - A. It might, or it might not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. That woman there I asked to take the deceased from my throat, which she did, and turned the deceased out of the room, and she said she would have no murder done in her room. I came down stairs after that, and she followed me down and met me in the passage: there is a woman can prove that she told me to put my child out of my arms: I said no: I was going to scour pots at a gentleman's house, I was afraid something would happen to me; I did not wish to have any more to do with her.</p>

            , of Birchin-lane. This is the paper that was presented to me for payment on the 9th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom was that presented? - A. I cannot say by whom; the shop was full of people at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say the prisoner was the person that presented the draft to you; but that person, whoever he was that presented that draft to you, did he remain some time in the shop? - A. Near a quarter of an hour, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180025"/>Q. When that was presented to you what did you first do? - A. I suspected it not to be Mr. Blake's writing, I requested Mr. Carter to go to Mr. Blake, in Change-alley, for the purpose of enquiring.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Blake keep cash in your house? - A. Yes; he had cash in our house at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Carter went what became of the draft you have now in your hands? - A. I do not recollect positively about that.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with the hand writing of Mr. Blake? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that paper whether any on the whole of it is his hand-writing? - A. I do not think any part of it is.</p>
               <p>Q. You are familiar with his hand-writing? - A. Yes, being a customer to our house some years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. What did you do with the cheque? - A. I put my initials and the day of the month that afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put it when Mr. Carter went to Mr. Blake? - A. If I did not give it to Mr. Carter, I kept it in my own possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Or perhaps you laid it down? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say whether you gave it to him or no? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember being applied to by the last witness on the 9th of July, in the afternoon of that day? - A. I recollect it very well: Mr. Halifax gave me the draft, which I took in my hand: I went to Mr. Blake; I found him in his shop; he returned with me to the banking-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Just look at that paper writing, and tell me whether that is the same that he delivered over to you? - Q. This is the same piece of paper that Mr. Halifax delivered over to me: when I got back to the banking-house with Mr. Blake, after I turned round the end of the counter, Mr. Blake asked me, who was the man? He immediately went towards the door to go out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at that time in the shop? - A. The man whom Mr. Halifax pointed out to me as the man that presented the draft was in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say whether that was the prisoner at the bar? - A. I cannot positively swear, I only took a superficial look at him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the man do that Mr. Halifax pointed out to you? - A. As Mr. Blake spoke, he turned round and made towards the door and went out; he seemed to brush out very briskly: I did not see the person again till I was summoned before the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Mr. Blake after that? - A. He went after the person that I pointed out, who presented the draft, immediately, crying out stop thief! I remained in the banking-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the person you took the prisoner at the bar? - A. I have not seen him since I took him; I brought him into Birchin-lane, and delivered him to Mr. Blake.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MELLISH, Esq. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. I was going from Cornhill up Birchin-lane, and when I had got about half way from Cornhill, I heard a cry of stop thief behind, and a man came running the same side of the way I was, and ran up an alley which leads into George-yard; at that time another man was running after him, and he got into the alley rather before me; I got time enough into George-yard to observe both the men running, and to see the last man take the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the last witness? - A. I cannot say it is the last witness, I have not seen him since; I am positive it was the same man that was taken in George-yard that was running in Birchin-lane; the person that was taken in George-yard is the prisoner at the bar, I saw him taken, and I saw him running in Birchin-lane; I only lost sight of him just turning the corner.</p>

               <p>Q.Was your house broke open in February, 1804? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the last person in the house before your wife went to chapel? - A. I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>Q. What clothes? - A. My own wearing apparel.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they? - A. Two cotton gowns, two calimanco skirts, two cotton skirts, twelve pair of cotton stockings, two flannel petticoats, eight linen shirts, a silk handkerchief, a five-pound Bank note, and two pair of shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were packing them in the chest? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing at all about these things? - A. Yes; I took thirty one-pound notes out of a pair of shoes, and put them in my pocket; she said, it would be safer to leave them in the chest, but I put them in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. She went out before you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you communicated to her that you were going to chapel that evening? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that on Sunday? - A. No, on Monday.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lock your chest when you went away? - A. No, I did not, I left it unlocked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she see that you left it unlocked? - A. She did; she went away, and I did not see any more of her till I came out of my own house to go to chapel; then I went into her house to see what o'clock it was, and it was seven; when I went in, they would have me stop, and I stopped a quarter of an hour, and then I went out to chapel.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. It was perfectly dark then, was it not? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you desire them to look after your house? - A. I did; I said I was going to chapel, and I would be very much obliged to them to answer the door if any body knocked.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the husband at home at this time? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from your house to the chapel? - A. It is about three minutes walk; the chapel is in Grey Eagle-street, Spitalfields.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you return from chapel? - A. I returned from chapel a little after eight o'clock; I went to my own house first after I came from chapel, and found my outer door open.</p>
               <p>Q. Had that door been shut by you when you went to chapel? - A. Yes; I locked both the locks, and when I came back again it was wide open; I went into my house, and looked into my chest, and it was empty; then I sent for my husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the prisoner afterwards? - A. I sent for my husband that minute, and he, as soon as he came in, ran to the prisoners' house, but he could not find them; they came to my husband afterwards to see what had happened, my husband sent for them; they seemed to be very sorry, as though they knew nothing about it; the girl can tell you more than I can what they said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell them what you had lost? - A. Yes; I went and shewed them the chest, the same chest that I had put the things in, in the presence of the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen any property since, and when? - A. I did not see any thing till I saw it with a search-warrant on the 12th of August; I had information; I got a warrant, and had some things produced.</p>
               <p>Q. What was produced to you on the 12th of August? - A. On the 13th, a gown that had been dyed, and a shirt of my husband's, a petticoat, and a calimanco skirt; the rest were found at the pawnbroker's.</p>

               <p>Q. What was found at the pawnbroker's, were they your property? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bolland. Q. You, I believe,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180028"/>was in the habit of intimacy with the prisoner at the bar, were you not? - A. She came backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Q. As a friend she came to your house, and when she saw you put the thirty one-pound notes into your pocket, she very kindly observed to you, that you had better put these notes in the chest than take them out with you in the night to Spitalfields? - A.

               <p>Q. You did not, I believe, see these articles, did you? - A. Never; I know no more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You say you never saw the articles at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live yourself? - A. In Castle-street, Whitechapel, No. 6; I go out to cleaning, and work at tailoring.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw the prisoner but once before? - A. No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. This was in the beginning of October last? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that you first had information that you must come here? - A. I never knew any thing about it till yesterday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been in Newgate to the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Never? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never seen her since she was confined in any place? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were subpoenaed to come here? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a good while ago? - A. Yes, last October, I lived with Mrs. Jones, and I lived with her all the time she was sick; she died a week before Whitsuntide last.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore there was from October down to the present time, and you recollect all about buying the duplicates? - A. I remember the words very well, Mrs. Taylor asked if it was her own property; she said, that the person that sold the duplicates was in distress, her husband was pressed, she had three small children.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Jones is unfortunately dead? - A. She is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Q. You are very certain it was Mrs. Taylor that bought them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>- Cox sworn. - Examined by Mr. Bolland. Q. You know Mrs. Taylor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever work for her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you look at a shirt that lies there - did she ever send you that shirt, and when, to mend? - A. Mrs. Upton did it, but it was done at my house; there was just a piece of calico run across the back.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the patch in the front of the shirt under the left shoulder, did Mrs. Upton, in your presence, put in that patch? - A. I cannot say to that; nothing but the sleeves and the bits on the shoulder were not felled on the inside; they are not new neck-bits, but old neck-bits.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Upton put in these old neck-bits? - A. They were in before; Mrs Upton put in new shoulder-straps and new wristbands, as near as I can guess, about six months ago; Mrs. Upton will be a better judge than me about the time.</p>
               <p>- UPTON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Bolland. Q. You know the last witness, Mrs. Cox? - A. Yes, she employed me to work for her.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the shoulder strap, do you remember working at that shirt? - A. Yes, I was ordered to put new neck-bits, but I did not; I put new shoulder-straps, collar, and wristbands.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago? - A. About six months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the patch under the left arm? - - A. There is no felling, and I did not fell it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the patch - did you put in that patch on that shirt? - A. I did, I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any patch there before you put it on? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. That you swear positively? - A. Yes, I should be sorry to speak any untruth; there was no patch there before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How lately had you been applied to to speak to this fact - have you seen the prisoner since she has been in custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where? - A. Not in Newgate; I saw her in this yard, in the underneath place.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you talked about these things, did not you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. No conversation with the prisoner, nor any one else? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Never talked about the shirt to no one? - A. No, only I was asked by Mrs. Cox; she came to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180031"/>my daughter when they were in Hog-lane, and asked me to go, but I was not examined.</p>
               <p>Q. You were asked whether there was a patch under the left shoulder - you did not know before my learned friend put the question to you what you were come to prove? - A. No, I mended the shirt, and made the other about a week afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know that you were come to prove that there was a patch under the left shoulder - you did not expect to be asked any thing about that? - A.Nothing at all; I expected to be asked whether I knew the shirt, and this is positively the shirt that I mended for Mrs. Taylor.</p>
               <p>Q. This is about six months ago? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And this is an old shirt - had you ever mended any other shirt for Mrs. Taylor? - A. Never; was an old shirt.</p>
               <p>Q.Had it any other patch about it? - A. I had the same patches that it has now, all but that just under the left shoulder; I put new wristbands in these sleeves, and I was ordered to put in new neck-bits, I would not, I thought it was not necessary.</p>
               <p>Q.Where do you live? - A. No. 8, George's-court; I live with my son and daughter, I have a trifle coming in, about eight shillings a month.</p>
               <p>Q.What is your son? - A. He is a master jeweller, and keeps three apprentices.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you have had no conversation with any body but with Mrs. Cox? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.When you were first applied to to give evidence on behalf of the prisoner, you refused to come? - A. Yes, I refused to come; my son and daughter were not willing that I should come, they thought it was such a mean thing.</p>
               <p>The prisoners called one witness, who gave them a good character.</p>

Yes, in High-street, Bloomsbury: On the 27th of July, I was walking down Chancery-lane, about six o'clock in the afternoon, I overtook the prisoner at the bar, in company with two other persons, near the middle of <placeName id="t18050918-36-crimeloc189">Chancery-lane, by Cursitor-street</placeName>

On looking back, I saw the prisoner at the bar, who had just passed walking from me, in a different direction to which I was then going; he was walking behind me, about three or four steps from me; I called out stop thief, and I called out again, and he rather mended his pace, and then ran away; I pursued him; he ran up Duke's-court into Cursitor-street, from thence into Castle-street; I got up to him about the middle of that street, he was stopped there by some person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him at all? - A. I lost sight of him in Cursitor-street; I saw him the whole of Duke's-court and Chancery-lane.</p>

               <p>Q. You pursued him into Cursitor-street and Castle-street, and he was stopped by a person there before you got up to him? - A. Yes, I lost sight of him in Cursitor-street, in consequence of the number of people that were running after him; immediately upon my coming up to him, there was some one gave me the handkerchief, and the prisoner immediately went down on his knees, and begged my pardon, and hoped I would forgive him, and he repeated it several times, in a very suppliant manner, that he hoped I would forgive him, as I had regained my property; I told him I could not think of doing that, in consequence of his robbing at that time of the day, at six o'clock in the afternoon; we took him into Norwich-court, leading into Fetter-lane, there he made a great attempt to get away, and afterwards he made another attempt.</p>
               <p>Q. In your way to Hatton-garden from Fetter-lane, he made two attempts to get away? - A. He did, and in turning into Hatton-garden particularly he made an attempt to get away; I took him into Hatton-garden, and there I left him in custody of the Police officers, and the handkerchief I left in the custody of Stanton, one of the officers.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there were three persons walking together, of whom the prisoner was one? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know at the time you saw the three persons that you had got the handkerchief in your pocket? - A. I have no doubt of it, I felt for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any body at your pocket? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not aware of your loss till somebody called out? - A. I was wholly unconscious of it; they called out, there were several voices.</p>
               <p>Q. What was become of the other two persons at that time? - A. I do not know; in consequence of my running after him I lost sight of them.</p>
               <p>Q. In turning about after you were informed you were robbed, were the other two persons with him? - A. No, he was alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person they pointed out when they called out you had been robbed, did they point to the prisoner? - A. Yes, they pointed to the prisoner at the bar as the person that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. When they pointed him out to you the other two persons were not with him, were they? - A. No, they were not then.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do not know which of the three persons it might be that took the handkerchief from your pocket? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You only know that the prisoner is the man by the persons that apprized you of it that he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180032"/>the thief? - A. Yes, I recollected the moment that I looked back, that it was the man that I had just passed, in company with two others.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I ask him, whether he saw me take the handkerchief out of his pocket, or whether he found it on me? - A. The moment he was stopped in Castle-street, he threw the handkerchief away; here is a gentleman who saw him do it.</p>

I live with my father, No. 31, Castle-street, Holborn; on the 27th of July, about six o'clock in the afternoon, as I was looking out of the front room of my father's house, I heard a cry of stop thief, and on my looking out of the window, I saw the prisoner running up the street closely pursued; when he arrived at the house No. 4, nearly opposite to ours, he threw a handkerchief over the rails that covered the kitchen windows of the house; I think he took it from his bosom, or a side-pocket, I cannot tell which; I came out into the street and saw him collared by a great many persons who were round about him, I saw him go on his knees, and heard him ask Mr. Marshall to forgive him, as he had got his property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body pick up the handkerchief? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look to the rails to see whether the handkerchief was there? - A. I saw it in his hand when he threw it away, Mr. Marshall's handkerchief is a red and yellow handkerchief; I went to Hatton-garden Office with Mr. Marshall when he was in custody, we walked behind him, and sometimes before him; I saw him make a desperate attempt to get free, and there appeared to be some companions of his in Holborn, who endeavoured to rescue him; the prisoner hung back and made the people lift him and carry him a little way, at last he walked after they pushed him along.</p>

               <p>Q.(To prosecutor.) Is that handkerchief your's? - A. It is my handkerchief, there are my initials upon it, I. M. and this is the handkerchief that was returned to me in Castle-street.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the worth of it now? - A. I suppose four shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was drinking in a public-house in Sweet's-alley, on the day this affair happened; I was very much intoxicated, and when I was coming down Chancery-lane, there was no one with me but a young woman whom I met coming out of the public-house, and when I was coming down Chancery-lane I heard a singing out stop thief, and several persons ran before I ran, to the amount of twenty or more; on my running down Cursitor-street, I stumbled, and the handkerchief was six doors a-head from where I fell down, and when I got up again, Mr. Marshall swore that I was the person that picked his pocket; I know no more of the handkerchief than any gentleman in Court knows.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time this supposed theft was committed, were they sitting on each side of the prosecutor? - Yes, and the prosecutor fell asleep; I first met with them at the Ivy-house, I called in there for a pint of beer, and they wanted me to make up the side; I agreed to make one of them; after eight o'clock, they said they would go to Mr. Bell's, the Unicorn, and have a pot of beer; going along Ivy-lane to the Unicorn, the two prisoners conversed together, one of them asked the other if he (Dix) had any property about him; I do not know what answer was made to that question; Roberts said, another pint of beer will do him fast asleep; Orange said, beer is of no use, let us give him brandy; then we went into the Unicorn, a pot of beer was ordered, and one of the prisoners, I believe it was Roberts, ordered brandy, and the prosecutor drank a glass of brandy; we had one glass of brandy all round; he ordered the prosecutor to have another.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them ordered it? - A. I cannot speak to one or the other, I believe both the prisoners ordered him another; I interfered, and said I thought he had enough, and the prosecutor refused; after that he fell asleep, and they sat then one on each side of him, and sometime after that they got away from him, and sat at different parts, but previous to the reckoning being called, the prisoner Orange was gone; this man went to put his hand into his pocket, and it was turned inside out; he got up in a very great passion, he stormed about his property, and the people in the room laughed at him; I told the landlord I thought he had a watch, I told the landlord to fasten the door, and we would all stand search; the prisoner Roberts began to strip himself in the box, he took his coat, waistcoat, and neck handkerchief, off in the box; the landlord told him to come out into the middle of the room, and said, I should like to see what paper that was you put behind you; I loosed Roberts's neck of his shirt, and a person sitting there said, let us look where he was standing; we looked there, and found ten one-pound notes.</p>

             sworn. - Q. You keep the Unicorn public-house? - A. Yes, Dix and the prisoners came into my house about six o'clock in the evening; the first thing they called for was a glass of brandy, they insisted upon the prosecutor having two glasses of brandy; I refused it, seeing him a little intoxicated; they insisted upon his having it, saying, he had a pain in his bowels; he drank two glasses, and I saw no more of him, he went fast asleep. About eleven o'clock I shut up my shutters, and persuading this man to pay his reckoning, he felt in his pocket, and he had got no money; he was in a very great rage; this gentleman said he was confident he was robbed; he said, Mr. Bell, bolt the door, and we will all stand search.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time were these two prisoners in the room, or only one? - A. Only one, Orange was gone; as soon as the word search was spoken, I perceived something in the prisoner Roberts's hand, he tried to conceal it in his neck handkerchief; I saw something in his hand apparently to me fine paper, and while I was searching the one, he stripped in the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he at the time you saw him with the paper in his hand? - A. In the box, putting his hand behind him.</p>
               <p>Q. There were others sitting in the box with him? - A. Yes, they came out of the box to be searched, and when I was searching one, he was stripping himself in the box; I wished to search him the next, I told him to come out of the box, and I would search him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing on him? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Prosecutor.) Are there any marks by which you know these notes? - A. I know them by keeping them by me, and looking at them; there is a particular old note, with red at the back of it; I am sure I had such a one; the notes were all wrapped up in paper, and were in my right-hand pocket, and so was my money; I had nothing in my left-hand pocket, my watch was in my right-hand fob.</p>
               <p>Roberts. (To Bell.) Q. Landlord, was any part of the reckoning paid before this search? - A. Yes, Orange paid a shilling, his share, and went away.</p>
               <p>Roberts did not say any thing in his defence, but called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Orange left his defence to his Counsel, and called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you, in the yard at the Repository in Barbican, meet the prisoner Keenan? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known him before? - A. I had some knowledge of his person, but I was not acquainted with him; he was a <rs id="t18050918-40-deflabel210" type="occupation">groom</rs>

               <p>Q. Did he invite you into a public-house to drink? - A. Yes, and I went with him, and while we were drinking in the public-house, Gale, the other prisoner, came in; he asked us whether we would toss for a pot of porter; I declined; I said, I did not come in for the purpose of tossing, what I called for I would wish to pay for, and not to toss.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a person in the public-house of the name of Tims? - A. He came in as a companion of Keenan's, towards the first he stood at the door; Tims wished me to toss with Gale.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at last induced to toss up? - A. Yes, at last; upon which I won the first toss of Gale; Tims took a halfpenny of mine, and said he would toss; he hid a halfpenny of mine under my hat; upon which Gale won three times running; I desired Gale to call, and three times running he called right.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of this conversation did Gale say who and what he was? - A. After that toss was decided, Gale said he was a respectable farmer's son, and that we were a parcel of shabby stable grooms and coachmen; he said his aunt had left him fifteen hundred pounds, he was able to spend a great deal of money, and he wanted to toss for more, and we declined.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he afterwards leave this house? - A. Yes; he said he was going to the Saracen's Head, Snow-hill, in order to take a place in the coach to go to Salisbury, where his father lived, and kept a farm.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, Keenan, and Tims, go with him to the Saracen's Head? - A. We did, it was in my way home, and Tims said if I would go with him to the Saracen's Head, he would win back what I had lost, which was two pounds thirteen shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you all go together to the Saracen's Head? - A. We did; Keenan procured a room; Gale went into the book-keeper's office, under pretence of taking his place to go to Salisbury; after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180035"/>that we all went into a back room, and Gale and Keenan wished to play at cards for some money; Gale asked me if I would play with him; Keenan called for a bottle of wine, and got me to toss up a halfpenny for him with Gale who should pay for the pack of cards; Gale lost, and he sent Tims for the cards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Tims return with a pack of cards? - A. He did, and we all four set down to play; they proposed to play for a bottle of wine; Keenan was my partner against Gale and Tims; Keenan won the first odd trick, the next was Gale's deal; he gave me a very good hand indeed. I said, I never held so good a hand with such good cards as I played with; Gale said he would bet me ten or twenty pounds that he would win the odd trick; I declined the wager; Keenan urged me to bet him, he d - d my eyes, and said why would not I bet him. I then consented to bet him for ten pounds; I pulled out the two ten-pound notes I had in my pocket before them, to put down ten pounds; then Gale said he would make it twenty. Keenan urged me, he said he would see it all right; I then consented to bet twenty pounds, and put down the two ten-pounds notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Gale pull out any notes? - A. He pulled out a parcel of paper like silver paper; I said, will you be so good as to let me see your notes; Keenan said they were very good, and he would see that they were all good and right.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he open them for you to see what they were? - A. He did not; he took them, and put them under a pot, and said he would take care of them; then we played a hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How many tricks did you get? - A. Six, and the other got six.</p>
               <p>Q. Who won the odd trick? - A. I laid down the king of spades, to which Gale said, that is mine; I had four honours in my hand, and two trumps, I had played them all out; I won the odd trick with the ace of spades, and he played his king.</p>
               <p>Q. You laid down your queen however? - A. Yes; upon which Gale said, that is mine; I said, it cannot be your's; he made a grasp for the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he play his card first? - A. Yes, he threw it on the table, I do not know what it was.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You played the ace of spades, the king, and two trumps besides? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Gale threw down his card, and laid hold of the money? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attempt to pursue him? - A. Yes, but Keenan caught hold of me by the coat, and kept me back; in the mean time Gale got away; Keenan got before me, and Tims behind me, and stopped me some minutes; then I got out into the street to pursue Gale; I could not see him any where.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then detain Keenan or Tims? - A. No; I told them I thought they were a parcel of rascals, and had an intention in colleague to rob me; Tims said, oh, no, he would do no such a thing, he was a man that had plenty of money; the next evening I had Gale apprehended at the Coach and Horses, Dover-street, and the following Tuesday Keenan was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Tims you have never taken? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You say you have been a servant in place as a valet? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have been, perhaps means some years ago; let us know how long ago it is since you have been in place? - A. I have been in place about five months ago with Surgeon 
               <persName id="t18050918-40-person420">Gore</persName>
            , till he went abroad with Lord Cornwallis; I lived with him six months.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had you lived with before? - A. The Earl of Dover.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have been five months out of place - what have you been doing with yourself? - A. I was extremely ill great part of the time, not able to take a situation.</p>
               <p>Q. You know what revoking is? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know there was no revoke during the game? - A. That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know but there might be a revoke, and that the last card that Gale played was a trump? - A. I cannot say whether it was or not.</p>
               <p>Q. If it had been a trump, would not Gale have won the trick, and would have been entitled to the money? - A. Yes, but to the best of my recollection it was not a trump, but I will not venture to swear it was not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Was there any talk about playing any other game? - A No, there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. When they won the money they went away - you thought you beat them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a creditable house, the Saracen's Head - did you make any complaint to the men of the house; did you tell any body at that time that you were cheated, after it was over? - A. No, I did not, I thought they could not redress me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this was it that you saw Keenan again? - A. The next Sunday after that; I told him that I had taken Gale, and I would take him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you where his master's lodgings were? - A. He did; I went to his master's house, and found him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell him all you wanted was the twenty pounds that you were cheated of? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you upon your oath, whether you did not tell him that you only wanted to get the twenty pounds, out of which you were cheated? - A. The man's friends came to me, and asked me to take the money; I told them I could not with propriety, if I could I would, but I found I must not take it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180036"/>Q. Whether you have not gone to any Gentleman, and told him, if he would give you twenty pounds, you would cause the bill to be thrown out by the Grand Jury; I am speaking of Mr. Gillman, a gentleman, in the City? - A. The man's wife came to me several times crying; I took compassion on her; I did go to Mr. Gillman, and the reason of my going was on account of her lamenting so much; Keenan's wife wished me very much to see Mr. Gillman, to see if any thing could be done to make it up; Mr. Gillman told me that Mr. Murphy had stated to him, that if a little sum would do, he would come forward; I told him I would not take five hundred pounds of him without consulting my attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you upon your oath, did not you go to Mr. Gillman's, and say to this effect, that you would procure the bill to be thrown out, provided he would give you fifty pounds? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor nothing to that effect? - A. I did not know that I could do any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. How often had you been to Mr. Gillman's? - A. Twice.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you upon your oath, man, the first time you went to Mr. Gillman's, did not Mr Gillman say he would not give you one single farthing? - A. Mr. Gillman said he would not give me above thirteen or fourteen pounds; I went by the desire of his wife, seeing her distress; I told her I would not spare my own trouble, I did not want to do any more than the law obliged me to do, and what the law obliged me to do I would do.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How came not you to apply to the landlord at the Saracen's Head - why did not you call out when they stopped you, it is a creditable house? - A. I ought to have done it, but I was too much confused; I went out into the street, I wished to find Gale again.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you keep the other two - did you know any thing of Gale? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever complain to the landlord of the Saracen's Head? - A. Keenan wished me not to make a noise.</p>
               <p>Q. I should have thought that was the very reason that you should have made a noise.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon the solemn oath you have taken, are you sure those were the words that he said? - A. Yes; he said then he would not appear before the Grand Jury, or some expression to that purport; I am sure he called three times, if not four.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Had you any correspondence with Mr. Murphy? - A.

               <p>Court. Q. Did he tell you, that if you would procure him twenty-two pounds, he would get the bill thrown out? - A. He did, and to pay the forfeit of forty pounds.</p>

               <p>Q. How late does your Ladyship recollect having seen that snuff-box? - A. I recollect having looked at it in the spring, but at what time I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your Ladyship remove it into the country subsequent to that time, or where was it when you last saw it? - A. I think it was in that cabinet; I have not looked at it a good while; it was in the cabinet when last I saw it.</p>

               <p>Q. When did he leave your service? - A. I cannot positively say the day he was discharged; he was discharged between the 26th and the 31st of July; I discharged him by Lord Mansfield's direction's who was then at Ramsgate.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner was in your service, was he entrusted in your apartment? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he then an opportunity of knowing where the snuff-box was deposited? - A. Of course his employment let him know where this box was kept; I believe he knew it as well as I did; he was often with me in that room, and any thing that I wanted I got him to hand it me.</p>
               <p>Q. When had your Ladyship first occasion to know that that box was missing? - A. Not till I received the Magistrate's letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your Ladyship at that time? - A. I was at Caen Wood.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your Ladyship's return to town did you look in the place where the box was kept? - A. I did not, having seen the parts of the box in this broken state since I returned to town.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Where do you live? - A. I live in Oxford-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar and tell me whether, at any time, you saw him at your shop? - A. Yes, on the 15th of August last the prisoner came to my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose? - A. To purchase a gold chain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you produce him any chain? - A. Yes, the man in the shop shewed him a chain; I was not there when he first shewed him the chain.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came in had the prisoner at the bar come into your shop about any thing? - A. Yes, he was in my shop looking at a chain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you agree with him about the price of the chain? - A. Yes, when we agreed for the price, he asked me if it was customary to take old gold in exchange for new articles; I told him it was; upon which he pulled out some bits of gold, which I have now in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. When he gave it to you did you make any observation about it? - A. I immediately suspected him; the pieces of gold were apparently fragments of a snuff-box of curious workmanship; I sent for our journeyman to come out, and I conversed with him aside.</p>
               <p>Q. When the journeyman came out did you speak to the prisoner? - A. I asked the prisoner, how he came by the gold; he told me he had it from a servant; I told him that it was no servant's property; he said it was, upon which I told him I thought he had stole it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the gold lying at the time of this conversation? - A. On the counter; I told him he should not go away until he had given me an account of it.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you had told him the whole of the story he seemed to try to collect it in his hands? - A. I went to fetch my hat to go with him to Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him that you were going to take him to Marlborough-street? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went for your hat, what became of him? - A. I observed him make a snatch at the gold on my returning with my hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he succeed in getting any? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any remain behind? - A. Yes, he took a part, and left the remaining part behind.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the chain? - A. We lost that.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180038"/>Q. You never saw the chain any more? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner stay or go away? - A. He made a snatch at the box, and immediately ran out at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. When you stated the box you meant the pieces of gold that are there? - A. Yes; I pursued him; he had gone about fifty or sixty yards before I overtook him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him at all? - A. I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the least doubt that the prisoner is the man? - A. None in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he was afterwards taken to Marlborough-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when he was searched? - A. No; when I overtook him, I immediately collared him, he said, do not collar me, for I am no thief; I told him he had given me every reason to suppose to the contrary, and he must go with me to Marlborough-street, and I took him; I attended the search-warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were at Marlborough-street did you learn from the prisoner where his lodgings were? - A. Yes, I think it was No. 21, Bolsover-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What apartment in that house did you search? - A. The garret.</p>
               <p>Q. And underneath the grate in his apartment? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you make any observation to him? - A.

               <p>Q. How is the room called the little library situated with respect to the organ-room? - A. The organ-room is not quite over it; it stands in a circular room over it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What is your Lordship's Christian name? - A. William.</p>
               <p>Q. Will your Lordship have the goodness to look at all these things now produced - are you certain that they belonged to and that they were part of a box that was in your possession when your Lordship went into the country? - A. Yes, it is part of a gold box I then had.</p>
               <p>Q. There are some brilliants, will your Lordship look at them? - A. I had some of a similar sort that encircled the box I lost, and it had such a case as that which is found, and I know the miniature.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose immediate custody was this, in Lady Mansfield's or your's? - A. In Lady Mansfield's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the box been in your family any length of time? - A. The box came from the Emperor of Austria, 
               <persName id="t18050918-42-person436">Joseph</persName>
             the Second, to my father, on his leaving Vienna.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the value you set upon that box? - A. I should imagine, I cannot speak with accuracy, two hundred guineas, the value of the box and the brilliants.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt of its being worth ten pounds? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Just shew me one or two pieces of the box that you speak to? - A. I speak to the chasing; the form of the box and the rim of this box are different from any other box I ever saw; on the miniature there is the lower part of the face to be seen, and the breast, with the Austrian orders.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. (To Lady Mansfield.) Q. Has your Ladyship seen part of the box since you have come to town? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the result of that observation? - A. That they are part of the box.</p>

After they had taken all their things out of the room, they left me the key; when I went into the room, I found it all a flood with water; I got out of the trap-door, and found my lead gone that was round the chimney by the gutter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the young woman lodge with the old one? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any character with them? - A. Yes; my wife went after their character, they gave them a good character; my wife went to them after they were gone, and asked them how they could give them such a good character; they said they gave it them to get rid of them.</p>

               <p>Q. You visited the two prisoners at the bar often at times, and you visited them often enough to keep the young woman company? - A. That was her fault, it was not mine.</p>
               <p>Q. You were received into the family as a visitor,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180040"/>and as a person they put confidence in - pray how often used you to be there in a week? - A. Sometimes not at all.</p>

               <p>Q.When was it that you first took upon you to charge them with stealing this lead? - A. When they were taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not taken into custody, were you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were taken into custody on suspicion of stealing the lead - have you come here in custody? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. I am sure, if you do not know, I do not know; you have good luck if you do not - As you say you do not know, I will tell you: when you were taken into custody for stealing the lead, then you accused that young woman of stealing the lead? - A. I did not accuse her.</p>
               <p>Q. You told the same story then as you have done now? - A. I told the truth then.</p>
               <p>Q. And not till then, you said she was the person that stole the lead? - A. I said she was the person that gave the lead in at the trap-door.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is this to climb up? - A. It is not above this height from the floor (about four or five feet,) it is a slanting gutter.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray how long after the lead was lost was it before you accused this young woman of stealing it? - A. About a week.</p>
               <p>Q. By your own account you are a good honest lad - How long had you been in custody before you told this? - A. Not an hour in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you charge that young woman, to clear yourself? - A. By no means.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no hope of that kind? - A. I was not guilty.</p>
               <p>Q. No man is guilty by his own account - You did not charge her at all, to discharge yourself? - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not you charge her in hopes of clearing yourself? - A. I did, because I knew myself innocent.</p>
               <p>Q. You did it then in hopes of clearing yourself? - A. I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he come down stairs with it? - A. Yes; I followed him into the passage; I asked him who he wanted, and passed him, and shut the door to, and shut him in the passage; I then returned, and asked him again who he wanted; he told me he wanted Mrs. O'Hara.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any Mrs. O'Hara in the house? - A. There was such a person, but I did not know her name, she had been in the house a fortnight; I told him he had property about him that did not belong to him; I put my hand to his breast, and took the petticoat from under his coat; he bid me not be foolish, and let him go; I told him I would not be foolish, and let the petticoat go; he was secured, and I delivered the petticoat to Mr. Gregory.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he not say that his wife slept in the house with Mrs. O'Hara - she had left him, he thought it was her's, and he took the petticoat to punish her? - A. He said so at Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was the petticoat wet? - A. It was a little.</p>
               <p>- GREGORY sworn. - I am a constable, I was sent for to take him into custody; I took the petticoat, and I searched him; I found three duplicates on him, one a pledge for a watch; I asked him how he came to take the petticoat; he said, he meant no harm, he should have delivered it to the landlady; I took him to Marlborough-street, I went to the different shops where the duplicates mentioned, they told me he dealt in watches, and pledged many things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the 7th of August, when I came home from my work, my wife and I had some words; my wife went out, and I staid at home; the next morning I got up, the children told me their mother was gone to Mrs. O'Hara's; I went to No. 3, Leicester-street, to desire the mother to come home; I had sent my little boy before there, he not returning I was afraid he had lost himself; I went up stairs to Mrs. O'Hara's room, nobody answered me; coming down stairs I took the petticoat, I thought it was my wife's or Mrs. O'Hara's; when the gentlewoman followed me down stairs, she said, young man, you have got my petticoat; I said, is it your's, then take it; she said, stop there a minute; she went out, and brought an officer; I stopped till she came back with him.</p>

               <p>Q. Might it come from exertion or agitation of the mind? - A. It might; most probably the fall was the occasion of his death.</p>

I wish to ask you about the pantaloons; did I not tell you that I had a written order from Mrs. Lewis to send all my master's wearing apparel down into the country, and when I had sent my master's razors, and some other things, my master reprimanded me, and said, I had no right to send any thing down till I had orders from him; these were some of the things, and that was the reason they were down stairs? -</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know any thing of an order his mistress sent? - A. They were sent according to order.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You are the brother of the prosecutor? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 30th of August, did you go to your brother's house for the purpose of discharging the prisoner? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into his pantry before you sent him out of the house for the purpose of seeing whether he had any thing that he ought not to have? - A. Yes, for that purpose; I went into the pantry, I requested him to give me the key belonging to the pantry; I went down into his pantry, he opened two cupboards, and the first thing I saw were these pantaloons of his master's, they were uppermost, and under that there were eight bottles of wine; I particularly asked him whose property that was; he said, it was his master's property.</p>
               <p>Q. Under that you found eight bottles of wine? - A. Yes, and a powder flask; in another cupboard were seven bottles of wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the key of that cupboard? - A. The prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What wine was it? - A. Port wine.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180043"/>Court. Q. What did he say about the wine? - A. I asked him particularly why he put the wine there, and why he secreted it in that manner; he said that he was a very distressed man; he was very sorry for it, he hoped I would have mercy on him.</p>
               <p>Q. After that an officer was sent for, and he was taken before a Magistrate? - A. Yes; I requested my brother's cook to make search about the pantry, to see if any thing more was there, and in his trunk were found, two files, a pair of pincers, a turn-screw, and a bunch of keys.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. (To witness.) Q. Were not these pincers about the shelf, and the two files in the top cupboard; you looked and found the pantaloons in the housekeeper's drawer in the house-keeper's room? - A.No, they were in your cupboard.</p>

               <p>Court. Were there two pipes of port? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it port wine found in all the thirty bottles? - A. Twenty-nine of red, and one of white.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you assist in bottling off this wine? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. It was removed to Russel-square, to Mr. Lewis's new house? - A. Yes; I found a deficiency immediately that I had done bottling it; I found only fifty-one dozen and two bottles, which I conceived to be deficient.</p>
               <p>Q. When you counted the other pipe, what was that? - A. Fifty-three dozen and one.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. After you had reckoned them, you found a deficiency? - A. Yes; I am certain of the quantity, it was put into baskets which hold fifty-six bottles; the prisoner at the bar had been with me all the time, and when I counted it out first, I found it fifty-two, and the other ran fifty-three.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Were you able to know there was a deficiency afterwards? - A. I did not reckon it before I had done bottling the pipe, it was taken away before I had done bottling it; I was in the cellar, and they went out of my sight with it into the wash-house adjoining the wine-cellar; I make no doubt but it is part of the wine, by the freshness of the corks, and they being wet when Cook called me, and the bottle of sherry, I have no doubt of it, it was sealed; there were no more than six bottles of sherry in Mr. Lewis's cellar.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. (To Bowen.) Q. Whether I was not sent into the street at the time this wine was sent out to stand by the cart; I went out to the baker's for bread, and I went for beef-steaks? - A. You were not sent away the first pipe that was counted and found deficient.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see me go into the pantry with any wine, or any other place? - A. I could not see him; Mr. Tuck walked backwards and forwards after the first pipe was bottled.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To prosecutor.) Q. What is the value of a bottle of this wine? - A. Three shillings a bottle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had not moved the wine there at all; I can prove that those cupboards in the pantry were all the whole day open; Mr. Tuck and his man breakfasted with me in the housekeeper's room, after which we went into the kitchen; I fetched the newspaper for Mr. Tuck to read in the housekeeper's room; I fetched water and rolls; at this time the wine was laying about, in a manner, all over the place; from the first pipe till a considerable time after breakfast, there were two sash windows open, one in the pantry, the other in the room adjoining, in the yard, while I was going to answer the street-door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner (To Tuck.) Q. Whether Mr. Tuck did not say to Mr. Lewis, that pipes run commonly so short? - A. I said to Mr. Lewis, that the pipe did run short; in such cases as these we must say something to gentlemen (I had a hint from Mr. Lewis); it wanted a gallon when it went into the house, and it was in as good condition when I bottled it off, as when it came in; I had the whole care of it when it went into the house, and I attended the bottling of it; there was no leakage; I have one thing to say - the prisoner made an observation to me, that he never admitted any body into his room, not even the housekeeper, and wherever he had lived, he never associated with any of the servants when the family were in town.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Tuck observed that the pipe was not filled up; the pipe was not guaged before it was drawn off; he said it was a very common thing for them to waste, standing so long a time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Tuck. It had been a twelvemonth in the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. It did not leak at all? - A. No; and the two pipes both came in at one time, and the other ran that quantity.</p>
               <p>Jury (To Tuck.) Q. Had the pipe of wine been a twelvemonth in the cellar after it was guaged, or guaged previous to its being bottled off? - A. It was guaged a twelvemonth previous to its being bottled off.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer of the Public Office, Hatton-garden; I know the prisoner very well, he lived in Steward's-court, Clerkenwell-green.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search his lodgings? A. Yes; on the 15th of August, I and Stanton, between ten and eleven at night, found the things that are in the indictment, and now produced; we entered the room, the prisoner was in bed, pretending that he was ill, his wife told me that he was so deaf that he could not hear, and she hoped that we were not come to fetch him or her away; I answered, I did not know that; what have you got under this blanket on the table; I pulled the blanket off the table, and there I saw a quantity of linen of different descriptions; I tied it up, and begged Stanton to get the man out of bed; he pretended he was so ill he could not get out of bed; we forced him out, and when we pulled the clothes off the bed, we saw he had some of his clothes on; Stanton pulled him up and saw another bundle and two pocket-books; we took them both into custody.</p>

               <p>Q. That was after the bundles were taken away from you, and given to the man? - A. Yes, and she said if I did not hold my tongue, she would chuck me in the ditch.</p>
               <p>Q. The man was gone with the bundles then, was not he? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body come by at the time? - A. Yes, Mr. Durmaine came by.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he take? - A. Seven yards and a half of quilting; there was no person in the shop but myself; I pursued him till he threw the piece down; he was brought back by Jones. When I got out of the shop to pursue him, he was about a hundred yards off, he had the piece of quilting then; I saw him throw it down, I have no doubt of his person.</p>
               <p>- JONES sworn. - I heard the cry of stop thief on Thursday evening, the 5th of September; I observed a man running by my shop; soon after I observed Mr. Dixon passing by, calling out, stop thief; in consequence of a winning in the court, he passed through, and I lost sight of him for about a minute; the prisoner was walking towards me when I took him.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know it was the same man? - A. I can only say he was the man that I took, in consequence of being told he was the man that was running away.</p>

In the evening, when the prisoner was going home from his work, I told him I must search him; I found in his two waistcoat pockets one pound and half an ounce, and three quarters of a pound wrapped up in paper in his breeches; this bag he had taken up stairs to grind some snuff, he tore this bag up to put part of the tobacco in the paper; I know it to be mine positively, by my hand-writing on it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he lived with you? - A. Two months and one day; I have not the least doubt but the tobacco is mine, I have compared it with the other; the officer found some more on him.</p>

               <p>(The indictment was read by Mr. Dampier.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. - Gentlemen, This prosecution, we all understand, is against the prisoner for an offence which he has committed against the stamp laws, and the indictment charges him with having counterfeited the impression of stamps authorised by the Commissioners for the purpose of denoting the duty on playing cards; it charges him likewise of vending and selling cards with these counterfeited impressions, knowing it to be so done.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, The act under which the prisoner is prosecuted makes it a capital offence for either counterfeiting, vending, or selling cards with counterfeited stamps, the person so acting having a guilty knowledge thereof.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, Having stated these circumstances to you, I conceive I must do more, in order to apprise you of the serious and important business in which we are now engaged. The prisoner at the bar is a licensed card-maker, having two licensed shops, the one situated in Hereford-street, Oxford-street, and the other in North-row, Grosvenor-square; I shall shew you that in these two places he carried on the manufacturing and selling of playing cards. There was another place the prisoner had, which was even unknown even to the servants that were employed in either of these manufactories, in which almost all the infamous part was transacted by the prisoner himself alone.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, The extensive manner in which he carried on this business, compared with the small demand he made at the Stamp office for stamps to have legally carried it on, was one of the first circumstances that appeared against the prisoner, and that a fraudulent fabrication were made and vended, to a large extent, in lieu of the legal one, there was not the least doubt. And in consequence of this, and likewise from some other circumstances, it came sufficiently to the knowledge of the persons employed at the Stamp-office that there must be some illegal practice carried on. It was thought expedient to employ one Hockey, who is the printer of the legal ace of spades at the Stamp-office, in order to see if they could detect him in the improper practice he was carrying on, and this employment of Mr. Hockey has led to the discovery for which the prisoner is now brought here. It was in the month of May, I think the 14th, that Mr. Hockey made the first purchase; he called at his house, and asked for six packs of playing cards, Mr. Harding was not at home, but a servant furnished him with the six packs of playing cards; the charge that was made for them was about a guinea, nothing at all under what would be the trade price bought at a regular manufactory; Mr. Hockey having purchased these six packs of cards, he found that they contained all the marks and impressions of forged stamps, and he was satisfied in his own mind that they were undoubtedly forged. He was not contented with making this purchase, he went on the 16th, and purchased six packs more; Mr. Harding then was at home, and served him himself. On the 21st he made another purchase, when the same servant furnished him with six packs more, and on the 24th of May he purchased a dozen packs; the cards in this dozen were furnished him by the prisoner himself. On the 27th, he went again to the shop, and ordered five dozen to be sent to No. 74, Edgware-road; these cards were sent accordingly, and the person that carried them will be called; he will tell you (he was in the habit of giving receipts not in his master's name;) he asked his master in what name he should give the receipt, his master told him to give the receipt in any name he pleased; he was instructed where to carry them, and he gave the receipt in the name of Bates. When he returned he told his master, and his master was very well satisfied with it.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, This circumstance was in order to prevent the easy communication of tracing back these packs of cards; for all these and every one of those different packs of cards which were purchased on those specific days, in the month of May, contained the forged impressions of these counterfeited stamps, and the prosecution against the prisoner was supposed to be complete by these various instances of selling these counterfeited impressions. In consequence of that, it was thought fit to apprehend him, and to make a seizure from which information<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180050"/>might be collected from the circumstances of the manner in which it was carried on. He was apprehended, and several of his servants were likewise laid hold of at the time; and from this remarkable circumstance it is evident that the prisoner must have become acquainted previously, that there was that suspicion ripened against him, that it was likely that he should be the subject of apprehension; for upon the seizure of the stock there was not one single forged impression found, although down to the twenty-fourth of May he had, wherever the sale had been made, sold cards with these counterfeited impressions; they were all removed before the apprehension and seizure; that unquestionably by some means or other the prisoner must have been apprised thereof. After the apprehension of the prisoner, the persons that assisted him in carrying on this nefarious business, who were taken at the same time, became the subjects of examination, and the connection and acquaintance of the prisoner were discovered; and that a person of the name of Leadbetter was the engraver that was employed by the prisoner, and a person of the name of Skelton was one that had considerable dealings with him; that they were frequently employed in carrying cards to Mr. Skelton, who lived somewhere near Grosvenor-square. I shall shew to you the manner in which the prisoner at the bar first seduced Leadbetter, and the manner in which Leadbetter seduced Bunning - I can hardly say seduced, employed Bunning. That the prisoner at the bar actually paid for Leadbetter's instruction in the art of engraving on copper-plates, he being a stone seal-engraver; and after the prisoner had actually paid for the instruction of Leadbetter, he was anxious to know whether he could execute a plate for him. Leadbetter attempted not only to touch up a plate, but also to engrave others for him; but in consequence of his not being able to do it for him, he was desirous of getting it done for him; he employed a man of the name of Bunning, who was himself an engraver in this line. Leadbetter led him to believe that he was acquainted with a drunken engraver who worked for the Stamp-office, who would lose his business if he did not get some able hand to do them for him. These are the outlines of the case, in which, if the facts are brought home to him, I am sure you will not entertain a doubt of the propriety of the prosecution against the prisoner, Mr. Harding.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I shall first state to you what it is we have to prove against him; I shall then state what is necessary to prove against the prisoner by the detail already applied to the facts. The first thing to be proved against him is vending these articles, knowing them to be counterfeited - for vending these packs of cards with the counterfeited impressions of the stamps, he knowing them to be counterfeited, rather than the actual counterfeiting of the impressions of that stamp. I shall shew to you that at the early stage of the business evident proof of his having vended these articles in considerable quantities to a person of the name of Hockey, and that Hockey will shew to you, beyond all possibility of a doubt, that he sold these cards with the counterfeited impressions on them; and to establish that fact, that he knew they were counterfeited, I shall here state the manner in which the duty stamps are carried on at the Stamp-office. This will of itself make it next to impossibility that any trader carrying on the business as this man did, could possibly sell or vend cards without knowing they were false. The duty on playing cards is upon the whole two shillings and sixpence; there is a duty of sixpence on the wrapper; and with respect to the ace of spades particularly, the Office makes a plate for every dealer, and upon that plate for every dealer they put the dealer's name. Every dealer, therefore, must know, that in order to get a legal ace of spades, he must have the ace of spades that is furnished by the Stamp-office themselves; he cannot get it from any other quarter. If any dealer is furnished with any other ace of spades, he must know that they were forged; for on looking upon the legal impression of the duty ace, there is charged sixpence upon the top, and sixpence on each side, and then there is the name of Harding, or of the dealer, that is, the card-maker, at the bottom; and any card-maker getting it from any other quarter, must know that he has got a false impression.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, This case will by no means rest here; but I shall shew to you the actual employment of the prisoner, and who it was that made the fabricated plate. I shall shew you by one of his servants that he had a plate in his possession of the ace of spades, and that he saw him polish the impression that is made on the label fabricated stamp, to give it that gloss which the legal stamp does, in order to meet the eye, and to be less liable of detection. You will find from his servants that, for several weeks before the time that he was apprehended, he had taken upon himself entirely the whole management of that part of the business which consisted of making the aces of spades. The legal aces of spades have twenty impressions upon a sheet of paper of a large size at the Stamp-office; they are cut in shape, and put on one side of the cards by the card-maker; they are progressively numbered from one to twenty. The plate that the prisoner procured to be fabricated, only contained four of these impressions, and when you come to examine the particulars of the plate, you will find that some of them are not correct with the original of which they were intended; for I think they have got an R instead of the E in the word Dieu. In this instance it points out, beyond all possibility of a doubt, that it is a forgery.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, You will find that he kept this part of the business to himself for six months before he was apprehended; that he cut these out, and pasted them on the cards; that he delivered the aces of spades, which were to be included in these packs, himself; and I apprehend from this circumstance of Leadbetter being actually employed and engaged by the prisoner to acquire that knowledge by which he was to fabricate the legal stamps, will make it beyond all doubt that he knew they were forged. I have pointed out these other circumstances, independent of the proof of Leadbetter, and particularly independent of the proof which will be given on the part of Skelton, because both Lead-better and Skelton will come before you as men who are more or less implicated in the guilt of the prisoner himself. With respect to Leadbetter, there is no doubt but he must know what these stamps were; and with respect to Skelton, there can be but little doubt, if any, but that he must have known the iniquitous purpose of these stamps. He will tell you that he knew the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180051"/>prisoner many years; that he let him part of his premises in a back yard behind his house, and that in these premises the prisoner carried on this nefarious business; he had often seen him, and often heard him make use of the instrument for forging these stamps. I say I will desire the keeping the case, as much as I can, without the assistance of these accomplices, because I think, without their assistance, there would be very near, if not quite, sufficient to prove the case against the prisoner. At Mr. Skelton's, and at the house of a person of the name of Shinglear, were found not less than two thousand aces that had been made by Harding, the prisoner, he having removed them from his premises the very night before his apprehension to elude every means of indicating the forged business being carried on by him.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, Some of the plates were found in the garden at Skelton's, and two were found in the possession of Leadbetter, to whom they had been returned by Harding, for the purpose of his secreting them. You will find that there is abundant proof against the prisoner at the bar, even if you were to put out the evidence of Skelton, or of Leadbetter, they being persons that were accomplices. You will be directed to give a very anxious attention to their evidence, and to be watchful whether their evidence is confirmed, and if it is confirmed, you may give the same reliance to that as to any other evidence. In this case you will give attention to the whole of it - how far the evidence supports the facts, and how far upon the whole these facts make out the case of guilt against the prisoner. In my mind it seems to be a case in which there will not be a possibility of a doubt, but it will be for you to determine.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180053"/>Q. Did he tell you what? - A. No; I told him I had known White from a lad, even from an apprentice.</p>
               <p>Q. What Did Mr. Harding say upon that? - A. He said he would call upon me in the course of the next week; then he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards was it that you saw Mr. Harding? - A. About three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that? - A. He came to my lodgings, which were, at that time, No. 3, Greek-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing with him when he came? - A. He brought with him four duty aces of spades with the name of Harding cut off.</p>
               <p>Q. You can only tell a name was cut off; what did he say to you? - A. He told me to take that to Mr. White and tell him to copy it as close as he could, and if he should ask any questions, to tell him it was for a foreigner at Hambro'; he then went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry these to White? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any conversation pass between you and White? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him what passed between you and White? - A. Yes, I had some difficulty to find him; I met him in Long-acre, and he took me into some shops; I asked him to call at my lodgings, which he did; I asked him to engrave me a plate and to call on me to-morrow; when he came, he said, Leadbetter, for God's sake, do you know what you are doing of? I told him I did not; he then said, he could engrave these aces, but if he did, he must give them into the hands of a Magistrate, for he had asked a question of his friend, who was a card-maker, and he told him that.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see Harding? - A. The next day he came to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Now then at that time did you inform Harding of what you have told us, of what White said to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Harding say to that? - A. He still persisted it was no such thing; I told him that White told me it was a forgery; he insisted it was no such thing, he said he was a poor fool, and knew no better.</p>
               <p>Q. What further did he say? - A. He told me to go to White again, and to tell him that no harm should come to him if he would do it, and more than that, whatever money he wanted or asked he should have, and that he should have the money first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see White afterwards, to inform him of that? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Would White do them? - A. He told me that he would have nothing to do in it, for he thought that I knew who they were for.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, I believe, you never saw White? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Harding soon afterwards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come to you, or did you go to him? - A. I think I went and told him what White had said.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to that? - A. There was nothing more passed after that; he never took any more notice about engraving for six or seven months.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you lodged, then, in Greek-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After that you lodged in Titchfield-street, No. 42? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you there see Mr. Harding? - A. Yes, about six or seven months after the time I was speaking of, he came to my lodgings in Titchfield-street, he asked me and said, do you think in your own mind, you could learn to engrave on copper: I then told him I did not know, but I thought I might; upon which he said, if you will get some one to instruct you, I will pay for your instruction: upon which I applied to several people, and I was recommended to Mr. Woodthorpe, in Fetter-lane, to whom I went; he told me to call again on the next day, when I went to him, and he would give me an answer; he did afterwards do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he undertake to instruct you afterwards? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. For what sum was he to instruct you? - A. For twenty pounds or guineas, I think guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid that money? - A. Mr. Harding, he furnished me with that money to pay Mr. Woodthorpe.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had been with Mr. Woodthorpe a competent time, did he come to you to see how you improved? - A. He asked me if I had practised enough to touch up a plate for him; I then asked him what that plate was; he told me it was a plate of the aces of spades; and he said that the poor old man - the poor old Baronet that did it for him was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you endeavour to do it? - A. I told him I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. After that did he come to you again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long afterwards was it, a week or a month? - A. It might be a month.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come to you again? - A. He came to me again, and asked me how I came on with Woodthorpe; I told him very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he then shew you any thing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it? - A. He came and shewed me a plate of four duty aces of spades.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say he wanted to be done with it? - A. He said he wanted it to be touched up;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180054"/>and then we walked to the other end of the room, and said, had I better touch it up here, or come to his house to do it; I told him to do as he pleased; he then said, come to my house; I went and dined there, it was on a Sunday, and after dinner he shut me into a room, and gave me some gravers, and told me to do the best I could with them.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he shut you in the room? - A. He locked the door; I tried to do it, but finding I could not do it, I left off; he came into the room about the dusk of the evening, he said, Leadbetter, what have you done? I told him I had done a little, I did not know whether it would do or no; with that he said, never mind it now, I will try to do it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect at all what the number were? - A. To the best of my knowledge it was one, two, six, and seven.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him afterwards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it at your lodgings that he came again? - A. Yes, he came to my lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask you any further questions? - A. He said, he did not mind telling me what he wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he want? - A. He asked me if I could engrave on brass with my own machine; I told him, I could not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dampier. The witness is a stone engraver.</p>
               <p>Q. He asked you if you could engrave on brass? - A. I told him I could not, my tools were made of the softest iron I could get.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he afterwards ask you of your progress with Mr. Woodthorpe? - A. He came again, and asked me how I came on with Mr. Woodthorpe; I told him as before, very well. He brought me a plate under his coat, and gave me a sheet of aces of spades.</p>
               <p>Q. Containing the number of twenty? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Such a one as this? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you? - A. He told me that he would be glad if I would copy fourteen, fifteen, nineteen, and twenty, and do them as close as possible I could, he was so distressed he did not know what to do; I then told him I would. Finding I was not capable of doing it, I employed a man of the name of Bunning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate to Harding that you had employed Bunning? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give Bunning the plate, and did Bunning do the plate? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the plate so done by Bunning to Harding? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When you gave it to him, what did he say to it? - A. He said it was not a proper thing to be done; Bunning said that.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, when you gave the plate to Harding which Bunning had worked upon, did Harding make any observation upon it? - A. He looked at it, and said it was very neatly done.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do upon that - did he give you any other plate? - A. He came a very short time afterwards, and told me that he liked that plate very well that I had done, and he would be obliged to me to do another, and put the name of Blanchard in; he gave me an exportation ace, a sheet of the same size as one of them; I gave it to Bunning with his directions, and got it done.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give that to Harding? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Some time after that did he come to you again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you? - A. He asked me if I had done the plates; I told him, yes; he said he would be obliged to me if I would do one or two more, with the name of Harding, duty aces not for exportation; I did two Blanchards, and then he came again for me to do a Harding, because he said he should be found out working on one number.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give that to Bunning? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that done by Bunning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And afterwards given by you to Harding? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him again with one of the Blanchard plates? - A. Yes, he came to me again to see if I would take out the palm-branch; the exportation aces are with palm-branches, and the duty aces are with leaves on them; I was to take out the palm-branch, and to put in the leaves; I was to make some alteration that they should not be exactly to pattern; it was taken out, but the alteration was not made, I had not time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the bustle there was about Lee and Hardy? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. About that time Blacklin was prosecuted, and Lee ran away? - A. Yes, he came to me, and said, for God sake, help me to bury the plates; for, said he, they have been searching my house; upon which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any directions? - A. He told me to bury them; then he came again, and said, let me have them; he took the plates, and brought them again in the course of a day or two, and I buried them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what you were to do if you were asked about them? - A. Yes; he said if they came to me, and asked me any thing about it, to to say I knew nothing of any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the time you were apprehended? - A. I think it was the 25th of June.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time were there any of these plates at your house? - A. Two.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had brought them there? - A. Mr. Harding.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You were taken up on the 25th of June? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. And there were found in your house two forged plates? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had employed a lad of the name of Bunning to forge others to engrave them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever told that poor lad, Bunning, that they were done for the Commissioners of the Stamps? - A. Yes, I told him they were for Mr. Shephard, that belongs to the Stamp-office.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times were you examined yourself after you were taken up? - A. Three times, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. With some little apprehension to your neck, you knew you were in danger? - A. Certainly; I had not a little apprehension, I knew I was in danger if I was not admitted an evidence for the crown.</p>
               <p>Q. That is true - pray how many different accounts have you given before you had given this to-day? - A. To the best of my knowledge there was one.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there not three? - A. I cannot exactly say there were not three.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not remember, at the conclusion of your last examination, your saying that the account you then gave you would stick by, and that your former accounts were not true? - A. I cannot understand you.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you remember being asked, upon the conclusion of the last account that you gave, whether the account of that day was true, or the account of former examinations - you said, the account I give to-day is true, and the former accounts are not; the former accounts were destroyed because they were false? - A. They were false in parts.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you have given three different accounts - have you given three different accounts or two? - A. There were two.</p>
               <p>Q. And given before the same Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dampier. Q. These are the plates and the paper that were delivered to you by Mr. Harding? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dampier. One of them has the R instead of the E, on one of the plates is Diru instead of Dieu.</p>

               <p>Q. He asked you whether you could engrave what he wanted? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Telling you what it was, what answer did you give him? - A. I told him I did not think I was capable, it was entirely out of my line.</p>
               <p>Q. In order to induce you to do so, did not he tell you he would give you something, and teach you music also? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you told him you must tell your master, he said you must not do that, because the Stamp-office will find it out - he told you that he had great influence at the Stamp-office, there was no harm in what you were doing of, and he could do any thing for you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you took it for granted you were doing nothing wrong, you were only doing it for the service of this man? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. I do not know whether I was correct in what I thought I heard you say: that once you saw him print an ace of spades - can you tell when that was? - A. I cannot tell, I think my memory to be very imperfect.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your memory serve you to recollect what you swore at Bow-street upon that occasion? - A. I will tell you what it was: I said I never saw him print an ace of spades but once.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you at liberty now, or in custody? - A. I am out on bail.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. We may as well give your Lordship the fact of this book, Harding on one side, and Skelton on the other; the charge against Skelton is of this nature: twenty new, one pound fifteen; twenty-eight only, old and new; and then waste, one dozen and sixteen and eight; upon the whole it appears to be one hundred and forty pounds; one hundred and eighty-six, with the exemptions of a few articles in cash; they all appear to be waste paper, up to the amount of between three and four hundred pounds.</p>

Mr. Harding was in the shop when I went in; I apprehended him; I made a search in his house at that time; I found a large quantity of cards, and all of them with good stamps; they were all good aces of spades found there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apprehend any others? - A. The last witness was there and the apprentice; we went to Leadbetter's and found in the kitchen, upon the top of his rolling-press, these two plates in paper, done up in this way. (Witness describing the manner.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Skelton's house? - A. We did, on the same day.</p>

               <p>Q. What part of the premises did you search? - A. I searched the room at the bottom of the yard.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there any other articles there? - A. There was an iron fly-press that was in the room, and a flannel working jacket, and some flannel, likewise a printing-ball; the flannel has the appearance of red ink, and shews that some work has been carried on, by the red appearance; here is the marble slab it has been worked upon, the rolling-press was compleat; at a distant place we found the remainder of the press which had been taken down.</p>
               <p>Q. Then both in the room and the other place you found a compleat press? - A. We did: on the 27th we went to Mr. Skelton's, and at the bottom of the yard, about a foot under the earth, we found these other plates.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they the plates of? - A. They are four plates of aces of spades; in the room there were cards packed up, a large quantity; I saw no aces of spades in those I looked at; I looked in one, and some loose cards were in the room; on the 9th of July I went to Skelton's and made a subsequent search, and in the privy we found these four other plates; they are aces of spades.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Skelton on the premises when they were found? - A. At the first time he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in consequence of what you heard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180060"/>from Skelton, search another place? - A. I went to Mr. Senor's house in King-street, Grosvenor-square; I found, in the back-room, which was occupied by Mr. Shinglear, this parcel.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe, also, that before that time, with respect to the duty aces of spades, orders were given that they should be circulated as before, and printed as before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr Gurney. Q. Was this order in writing? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you examined a certain quantity of duty aces that have been produced to you? - A. I have examined them.</p>

               <p>Q. We will shew you one or two that were purchased by Hockey, the first purchase of the prisoner, and on the 24th; looking at that ace of spades, are you able to say whether that is or not the stamp authorised by the Commissioners, or whether it is a forgery? - A. It is certainly a forgery.</p>

               <p>Q. Is there any particular circumstance that makes it out of all possible doubt? - A. The letter R is imposed where the letter E ought to be.</p>
               <p>Q. That where the letter R is cannot be printed from one of the plates of the Stamp Office? - A. No, it cannot be.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you looked over all the aces of that bundle sold on the 24th? - A. They are all a forgery.</p>

               <p>Q. I shall trouble you with another question with regard to the wrappers - look at one of them purchased on the 24th of June; does that appear to be a genuine stamp from the Stamp Office, or a forgery? - A. It appears to be a forgery.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Estcourt.) Did you shew to Mr. Merchant any but such as were bought of the prisoner, or were bought at his shop, or were found at the other places? - A. No.</p>

All the legal stamps are delivered out with the name of the card-maker on them, upon a receipt of the card-maker or his servant; the plate is kept at the Office, or, by the directions of the Commissioner, the manufacturer provides the paper; it is stamped, at the Stamp Office, and is to be re-delivered to the card-maker.</p>
               <p>Q. How many in a sheet? - A. Twenty, never less (Witness looking at those purchased at Harding's.)<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180061"/>These never came from the Office; with respect to the stamp on the wrapper called the label, they are delivered in the same quantity as the aces, and no otherwise; the label is pasted on by the card-maker.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you receive your money? - A. Yes, of Mr. Randell, in Dean-street, Westminster; he paid me three pounds sixteen shillings and sixpence; he gave me fifteen shillings in halfpence, one shilling and sixpence in silver, and three one-pound notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Having received that you went on home? - A. Yes, and the girls overtook me in Tothill-street, they went a little way along the Park with me; after they parted from me, I missed the money out of the crown of my hat; then I looked after them, and they were gone out of my sight.</p>

               <p>Downing's defence. The prosecutor was unloading a cart of straw, he asked me if I would come down and let him in, as I was looking out of my window; I said, yes, if he would give me some money; I came down and let him in, he sent for both beer and gin; he stopped and spent what money he had in his pocket, he said he should like to have something more to eat and drink; he asked me to pawn his watch; I said I would, if he would give me leave; he gave it me to pawn, saying, get me two pounds on it, I said, it will not fetch one quarter of the money; I pawned it for ten shillings, I told the pawnbroker that the person that belonged to it would fetch it out again; I took the prosecutor the duplicate and the money; he gave me some of it, and staid and spent the remainder. He went his way to go home, this young woman and I were going to St. James's market, we lit of him again; we told him, as far as we were going, we would accompany him. We left him and went through Spring-garden gate, and he went towards Kensington; I never saw any more of him till Sunday morning, he came to us then, and said where is my watch? I told him I had pawned it for him; I said, here is the ticket; he said, as you pawned it, I will leave the duplicate with you till I get the money, I shall come to Mr. Randell's before long, and you shall fetch it out; I never saw any thing of the money that he said he lost.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe that she had any thing with her when she went out? - A. No, nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you together in the same room all the time she staid with you? - A. Yes; I came home about seven o'clock, and missed my children's clothes that same evening - a gown and a frock; they were hanging on the bannisters of the stairs in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave them there when you went out? - A. No, my children had put them there when they came from school at five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out they were on your children's backs, who were at school, so that when you came home you did not know any thing more than what your children told you - Did you see this gown and frock afterwards? - A. Not till I saw them in Court.</p>

He came in on the 9th of September; he said he was ashamed to be seen lurking about, and he sat on the stool; at four o'clock I left work, and the prisoner went out and sat upon some bricks, and he drank part of half a gallon of beer with me; on Tuesday morning, when I went to work, the tools were gone.</p>

I have got a family of small children; I am a dealer in old clothes; I went and sold my work; I went into that man's house for a quarter of a pound of tea; I felt something under my feet; I stooped down to see what it was; before I could pick it up, he came round the counter, and took it up; he said I wanted to steal this soap; he dragged me away, and took me to the watch-house; the next morning he took me out, and as we were going out of the watch-house, he said, if you will own to taking of this piece of soap, I will forgive you, as to the starch, my shop being full of people, it might drop down.</p>

            ; my mother went out and fetched the watchman; the prisoner was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - A. She was a lodger in the house at that time; the house had been two houses; the lower part is in connection with each other, the lower part and the first pair are not separated, but the second pair of stairs there is a pair of stairs to go up to that separate by itself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any door to them from the street? - A. There was to that part of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner lodge in the garret? - A.Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any communication between the lower part of the house and the garret? - A. Yes, this door goes into the yard which communicates to both houses.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the garret and the two pair of stairs have a private door in the street to go out of? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore that pair of stairs is open to every part of the house? - A. No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Just describe it. - A. You must go through the yard, and go through a back door to go into these two stories; there is no communication from the tap-room to the two pair of stairs and the garret.</p>
               <p>Q. You took her up and she was carried before a Magistrate? - A. Yes, at Lambeth-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you present at the examination? - A. Yes, the examination was taken in writing.</p>
               <p>Q. She could not get to where you saw her, from the garret where she lodged, any other way than through the yard or the street? - A. No way else.</p>

             sworn. - I am the wife of John Unnice; the prisoner at the bar rented a two-pair of stairs ready-furnished room with us; I let her the lodging in August, 1804.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at any time, miss any of your furniture out of the room? - A. She left the lodgings about the latter end of July; she gave no notice, but sent the rent weekly; I broke open the room, and found all the articles mentioned in the indictment were gone out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen any of your property since? - A. Yes, the officer found them, they were pledged. (The property produced, and identified by the prosecutrix.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I did not go away from my lodgings, I have some property there at this time; my husband is gone to sea, he promised to send me some money; I hope you will shew me as much mercy as your Lordship can.</p>

               <p>Q. Was Mr. Paas a customer of your's? - A. He has been a customer of ours for these five or six months, he lives at the end of Surry-square, Walworth.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any suspicion that fell upon the prisoner, did you make any application to Mr. Paas? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of having made application to Mr. Paas, do you remember the prisoner at the bar coming home on the 27th of August? - A. Perfectly well; when he came home I booked his load with the name of the customers whom he had served in the course of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear that Mr. Paas was one of the customers on that day? - A. No, it was not among them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you delivered any beer to him to deliver to Mr. Paas on that day? - A. We do not deliver them beer for particular customers without there is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180069"/>a specific order brought home; they call upon their customers when they go by to see who wants.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came at night, what did you say to him? - A. I merely took his account, I have the book here; he gave me no account of any beer delivered to Mr. Paas, there is no entry by me on that day; we did not charge him with it at that time; on the following day, or the day after, we consulted with the partners, and he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing before the Magistrate? - A. He said he had booked the load right.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go to Mr. Paas for the purpose of making enquiry whether he had delivered any beer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. When the prisoner came home to you at night, he gave you the account, and you booked it - how many barrels were booked on that day? - A. Twenty-two of beer and two of ale.</p>
               <p>Q. He reported all these names from memory? - A. From his own book, he carries a memorandum-book with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You asked him whether he had delivered any beer to Mr. Paas on that day? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You were afraid to remind him, perhaps - did you or did you not abstain from asking him about Mr. Paas for the present? - A. I did abstain, we were satisfied.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you purposely omit to remind him? - A I cannot tell exactly.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You said you refrained? - A. It was not usual to ask them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. I take it for granted that you take an account, when the dray goes out, of what quantity of beer it carries - did you compare that quantity that went out with the account he gave you at night - was there any deficiency? - A. No deficiency whatever in the load; we found out afterwards who he booked it to.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was the prisoner intrusted to receive money? - A. Always.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not ask him to be on his guard, to give a correct account, or whether he accounted for all the money he had received? - A. He did not account for any money whatever from any person; we took his receipts, every one back, as he went out with; he said nobody had paid him.</p>
               <p>- PAAS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp Q. You live at Walworth, and you bought beer of Messrs. Eldridge and Co.? - A. Yes, for five or six months I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you purchase any beer of the prisoner on the 27th? - A. One small cask; I paid him 4 s. 9 d. for it on account of his master, thinking he paid it to him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you take any receipt of him for it? - A. I asked him before I had that cask if he had got a printed receipt; he said it was of no consequence' as I paid on delivery.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether it was not his duty to give receipts for every sum of money he received, whether ready money customers or not? A. Always.</p>

             accompanied me to my house, and gave me the keys again; the same keys were in my possession till the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of some information, the next day at twelve o'clock you went to this warehouse again? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find the goods of the warehouse when you arrived there? - A. The greater part of the goods that I had seen the night before I found missing; I saw them afterwards at Worship-street Police-office.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray how is this warehouse situated with respect to the dwelling-house of Mr. Topham? - A. When my brother took the warehouse, the door out of the passage was open; there is a door from the passage into the warehouse from the passage of the private house.</p>
               <p>Q. That is Mr. Topham's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean inside of the outward door of the private house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the front of the passage is the street-door - at the further end of the passage is there any direct communication into the house of Mr. Topham? - A. There was by this door; but after my brother took this warehouse, Mr. Topham requested he would fasten it up; there is a lock on the inside, and a bolt on the outside.</p>
               <p>Q. So that no one of the house could come into the warehouse, nor your brother could not go into Mr. Topham's house without each other's consent? - A. No, and separate doors into the street.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time your brother was absent? - A. He was not at the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the warehouse entrusted into your care? - A. It was the request of my brother that the keys should be left at my house, and that I would call at the warehouse to see all was right; my brother was not in town when this robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Your brother had the misfortune since that time to become a bankrupt? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time this happened at the warehouse, did you join in paying the rent for the warehouse? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any interest in any part of the goods that were in the warehouse? - A. My brother and I had been in partnership, but our partnership ended the last day of the year 1804.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all your goods sold previous to the dissolution of your partnership? - A. There were about four hundred pounds worth of goods left, which my brother took himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that expressed in your dissolution? - A. It was between my brother and me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any part of the goods at this time when it was broke open and robbed, that were part of the stock in partnership? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear positively? - A. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180071"/>believe there were none; I say to the best of my knowledge, because I had not the direction of his business; I believe he had none left, I believe I can safely swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to send the key to you? - A. It was a request of my brother when he went to Manchester, he asked me to take care of the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was not the key left with you to protect your property as well as your brother's? - A. No, I had no property there at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Upon the oath that you have taken, are not you and your brother in partnership now? - A. No, we have not been in partnership since we parted in any way whatever.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. How far is Noble-street from Basing-lane? - A. I cannot say, I do not know that I know it.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Gurney. Q. How far from your house does Doe live? - A. About eight or ten doors.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning of the 12th of July what time were you up? - A.About a quarter after four.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look out into the street? - A. I generally look out into the street of a morning to see what o'clock it is to go to my work; I looked out into the street that morning; I saw a coach standing at Doe's door.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a coach? - A. A hackney coach, the coachman was standing at the horses' heads; and then he went down to the end of the street, making answers to them, saying, go on; and some man that stood by the coach door, began to take parcels out of the coach, and chucked them into the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you do not know who that person was that was chucking them into the passage? - A. No: the parcels were in a coarse bag, and were like them.</p>
               <p>Q.What might be the size of them? - A. It might be the same size as they are (pointing to the packages that were then produced); they were large packages.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the packages? - A. They chucked them on the house stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there more than one person employed in this? - A. There was one person employed in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180072"/>taking them out of the coach and chucking them on the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see or hear any more? - A. I was not near enough.</p>
               <p>Q.After the packages were taken out of the coach what became of the coachman? - A. The coachman got on the box and backed the coach towards Aldersgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q.How was Doe's street door? - A. I did not particularly notice that; I think, to the best of my knowledge, as soon as the parcels were taken in they shut the door directly, and the coach, within a few minutes afterwards, went away; when the coach was gone away, two persons came out of Doe's and went towards Aldersgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. After you observed two men come out of Doe's house where did you go to? - A. Then I went out and knocked at my mother's door; I saw, when I went past Doe's door, somebody come out of Doe's, and they asked him how long he should be; he made answer about an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you are not able to speak to the person, whether it was a man or a woman? - A. I cannot tell; in a few minutes afterwards I saw Doe come out of his own house, and walk towards Old-street; he had not been gone many minutes before I followed him; I met him returning from the corner of Gee-street; he then went up stairs again at his own house; I then watched him, and he came down stairs again with a bottle in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. You watched him from Gee-street to his own house - when he went up stairs how long was it before he came down again? - A. About five or ten minutes; then I saw him come out of his own house, and I watched him out; he had not been gone ten minutes, time enough to get to his dye-house, when he came back again; I saw then, some time afterwards (it might be half an hour), Higgins and another man at the end of the street, who had on a blue coat and a swansdown waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was that? - A. About six o'clock, or nigh upon it; Higgins walked several times by me.</p>
               <p>Q. What persons did you see next? - A. I saw two men come out of Mr. Doe's place, one of them had on a brown great coat; they walked towards Old-street; the other had on a blue coat; they crossed over each other before they got to Old-street, this was Higgins and the other man, one turned down Old-street, and the other kept down Aldersgate-street; I followed him as far as I work, which is at No. 101; I then went to my work, I saw no more of them till I came back to breakfast, which was about a quarter or twenty minutes after eight; then I saw Higgins walking up the other side of the way to Mr. Doe's house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were returning home, where did you see Higgins first, in what street? - A. He was in Goswell-street, about two or three doors from Doe's house, but he was of the other side of the way, he walked on towards Compton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you? - A. I went and told Mr. Armstrong, and Mr. Armstrong called after him, and stopped him.</p>
               <p>Q. You immediately gave information to Armstrong? - A. Yes, he followed him, and called out stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Armstrong call out stop thief A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Higgins then? - A. He ran away up Compton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the person that ran away was the prisoner Higgins - did you see him? - A. Yes, I saw him so many times passing before that I took notice of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You say this was about six o'clock? - A. Yes, I saw him before that, about two hours before he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Q. When was the first time in the morning that you first saw Higgins? - A. I cannot pretend to say which, it was in the morning that he went down Old-street or Aldersgate-street, I saw him then.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You saw Higgins at six o'clock, was that the same man you had seen before walking backwards and forwards? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Q. The first time that you saw Doe was when you saw him come out of his own house? - A. Yes, going towards Old-street.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did he remain in Doe's house? - A. No longer than they filled the bag; two women brought it down full, and he came out of the house with it full.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you watch him to see where he carried that full bag to - to what place did he carry it to?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180073"/>- A. He carried it to a tobacconist's in Golden-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that Cable's? - A. I believe that was the name.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he stay in Cable's house? - A. About a minute or two; when he came out, he had no bag, as I saw then, at all, and in about ten minutes he returned to Doe's house; then I saw he had a bag in his hand when he came to Doe's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing when he came to Doe's house? - A. He said, I have brought your bag, Mrs. Doe, and when he came out again he had a large parcel; I watched him; he took that to Golden-lane to the same place.</p>
               <p>Q. In his way to Golden-lane did he meet with any body? - A. When you go from Noble-street to Golden-lane you have to cross Old-street, and when he came as far as Golden-lane, Higgins came to the side of him, and said something to him, which I could not hear.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Clark do immediately after Higgins said something that you could not hear? - A. He went on, and Higgins went alongside of him till they came to the tobacconist's shop; Higgins crossed over, and Clark took that into Cable's likewise; then Armstrong came sometime after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Armstrong was fetched by the order of your mother? - A.Yes. first of all to Noble-street; he went into Mr. Doe's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go in with him? - A. No; I saw him come out, and then I went with him to the tobacconist's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him take Higgins? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the shop in which you had seen Clark take the parcels? - A. Yes; we went into the shop; we asked if any thing had been left in the shop, and while we were there Clark came in, and I pointed out Clark to Mr. Armstrong; Clark said he came in for half an ounce of tobacco; Mr. Armstrong took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What you have been speaking of now, relates to the 12th of July? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to what passed on the 11th of July, you know nothing at all of? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore all that you saw pass was at Doe's house, which is in the country of Middlesex? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw Clark go into the house, he had an empty bag - you saw him bring things out, but did not see him take any thing in the bag? - A. No, only an empty bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen Clark before this time in your life? - A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear positively to the person of a man that you had never seen before? - A. I saw him walk up and down; I knew him again, I can swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation upon this business with Mr. Armstrong? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard that there is a forty pounds reward? - A. Never in my life.</p>

            , the first witness? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning of the 12th of July, did you look into the street? - A. Yes, as soon as I had dressed myself.</p>
               <p>Q. When you looked into the street, what did you observe? - A. I saw nothing extraordinary at Mrs. Doe's door then, but some straw at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see Mrs. or Mr. Doe? - A. I saw Mr. Doe come out with some bread and butter and a bottle in his hand; he was eating, and after Mr. Doe went out, Mrs. Doe came down stairs and swept the door; she swept it into the kennel.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the straw? - A. The remains of the straw laid in the kennel; she swept it from her door a good way down the street; I saw Clark come up about five o'clock, or after, he was alone with Mrs. Doe; they came out of Doe's house together, and went to the wine-vaults at the corner, and returned together, and they stood in the street talking together as they came out of the door; I was as close to them, and closer, than I am to you: I heard Clark say he would see her husband at breakfast time, at nine o'clock; I saw Clark come back again with a man very much like a Jew about half an hour afterwards; he went up stairs. I went and told Mr. Geary, and when I came back I saw Mr. Higgins and another man standing at the bottom of Noble-street; Higgins kept looking up the street; I passed him, and looked him full in the face, I am positive it was him; I went up to my own door; I saw Clark go up stairs; I did not see him come down at that time. After that, in about half an hour, Higgins returned home; after that I saw Clark turning out of Noble-street with a bag at his back full of something, and go up Gee-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the way to Golden-lane? - A. Yes, you can turn down there to Golden-lane, and I saw a man with him, and when he saw me he drew his head back.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that man? - A. Higgins; I saw no more of Higgins till I saw Mr. Armstrong.</p>
               <p>- ARMSTRONG sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. In consequence of information on the 12th of July, in the morning, did you go to Doe's house in Noble-street? - A. About eight o'clock, or a quarter after, when I went to Doe's house, Mrs. Doe was sitting at the bottom of the stairs (that goes up from the one pair of stairs to the two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180074"/>pair) with a child in her arms. I then asked her if she had any goods brought in there that morning; she said she did not know; I said, do you let any place out; she said she let a room out to a decent man, and I believe his name is Brown; I then passed her, and I went up two pair of stairs, and these goods that are here now were all lying on the floor with the packages open, and the padlock of that door was lying in the window, and no person in that room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask her how these goods came? - A. I asked her if they were her own; she said, no, she knew nothing about them; I then sent for a coach, and we were putting a number of packages in the coach, leaving an officer up stairs, another with Mrs. Doe, and another with the coach; I received information from Blackwell.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what Blackwell told you, did you go towards Goswell-street? - A. Yes, I was crossing it, when I saw a person standing at the end of Compton-street; I was not near enough to know the face of that man at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. The end of Compton-street is opposite to Noble-street? - A. It is not opposite, it is in that direction; that person, as I crossed over the road, saw I was walking fast towards him; I could perceive his eye caught me; he turned round, and began a fast trot at first; I called out, stop thief; then he ran, and I ran after him. When I turned into Compton-street, I saw Higgins walking, I dare say he was twenty-five yards before me down the street; I said, Higgins, I want you.</p>
               <p>Q. And you took him? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say whether that person that ran from the corner was Higgins or not? - A. I should believe that it was, it had every appearance of him except the face, which I did not see at that time. Then I brought Higgins to where the coach was and the other officers, and I turned him round and said, look at the back of this man's coat; the back of his coat was covered all over with flew; his coat had that sort of flew on it which would have come on a coat if a person had been carrying parcels of that kind; I put him in the coach with Mrs. Doe and the officers, and the coachman drove the coach, I walking by the side of that coach to the end of Golden-lane.</p>

I did, I produce them; these were under the counter in the shop, (shewing them,) and these were up one pair of stairs; I found two parcels at Cable's, they are Manchester goods, cottons, and corduroys. While I was there, the prisoner Clark came in; I said to Mason, secure him; I turned him round, and shewed his coat to Mason, his coat was just like Higgins's; then I took them and the goods to the Office; I have had the care of them ever since, they have been under my lock and key.</p>

               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Q. Mrs. Doe told you that a man lived there of the name of Brown, did not she tell you that was his apartment where the goods were found? - A. She told me that she knew nothing about them.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Had you sold any goods to Mr. William Smith shortly before this robbery? - A. I had; I can speak to the printed calicoes, they have got my name on them; I had frequently seen them at his warehouse after I had sold them.</p>
               <p>Armstrong. They were all found at Doe's.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr.

            .) You are the person who locked the warehouse door? - A. Yes, I double-locked it; it had a catch besides, which fastened of itself.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Young.) In the morning in what state did you find the catch? - A.The catch was fastened up with a piece of wood.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Richards.) Were these goods in the warehouse the night before the robbery? - A. They were, I am sure of it, because I had taken an inventory of them; they were not there the morning after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. There is not sufficient evidence to go to the Jury with respect to Doe and his wife.</p>
               <p>Court. With respect to Doe, it will be evidence to go to the Jury; and respecting the wife, how far she is implicated in any thing without the presence of her husband, we shall see; probably that may be the result upon looking over the evidence.</p>
               <p>Clark's defence. I am conscious of my innocency, I have been always honestly employed; I have called upon Young, the porter, several times; he knew me, and that I was in a respectable situation; I called on him out of friendship, I work for Messrs. Wynne and Ayres. There is no proof whatever that I committed the robbery, I was going to work when I called into Mr. Cable's, and asked for half an ounce of tobacco.</p>
               <p>Higgins's defence. As to what Mr. Armstrong has been saying about my coat, it was a coat that I used to wear of a morning, and used to go up and down there in that street two or three times of a day.</p>
               <p>Doe left his defence to his Counsel.</p>

             sworn. - Mrs. Gadd being ill, I took her place at that time in taking the money; I was a waiter there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, on the 25th of July, how many notes you took in the course of the day? - A. There were six one-pound notes taken in the course of that day belonging to Mr. Gadd; I had put them in a bowl in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner do any thing in the course of the day? - A. I saw her take two notes out of the bowl on the 25th of July, about half past four in the afternoon; I was coming across the shop at the time; I saw her take them from the bowl and put them in her bosom.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they were two notes? - A. I saw them separate in her hands; I immediately asked Mr. Gadd how many notes he had left in the bowl, he said six; I said Mary must have taken two; then she was called in; at first she denied having taken any; I did not see her searched.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bolland. Q. Did you give any account before the Magistrate of having seen her take these notes? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw her take distinctly two notes; you then asked your master how many there were, in order to ascertain how many were gone; he said six, then you said Mary must have taken two? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you put any mark to these notes? - A. No; I cannot swear to them.</p>
               <p>- BLUNDLE sworn. - I am a constable: In consequence of information that I received from Mr. Gadd, about a quarter before five in the afternoon, on the 25th of July, I searched the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you searched her did you question her? - A. I asked her if she had the notes; she said no; I told her, if she had, to give them up; I then proceeded to search her; she resisted; at last we conducted her to her bed room, and I searched her as narrowly as I could, and between her stocking and her shoe I found a one-pound note (I produce it); I then supposed that I had searched her every where; I took the note to Mr. Gadd; I went up again to search her, and as I got upon the last stair, the nurse called out, I observe something chewing in her mouth; I went to her, but I could not perceive what it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bolland. Q. She objected to your searching her, you said; whether that objection was not arising from modesty? - A. I told her, in the first place, I was a family man; she seemed intoxicated in liquor.</p>

I was; I saw him find a one-pound note in her shoe; when he came up stairs again, he said there was another missing; I told him that I fancied she had it in her mouth; Mr. Blundle came and examined; she had a lump in her cheek; I did not see what it was, nor what became of it.</p>

               <p>Q. When had you occasion to go up to your bed-room? - A. At ten o'clock in the morning, and my watch was not there; I wanted to put it in my fob, as I used to do of a morning.</p>

             was the only man that returned after eight o'clock; the watch was there at nine, my servant took it in her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How early had you seen the prisoner in your house in the morning? - A. Between six and seven, I let him in in the morning myself; upon my missing the watch about ten o'clock, I made no enquiry about it at that time; sometimes my wife takes it down stairs herself; I went into the City upon business; returning home about one o'clock, I made enquiry about it.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of your enquiry about it, did you afterwards find your watch? - A. I saw my watch between eleven and twelve o'clock at night; it was brought to me by Mr. Miller, the prisoner's master.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner having taken your watch of your own knowledge? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever speak to the prisoner about it? - A. I did, as I was asking my wife about it, when I returned to my business out of the City; I asked my wife if she had brought the watch down stairs; she said, no; I immediately ran up stairs, and looked for the watch; I said, it is not there; I went and fetched the constable, and had him taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to the prisoner when you brought the constable? - A. I told him that he had got my watch; he declared he knew nothing of it; I asked him several times, and he denied that he had got it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told him it would be better for him to tell you? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then we must not hear what he said - Do you know any thing more of this business? - A. I asked the servant-maid, in the prisoner's hearing, if he had been up stairs; she said he had</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say to that? - A. He did not deny it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of this watch? - A. Nine pounds; it was a metal watch capped and jewelled, it cost me nine guineas, exclusive of the seal; the seal cost me two pounds eighteen shillings, and the key cost me either half a guinea, or twelve shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a gold seal? - A. It was, with my own initials.</p>
               <p>Q. When the watch was brought you back, have you kept it ever since? - A. No, I give it to the constable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You say, in the morning there were two men at work - were you gone out before they went to breakfast? - A. No, and I know there was only this one man come back.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it that the other man went to breakfast? - A. About eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner, you say, went up stairs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was his business to go up stairs? - A. Yes; that was when the other man was with him, before breakfast, it was not afterwards; it was finished at the top of the house when the other man went away.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The whole house was painted? - A. No, only a little of the back part of the house, in a gutter at the top of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the house was this watch left? - A. In the two pair of stairs</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Was the two pair of stairs painted at all? - A. It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the gutter was finished before the other man went away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>- sworn. - Q. Are you a servant of Mr. Andrews? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen your master's watch the day it was taken? - A. Yes, at a little after nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it when you saw it last? - A. It hung on my master's curtains in his bed-room, as it usually did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at your house painting? - A. Yes, he came between six and seven o'clock in the morning along with another man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at any time of the day in the two pair of stairs room? - A. No, I did not see him in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him up on the two pair of stairs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was that? - A.A little after ten o'clock I saw him on the two pair of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180080"/>stairs; he told me he went up to finish the skylight; I saw him go up the first flight of stairs; he took some stuff out of the garden, and told me he wanted to finish the sky-light that looks down on the stairs going into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Where he was going up, could he get at that sky-light? - A. He could not, without getting out into the yard, and getting on the top of the house, and that he had no business to do; it was finished before breakfast; he asked me if he might have the steps in the garden; I told him he might have them; I was then coming out of the little parlour; he told me somebody called me before he went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body want you at that time? - A.No, my mistress and master were both in the shop; I told him, nobody called me, after I had been to see; he then said he heard somebody call me two or three times; he was then stuffing some putty in the holes of the cupboard before he painted it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what time he came down stairs? - A. Yes, he was not up stairs three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see whether he went as high as the two pair of stairs? - A. I did not watch him, I had not the least suspicion when he told me and insisted that somebody called me; I told him there was not; he went up stairs, and came down again, and finished painting of the yard-door.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that your master went up stairs after the prisoner had been up stairs? - A. Yes; and in the mean time my master went up stairs the prisoner left his work; he took up his painting-pot, and left the house; I asked him whether he had finished; he said he had not, he was going with his painting-pot, and should return again; that was while my master went up stairs to clean himself. I never saw him afterwards till he returned at dinner-time, and my master came in at the time; he missed his watch, and my master charged my mistress with having the watch; she said she had not got it; he asked me whether I had seen the watch; I told my master I had no occasion to go up that morning after nine o'clock. My master then sent for a constable, and the prisoner made a good many oaths that he had never seen the watch in any part of the house, nor had he passed the door of the two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have been talking a good deal of sky-lights, I am told that there was no sky-light, only the trap-door - might not he go up to paint the trap-door? - A. No, that was finished; I know it was finished, because the old man said it was finished when he went away to breakfast.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not go to fasten the trap-door? - A. There was no occasion for that.</p>
               <p>Q. When he returned he went to work in the yard, and continued till about eleven or twelve o'clock? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master then returned, and he went away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been out of the house before that? - A. Yes, he went home with his painting-pot about ten o'clock, while my master was gone up to clean himself.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he come from breakfast? - A. At nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that was it before he went home with his painting-pot when your master went up stairs? - A. Between ten and eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he had been an hour and a half in the house - he might have gone away before your master returned? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not another man return after breakfast? - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I am told the other man returned with the painting-pot? - A. No, he did not; the other man did not return all the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the other man return to fetch a pot of colour from your house? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You know as well as I do that he came, and certainly did bring a pot of colour with him? - A. He did not.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Were you the employer of this prisoner? - A. Yes: On Thursday, the 11th of July, I sent this man with another man to Mr. Andrews's to paint some trunks at the back part of the house; in the morning I sent two men, because it was an awkward part to get at at the top part of the house; when that was done, there was no necessity for any more than one man. These men remained there till eight o'clock; the other man came to the shop, and I sent this man back to finish the lower part of the house, which he could do himself. I never saw nor heard any thing of him till half after ten o'clock; then he rung the shop-bell; I went down, and let him in; he brought two paint-pots in with him: I said, Joseph, have you done; he said, yes, Sir, I have done all but the trunk that runs along the skylight, Mr. Andrews wishes to have it painted, but it is very full of dirt and wet. He took his paint-pots up stairs, and brought a ladder, and he left the shop-door open; I was surprised to see the shop-door left open; I went into the accompting-house, I did not say any thing to him; in about a quarter of an hour I saw him come out of the privy, and he went out. I never heard any more about this business till after twelve: Mr. Andrews came and said, your man has stole my watch; good God, says I, is it possible; he said he had. Mr. Andrews's shop-door is constructed in this kind of way: there is no private door at all to the house; every person must go through the shop to go into the house. Mr. Andrews said, I wish you would come down and hold him in conversation while I go for a constable; I went, and the prisoner was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180081"/>coming through the parlour; I kept him in conversation; he told me he had finished, and just as I was making him a reply, Mr. Andrews came in with the constable. When they came into the parlour, I said, Mr. Andrews accuses you of stealing his watch; me! says he, I know nothing at all of the watch. They took him to Marlborough-street, I did not attend that day; I should have gone to Marlborough-street, but I had not done with the Grand Jury, and that day I did not return home till ten o'clock at night. During the time the prisoner came in with the paint-pots at my house, I was called to another part of the house; when I came back again I met this man coming out of the privy which is made for the men of the shop; it struck me, when I came home at night, that it might be concealed in this privy; I found the watch in the privy where I saw the prisoner come out; I should not have had suspicion to have looked there, had not I have seen him come out when he came from Mr. Andrews's with the paint-pots. When I found the watch I took it down to Mr. Andrews's between eleven and twelve o'clock at night; I gave it to Mr. Andrews, and he gave it to the constable himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you have a character with this man? - A. In my profession we cannot take characters, it is not like a servant.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Several hours afterwards the watch was found in your privy? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. All your men have access to that place? - A. They could not before the next day, they could not return home till the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. They might have gone if they had been in the shop - am I to understand you that none of your men were at home? - A. Yes; there were none there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that none of them were at home? - A. There were two men came home at dinner-time, I was with them; they did not go into the privy; I was at home till half after four o'clock, and there was no man came home till after their day's work was done.</p>
               <p>Q. Your men came home in the evening? - A. Yes, then there were some of my family in the way.</p>
               <p>Q. You went out at half after four o'clock, and staid till ten? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Your men came home in the evening - they might or might not have gone unknown to you? - A. Not unknown to my family.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You say you sent only two men, of which the prisoner was one - the other person returned to you before nine o'clock, and never went afterwards? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. And after nine o'clock the prisoner was the only person employed in painting this house? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>- HAWTHORN sworn. - I am a constable of St. Ann's, Soho; I took the prisoner into custody, and at night, between eleven and twelve, the watch was brought to me; I have had it ever since, I produce the watch.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosecutor) What parish is your house in? - A. St. Ann's, Soho</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that watch, seal, and key, are they all your's? - A.They are.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you sober? - A. I was sober; I had a friend with me; he was very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. And you went to take care of him; you fell asleep? - A. Yes; I slept till a man came to me; I felt him take my watch out of my pocket; he ran away, and I ran after him, calling out stop thief; he was stopped by a constable a little way further off, in the same street; I was not far behind him when he was taken; the witness that took him was shutting up his shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of your watch? - A. The witness had it afterwards; he found it on him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all you know is, that you fell fast asleep; you felt a man take your watch out of your pocket; you ran after him, and cried out stop thief? - A. Exactly so.</p>

               <p>Q. What is he? - A. A hackney-coachman; he drives for a master; when I took hold of him, he immediately said, I live here, let me lay my key down; there was a place withinside the palisades, where he pretended to lay the key down, and it fell out to be the watch; I desired the watchman to pick it up while I held him; he did, and gave it to me when we got to the watch-house. I produce the watch. (The watch identified by the prosecutor.).</p>

               <p>Q. I was told that there were two or three other men running at the same time? - A. There was no one running at the same time but the watchman and me.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not pick up the watch; you took him to the watch-house first, before you saw the watch? - A. No; I saw him lay it down, and here is the watchman that picked it up; he broke the glass of the watch in laying it down.</p>

             sworn. - I am shopman to Mr. Pearson: On the 14th of September, between six and seven in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop to look at some black silk stockings; I shewed her some embroidered ones; the paper contained ten pair; she wished to see some lace clocks; I shewed her a paper containing fourteen pair; she offered me twelve shillings for a pair of lace clocks; I told her, I could not take less than thirteen and sixpence; then she wished to see some broader lace clocks than what I had shewed her; I told her they would come higher, they would be fourteen shillings; she said, that was higher than she intended to give, she thought she could get them cheaper elsewhere: At that time there was one pair of embroidered clocks which laid by the side of the lace clocks on the counter; I turned my head to see if I had any that might suit her, and turning my head back again, I found a pair of embroidered was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw something move? - A. I did not; I found the embroidered pair was gone; I turned over the lace clocks to make myself positive, thinking perhaps she might have put them amongst them; not finding them there, I was thoroughly convinced that she must have taken them; the prisoner said, if I would not take her money, she must go elsewhere, she immediately got up, and went out: I went after her, and told her I was sorry to lay under the disagreeable necessity of detaining her for taking a pair of stockings, which she denied: I told her, if she looked in the tail of her gown, where she put them, she would find them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they? - A. I took hold of her and opened her hand, and in the tail of her gown,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180084"/>which the had been holding in her hand, were the stockings; I brought her into the shop and sent for a constable; I gave charge of her, and I gave the constable the stockings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Who else was in the shop? - A. There was a young lady and Mrs. Pearson.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you told her when she went out of the shop, that she had got them in the tail of her gown - therefore you suspected that she had got them in the tail of her gown? - A. I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Had she any thing else in her hand? - A. Yes, a parasol.</p>
               <p>Q. She had the parasol and the tail of her gown in her hand, and the stockings in the tail of her gown? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear positively, you having suspected and told her she would find them in the tail of her gown, that it was not by accident? - A. It could not be by accident.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a muslin gown? - A. I cannot say; it was a white gown; I have not been able to ascertain whether it was muslin or no.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a white gown and a long train? - A. I cannot answer whether it was a long train or a short one.</p>
               <p>Q. The lady had it in her hand when she came into the shop and when she went out; I should suppose if a lady's train was not long, she would not hold it up? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. When you stopped her what did she say? - A. She denied having them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say when you found them? - A. She said, good God! so I have! She seemed very much confused.</p>
               <p>Q. I should think so too - upon your oath was that all she said? - A. I believe that was all she said; I was as much confused as she was.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Mrs. Pearson serve in the shop? - A. Occasionally; she was not then serving in the shop, Mrs. Pearson and her friends were in the back shop; a young lady stood at the side of me while I was serving the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. There was a young woman in the shop standing by the side of you - was she a shop-woman? - A. As occasion requires she assists in the shop; she did not see her take the stockings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. She should have been here to tell us herself, because she stood next to you, and therefore she might have seen it, if her head was not turned on one side. - A. Certainly it is possible she might.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. She was near enough to see it? - A. She was close by the side of me.</p>
               <p>- STONEHOUSE sworn. - Q. You are a constable? - A. Yes; I produce the stockings. (The stockings identified by Leech.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. If you think proper I will state the circumstance as it happened, if it will be any satisfaction to your Lordship and the Gentlemen of the Jury: When I went to buy the stockings, this is the gown I had on at the time (shewing the gown), it was a nice dress gown; I held it up a great deal, and when I went into Mr. Pearson's shop, it was about six o'clock in the afternoon, I asked him to let me see some black silk stockings, which he brought; I told him I did not like them, they were not so good as I wanted them, I wished to see others; he brought another parcel, they were not the clock that I wanted; I wanted to see open lace gores; these stockings lay on the counter; I then looked at the open lace ones, and they were striped down the gore; I told him I wanted them as good as I could get them, and as rich; I would thank him to let me have a pair of clear lace gores; he looked, and found a parcel of this description, he said; and when I examined them, I made him sensible that the description of stockings that I wanted, the gore ran broader at the bottom; he made me answer, the reason he did not shew me them was because they were of too large a size for me; I said I believed he was right, but if he would look out a short size of that pattern, I would be obliged to him; he then found a pair, which I looked at; he told me the price was thirteen shillings, I told him I would give him twelve shillings, he said he would not take less than thirteen shillings; I said to him, you have been always in the habit of asking thirteen and taking twelve, take the twelve and I will have these stockings, if you will not, you will oblige me to go elsewhere; he said, I cannot help it, I will not take less than thirteen; with that I took up my train off the counter (the young woman came out of the parlour), I held my train up and took my parasol, and bid them good evening; and when I was going some way from the door, he came after me; he said you have got something that does not belong to you: I returned back with him; he said, if you look in your gown tail, you will find the stockings; I said, good God Almighty! you astonish me! I let my gown tail fall, and, to my utter astonishment, as well as the young man's, I saw the stockings. I am an innocent woman, I never knew they were there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Stonehouse.) Q. You found some money on her? - A. I found two half guineas and twelve and sixpence in silver in her pocket.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. The only reason of your apprehending him was because he was a transport? - A. No other reason.</p>
               <p>Q. Now prisoner, if you have any pardon, or any order for your discharge, you must produce it? - A. I have a letter which I had wrote for since I was taken, which I received from the ship (the letter handed to the Court); Mr. Homan knows that I received this letter; I was ruptured by a fall from the fore-top-yard; I was sent on shore as a disabled man, they would not have me any longer; after that, where was I to come but to my wife and family; I am both fractured and ruptured.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mr. Hawker? - A. A navy agent at Plymouth.</p>
               <p>Q. These are not the proper documents; certainly when you were discharged they ought to have given you your discharge? - A. There were more than twenty sent on shore, and they never gave a man of them a discharge; I begged hard, and asked them for it particularly, telling them I was a convict; they considered me being a convict that I had no right to it; Mr. Kirby knows that I had my pardon.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any body to prove that fact? - A. Mr. Kirby could if he was here.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were disabled they would have granted you a certificate of that? - A. They considered my being a convict that I had no right to any thing of the kind; they even told me they would slog me if I came on board again; they told me I was not fit for the service, as I had a fracture on my skull; they sent me on shore on account of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you light of this accident? - A. About four months before I left the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any evidence that I can state to the Jury on your behalf, or any witness of any kind? - A. I have no witness to come forward to state any thing.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of any information, did you go to the house of Mrs. Martin? - A. I did; her house is in Princes-court, Drury-lane; she was at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any lead which corresponded in appearance with the lead that you had in this place? - A. Yes, it appeared by the smell to come from a place of that description; Mr. Lane asked Mrs. Martin how she came by it; she said, that Mr. Edwards's men had left it there to exchange for patent pipe.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you authorised your men to leave it there? - A. No such thing; she was taken up, and the lead was taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it correspond so as to make you partly sure that it was part of that lead? - A. It did; the two angles at the bottom corresponded where it had been cut off, the solder of the lead in one had been cut from the other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I understood you, that, in Mrs. Martin's place, you found the lead - she is a plumber? - A. Her husband was.</p>
               <p>Q. When you have done your work, you take what old materials there are, and allow for them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This has never been delivered to you, nor has ever been in your possession, of course you would never allow for that which you never received? - A. No, I would not allow for what I never had.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You watched the men the whole time they were at work? - A. The principal time, not all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you give your son instructions to attend the cart? - A. He was instructed; I was not there then.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You are a porter in Lincoln's Inn? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 2d of August, between twelve and one o'clock, were you in Lincoln's Inn? - A. I was in the Inn; I saw the cart, and saw the lead taken from the privy loaded in the cart by the three men at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the cart drive away? - A. I did not, but I saw the cart after I had got out of the Inn in Lincoln's-Inn-fields; I knew it, because it was the same cart, and the three prisoners at the bar were with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the cart nearly facing the bottom of Portugal-street? - A. Yes, between that and Bear-yard, and there were two pieces of lead stood against the post out of the cart; I knew them by the make up, and by the soil on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the cart? - A. The cart was standing a few yards from the post where the lead was, the cart did not stop long; as soon as they went away with the pieces of lead, the cart went on; Jackson and Suddery took each of them a piece of the lead on their shoulder that had stood against the post, the carman drove the cart up Little Queen-street; I followed them some way, but I could not walk fast enough to keep up with them; they went along Duke-street, which leads to Drury-lane from Lincoln's-Inn-fields.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You say you saw two of the prisoners stand near a post where some lead was? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to say that you saw the lead in a cart, it was near a cart - it was in Lincoln's-Inn-fields you saw the cart, you were a good way from the cart? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your eye-sight very good? - A. Rather-bad.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if you were a considerable distance from the cart, how do you know it was the same cart? - A. I knew it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I recollect he said he knew it, because it was the same cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you also see the prosecutor's son with the cart in Lincoln's-Inn-fields? - A. Yes, I know his person, but I do not recollect seeing him when the lead stood against the post.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Do you remember on Saturday, the 3d of August, passing through Lincoln's-Inn-square? - A. Yes, about half past eleven; I saw these two children (pointing to them) walking with little Henry; I saw the prisoner at the bar having hold of little Henry's left hand with her right hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know these children before? - A. No, I said to the prisoner, poor little fellow, he can hardly walk alone; she said, no, Madam, he can but just walk; I took no further notice of the prisoner, I went to my employ. About half past one I heard of a little child being lost; I ran down stairs upon their saying it was with a little boy in a brown coat, and I said I saw a woman take<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180088"/>a child away in Lincoln's-Inn-fields. On the Tuesday after that I saw her sitting on Mr. Wood's steps, in Chancery-lane, and there I said she was the person that took the child away.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the prisoner is the woman that you saw with these three little children in Lincoln's-inn-square? - A. I am positive of it; she had on, then, a coarse black bombazeen gown, and a velvet bonnet; I am sure it is the same woman though she is not in the same dress.</p>

             sworn. - I am shopman to Mr. Thomas: I was very busy at the time a woman came past and called out, that somebody had taken our goods; I pursued the prisoner, and took her with the cotton in her apron; this is the remaining part that hung inside of the house; I produce the cotton I took from her: I overtook her in Flower-de-luce-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it was in your shop? - A. Yes; we have matched it, and it tallies exactly, and we have measured it, and it is the same quantity.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going through this court; I met a woman with a red cloak; she dropped this property, and this gentleman followed me and took me.</p>
               <p>Campion. There were two together when I pursued; they were running; when I got hold of this one she took her hand out of her apron, then I discovered this property.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Shadwell Office: On the 19th of July I received information by Mrs. Hunt, that her neighbour had been robbed of a great deal of wet linen, and that she suspected the person right over the workhouse yard; I went into Mrs. Conner's house, No. 3, Indian-garden, St. George's in the East, and there I found her a-bed, about eleven o'clock in the morning; Mews lives over head in the one pair of stairs room, in the same house, and there I saw, in Mews's room, a quantity of wet linen and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180089"/>stockings; I afterwards went into the garret, and there I saw the bed strewed all over with wet stockings, besides a large quantity of things on the line.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did that garret belong to? - A. To Mrs. Conner; I went back into the yard; I found lines tied up there; there were three wet sheets; I then went up the one pair of stairs again, and looked out of the landing-place window into Union-street, where I received information that the property was stolen from, right across the workhouse yard: I then called out to Mrs. Hunt (seeing partly the garden from where the property was taken), for her to come and see whether any of the wet linen belonged to any of the persons she knew; she came and spoke to some of the property; I then came down to Mrs. Conner, and told her she must get up; I asked her who the garret belonged to; she said the person was gone out ever since Monday; I asked her whether she took in washing, she said a little; I told her there was a great deal of wet linen, she said there was no doubt but it was all her's; I and Mr. Rogers took her and the property to the Office, and there were other people came and spoke to the property; Mrs. Mews was taken into custody two or three days afterwards; there was a waistcoat found in her room.</p>
               <p>Q. What property was found in Conner's room belonging to Mrs. Rumford? - A. Six check cotton shirts, and, I believe, fourteen pair of stockings, one single one, and two frocks; that was all, I believe, that was found in her room, the rest of the wet linen belonged to other neighbours; this waistcoat was found in Mews's room, Mrs. Hunt swears to that.</p>
               <p>Conner. (To Brown,) Q. Did you find any thing in my room where I sleep? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Conner. (To Rogers.) Q. Did you ever know any thing amiss of me than getting my living by hard labour? - A. You bear a very indifferent character.</p>

               <p>Q. Why do you accuse Mrs. Conner and Mews of it? - A. By a stocking being dropped in the workhouse yard, which is the direct road to Mrs. Conner's; as they carried them along they dropped a stocking; the other stocking was found in Mews's room.

               <p>Q. How do they generally navigate these barges? - A. Generally two men.</p>
               <p>Q.Bromley-lock is lower down the river than your part? - A. Yes, it is the entrance from Old Ford into the Thames.</p>

               <p>Q. The man that you found on board had the care of the barge? - A. He was standing there then; he let me go into the cabin; I asked him how the rope got there; he said, his master brought it there; when I returned, in about two hours afterwards, he was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have never seen him since? - A. No, he went away directly; I had the prisoner apprehended in an hour after I found the rope.</p>
               <p>- sworn. - I am a labourer to Mr. Killick: I saw the prisoner in the stack-yard between three and four o'clock in the morning, on the 18th of July; he had got a little beer cask in his hand belonging to Mr. Killick, he said he should be glad to find a little small beer, he said he was dry; I never saw him carry any thing away; I said to him, what do you do here; he said, I am very dry; I said haymakers are always dry; how came you to think of finding small beer here.</p>

             sworn. - I work at Mrs. Rixson's; she takes in washing: On the third of August I was there to assist her in ironing; about ten o'clock the prisoner came to Mrs. Rixson's and said he was going to Somers Town to receive some money; Mrs. Rixson gave him some bread and butter, and I gave him part of a pot of porter; he went away; he did not return till five o'clock in the afternoon, and then he brought a woman with him, and he asked Mrs. Rixson to let her sit down. After they had sat awhile, the woman sent for a pot of porter, and then they had half a pint of gin; the prisoner asked Mrs. Rixson to give his friend a cup of tea; and when we were sitting down at tea, the prisoner went out, and did not return till after tea; Mrs. Rixson went into the wash-house, and I went up to my ironing again; I heard the prisoner come in; I went down stairs, and there was some argument arose between him and the woman, about some money, and the woman and he left the house; in about half an hour after they were gone, Mrs. Rixson missed some silk stockings; she said some of the women had got them; the women were all very ready to strip; I said to Mr. Rixson, I would go to the prisoner at the bar, to know where that woman lives that came in with him. I went to the prisoner to know where this woman lived; I laid hold of his coat, seeing the stocking hang out of his pocket; I told him they were the property that I wanted; the prisoner lived as far as Tothil-street; he said the woman lived over the way; we walked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180093"/>back together as far as the Infirmary, then he struck me; I was going to carry the four stockings I had taken out of his pocket to Mr. Rixson's, when he drew out another stocking and a glove from his small-cloaths, I believe.</p>

In consequence of suspicion that I had, I searched the prisoner's apartment on the 8th of August, she was present; I opened the drawer where her things were put, she put her hand into the drawer, and took out a piece of paper, and said I might have all the rest; I told her I would have that; she said she had thrown it into the fire, and I might get it out, but I saw she had thrown it under the drawers; a lad picked it up, and gave it to me; I saw it was the same she threw down, she struggled for it very much.</p>

               <p>Q. What did the paper contain when it was picked up? - A. Four duplicates for five tablecloths and two tea-spoons; the five table-cloths were brought to Queen-square, and the two teaspoons, as the produce of the duplicates; I know the table-cloths to be Mr. Ireson's.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I am a poor servant unfortunately brought into trouble unthinkingly; when my master and mistress first accused me, they promised me both protection and liberty, and moreover agreed, that if I would pay for the things that were missing, or state the truth without even paying for them, they would forgive me, and not prosecute me. The hope of liberty, and the dread and fear of confinement, induced me to criminate myself; I hope the merciful Judge and Jury will take my case into consideration, and be as favourable as they can, as it is my first offence; thus, on my bended knees, I implore for mercy.</p>

            , Carlisle Mews, Bedford-square: Last Friday was a week, the ostler of the Red Lion came and ordered a chaise and four, and one saddle horse, to go out; we took up at the Red Lion, in Tottenham-court-road; after waiting there twenty minutes for the prisoner, who came in a hackney-coach, he got into the chatle, and ordered us to drive to the Load of Hay, at Haverstock-hill, two miles and a half out of town; when we arrived there, he got out of the chaise, and went into the house.</p>
               <p>Q.Where were you hired to go? - A. To Hounslow at first; when he came out of the house, he brought a soldier with him; he got into the chaise, and said, turn about, my lads, he ordered us to drive to Hampstead; he said to the soldier, take my stick, and thrash the rascals; the prisoner then came out of the chaise, and gave me several violent blows.</p>
               <p>Q. Which horses did you drive? - A. I drove the leaders.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he went to the other lad, and served him the same? - A. Yes, that is my master; he got into the chaise, and ordered us to Hampstead; I told him any where where he pleased; we went up to Mrs. White's, a stay-maker's, I believe we asked him which was the house; he said, he would stop us when we came to the house. When we came to the house, there was a young woman at the door, and when the prisoner got up to the door, she knocked first; she cried out do not let him in, he is so and so, and she ran away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She said he is a madman, he is a madman.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Witness.) What were the words the young woman said, do not let him in - what were the words that she used? - A. He wanted to take Sally, I believe she said.</p>
               <p>Q. The young woman said, do not let him in, he is coming to take Sally away? - A. Yes; the prisoner said to the young woman, what do you mean by that? he ran after her, but could not catch her; he returned again to the door, and came up to Mr. Clarkson's servant, who was in a gig, and pulled him out; the young man got away from him, the prisoner ran after him farther than I could see. When the prisoner returned, I was standing at Mr. White's door, I asked him if he caught the young man he ran after; he made me no answer, but caught hold of my coat, and cut me in the lip with a knife; I caught hold of his two arms to defend myself, and with my struggling about he cut me on the shoulder; I called out for assistance, I said, come, master, for God's sake come, or else I shall be murdered. He came to my assistance, and defended me as well as he could, and as soon as I saw an opportunity, I put my leg under him, and threw him on the ground, and we kept him there till the constable came; he cut me about six inches across the shoulder, this is the knife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. It was nothing of any wound on your shoulder that happened in the scuffle, how was your lip cut? - A. Right through to my teeth; he had the knife in his hand, but whether it was the blade of the knife, or any thing else, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Whether it was before the constable came that he saw I had a knife about me? - - A. It was before.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether I brought the soldier out of the house, or whether he said you are using that gentleman ill, at Haverstock-hill; I said, I am an old soldier, and he promised he would take care - that was after I had given you and your comrade the beating? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Then I took the trooper with me, thinking I should have some assistance against these youths; he ran away as soon as the battle came on, he was not steel to the battle, he was not a man of my heart, he was not point valiant, he did not stand by me at all.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What did you wish him to stand by you for? - A. He saw I was in danger of being ill used by these rascals; I will tell you my story by-and-by, only I will put them to rights now and then, when they swerve from the truth.</p>

             sworn. - I am a post-master; I was driving the horses: I went to Tottenham Court-road to take this gentleman up to the sign of the Load of Hay; when he came there, he got out of the chaise; Mr. Davis, who keeps the house, asked him if he was going to give the lads something to drink; he said he would see them d - d first. Up came a soldier and interfered; I told the soldier to mind his own business, I was hired to go to Hounslow; the soldier and I had two or three rough words; the gentleman told us to go to Hampstead; I then said I had no objection, so as he paid me for it; the gentleman began beating my man with this stick; he came to serve me the same; I let him taste my whip as well, then he left off. He got into the chaise, and ordered us to drive to Hampstead; we went to Hampstead, and stopped at Mrs. White's, on the right hand side of Hampstead-hill, and there was a double knock at the door; I believe the prisoner gave it, but I was on the other side of the chaise:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180095"/>I heard a woman's voice say, do not open the door, Mrs. White, for this gentleman is coming to take Sally away. I believe he drove the woman away somewhere, but that I do not know, I was on the other side of the chaise; when he returned, there was a scuffle with a servant man that was in a gig: I saw him run up the hill after him; he came back again, and I heard my man crying out for assistance - that the prisoner had a knife in his hand, and that he should be killed. I went to his assistance, we got him down at that time; he cut at me, but I did not see the knife till he was down; he struggled sometime with the constable before he could get the knife from him, the knife was open; we put him into the watch-house, and returned home.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was it not when I was in the house that you turned the horses' heads to London - who ordered you to do that? - A. Nobody; had not I a right to do that to go to Hounslow.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not Joe Davis that ordered you - did not I tell you I would take you to Hampstead? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is rather a ridiculous thing of Mr. Clarkson; he was rather desirous of Sally: she is a very pretty girl, and every body else as well as me liked her; the only objection that the mother had to my having her was, I was too old; the mother said she was a poor young thing. Mr. Clarkson was very officiating when he found I was coming after her, he said I was a madman; the father and the mother went off the bargain. I went up on foot to Mrs. White; says I, Mrs. White, I am come to offer to take Sally for my wife, and I will take you all and give you a pretty jaunt if you will go to Gretna-green, I will pay all the expence, will you let your three daughters go; she said, no; (Sally had no objection;) she said I was a blockhead for talking such nonsense; I told

             to turn the horses' heads to London; I ordered them to be turned to Hampstead, they would not do it; I told them, if they would not, I would make them: the blackguard post-boy heard it, he would not stir a step till he was paid; I went into the bar; I said, how much is your demands for the chaise; he said, two pounds, and ten shillings for the horse to Hounslow; I said, there it is, and nine shillings between you; I went up to Hampstead, and Mr. Clarkson's man came driving up in the single horse-chaise, and said, do not let the man in, he is mad; I said, you say I am mad, I will let you see; he ran away, I never asked for Sally; a woman cried out, murder, murder, at the windows, this fellow is come to take Sally; those men here got me down, I did not know what they were going to do with me; I had my knife, I wrought with my fingers till I got it open, and by G - d I would kill any man that dared stop me in the King's highway: the scoundrel of a constable came up to me, and stamped upon my wrist, and got the knife out of my hand; there is the mark on my wrist now. I was brought back as a felon; they took me to the public-house, and stripped me of every thing; what I did was in my own defence, being attacked in the road. In the first place I demand that my money may be returned - the forty shillings that I paid for the chaise, they not having performed the journey; they may keep the nine shillings for the dressing I gave them; that villain (meaning the constable) stripped my pocket of every thing.</p>
               <p>- sworn. - I am a constable of Hampstead, I heard the cry of murder.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you take his money from him, and how much? - A. Yes, a penny-piece and a shilling, that is all that ever I took out of his pocket, besides his snuff-box and twelve yards of white ribbon, which I have left at home. When I heard the cry of murder, I immediately ran up; I met a soldier, I asked him what was the matter up there; he said, I am in a hurry, I believe there is some mischief being done. I went up, and saw Mr. Halston on his back; I said, for God Almighty's sake take the knife out of his hands, he will murder me; he made a strike at me; I put my foot down on his hands, and took the knife out of his hands. I caught hold of him by the collar when he got up, and he caught hold of me by the throat; I was obliged to secure him.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. You will not be treated improperly for any thing you communicate here? - A. That is foreign to the present subject. That villain said he had delivered up all at Hatton-garden; there was a skein of silk and a twenty-shilling note I will swear he took out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What is this you know about Bonaparte? - A. I would rather not mention it here at present, because you will possibly look upon it as the effect of a disordered brain; I am sober, I speak the words of truth: if you read in the Hebrews, you will find it written - A body hast thou prepared, O Lord; and the same thing was said of him that died at Jerusalem - he is a madman; is not this the carpenter's son. I can shew you, if you will allow me, all the marks that ever he had on him, not that ever I was at Jerusalem, but my manner of life is known to many in England, Ireland, Scotland, and America; I may be deemed mad, I am not. I can shew you what I suffered in the House of Correction, if you like to go into it, without being indecent at all; I know what I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180096"/>do know, and in your presence I shall prove that I am what I am. What I have to communicate to His Majesty, I will communicate to you in private, if you please, not here. I wished to see the Prince of Wales; his insolent porter told me he would not admit a man of my description: I went in disguise, with my gun in my hand, a powder-horn, and a shot-bag; I wished to be admitted in that garb as an old soldier. He that suffered in Jerusalem suffered but little to what I suffered; these wounds (shewing them) I got in this pretty House of Correction, for me attempt of running away with Sally, who was very willing to go, whose connections are not very genteel; she is the daughter of

               <p>Q. Has he been so ever since? - A. When he came in I was not only under the necessity of putting him on a strait waistcoat, but was obliged, from the Saturday to the Wednesday, to lash him down to his bed; from that time he has been more collected; there were no complaints in his legs till now; it is in consequence of his being tied, and with his violent struggling.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt of his being perfectly deranged? - A. Not the least doubt.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You have under your care a number of people of this description at Hoxton - you have had this gentleman in your care? - A. I knew Mr. Halston from the present time up to the year 1790. In September that year he was put under my care; he was with me about three weeks that time, he was then in a low desponding state of mind; then he was admitted into St. Luke's Hospital, upon what they call the cure establishment; he remained a year there, the usual time, and was discharged, that was in 1791; he then came under my care again, and remained so till the year 1794, when he was re-admitted into St. Luke's Hospital on the incurable establishment, for which it is necessary to give security for a year, and I became security upon that establishment; he continued in that situation till the year 1799. For that five years I had frequent opportunities of seeing him, being security, and supplying him with little comforts that he stood in need of, and during that time he was labouring under a partial mental derangement. He was, however, very earnest to be set at large; I communicated to his brother on the subject, and against the conviction of the steward of the hospital, and against my own conviction, we complied with his request, on condition that he should be placed somewhere near to myself, that I might have an opportunity of seeing him occasionally to superintend and watch over him; I placed him at my gardener's, a house close to my own; I had frequent opportunities of seeing him almost daily; he conducted himself with very great propriety, he was very calm and very honorable, which is his natural disposition when he is right; he used to go to town for me on errands, such as carrying cash to the bankers, and receiving bills; he was much better at that period, though at that time I thought there were the seeds of insanity lurking about him, and if there was any exciting cause he would become downright a deranged man. His brother, to whom he has a great affection, I believe, has returned from India, after being there twenty-six years; it was an event very likely, in my opinion, to affect him, for either a great deal of pleasure or joy on one hand, or a depression of spirits on the other, would excite the lurking seeds of insanity into action, and the joy of seeing his brother might have taken this effect on him. I never considered him as cured of the disease; he was, when right, the best disposed man I ever saw; I saw him on the day he went in the chaise, and I saw him a day or two after he was committed to the House of Correction; there I saw him completely outrageously mad, scarce a rational word to be got out of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You were examined before the Magistrate, and told him all this? - A. I did, he was in a strait waistcoat then; he told me a long history that he had seen Bonaparte, and had conquered him and his brother Jerome; I saw Mr. Halston in the prison also, I am thoroughly satisfied, from the questions I put to him about Bonaparte, that he is labouring under mental derangement.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, you look upon him as deranged in his mind? - A. Certainly.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you used all diligence? - A. I have; I knew Deakin, I dare say, twenty years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I admit that he was out of the way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Briant.) Q. Has Messrs. Truman and Hanbury satisfied you for the coals? - A. They were not our property, we only carted them; Mr. Wright is the merchant; Messrs. Truman pays me for carting these coals, and Mr. Wright for the coals.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he paid you for the cartage of these coals? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You do not mean to charge Messrs. Truman and Hanbury for the coals that your servant stole? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. They will not pay you.</p>

               <p>Q. Was Mr. Deakin there when the coals were delivered, and you saw that man there? - A. He was not there; I was at work in the shop when they came to the door; I came out to carry some work into the air to dry.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. You were not there during the whole time the coals were delivered - he might be there for what you know? - A. God knows, I did not see him; if he had been there, I must have seen him, because there were glass doors.</p>
               <p>Q. He might have been at the horse's head, and you not have seen him, you were not there during the whole time - what occasion had you to come up and down so often, when coals were delivering - do you do your work as you walk up and down stairs? - A. No; when the work gets too dry, it is a great loss to a man, I came to look at it.</p>

               <p>Rose's defence. I was coming down Drury-lane; a young man tapped me on the shoulder, and said I was the person that he wanted; I had been doing of nothing I told him.</p>
               <p>Shorter called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer of Shadwell: I received information of a man stealing some pots, and I received information from a little boy, which led me to the prisoner's lodgings; I found him at home, in a place they call Match-walk, Shadwell; I searched in the cupboard, and I found a quantity of pots, and in the side of the fire-place, and amongst them I found two pints of Mr. Green, and one belonging to Mr. Tindal.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him, or he to you? - A. He said he knew nothing about them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any person in that room with him? - A. No, there was only a little boy in the house; he keeps the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Any other people living in the house? - A. There is a woman that lives in the house; he was in the room where I found the pots; he made an excuse that he wanted to go up stairs to get his coat; he made a spring at the stairs, and jumped right to the bottom of the house into the cellar; he then got into the garden, and the next minute I happened to step into a pail of water. In the mean while he got over the pails, I pursued him, and in about twenty yards Mr. Bellamy caught hold of him; I am sure he is the man, I was not ten yards from him when he was taken; I only lost sight of him when he got over the paling; I found in his room four pint pots, a half pint pot, a half pint liquor measure, and a half quartern.</p>

               <p>Q. What did she come for? - A. penny pewter tea-spoon; I gave her one, and she gave me a sixpence, as soon as I saw it I perceived it to be a bad one; she asked me to give her the sixpence again; I told her no; with that she made use of the most dreadful language that could be uttered from a woman; Mr. Mason came in at the moment; he asked me if that woman had been purchasing any article; I told him yes; he said, has she tendered any money to you; I said a bad sixpence; he desired me to keep it; I told him that I conceived her to be one of those people that went about uttering bad money; I sent for a constable; I delivered the bad sixpence I received from the prisoner, and Mr. Mason delivered his immediately.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners at the bar? - A. Yes, I served one of them with nine weeks milk, and the other with five weeks milk.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any money they gave to you, did you apply to Mr. Wood? - A. I did, and he applied to Mr. Sapwell; I used to get bad money every week of them, and I used to throw it away. Mr. Sapwell told me to keep going on with them, and take notice of the money I received of them, and to mark it. On the 5th of August, they came one after the other as usual, Ann Alen came first; I was then in Smock-alley, she gave me a shilling, she had a pennyworth of milk, and I gave her the change; a little time after, when I came into Artillery-street, she said she liked my milk so much she would have a pennyworth more; then she gave me a sixpence; then Mary Evans came and had a pennyworth of milk, and she gave me a sixpence the same morning, and I gave her the change; they both met at the distance of about thirty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was first in the afternoon? - A. That I cannot tell, both of them came about one minute after the other; Mary Evans gave me a shilling in the afternoon, and I gave her change, and the other gave me sixpence.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180106"/>Q. Were they together when they came to have the milk, then? - A. They used to be together at about the distance of thirty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with this shilling? - A. I went to Mr. Wood's and marked them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mark both of them? - A. Yes, and I put them into my pocket after I had marked them; in two or three days afterwards I delivered them to Mr. Sapwell.</p>

             in Petticoat-lane; I knew her perfectly well; she had a bag in her hand containing five-and-sixpence in good money; she knew me perfectly well.</p>
               <p>- PARKER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are employed by the Mint - are these good or bad shillings? - A. They are counterfeit, both of them are new coloured; they have not been in circulation.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that sixpence? - A. That is also of the same manufactory; it has not been in circulation.</p>
               <p>Allen's defence. I went to this man and had a pennyworth of milk from him, and gave him a good shilling, it had a mark in the middle of it, he took his purse out of his pocket and put the shilling into it and looked for a sixpence and gave it me, he put his hand into his side-pocket and gave me five pennyworth of halfpence and thanked me; I went into Petticoat-lane to sell a few old cloaths; I was two hours gone; I was sitting at home, and inadvertently they came and took me prisoner, and he said, the reason why they took me prisoner was, he saw me speak to the other prisoner; I never opened my lips to this woman in my days; if he had produced that shilling he put into his purse, I should have known it, it was a good shilling; I never changed but two shillings with him in my life; he knew as well where I lived as I did myself; he did not come to me directly, but he came two hours and a half afterwards, and took me a prisoner; they distressed me and hurt me very much.</p>
               <p>Evan's defence. I have often been to this man; I went to him on Monday afternoon, I told him I had no occasion to change a shilling; I said to him, you know if you come and have a pennyworth of apples, I need not change this shilling; I never changed with him before Monday; a woman was sick, I went for a pennyworth of milk for her, the woman that sent me gave me the money; immediately I was stopped, I had no more than sixpence and fourpence farthing, which was taken from me.</p>
