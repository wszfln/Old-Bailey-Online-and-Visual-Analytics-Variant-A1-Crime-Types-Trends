               <p>What may be the value of the three? - About twelve shillings I should imagine, but it is impossible to ascertain a value, in the state they are, because they are utterly unfit to sell; no man that grew them would cut them, nor any fruiterer buy them.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. What sort of a night was it, was it dark or light? - It was a pretty clear light, and I could see twenty yards before me.</p>
               <p>Was this pen-knife a fit instrument to break open a house? - It was a small knife; I found no ear-rings about this man; he was not dressed as he is now; he said, he was a drover, and had been drinking at some public house in the market; he never spoke a word about cattle; I did not look upon it that he drove cattle.</p>

            ; since I came home, I have had a pretty considerable legacy; on the 29th of May as I was coming along just by the New Church in the Strand, I picked up two women, the prisoner was one.</p>
               <p>Was you drunk or sober? - I was pretty solid.</p>
               <p>But a sailor's pretty solidness we do not understand? - I was capable of remembering what I did; I picked up the prisoner and another woman, and went into Mrs. Flannagan's house in Bridges-street, Covent-Garden, there was a bowl of negus brought up, both the women went up in the room; we continued there about half an hour, I had about eight or nine guineas in my pocket, and I had four bank notes of one hundred pounds each, which I had seen about me three or four hours before; I had been along with some friends, and staid a little too late; I am sure I had them with me when I picked her up; it was in this pocket book, in my side pocket; I had not this coat on; I had my coat buttoned; I got off the chair, took hold of the bowl, and just wetted my lips, and I set down in the chair, and I was no more, I lost myself quite.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive it was intoxicating liquor? - Yes, I did; I awoke in half an hour, and the women were gone, my coat was unbuttoned, my pocket book was taken out, and found on the ground, and my hat taken off the table, the nine guineas and the notes gone; I enquired at the house; I saw these two women about a week after; my wife gave information at the public office on the Wednesday following; I saw them on the Friday at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>What length of time had you of observing them, before you picked them up? - No great length of time; I saw the prisoner, and knew her again; I have no doubt upon it; I was sober enough to see and know the person of the prisoner; I have never recovered any part of my property; two notes were changed in the bank; here is a gentleman that knows how they came into the bank.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, prisoner's counsel. Where had you been drinking? - At Islington; I was pretty solid.</p>
               <p>Had you had no conversation with other people, previous to this? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that at the time you met these people in the Strand, you was not in company with another woman? - Before I saw them, I had no woman.</p>
               <p>At what place were you, when you first came up to them? - At the New Church in the Strand.</p>
               <p>I believe it was at the wall of Somerset-house? - It was near that.</p>



               <p>I believe there are thereabouts some low prostitutes; now, was not you in company at that time with one of those prostitutes?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190009"/> - No further than with the prisoner, and the other woman; I was not picked up by any body before I met those two women.</p>
               <p>Which of the two ladies did you select for your companion? - The prisoner that stands there.</p>
               <p>Are you as sure of that as you are of any thing you have sworn to day? - Yes, Sir, I am.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, will you take upon you to swear, that you did not desire the prisoner to leave the room, and that you was in company with the other woman you picked up? - No, Sir, I did not, I was in company only with this woman; they were both in the room, and this was my companion.</p>
               <p>Were not you behind a hackney coach that night? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Who did you follow? - I followed some gentleman and asked him to stop; he asked me what I wanted; I said, Sir, I have no harm to you, but I have lost some property and I thought it might be in that coach; I understood there were two ladies in the coach; I did not charge these two women at all; upon which the gentleman said, I was going to rob him, and he gave charge of me, and the watchman said, I was so much of a gentleman; as soon as I awoke, I came down stairs, I saw the servant maid and told her, I had lost a large property, she said, she knew nothing at all about it, and she did not know the woman; I saw the prisoner about a week after I was robbed, and I said, do you know me? I shewed her the pocket book, and said, do you know this? and you have the property that was in it; then I threatened to send for a constable, and went out for one; I believe it was twenty minutes before I could get one, it might be half an hour, it might be three hours.</p>
               <p>Was it twenty minutes, or was it three hours? - It was twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to say just now it was three hours?</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Now take your choice, which of the two it is, the three hours, or the twenty minutes? - Twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Did you find these women in the same place? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Waiting for you to apprehend them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What account did you give of this property when you arrived at Bow-street, what did you call it? - Four hundred pounds in bank notes.</p>
               <p>Did you describe it in the security it was vested in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What security did you say? - A note on the bank.</p>
               <p>Did not you say at Bow-street that they were Exchequer bills? - I received them from the Exchequer; I will now swear they were bank notes, and it was the prisoner that was with me.</p>
               <p>How come you now, Sir, to swear they were bank notes? - I did not rightly understand them, the Justice proved that they were bank notes; my wife shewed me one of them, one that I happened to lay down, I mislaid it, and they happened to find it; I received them at the Exchequer-office at Westminster.</p>
               <p>What time did you leave Islington? - At seven.</p>
               <p>Can you tell us the places you was at between seven in the evening, and Somerset-house? - Yes, Sir, I found myself in Cheapside.</p>

               <p>What did you do between seven and two? - I went from Islington to the Strand.</p>
               <p>Was you these hours coming from Islington to the Strand? - Not quite so many hours.</p>
               <p>You say you came from Islington at seven, and at two you picked up these girls? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you did not mislay all the bank notes? - I will not swear that I did mislay them all only one.</p>
               <p>You can swear you did mislay more? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Will you, after having been so drunk, take upon yourself to say you did not mislay any more but that one.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190010"/>Court. Did you know that night that you had four or five? - I knew I had only four; I knew I had left one behind.</p>
               <p>Did not you imagine the next morning when you saw your wife, that they were all five lost? - I did not imagine so.</p>
               <p>You will not tell me I suppose how many women you picked up from seven till two? - None but these two.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you give either of these women any money while you was there? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did you, or did you not? - Yes, I gave Hetty

             a guinea; I put the rest in my pocket; I am sure they were left in my pocket when I went to sleep.</p>
               <p>Jury. I want to ask you a question or two, you was at the public house at Islington? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many people were there? - Three or four.</p>
               <p>Friends and acquaintance, or strangers? - There was no acquaintance of mine, I dropped in promiscuously, they seemed to be gentlemen like.</p>
               <p>You left it at seven o'clock? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where was the next house you went to? - At Cow-cross.</p>
               <p>Drinking there at a public house? - Not in company; the next house was in Cheapside, I drank by myself, then I went to Whitechapel, then I came back to this end of the town; I was with nobody else till I came to the New Church in the Strand.</p>
               <p>When you saw the woman of the house and you produced your pocket book, and said, she must know it, was any person present? - Yes, there was a man.</p>
               <p>Court. You never saw these bank notes from the time you went into the house at Islington? - No, Sir, never after I left the house.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell her you was going to get a constable to take her up? - Yes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mrs. Flannagan; I remember the prosecutor coming to our house with two ladies on the 29th of May.</p>
               <p>What time in the morning might it be? - About two I let them in, I shewed them into the first floor all together.</p>
               <p>Did you carry them any thing to drink? - A bowl of negus.</p>
               <p>Do you know the ladies? - I cannot say I know them, they did not belong to the house, the gentleman brought them in out of the street; I should know them if I was to see them.</p>
               <p>Look about? - There is one of the ladies.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long did they stay together? - About half an hour.</p>
               <p>Did they all continue in the room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who went away first? - Both the women, about half after two.</p>
               <p>Did the man appear to be drunk or sober? - Rather in liquor.</p>
               <p>Was he so drunk as not to know what he was about? - He paid for the negus one shilling; it was a bowl of Madeira negus; he gave me half a guinea, and I gave him change.</p>
               <p>Good negus? - I cannot say; I let the ladies out, I had no conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Did they tell you whether the man was coming after them? - The man followed them direct; he came in with the women, but he did not come down with them, he stood on the second or third step on the one pair of stairs, they did not take leave of one another; they went out first; he said, he had been robbed in their hearing; after the ladies were gone out, the gentleman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190011"/> followed them; he said, he had lost his property, I asked him what? he said, a brown paper parcel pinned; I did not go up any more that night; I have seen the prisoner, I know nothing of her; I did not know her name; I did not know where she lodged; I saw her again at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Have you ever heard her say any thing about this? - No, I know nothing more.</p>
               <p>You describe his coming down almost instantly after? - Yes, immediately; he came down before I got from the door to the passage; he went out immediately after, as soon as he expressed these words.</p>
               <p>- THACKER sworn.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor sold out a certain quantity of stock in the five per cents, and he bought in Exchequer bills; he went and received the money, I was not with him; I have been since he lost them, and enquired about them; I did not know any thing of them previously.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have the number of the notes in my pocket, which I took down before I lost them.</p>
               <p>Had you made that memorandum before you lost them? - Yes, Sir, I did.</p>
               <p>Jury. What time did you see them last? - I did not put down that that my wife had, I had mislaid it before I had taken the number of the others.</p>

            , and he went out of doors, and Pike came in, and he came in directly after him, and said, Oh you are at home now; they talked together, but I cannot tell what they said; I heard them say something about twelve; this was about a quarter after eleven at night; the prisoner staid about five or six minutes, he went away and left Pike there, after he was gone

             asked me for a light, and instead of taking one, he doubted mine; the prisoner was in the house, and I saw Pike take the muslin, which was in a frame, out of a chair, and give it to the prisoner, and a muslin neckcloth they dropped in the entry; this was twenty yards of my master's property; my master first valued it at 5 l. 18 s. then he said, as I was a poor girl he would abate something; it was worth more than 40 s.; we took the prisoner on Friday night; I have not been able to find Pike; they staid in the entry till they folded it up into the frame; I alarmed the neighbours; I saw the prisoner one night before, he came and asked for Ben's work? the muslin was never found; the neckcloth was picked up in the entry by a young woman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, prisoner's counsel. Pike asked you for a candle? - Yes, they took away the frame with the muslin, it was in the room in the arm chair, in one frame; it was very dark when the candle was out, but I could see by the light of the muslin; it was very dark, and the window was shut; nobody came in but this young woman that picked up the neckcloth; I have twenty-four women lodge in the house, but they were all in bed; I always examine them all the last thing at night; the candle was out when this young woman came in; I was very much frightened when they came in; there was a young woman laid asleep.</p>
               <p>It was rather lightish out of doors that you could see by the street door. - It was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190012"/> light enough to discover any body in the entry, I discovered Ben. Pike going to the chair, and giving the muslin to the prisoner; I had seen the prisoner about a fortnight before this, only once, I believe it was the 30th of May; the street door was wide open, but they stood in the entry.</p>

Pike and the prisoner talked together, but the prosecutrix made an alarm, and said she was robbed of her property.</p>
               <p>Did the cry out for some person to come to her assistance? - Yes; I saw Ben. Pike and the prisoner come out of the door with a bundle, but which of them it was I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Did the prisoner do any thing to you but stab you? - Nothing; then I dropped down in the middle of Holborn; the people came and surrounded me, and desired to take me to the doctor's; I was bleeding very fast.</p>
               <p>Court. What did Smith do immediately after he stabbed you? - He went off immediately.</p>
               <p>Did he go off before the other searched you? - I cannot tell; Smith tried to open my breeches pocket, because he was on my side.</p>
               <p>You did not tell us that before; when did he try to open your breeches pocket? - As he was stabbing me, Smith was on my right hand side; he saw I would not give him leave to rob me, therefore he stabbed me; he tried before he stabbed me, then I dropped down dead, and as I dropped down dead, they desired I might be carried to the doctor's.</p>
               <p>Are you sure as to the person at the bar? - That is the person that stabbed me.</p>
               <p>How many moments might he be in your eye before the accident happened? - The value of seven or eight minutes; I have seen the prisoner many times; I have no doubt but that is the man, because he made an acknowledgement to me when I was in my bed; the prisoner was taken on the Sunday evening, the 23d of April, when I was very bad, he was brought to me in bed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was Sir Sampson present? - No.</p>

               <p>Why is he in court? (ordered out of court.) Who were present? - Richards was one of them; I cannot tell their names; when the prisoner was brought to me it was between nine and ten; I was laying down on my bed; he told me in this way, your heart aches, and you are going to make my heart ache; and he desired me for God's sake not to go and swear his life away.</p>
               <p>Did any thing more pass? - That is all.</p>
               <p>Did you know him then? - Yes; I said nothing till I fully knew him?</p>
               <p>Did you say you knew him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He said nothing, but biting his lips.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The person that you took to be the prisoner stood to your left hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was stabbed on your left side? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Three people came behind you, they did not meet you? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>The two persons that were on the side of you were not fronting you; which hand did the man stab you with? - With the left hand; I shall be glad to say as little as possible.</p>
               <p>Why did not you mention that sooner? - I have had no conversation with the lawyers since last session; the same man tried to rob me with his left hand at the same time that he was going to stab me.</p>
               <p>So finding himself disappointed in not being able to rob you, he instantly stabbed you with the same hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What sort of knife was it, a clasp or a case knife? - That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Did he put his hand into his pocket after he had tried your pocket, or had he his knife in his hand? - I cannot say; the man that came in front of me tried also to search my left hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Did you hear the expression, by G - d I will do for you, before he was trying at your pocket, or at the instant? - Before.</p>
               <p>At the last session have you ever said in your life, that the prisoner is the man that tried your pocket? - Yes, I said so when I was in bed, I always said so from the first day I was stabbed, to this day.</p>
               <p>When he had stabbed you, the man in front came up, and the man that stabbed you ran away? - They all three ran<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190014"/> away; I was on the path way, it was ten minutes before eight, it was not half after seven before I went from my house; the next day this man was brought in custody to our house.</p>
               <p>And what he said you took to be a confession of his guilt? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was a considerable time in the hospital? - I was.</p>
               <p>Who told you that the present indictment could not be supported unless you swore that the prisoner attempted to take your money? - Nobody; I never heard so from any body.</p>
               <p>I ask you this; has no person that is now in court, or any other person told you, that unless this prisoner was proved to attempt to take your money, this indictment could not be supported? - I was told that you was at the hospital door to enquire for me, whether I was out of danger; is your name Mr. Garrow?</p>
               <p>Yes my name is Garrow? - I was told so by the people of the hospital.</p>
               <p>Name a person to me that told you that; you must recollect that? - They told me that the counsellor that was employed by the prisoner enquired whether I was out of danger.</p>
               <p>That person did not tell you any thing of Mr. Garrow. Upon your oath Sir, was not it your own solicitor that desired you to say that to day? - I have no attorney.</p>
               <p>I shall travel one step higher; is not the person in court who desired you to say that? - I am not able to stand.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath is not the person present that directed you to say that? - Upon my oath nobody told me in the court.</p>
               <p>Is not the person now in court that desired you to say that? - I will take my oath that nobody in court told me any thing.</p>
               <p>Did no person to your knowledge now in court, tell you to say that? - I will take my oath that the person is not here.</p>
               <p>Who was it? - The nurse of the hospital.</p>
               <p>When was you told so? - Last Thursday was a week the nurse told the sister, and sister told me; they never mentioned your name, they said the counsellor.</p>
               <p>Why was it then when I asked you the question, just now, your answer to me was; is not your name Garrow? - Because I have heard many people telling here the last sessions, that you was to speak for the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Has no person that is concerned for you as a lawyer given you directions to day? - I will take my oath they have not, or God may strike me dead.</p>
               <p>Did any body tell you to say you was too feeble to answer my questions? - No.</p>
               <p>Has nobody wrote it down. - No; it has been a fortnight since last Thursday; I am not out of the hospital yet.</p>
               <p>What is the name of the sister that told you? - Her name is Soldier.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. How was the prosecutor's intellects at the time? - He appeared to be very ill at the time, but he appeared to be very sensible; I never saw him but that time.</p>

               <p>Was Howell apprised that you was coming with the man? - Yes, I think he was; because his wife went in first and told him that one was come with the man; to which he instantly said that is the man; and the prisoner instantly said do not swear my life away, I am an innocent man; I apprehended the prisoner at the sign of the Falcon, in Port-pool-lane; the prosecutor seemed to be in very great agony.</p>
               <p>Have you had frequent conversations with Howell? - I do not know that I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190015"/> spoke to him about that matter till last session; I did not hear his examination.</p>
               <p>Have you ever had any talk with him about this business? - No, no particular talk.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear from him that he suspected this to be in consequence of spight; did he always represent the attempt to rob him to be before or after the stab? - I understood before.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon; I attended the prosecutor for a week; he was brought about eight in the evening, on a Saturday; if I recollect right, to my house, and at that time he had a wound in his side, which I dressed; I suppose it penetrated about two inches.</p>
               <p>Did it appear a dangerous wound? - It appeared to be from a sharp instrument, either a knife or a bayonet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It was before he went to the hospital that you atended him? - Yes; he said somebody had stabbed him; I saw him on the Sunday; the symptoms of delirium I was informed on Sunday appeared, and on the Sunday evening he was scarcely sensible.</p>
               <p>About what time on the Sunday evening did you visit him? - I believe between eight and nine; the symptoms had then begun, and I was in again between ten and eleven, when they were worse.</p>
               <p>I have no doubt but you took all possible care; would not it tend to disturb the frame to bring the man? - Not a doubt of it.</p>
               <p>How long might the delirium continue? - He was exceedingly ill many days; I thought he would die; I did not see him after he went to the hospital; a young man that is with me is here.</p>
               <p>- PITTS sworn.</p>
               <p>I attended the prosecutor at the hospital; when I first saw him in the hospital, he was in a very dangerous state, and continued so a great while; he was getting well, and he came to this court to attend the trial, and the trial was put off, and he came home exceeding ill indeed, a fresh inflammation, a cough, and a difficulty in breathing, and we have been obliged to give him the strictest regimen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Is he much weakened in consequence of his wound? - He is.</p>
               <p>I should suppose he is capable since he got the better of that symptom that came on by attending here.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any more common symptom than that of his taking one person for another? - Wherever a man is delirious, his mind is deranged, and his ideas certainly.</p>
               <p>But do you not in point of experience and fact, frequently find that persons in a delirium sever take one person for another? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it all to my counsel.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190016"/>Jury. I think the prosecutor said he had some previous knowledge of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Would it be amiss to ask him how he knew him.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutor. You have no personal knowledge of the prisoner? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You only mean to say that you have seen him more than once? - Yes, I have seen him more than once.</p>
               <p>Jury. By that knowledge of seeing him different times in the street, can you swear now to him positively? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. As far as you think under all the circumstances of the case, that the prosecutor in the state he was can be depended upon, he has sworn that he was the man.</p>

Gentlemen, he then addressed Mr. Bellingham, and said, why do you seize me, I have never done you any injury? Mr. Bellingham said, no, Sir, but you are the man who robbed my wife; the prisoner immediately, before Mr. Bellingh am said another word to him, then said, I hope Sir, you will be merciful to me, Mr. Bellingham told him he should have all that the law would allow him, but no more. Gentlemen the prisoner was then committed, and is now brought before you: Mrs. Bellingham will be produced, and you will hear from her whether she is as certain as I am instructed she is, that the prisoner is the man; the little girl will also be produced, and the Court will judge whether she should be examined: and if the witnesses convince you of the identity of the person of the prisoner, joined to the other circumstances; you will from your judgment, and discharge your duty by a verdict of the guilt of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mrs. BELLINGHAM sworn.</p>
               <p>I am wife of Mr. Bellingham; I live at Teddington; I was walking in the high road, from Teddington to Hampton-court; on the 15th of June with Mr. Bellingham's niece; the person that robbed me walked some way on the roads, perhaps half a mile.</p>
               <p>Court. What in company with you, talking to you? - No, my Lord, he followed me all the way; he stopped and leaned over the gate; he then presented a pistol to me, demanding my money.</p>
               <p>How far had this person walked, who presented a pistol to you and demanded your money? - Near half a mile.</p>

               <p>What time might you be walking with this person near you? - I should suppose a quarter of an hour; I was walking slowly with a little girl, between twelve and one.</p>

               <p>Had you had frequent opportunities of seeing this person? - I had so much, so that I was pleased there was so creditable good a looking man, walking with me.</p>
               <p>Had your little niece the same occasion of observing this person as yourself? - The child saw him all the way.</p>
               <p>What did he do when he presented the pistol to you? - He demanded my money; I gave him two half crowns; he then presented his pistol the second time, and said, he must have more; I begged of him for God's sake not to frighten me, and I gave him a guinea; he then searched both my pockets, and asked for my trinkets and rings, I told him I had none; the man took my watch; I think he put his hand to my apron whether he took it, or whether I gave it him I cannot say; both our hands were together; he took a metal buckle out of my handkerchief, I told him I would give it him, but he tore it out, and said he would have it.</p>
               <p>What time might this transaction take up? - It is impossible for me to say exactly, I should suppose four or five minutes.</p>
               <p>Now during that time had you an opportunity of observing the prisoner's person? - I had.</p>
               <p>At this time I apprehend you was under some alarm? - I was.</p>

               <p>Was you under any alarm during the time he had been walking near you? - None, till he presented the pistol.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you know the prisoner again? - I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Will you look at that person? - That is the person, but not the clothes; I am sure of his person.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190024"/>How long was it after this before you saw the person again? - The 15th of July.</p>
               <p>That is just a month after? - Exactly.</p>
               <p>In what situation did you see him? - I was coming through Bushy-park in a post chaise; I saw him, and I knew him directly; my husband was with me, and a gentleman who was in court just now, and

               <p>Have you ever had any reason to doubt him? - Never, never, never.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. It is my duty, Madam, to trouble you with a very few questions; you need not be under any more alarm from them than those of my friends, I shall not give you any unnecessary trouble.</p>

               <p>Were you going on any visit? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Where did you go after you was robbed? - I went home as well as my fright would permit.</p>
               <p>You was extremely alarmed? - I have not been perfectly myself since.</p>
               <p>I dare say Madam, in all your excursions you have felt frequent apprehensions of robberies? - I have, I never stirred from home but when I could not help it, and never but under great apprensions that I should be robbed.</p>
               <p>On the evening of the robbery, did you or any body give directions to make a pursuit after the man that robbed you? - I think Mr. Bellingham was not at home for two days, he was in town.</p>
               <p>Did you give any information to any of the public offices? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did any body on your part send notice before the man was taken, that such a robbery was committed? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do you know of any advertisement of your watch, or any hand bills? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>How many excursions may you have made in a carriage, between the 15th of June and the 15th of July; perhaps but few? - Two besides that when the person was apprehended.</p>
               <p>What time of the day was he apprehended? - It was in the evening.</p>
               <p>What time? - It was past eight.</p>
               <p>You was not less frightened at that time of the day than at noon day? - I was extremely terrified at seeing him, it was in my fright I instantly cried out that is the man that robbed me, and the child instantly cried out, that is him, that is him; the man met my chaise; he walked some length before he was taken.</p>
               <p>What distance might he be from you then? - Not further much than he is now.</p>
               <p>How far had you travelled that evening? - I cannot tell how far, it was from Oatlands; he was apprehended in Bushy-park.</p>
               <p>I only wish to know within half a mile? - About five miles.</p>
               <p>Had you met many persons, Mrs. Bellingham? - I had not to my knowledge, to notice it, met one.</p>
               <p>Had you put your watch or your purse in any place of safety that evening? - I have not come out with a watch or any money since.</p>
               <p>So that the first man that you met was the prisoner, you was very much alarmed, and you instantly exclaimed, that is the man, in which cry the child joined, and you left Mr. Bellingham to do the best he could? - Yes, he was first produced to me before the Magistrate on Sunday.</p>
               <p>You had seen your husband? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He had told you that upon the person that was taken there was found a picklock key and a loaded pistol? - He did.</p>
               <p>That of course did not lessen your belief that he was the man? - Nor add to it; the person of the man was sufficient.</p>
               <p>You had taken no oath on the subject till after you knew the circumstance of the pistol? - I could not.</p>
               <p>He had walked behind you about half a mile before he robbed you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you had the misfortune to be robbed before? - No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190025"/>Jury. Was the prisoner in the same clothes when taken, as when he committed the robbery? - He was, excepting a waistcoat, he had a striped waistcoat on when he robbed me, and he had a striped waistcoat on when he was taken, but they were different waistcoats.</p>
               <p>Miss Middleton called.</p>
               <p>How old are you? - Twelve.</p>
               <p>What will become of you, if you take a false oath, and swear what is not truth? - Go to hell, my Lord.</p>
               <p>I suppose you have been taught your catechism? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Who gave you instructions to give that answer to my Lord? - My aunt.</p>
               <p>Was it yesterday or before? - Yesterday.</p>
               <p>You was told you would be asked that question, and that was the proper answer to give? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you go to Clerkenwell? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They would not swear you there, what did your aunt say to you because you was not sworn? - Because I was not of age.</p>

               <p>They thought you did not know the nature of an oath.</p>
               <p>Court. Suppose you say the truth now, what will become of you then? - Go to heaven, Sir.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I see upon the back of the indictment she had been proposed as a witness and had been rejected.</p>
               <p>Court. Swear her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Will you be so good when I ask you a question, to speak so loud that those Gentlemen and my Lord may hear you; pray Miss do you remember walking with your aunt? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was it? - I do not remember the day.</p>
               <p>Was it the day she was robbed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body on that day? - Yes; the person that robbed my aunt walked all along the lane with us, sometimes on one side, and sometimes before; he walked just before my aunt on the other side, then he came up and shewed a pistol to my aunt, and asked her for her money, my aunt gave him some money, and he put the pistol to my aunt again, and said that would not do, he must have some more; he searched both her pockets, and he took a little buckle from her handkerchief, and he said he must have her watch, her trinkets, and rings if she had any; he did not take her ring; he took her watch and little buckle.</p>
               <p>What time was he taking those things? - He seemed a good while taking them.</p>
               <p>Was you frightened? - Yes, Sir, very much; I saw him before that time; I had seen him for a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Did you take any notice of him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Should you know him again if you was to see him? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Look round the court? - That is the man that robbed my aunt.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of it? - I am sure of it; he wished my aunt a good morning, and said he hoped she would never miss it.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see him again? - Yes, Sir, last Saturday, when he was taken.</p>
               <p>How happened you to see him again? - We were coming home and he went by the chaise.</p>
               <p>Who was in the chaise? - My uncle and another lady.</p>
               <p>Was you in the chaise too? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How happened you to see him then? - I was looking out at the window; I did not sit down, I was standing before the window.</p>
               <p>Which way was he coming? - He was coming from the gate.</p>
               <p>Was he coming towards you or going from you? - Towards us; my uncle asked my aunt if she was sure that was the man, and she said yes, and he jumped out of the chaise.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing at that time? - I said that was the man.</p>
               <p>Was the man brought to you at that time? - No, my aunt bid the coachman drive home.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure that is the man? - Yes, I am quite sure that is the man.</p>
               <p>Was you at all frightened before the man robbed your aunt? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190026"/>Not at all? - No.</p>
               <p>What time was it when he robbed your aunt? - It was between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You saw the man again in Bushy Park? - Yes; she said to my uncle, that was the man that robbed her.</p>
               <p>You was a good deal frightened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you said that is the man. - Yes.</p>

               <p>You are quite sure of that? - Yes, he went by the chaise and met us.</p>
               <p>How far was he from the chaise when you first saw him? - I did not see him till he came to the chaise almost; I saw him immediately upon my aunt's calling out.</p>
               <p>You was a good deal flurried? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You thought he would come and rob you again, did not you? - I did not think much about that, because there was my uncle.</p>
               <p>At the time he robbed your aunt you was a good deal frightened? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Because you was alone? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>What lane was it he walked in? - They call it Fry's-lane.</p>
               <p>Was it in the field? - No, in the lane, a common carriage way.</p>
               <p>Are there hedges on each side? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And gates at several different distances, so that a man might have come upon you out of the field? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But he did not? - No he did not; there was a carriage just past us before he robbed us, and he leaned over a gate.</p>
               <p>Did he walk more before you than he did behind you? - He walked more on the side, even with us on the other side of the road.</p>
               <p>Abreast with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he walk behind you? - Sometimes behind us, but not so much.</p>
               <p>Be so good as to tell me how he was dressed? - A snuff coloured coat, a striped waistcoat, white stockings, and I think silver buckles, white buckles.</p>
               <p>You understand now I mean the evening you saw him in Bushy-Park? - Yes, Sir, it was past eight.</p>
               <p>You saw him just as he come past the chaise? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Now Miss Middleton had you an opportunity of making such observation on his clothes in that short time? - Yes, Sir, I had.</p>
               <p>Did you see him at the justice's? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Was you up when your uncle came home at night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then he told your aunt that the man was secured, and had a pistol in his pocket? - Yes, Sir, and loaded with two slugs, and twelve picklock-keys.</p>
               <p>Then you have no doubt at all but he must be the man, as he was so equipped? - I knew he was the man, because I knew his face.</p>
               <p>You have often talked about this? - Very often.</p>
               <p>You heard your aunt tell the story to my friend that stands here? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was a few minutes ago? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You knew she told it all correctly? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did the prisoner say any thing at the time you took him? - He said, Sir, what have I done, I never offended you? I said, no, you have offended me in a tenderer part, you have robbed my wife; he then said, if I have, I hope you will be merciful to me; I had made him no promise.

             was the man that was with me; he is here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You was at your country house at the time the lady was robbed? - I was not.</p>
               <p>How soon after did you see her? - The second day; I gave information at Bow-street, either on the Tuesday or Wednesday following; the robbery was on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Did you give a description of the watch? - I did.</p>
               <p>There was nothing particular in the half-crowns? - That I cannot tell; I gave no description of them.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether there was any advertisement or hand bills? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You had no notice of any person being taken into custody till this man was taken? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>It frightened her a good deal? - She was very much frightened, as I suppose every woman who is in a bad state of health would be; she has been in a bad state of health several years; I should suppose it might be about half past eight when we were in the park.</p>
               <p>You left Oatlands probably about half past seven? - About seven.</p>
               <p>How much further had you to go? - The length of the park; my house is just out of Bushy-park gate.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect seeing any body from Oatlands? - I did not take any notice of any person.</p>
               <p>What distance was the man from the chaise, at the time your wife cried out that was the man? - I suppose he might be twice the length of this hall; but when I first saw the man, he was near the horses heads.</p>
               <p>What gate is it you speak of? - It is called Hampton-Court gate; a woman keeps the gate.</p>
               <p>What distance were you from the gate? - I suppose not a hundred and fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Within view of it? - Oh dear Sir, not one hundred and fifty yards, Bushy-park is remarkable for being one mile in length, and you may see from one gate to the other as clear as you can see me now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to the prisoner. If there is any other question you would wish to have asked, I will ask it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The gentleman did not say to me at the time he took me that I robbed his wife? - Upon my oath he repeatedly pressed me to tell him what he had done; he began to be a little boisterous; I told him, my friend, I am very well known in this neighbourhood, and my property is such, that if I have taken you wrong, you may have recompence; and then I said it is my wife you have robbed; then he said this, I hope you will be merciful.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. After Mrs. Bellingham had sworn to him, he then said, I am innocent, and for God's sake do not take away my life? - Sir, what I have told you is exactly the fact; that it was at the public house before Mrs. Bellingham saw him; she never saw him after he was taken until the next morning.</p>

               <p>What had you for dinner that day? - I had a fillet of veal that weighed about eleven pounds and a half, and a piece of pickled pork and greens; at the next meeting we had a leg of mutton, and what I call trimmings.</p>
               <p>What makes you particularly remember that this was on the 15th of June? - It was very remarkable on account of the boy's birth day.</p>
               <p>Was it remarkable on any other account? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did you know it was the 15th of June before the prisoner was taken up? - I cannot say when he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear of his being taken up? - I did hear of his being taken up some time ago, but I have not dined with Mr. Lilly above once since.</p>
               <p>How long is it since you heard of his being taken up? - About a week ago.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it is not more than a week ago? - I work for one Mr. Kenzie in Smith-street, they came and acquainted me that the prisoner was taken up.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you had nothing but mackarel<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190029"/> for supper? - Yes, they were boiled. What sauce had you? - Mackarel herbs.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner come at the same time with you to Mr. Lilly's house that day? - He was there when I went there at eleven.</p>
               <p>Did you all of you smoke, all the men? - Most of us did.</p>
               <p>Was there any other person there besides what you have mentioned? - No.</p>
               <p>There were but four of you men? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you all of you smoke? - Yes, at different times.</p>
               <p>Which of you smoked herb tobacco? - I smoked herb tobacco, some smoked herb and some short cut, I offered them sue of mine, I smoked some herb and short cut mixed, the others might, I did not take such particular notice of it, there was herb tobacco and short cut?</p>
               <p>Was not there some pigtail tobacco too? - There might, I cannot say, I never smoke any pigtail tobacco.</p>
               <p>Had not you some port-wine at your dinner? - No Sir, we had some porter and gin before dinner.</p>
               <p>What did you drink tea? - I had a dish of tea, and the prisoner had some, and we all drank tea.</p>
               <p>Did you smoke at your tea? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Jury. What day of the week was it? - Of a Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Are you sure it was a week ago you heard the prisoner was taken up? - I cannot justly say whether it was a week or more, I did not take much account of it, I did not think I should come here; as high as I can tell it is a week, I believe I heard of it on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Last Saturday? - Yes, which is not quite a week.</p>

               <p>Court. What had he in the basket? - Upon searching the basket I found eleven bottles of wine, and one broke and the wine running about.</p>

               <p>What may be the value of that one pair? - Fifteen shillings; I took them up, and said, these are not all you have, she said, she had nothing more; but I saw her drop a second pair; I immediately sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>What is the value of the two pair? - Thirty shillings; I gave that for them; I am very clear they are mine.</p>
               <p>In the first place, is there any shop mark upon them? - Not at that time there was not, I had sold two pair of the same pattern, they were both of the same sort, but a different pattern; she was very troublesome in the parlour, and called out murder very often; Mr. Allanson came into the shop after me.</p>

               <p>I am an officer; I had the prisoner in my custody some time, I searched him, and found a guinea in his mouth, he begged that Mr. Pugh would not prosecute him, and he would give him a draft for the remainder of the money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You are a runner to an office I understand? - I do not know what you mean, I very seldom run.</p>
               <p>That will not content me; I ask you upon the oath you have taken, whether you do not understand the meaning? - I do not go by terms of runner; I do not understand terms.</p>
               <p>I ask you upon your oath, do not you understand me? - What do you call a runner, I cannot answer you any such question, I tell you, Sir, I am an officer.</p>
               <p>Do you understand me, Sir, when I ask you if you are not a runner to some office? - I have heard them talking of runners and walkers.</p>
               <p>Do not you understand the meaning of a runner to an office? - Upon my word you ask me such a question that I cannot answer, you tell me and I will tell you.</p>
               <p>With that answer I am not contented; now I ask you what office do you belong to? - I attend Bow-street office.</p>
               <p>How long have you so attended? - For these six years.</p>
               <p>The last session when you was here what office did you say you belonged to then? - I attended Justice Walker's.</p>
               <p>How long have you attended Justice Walker's? - Bow-street and Justice Walker's I have attended six years, I am an officer belonging to a parish.</p>
               <p>That is a little different account you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190040"/> know to your being an officer belonging to Bow-street: to what parish do you belong as an officer? - The parish of Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>What office did you attend at last? - I attend now at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>You say you have attended at Bow-street six years? - At Bow-street and Justice Walker's six years.</p>
               <p>Have not you within the knowledge of the gentlemen within my eye given an account of yourself as attending at all the other offices except Bow-street? - There and at Bow-street for six years.</p>
               <p>Have you never from this place been committed to Newgate by this Court, though not prosecuted, for perjury? - No, Sir, nor never will.</p>
               <p>Can you say so, Sir? - I tell you no, nor never will be for perjury.</p>
               <p>Have you not been committed by this Court within these two sessions for some offence in the face of this Court? - No, Sir, never in my life.</p>
               <p>You stick to that? - Yes, Sir, I scorn any person to bring a bad matter upon me.</p>
               <p>Have you ever before this session given an account of yourself as an officer attending at Bow-street? - I attended from my first beginning at Bow-street six years, never at no other, only at Justice Walker's and Bow-street.</p>
               <p>You have never given an account of your attending at any other office? - Never, I never gave an account of attending Justice Blackborow's.</p>
               <p>Are you employed by Sir Sampson Wright? - I go there as a constable, no further than to serve a warrant, or any business that comes in my way.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I sent over to this man yesterday knowing that he had money belonging to me, he came over to me, I said, Frank, it is a hard thing for a man to lay in gaol with only gaol allowance, give me a part of my property, give me a shilling; says he, if you say any more, if you do not slash the matter, says he, I will do you.</p>
               <p>Court to Umpage. Did you say so? - Says I, Bob, the guinea I must produce in Court that I took from you, you have had eight shillings, and I cannot give you any more.</p>

               <p>Court to Pugh. Was it in your presence that the prisoner offered to give him a note? - It was in my presence, voluntarily offered.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>

               <p>I lent him a mare, I was busy in the yard; I cannot speak to the prisoner's person; two men came to me for a mare, and agreed with me for two shillings; I went away, and he said he should not want it just then, but in about two hours; and about twenty minutes after one, he came again; I saw him go out of the yard with the mare, and I sent afterwards to Aldridge's, and he had had no mare there.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the mare from the time you delivered it till you saw him at the Justice's? - No.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I have no more to say than this; at the time he says the mare was lost I was down in Devonshire, driving the coach for my brother, then I drove a gentleman in town, then I drove the Sheriff of Bristol; I went out of town last August.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. The question for your determination, is, whether or no the prisoner came originally with an intention to steal this horse under the pretence of borrowing of it? or whether after borrowing this horse, a subsequent intention arose in his mind of stealing it? - Now the evidence, in this case, to shew the intention of stealing it is this; that he came with an excuse to hire this horse to go to Mr. Aldridge's to drive a carriage to Harley-street, &amp;c. it is not in legal evidence that he went to Aldridge's or to Harley-street.</p>

               <p>What sort of pistol was it that you was beat with? - It might be about this length, I have seen it since; I believe it is the prisoner Chambers who had but one eye that came to the assistance of the other two; I cannot swear to him.</p>

               <p>How long was it before the 30th of May? - I cannot tell, I bought them on the 19th, I gave four shillings for them, Chambers gave me six shillings; on the 30th of May I bought two watches of the three prisoners, they were altogether.</p>
               <p>Who bargained with you and took the money? - The tall man.</p>
               <p>Did either of the others say any thing about it? - Yes, Chambers said, if I would give him two shillings he would advise Gall to let me have them; I bought a hat of them in about ten minutes after, I sold the hat in Monmouth-street to a shopkeeper, they were all present when the hat was sold.</p>
               <p>Jealous. I delivered them this morning to the prosecutor, we kept them in case they should be wanted. (The watches produced by Davis, and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190048"/>Holmes. I have had mine between two and three years, I know it by the maker's name, and a silver cock.</p>
               <p>What is the maker's name? - Stevens, Bristol; I have no doubt but this is my watch, I lost it at the same time.</p>
               <p>Court to Ellis. Is that your watch? - Yes, I believe it is, I do not recollect the maker's name, but a watchmaker who has cleaned it for me is here, I did not make any particular remark at the time I wore it.</p>
               <p>Court. Who took the money for these watches? - I laid down the money, and they all took some.</p>
               <p>Did either of them take a part of the money? - Yes, I saw them with some silver in their hand which I had paid them.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. What silver did you give? - I gave half a guinea for the one and nineteen shillings and sixpence for the other in silver, Chambers was in the room, he shared the money, I think they all three took the money in their pockets when it was shared.</p>
               <p>How much money had Chambers? - A very small part; they each of them had some silver, and Gall had the half guinea, I am very sure that Gall took up the money, and gave it into Turwood's hand, and Turwood took the rest of the silver in his hand, I do not know what he did with it; after I had bought the hat of him I went away, Chambers had a sixpence in silver, and sent for some gin with it.</p>
               <p>Who produced the watches? - Gall produced one, and Turwood the other.</p>
               <p>To Jealous. What money had Chambers in his mouth? - Half a guinea.</p>
               <p>To Davis. What time of the day was this? - About half past ten, on the 30th, I went there about half after eight, and staid with them till about nine; when I sold the pistols Gall was there, and Chambers was there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Gall. These two men knows nothing of the robery, it was two other men that was along with me, I know nothing of these men, only seeing them once at a public house, and that was all.</p>
               <p>Court to the witness Davis. You have appeared here in a very bad light indeed, you sold Gall a brace of pistols, and you afterwards bought two watches, it is impossible but you must know how they were obtained, therefore let me admonish you.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long has Mr. Evans kept cash with you? - Our house has not been in being in the present firm before the first of January, 1785; I was then principal clerk where Mr. Evans kept cash; he began keeping cash the 1st of January 1785.</p>
               <p>You had been so conversant with Mr. Evans's hand writing, that on the first inspection of it you took it not to be his? - I did.</p>
               <p>You mentioned that to the young man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You pursued that idea, and said, are you sure it is his? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long was it after he went away that you saw him again? - Not till between eight and nine that evening.</p>
               <p>Where did you see him then? - At Bow street at the publick office.</p>
               <p>You sent your clerk to Mr. Evans? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You learned from your clerk (for I have no objection to all the hear say ) that this was not Mr. Evans's hand writing? - I did.</p>
               <p>Upon the inspection of it, it did not appear to be at all like Mr. Evans's hand-writing? - There was some similarity but not such as to deceive a clerk, unless it was overlooked; it is not well done.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a gold-beater; I live in Long-acre, the prisoner was bound apprentice to me about four years ago.</p>
               <p>Was he a servant to you at the time this happened? - I cannot say he actually was a servant at the time this happened, because he quitted my house the day before, the Sunday, in the forenoon, and did not return again.</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, that draft, is it your hand writing? - No, Sir, it is not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was he your apprentice? - Yes, for seven years.</p>
               <p>You say that it was not your hand writing? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>He lived in your house? - He did.</p>
               <p>He continued there down to the Sunday preceding this fact? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At what time did you learn from Mr. Wilkinson that such a draft had been presented? - I believe it was near about ten.</p>
               <p>At what time did you receive this letter? - On the Tuesday, and I believe it was on the Monday the banker's clerk came to me with the draft, and the hundred pounds, I received this letter on the Tuesday in the forenoon about eleven; I was dressing, I am positive it was not on the Monday, it was delivered to me by a servant of mine, and appears to have a penny-post mark upon it.</p>

               <p>You know his hand writing very well? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is that his hand writing? - I believe it to be his hand writing.</p>
               <p>Do you believe that to be his hand writing? - (Shewing him another paper.) - I do.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you know where this was found? - It was taken from him when he was searched.</p>
               <p>What was the first intimation you had of this young man's being in custody? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190052"/> About ten o'clock Sir Herbert's clerk came to me with that draft, and told me it had been presented for payment, but his master had his doubts about it, therefore sent me the hundred pounds, I took the draft in my hand and told him it was not mine; I had some conversation with the partners; Mr. Wilkinson went with me to Bow-street, it was about eleven when I went from Bond-street; we arrived at Bow-street about twelve.</p>
               <p>At that time had they had any intimation of the prisoner? - None that I know of.</p>
               <p>You then gave some intimation? - Yes, Sir, to Mr. Addington; about three a person came from the public office in Bow-street, to tell me that the prisoner was in custody.</p>
               <p>You gave the information in Bow-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner in consequence of that apprehended, or did he surrender himself; - I do not know, I heard he was in Bow-street; I went to him, but I did not ask him the question; my servant told me he was in custody, and had surrendered himself.</p>

               <p>Do you know whether he was apprehended? - I do not know, I have heard he surrendered.</p>
               <p>Court. I cannot take that either for or against the prisoner; he does not know.</p>
               <p>You found him in custody, and you do not know that he was apprehended? - Yes, I have reason to believe that he surrendered, but I do not know it.</p>
               <p>Court. If it turns out to be a material fact, I shall be glad, for somebody from Bow street to be sent for.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I recollect the first account was from my own servant, and afterwards a man met me and said, he was in custody, but whether he said, he was apprehended, or whether he surrendered, I do not know; the general account was, that he surrendered, I really believe he surrendered himself, but I cannot say upon my oath that he did.</p>
               <p>Have you had occasion to know the state of the mother's health? - I can say nothing of myself of the state of the mother.</p>
               <p>I ask you, whether from universal reputation, you know what the state of her intellects are?</p>
               <p>Court. Reputation is no proof of a fact that is capable of being proved; it is with great pain that I reject any evidence that can make for the prisoner, but I must do my duty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you know what the state of that boy's health was, who was living in your house, during the last eight months? - I looked upon him to be in as good a state of health as most.</p>
               <p>Then you did not know of any disorder under which he laboured? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Do you know that there was a disorder which was concealed from you? - Yes, Sir, a surgeon attended him for eight months.</p>
               <p>Do you, of your own knowledge, know whether he was taking mercurials or not? - No, Sir, if he did, he concealed it from me.</p>
               <p>How old is he now? - I take him now to be eighteen or thereabouts, rather more I believe.</p>
               <p>He was very much entrusted by you? - Within these three or four months he was; he has been within that time in the habit of selling goods in the shop.</p>
               <p>When you went to Bow-street, I believe you very humanely made this man an offer, that he might, if he pleased, go to the East Indies? - I did; that was previous to the examination.</p>
               <p>I cannot ask you legally what his answer was; but I may ask you this, did he accept it? - He did not.</p>
               <p>That was after he was in custody, and after he was charged with the commission of a capital crime, which he perfectly well knew would affect his life? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you now at the time I am speaking to you, any reason to believe that the prisoner at the bar committed this offence in order to be detected, in order to be brought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190053"/> to justice, and in order to destroy his own life? - I do not see how I can answer that question.</p>
               <p>I will repeat the question, have you now, at the time I am speaking to you any reason to believe that the prisoner at the bar committed this offence in order to be detected, in order to be brought to justice, and in order to destroy his own life? - I believe he committed that offence with intention to obtain the money.</p>
               <p>Have you or have you not reason to believe that the boy did this, actuated by desperation, and with intent to destroy his own existence? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I wish to read the letters and papers; I have already stated the ground on which I mean to defend this young man, which is, that he was insane: when I state that as an answer to an offence of this sort, I undertake a very difficult and arduous task; it is a sort of fact that carries with it some evidence against the prisoner; we have had a very melancholy instance of that sort, and the defence of insanity has been proposed as an answer to the commission of the greatest offence, that of murder; it has been asked of the witnesses, whether they had observed any thing in the conduct of the party, that induced them to form an opinion that the mind of that party was disordered; you cannot ask that question as to any one single fact, whether at that instant his mind was under the influence of insanity; but you are to lay before the Jury, a sufficient quantity of acts, in order to draw the inference for the Jury to presume that this person is not accountable; we therefore always ask what has the party done and said; and conducted himself; what has been your observation on the conduct of the party originally? and it is upon that idea I state to your Lordship the principle upon which I produce this as evidence; the acts of the party cannot be evidence for him, because they may be framed and fabricated for the purpose of defence; but the case of insanity differs from all other cases, because the law presumes that these are not the acts of the man that does them, but that he is as much a mere machine in the hands of something that governs him, as the beast in the street; in that view you take all the acts of the party as done before, and at the time of the fact: If I was to state to you that this was not a forgery, if I was to state to you that this was not the hand writing of Mr. Evans, I admit I could not make the acts of the young man evidence for him; but I say, he is insane at the time he did this; and if I shew he was rolling in the streets, that he was running about the streets with a fire brand in his hand, that he did not know his nearest relation; I should bring convincing proofs of his insanity: but if I cannot give that evidence, may I not shew that on the morning of this fact, he conducted himself as an ideot, that he did that which no man in his sound mind could do, that at the same time he was writing this draft, he wrote a letter to his master to shew that he had done it with a design to be brought to justice, that soon he hoped to meet his friends in eternity, and that his only object was to get rid of the troubles and inconveniences of life; if I might shew that he was running about with a sword to murder his own father and mother, may not I shew this? though it may not go the whole length of that evidence; surely I might shew that at that very instant he was making confessions under his own hands, stating that it was complete, and that his object was accomplished; if now, my Lord, after I have done that, I was to stop short there, you might answer why it is the act of the man contrived for the purpose; but I have other evidence; I know there are differences of opinion on the subject, but I mean to shew that antecedent to the birth of this young man, there has been a fatal lunacy in the family; I mean to shew acts of the most confirmed madness of this boy's mother, antecedent to his birth, and from his birth, and to this time; and that it has not been confined only to that branch of the family, so that madness certainly has descended to this unhappy family; what ever the opinions of the faculty may<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190054"/> have been on this subject: I mean to shew that a sister of this boy, of the same age, has been guilty of acts of madness; that by her own hands, she was once suspended within a very short period of eternity indeed, that she was cut down and restored to society; and when I have done this, it seems to me as if I had laid a great foundation for the introduction of these papers: I know this is before a Judge who will go all lengths that the law will permit him to go in favour of a prisoner, who will feel much more satisfaction, if the evidence should tend to the elucidation of the prisoner's innocence; but I know also that your Lordship cannot go beyond the bounds which the law prescribes.</p>
               <p>Court. I think you come short, and require something to introduce the evidence of these papers, and that in the present state of the business, they cannot be received; I am of opinion, that the acts of the prisoner are evidence in all cases, both for and against him, but not so of his declarations, either by word or by writing; now you state a supposition which is putting it in the strongest way, and would stagger me very much, with respect to the general rule of evidence; for the reading a letter from the prisoner without shewing when, in what manner, or on what occasion that letter was written, certainly falls very short of the case; thus far I think myself bound to declare my opinion, that you cannot be permitted to read these letters, unless you prove them written prior to the time of this tender: when you have done that, I will consider and give my opinion, as to the propriety of receiving them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is in evidence, that this was received early in the forenoon of Tuesday, I mean to produce it with the post mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Court to Evans. Was you present when

             received this letter? - I was from home, and was informed that the postman had brought this letter; it was in my possession between three and four; the young woman is not here; I was there about three, and I was questioning this young woman, and soon after the letter came, it was about ten minutes after three.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Do you know when it was put in the post? - No, Sir, I do not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How soon was it that you saw this young man searched? - I believe it was in a quarter of an hour after; it was all before four; as soon as I was informed he was in custody I went to Bow-street; I did not stay twenty minutes; when I returned I received this letter.</p>
               <p>Court. I think every thing found in his pockets when he was apprehended may be produced and read, but I wish to hear you Mr. Silvester.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What is found in his pockets is evidence against him, but not evidence for him.</p>
               <p>Court. It is evidence to operate as it may. You call a witness who apprehended the prisoner, or to whom he surrendered, you ask him, did you search that prisoner? yes; what did you find upon him? why I have found these papers; then the papers are to be examined by those conversant in the administration of justice, they are to have what operation they may; but it would be too much to say, I will read these over, I will burn all the rest: I am inclined to think at present, that whatever papers or property are found on him may be produced, and the papers read: now, put it another way, what did he say when he was apprehended; he says something that makes for him; can you exclude the operation of the answer?</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I have always heard it laid down, that what a prisoner says in confession of his guilt, is strong evidence against him, but what he says in extenuation of his offence cannot go to prove his innocence.</p>
               <p>Court. You have it in every day's practice; did the prisoner make the same confession when he was taken up that he does now? It is carrying the nicety too far, it is injustice to garble the declarations of a prisoner, now that principle will not go to the other letter found in the hands of another person, because it cannot be introduced as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190055"/> direct evidence for the prisoner, but when we come to examine the witness who apprehended the prisoner, I shall certainly permit that witness to be asked, what did you find upon him? and whatever was found upon him I shall certainly permit to be produced, read and shewn to the Jury.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I was present when he was searched; I saw the letter taken out of his pocket.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. Are they confined? - No, Sir, she stays at home, but she is not capable of doing any thing like another woman; it is melancholy madness that depresses the spirits, and that I have observed in the family.</p>

               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Had you ever heard the prisoner was particularly connected with any woman in the neighbourhood? - Never, Sir, till after he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Did you ever suppose him to be any way insane? - No, Sir, most assuredly not, if I had, I would not have continued him in my service in confidence.</p>
               <p>No acts of his have caused you to suspect so? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You did not understand at all that it was a criminal connection? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>

            ; this trial has taken a turn which makes the consideration of it painful; from the nature of the offence, as the fact is so clearly proved, you can have no doubt in this case that the forgery was committed, that this draft was tendered in payment by the prisoner, knowing it not to be the draft of Mr. Evans; but the defence set up is of such a nature, that it is right, in order to from your judgment upon it, that you should fully understand the way in which it points: The defence of insanity or disorder of mind where it is carried to a sufficient degree, is a defence for all crimes whatever, from the highest to the lowest, because, in order to constitute criminality, the act must be the act of the mind of the party that does it, it must be knowingly and voluntarily done; now if a person is not in his senses, or is so disordered as to take away the faculty of distinguishing between right and wrong, and of knowing the tendency<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190057"/> of the act which he does at the time, though mechanically it is the act of his body, though the letters are written, or the blow struck by him, which constitutes the crime; yet it is not the act of the person, that is, it is not the act of the mind; but in order to amount to that, it is necessary that the disorder of the mind should be such as takes away from the party all moral agency and accountability; such as destroys in them, for the time at least, all power of judging between right and wrong; that is the case with respect to all crimes; it seems to be peculiarly the case with respect to the crime of forgery, for in forgery it is not the mere act of writing the name of another person, or the delivering a paper upon which the name of another person is written, and not by themselves, that constitutes forgery; but the essence of forgery is the intent to defraud, and if therefore the party is incapable of knowing what he does, he can have no such intention, for he can as a moral agent have no intention at all: but you observe, that I have stated to you that it must be a total derangement of the mind; and it will be, therefore, for you to consider, whether there is any evidence in this case that can go any thing near that length; for unless it goes that length, it is my duty to tell you, however it may approach to that degree of disorder, which may make it perhaps a little painful to discharge one's duty under the uncertainty which may be introduced by such derangement of mind, yet unless it goes that length, it does not amount to a justification; the facts therefore, are no otherwise material, than as it may enable you to judge how far the conduct of the party, at the moment of the commission of the crime favoured of insanity or not; therefore it is with that view alone that I shall state to you the evidence of Mr. Wilkinson, and he says the prisoner brought the draft at half past nine in the morning, the clerk asked him how he would have it, he said in money, the clerk then shewed the draft to the witness, who asked him after his master's health, &amp;c. (Repeats his evidence.) Now to be sure there is nothing in the conduct and demeanor of the prisoner at the moment of uttering this draft that speaks any insanity or disorder of mind, more than that which appears in the mind of every man who breaks the law; his answers to the questions are distinct, and are answers calculated for the purpose of obtaining payment of the draft? now the operation of insanity must apply to every moment during the commission of the crime, and in this case I cannot discern, but you are to judge of it, I cannot discern in the conduct of the prisoner while in the banker's shop, any thing that in itself, and exclusive of the rest of the evidence, argues any degree of insanity or disorder of mind; Mr. Evans is then called, and he proves the draft to be not his hand-writing, &amp;c. (Repeats his evidence.) The papers that have been read certainly argue his strong intention of destroying his own life, though we cannot comprehend by what strange distorted mode of reasoning any man disturbed in his mind should pitch on that way to complete his own desperation, or that he should suppose there was less guilt in that than in the very act of suicide itself; these letters, however, if you believe them to be written prior to the crime, and not with an intention to be seen and produced, do certainly argue a disordered state of mind; but I am afraid, taking them at the utmost, they do not amount to a strict legal defence; for if a party for a criminal purpose of destroying his own life, commits a crime which he knows to be a crime, and amenable to the laws of his country, it is direct proof that he did know that he was breaking the laws of his country; I therefore do think that these letters do not amount to a proof of that kind of insanity, which is the strict defence in this case; besides that there are several witnesses called to prove a fact which would be a strong confirmation perhaps, if there was a direct evidence<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190058"/> of the insanity of the prisoner; we all know, without consulting surgeons and physicians, that that unfortunate disorder which affects both the mind and the body, and seems intimately connected with both, does descend in families, and does affect different branches of a family; but it would be a great deal too much to say in a court of justice, that a man should not suffer for a criminal act, because there is a disorder of that kind in his family, when the evidence given as to himself, personally, falls very short of what the law requires; I cannot, therefore, consistent with my duty, tell you that in point of law, all the facts put together, this defence does amount to a justification; but you are at liberty to form a very different opinion, and if you are satisfied that he was at that time under the influence of insanity, so as not to be a moral and accountable agent, you will acquit him; but if you think not, it is your duty to find him guilty.</p>

            , as you appear to have still remaining on your mind, some impressions of conscience, a sense of the submission that you owe to your Creator, and of a future state of existence, I think it my duty to address a few words to you in particular, in the melancholy situation in which you stand; happy shall I be if any thing I can say to you in your unhappy state, could ripen those seeds of conscience and of religion in your mind, into a proper sense of your duty to your Creator; you have expressed a submission to the laws of your country, which is highly praise worthy, but you must not deceive yourself by imagining, that a desire to die stands in the same situation with that submission; it is the duty of those that have violated the law to submit with patience to its punishment; but it is a crime against your Creator to wish to throw away your own life, and that unhappy wish appears from what you have now said, as well as from some unhappy circumstances upon your trial, to have actuated you to the commission of a capital offence. To come uncalled into the presence of your Creator is highly criminal of itself; he who made you best knows when you shall have fulfilled those purposes for which you were created, and he best knows when to call you out of this world; it is therefore the highest degree of presumption in you, to take that secret judgment to yourself, and to wish to throw away your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190059"/> own life; it is that disposition I would earnestly pray to God to correct in your mind before you are called hence, if that should be your fate; but if there are circumstances in your case (which I cannot promise you there are) which should induce your gracious sovereign to mitigate your sentence, and to prolong your existence, it is your duty to receive of God and of your sovereign, the boon of life with gratitude, instead of pevishly throwing it away: it remains therefore for me to pronounce on you the sentence of the law, which your crimes have merited, and which it is your duty to submit to, but not to desire.</p>
               <p>The Court then passed sentence of death on him and the other capital convicts.</p>

E. R. in my master's hand writing; I can swear it to be his hand writing; he was not at home at the time; I saw the dimity on the counter after the gentleman was gone out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? I can swear it.</p>
               <p>What is the lowest value of it? - It cost my master nineteen shillings and three pence; we sell it for more.</p>
               <p>Did not you see her hand or her cloak move? - I saw her hand behind her all the time she was in the shop.</p>
               <p>Then she was leaning against the counter where this piece was? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you see her move? - I saw her elbow move.</p>
               <p>Now, have you no doubt but that was the time when she took this piece of dimity? - I have no doubt but what it was.</p>

               <p>The man took me and sent for a constable, and then he picked up this piece of dimity, and told the Justice, that he went to the further end of the shop on purpose to give me an opportunity of taking it; he said, you have robbed me, but shall never rob me any more; here I am as innocent as the baby unborn.</p>

               <p>Can you speak with certainty as to his being the person? - I can with a very clear conscience; in the morning he came for the horse, and left the mare, it was not three o'clock when he went away, and when he came back again it was about a quarter past six; I saw him come up the ride the second time, and Mr. Wood delivered out the horses; I am sure he was the same man that came before, for I had the horse in my hand when he came up.</p>

               <p>Did you see him afterwards? - Yes, about three in the afternoon I was going out, he came in, and I was rather cross, says I, d - n it, you never come to your time, I have fed the mare, and watered her; he said nothing to me about the mare, only that it was very well; I saw no more of him, I went over to my mistress, and asked her his direction, but he was not present; I was with Knight at the office, this is the mare that was at the office, Mr . Blacketer came and detained the mare the next morning; when I had this conversation with the prisoner, he was at the stable door, the mare stood facing him, he told me to take care of her, that it was a young mare, and a very great favourite; she is a chesnut mare, with a blood tail, and a star in her forehead, she has one white foot, she has no more white about her legs.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I belong to the office in Litchfield-street, the prisoner was in my custody, I found the chesnut mare at the King's Head in Broad Saint Giles's with a blaze on her face; that was the mare that Mr. Walker saw; I believe it was between seven and eight on the Thursday morning.</p>
               <p>Did any of the witnesses that are now in court, and have given evidence, tell you who brought this mare to them? - The hostler, whose name I have forgot, I told him to stop her, and let nobody have her; I know he was advertised, I observed her one night, I think she has a little white on one of her heels, she is a pretty looking mare, a very fine looking mare, Mr. Walker said he knew the mare to be Mr. Dowse's property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Who gave you the first intimation of that mare being in the stable? - The prisoner told me then he lodged all night at the King's Head in Tottenham-court-road.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you then charged him with stealing this mare? - No, my Lord, he said before the Justice, he had lodged all night at the King's Head in Tottenham-court-road, and they sent me up there to know if he had been there, I enquired about him, and they knew nothing at all of any such person, so I went to New-prison, and I told the prisoner, you stole this horse, and you had better tell who was concerned with you.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell him it would be better for him? - There was no owner to this horse then, my conversation was about the other; he said he would tell me by and by; I said I would not believe him, as he sent me on a wrong message before, and told me lies; the conversation I had was about the other horse; he told me she was Lord Mansfield's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walker. I thought there was some little white upon two or three of her legs? - I am sure there was white on one of her feet, I cannot speak with certainty to the rest.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Blacketer. You know of the reward? - I saw it in the paper.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Walker. You know of this advertisement? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Knight. Have you seen this advertisement? - I saw it after I was at the justice's, but I never looked after it at all.</p>
               <p>Court to Wood. Did you see this advertisement? - I heard of it at the Justices, not till then.</p>
               <p>Did you know what the sum was? - No.</p>
               <p>To Knight. Did you? - Yes, five guineas.</p>

               <p>The horse and the mare were given to me in Tottenham-court-road, about one o'clock, or rather after, on Wednesday morning by two men; one of them called himself Hamilton; I was coming to town that morning about one, and I called at the King's head, it was so full of hay-makers, I could not get a lodging, and two men came with their two horses, and I asked them where they were going, they said not much farther, I told them I should be much obliged to them to tell me where I could get a lodging, one of them said yes, come with us my lad, take hold of that horse, and we will get you a lodging; they took me into a public house, I cannot tell the name of it, and asked me what I would drink, I told them I was very thirsty, they gave me a pot of porter, and they asked me to take these two horses down to the King's Head livery stables in Saint Giles's, and put them in there till the next morning, I told them I would, one of them came out with me to the door, and gave me the horses, and came with me almost to the place, for I am an intire stranger in town; I found this waterman at the stable door, and asked him for the hostler, he said he would call him up, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190065"/> did not awake him, he took the horses, but the stables were all locked up; the man who gave me the horses desired they might take particular care of the mare, for she was a favourite of Mr. Hamilton's; in the morning when I came at six, I found the horses in the yard, one of the men's name was Hamilton, the other I do not know; I have no witnesses.</p>

               <p>Court to Walker. Is Mr. Dowse here? - No.</p>
               <p>What may the value of this mare be? - I think she is very cheap at twenty guineas.</p>

               <p>Was there any other person near you besides the prisoner? - Only this man in the box, while he was doing it I felt him; my pocket was cut out.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say when the money was found upon him? - He said at first he had no money, but when it was found upon him, he said no more; they took him away to the watch-house; the money had no mark upon it.</p>

               <p>Was not you in company with women of the town that day you was robbed? - As to women of the town, I do not know what they were.</p>
               <p>But before you came to the Running-horse, was not you in company with women of the town? - I might, but that is nothing, I was robbed in this house, I have nothing further to say at all.</p>
               <p>But you shall answer; did not Mrs. Butler tell you if you slept there you would certainly be robbed? - She might say so.</p>
               <p>Do you admit she did say so or not? - Well, I believe she did.</p>
               <p>Did not you in answer to that, say to her I am not affraid of being robbed, for I have been in company with two women of the town, and I am perfectly secure? - No, I did not, I will take my oath of that I did not.</p>
               <p>Did not you say, you had been in company with women of the town, and that they had got all the money you had about you? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>I ask you on your oath, did not the prisoner Duncan go home with you, at the request of his mistress to see you safe? - Yes, and I thought it had been the landlord of the house.</p>
               <p>Have you any charge against the prisoner Duncan respecting the robbing of you? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Was Duncan searched? - Yes, there was only a knife found upon him; no money.</p>

               <p>This man was at my mistress's house, he had a parcel of women, he was very drunk; my mistress came and said, friend, if you have money you shall leave it; indeed, madam, says he, I have but very little money; for, says he, I lost a couple of guineas any how; he said he was not at home the night before; and she sent me home with him; I went along with him all the way; he knocked at the door, and the landlord would not let him in, then he wanted me to go along with him to have something to drink; I had a pot or two of ale with him; says I, Mr. Reeves I wish you would hold up your head, so he stood up and said he had lost his money, and the constable came in and took me in custody; before Jones came in I could have gone away long before; so they took me up and brought me down here.</p>

               <p>"God that scoundrel has got my watch," then I put my hat on, and went into the street in search of these fellows, but I could not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190069"/> find them; I never got my watch again; I immediately went down to Bow-street and gave information of the persons, and advertised it with a guinea and a half reward; on Thursday, July the 13th, I saw the prisoner,; I am sure it is the very same man; there was nothing found upon him of mine; on Thursday afternoon about six o'clock I was going down to Grea Russel-street, I met the prisoner and another person near the Museum, I passed them, and just as I passed them,</p>
               <p>"Good God, says I, that is on of the villains that stole my watch," I followed them, and looked him full in the face, and I said, How do you do Sir? he made no answer, but looked at me; Well, says I, you never called to see my lodgings again according to your promise; says he, your lodgings, your lodging! Sir; yes, Sir, says I, my lodging; pray Sir, says he, where do you live? says I in Bentick-street, Berwick-street, Soho; Bentick-street, Berwick-street, Soho! says he; and after a little while, says he, oh, now I recollect, now I recollect; says I, what was the reason you did not call? says he I acquainted my friend about it, and he did not think it would suit him, so I did not think it of any matter to call; says I, do you know that the person that was with you took my watch? your watch! your watch! Sir, says he, I will take my oath of it, where is he, oh, he knew very well, says he, I will tell you what, friend, if you will call upon me to-morrow morning, I will give you a direction where you may call; so he gave me a direction, I told him I insisted on having him before a magistrate immediately; says he, mind what you say, Sir, says he, I am a gentleman, and I am a house-keeper below the Museum; well, says I, I am going to Bloomsbury-square, and will walk with you, and take your adress, I proposed to go to a public house, he agreed to that, and we went into a house, and they went into a back room, and rung the bell, and called the landlord, he ordered three-pennyworth of crank, and smiled, and seemed quite good natured, thinking to come over me, but I insisted on having him before a magistrate; by and by he opened the door and went into the passage, I followed him, he turned to the window at the bar, that opens into the passage, and paid for his crank, he then turned and saw me, I followed him, and he went into the back parlour and sell for the lock, then he came up to me and said, what do you mean by this you scoundrel, why do you follow me; I was in great danger, I called in the landlord, and desired him to send for a constable; he refused, and he said he knew the gentleman, he believed he lived somewhere near the Museum; I desired he would send for a constable; by and by the prisoner opened the door and run out, and run away, I followed, and the friend that was with him caught hold of my arm, I gave myself a throw, and gave the other a blow on the breast, I ran after the prisoner, and called stop thief, and in St. Giles's somebody took him, at last I got him down to Bow-street with great difficulty.</p>

               <p>I failed from the river Thames; the ship was taken away by the prisoners, and run into Dungenness; we were all ordered to go on shore, me and four or five more remained in the hold; I went over with the ship; she had a very bad passage; we were taken into a port in Maryland; the evening after we came in we were froze; the captain asked me, if I wished to be an indented servant, he said, he would write out our indentures, and the people would come on board and purchase us; he begged us to tell nobody, as there were about forty that were disposed of to the town of Baltimore; and some of them made a noise, calling them thieves; the inhabitants then began to find it out that they were convicts, they would not admit any to come on shore, nor go to purchase them; the inhabitants then discharged those that they had, and sent them into the woods; I was five weeks on board myself, when they found the vessel was obliged to go to another place, a merchant came on board, and took me to his own house; he asked ninety guineas for me, for three years, and the people thought it was too much; I was a fortnight at his own house, he got me a master who was a quaker, five miles from thence; after he found I was a convict he would not let me stay, he took me down to the place called the Notletts, and put me on board a ship, and he gave twelve dollars for my passage home; I told the captain I should be very happy to stay, he gave me leave to quit the ship, says he, do not let me see you leave it: I travelled night and day for three days, for fear I should meet with somebody to interrupt me and take me, I went to Petersburgh in Virginia, I got work there, this gentleman who purchased me, he was acquainted with this person that I worked for, whose name is Taylor; they happened to be coming through the country, they called there and saw me; the moment he had done so, he insisted on my going with him, that I was his servant; he said, he would send me home; he took me from Petersburgh, and put me on board a collier, and sent me home; I was obliged to come home; I brought some letters for a merchant.</p>
               <p>Court. They did not force you on board? - He said, I was his servant, as he had indented me for sixty guineas; my master put me on board the vessel first, but the captain gave me liberty to leave it; I was exceedingly well satisfied; my master when he called at Petersburgh he brought me and put me on board a vessel, a collier which came from Leeds, at least she went from there to Leeds, and he agreed with the captain to bring me over, the captain of the ship brought me over, when he found I was a convict, he would not let me be about his house.</p>

               <p>Was you drunk or sober? - Not at all drunk; I answered the prisoner, I had no papers of consequence in my pocket, only such as the world may say, might see were kept for necessary uses, and I thought it was impossible to pick my pocket to rob me because my pockets were inside; I did not know but the prisoner's intentions were well towards me, and I thought the other men being strangers might want to pick my pocket; the prisoner and me went on, he asked me where I was going, I said, to the city, he said, he was going to Whitecross-street, says I, let us go to the Coach and Horses which is a genteel house, and I will treat you with part of a pot of beer, and we shall be company for one another; we accordingly went there, and called for a pot of beer, the waiter brought it, I drank to him, and likewise he drank to me, and the prisoner says, upon my word, Sir, it is a pity that buckle of yours should be lost, it is very pretty, let me look at it; so to satisfy his curiosity I gave it into his hand to look at, and he put it into his pocket; Sir, says I, I shall be obliged to you; for the buckle again; the answer he made me was, you d - nd rascal, you gave me no buckle; why, says I, my friend you are a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Was not you the worse for liquor? - I did drink, but I was not drunk.</p>
               <p>But you was somewhat affected with drinking? - I cannot say, but a man that does drink may be a little affected with drinking; I cannot say that I was drunk, I was sensible of what I was about; the prisoner took an opportunity of concealing it while I had the pot in my hand, I told the prisoner not to make a noise in the house, and to return it again without any more to do; then he says to me, the devil's cure to you, why did you give it me? that was his repetition; when I found the prisoner's intention I called the waiter, and desired him to call a watchman, for the prisoner wanted either to rob or swindle me out of a gold breast buckle; the waiter called the watchman, and we took the prisoner as far as St. Martin's watch-house; when he was brought there, he entirely denied having it, the constable of the night stopped him he could not find it on him; my being in the tayloring line, I says to the constable if there is a private place in any of his garments, I think I can find it, for I think it is impossible for him to convey it away; his coat lay on the form, and I asked the constable of the night's permission if I might take the liberty of searching, the constable he gave me leave so to do, I took it and felt his coat, and it was a faced coat, and in his breast there was a bit of a private pocket, and I may say, I just put two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190073"/> or three of my singers in, and there lay the breast buckle; I says to the constable, if you will but take this out, I fancy it must be it; the constable of the night took it out, and he has it to produce.</p>

I said, just by Tottenham-court-road, and the prisoner said, he lived next door to my master, and it was a very great load, and they came down behind me and before, and they followed me down some street, and they wanted me to go to some court and pitch my basket, I said, no, I am almost at the place; then somebody called after me stop, I put down my basket, and I found seven shillings and sixpence in half-pence were gone, and the man that run away he chucked down one of the bundles of halfpence at me; that was in Wild-street I heard the cry of stop thief; the other man had got the halfpence.</p>

               <p>I lost the things mentioned in the indictment the 19th of June; a little after six, and I met my woman; we both went home together, and the first thing we saw on our return was the prisoner coming out of the door of our house; she lodged in the same house; the moment she saw us she turned in her head; I ran and unlocked the door, and I missed one coat, two waistcoats, one pair of breeches, one cloak, one handkerchief and one pair of stone knee-buckles set in silver, they may be worth four or five shillings; I asked my woman what became of the things.</p>

               <p>What your wife? - Yes, my lord, and I was going up stairs, and I saw the prisoner sitting on the stairs with something in her lap; I asked her what it was, she said, they are your things; I said, so I suspected; she said, it is so, and what of that; I took the things out of her lap down stairs, and put them in the room again; I made her go up stairs till I searched the things, then I missed the pair of buckles, and the handkerchief; she would not acknowledge the things, so I went for an officer, and kept her in custody; and I went to her to Newgate on Monday evening, and she told the she have the buckles into a horse pond where the horses drink; I went there and searched and found one of the buckles on Tuesday evening; I never found the handkerchief, she gave me no account of that; all the rest of my things I have got; they are here.

               <p>Prisoner Bell. Do not you recollect sitting in the bar, and my wishing you a very good night when I went out? - I believe he was not gone, to the best of my knowledge, I was sober.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Strong. Do not you remember my wishing you a good night at one, while you was lolling your head on the bar? - No; I have often seen the prisoners both in the week before the robbery, and several times before for two or three months.</p>

               <p>Did they continue there till Mr. Harrison went to bed? - I do not rightly remember whether they did or not, I remember letting Bell out before Mr. Harrison went to bed; I do not recollect either letting Strong out or seeing him go out; I saw Strong last in the house, between ten and eleven, that was about the time that the dog was dying, I did not much mind about the dog, I am quite sure to the fastening the bar.</p>
               <p>Is that petitioned off from the tap room? - As it opens into the tap room, there is open work, that goes down of a night; I locked the door of the bar, and all the doors in it, my brother was the last up.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing not in the bar when you went to bed, that was there in the morning? - In the morning I found in the bar a red garter that had not been there the night before; I missed two quart silver tankards, and one silver pint, two silver salts, two silver table spoons, four silver tea spoons, one silver watch; it was in the drawer locked up, where the salts and table spoons were, there was some silver coin of King William and Queen Mary; I do not know what it was; there was a guinea of King William and Queen Mary.</p>
               <p>What time did you go into the taproom in the morning? - I got up about about half after seven; I lost a work-bag, containing a new shirt, almost finished, and two pocket handkerchiefs that have since been found, there were several pieces of cotton; I have the garter, and have had it ever since; I have seen the prisoners several times at my house, nobody has any access to the bar except people belonging to the house; they were all in the bar, I saw them. I observed this man at my house that night; I have seen the prisoners several times at my house before, but never saw them in the bar.</p>

               <p>I assisted in the apprehension of both these prisoners; it was last Sunday morning; I took Strong at a house in Old-street road, I was with Jealo us; we had been Grub-street, and had information that he lived about Saffron-hill quaater, but we thought to call at this house in our road, and Jealous got out of the coach, and left us three in, presently a boy came and beckoned us, and there we found the prisoner Strong, East was there, and some other persons, some boys that I did not take much notice of, that I suppose are always there, and there were some things found by some of the other people, not by me, and we sent East to New-Prison, and Strong was carried to Covent-Garden round-house, I did not see the garter found; I was told that I should see East at the Adam and Eve in the afternoon, there I found Bell, and took him into custody, and he was very troublesome, he said he would be d - nd if he would be tied or taken, or any thing of the sort; I told him it was for breaking into a house in Fleet-street that you are wanted for.</p>
               <p>What did he say to that? - He did not like it, he said something of living in Fleet-street, or working there; I found a little small gimblet about him, nothing like a housebreaker's tool; Shallard and Townsend were with us.</p>

               <p>I live in Old-street; I know both the prisoners at the bar by sight; I remember the day that Jealous and the other officer came to my house, it was last Sunday; Strong was there, he came to know whether every thing was safe that I had of him; I had two tankards, a pair of salts, one milk pot, some silver coin, a watch, and a napkin, marked L. T; I had them of him between seven and eight in the morning; I went and fetched them from Bell's room.</p>

               <p>Where was that room? - In Aldersgate-street; they fetched me at half past six to go to Bell's; I asked them what they wanted, and they both told me they had some plate; they both spoke; I went soon afterwards to the house of Bell, in Aldersgate-street, facing Westmorland-buildings; nothing passed in the room till the plate was weighed; Bell took the plate out of a small hand basket, and weighed it; I carried the scales with me, it weighed seventy-five ounces; he took them out by pieces; Strong was present; when I had weighed it, I tied it up in the napkin, and I put it on the bed while I paid them the money; I put the money on the table; they did not share it while I staid; I was to have the plate, and watch, and five pieces of silver coin, and a guinea with a King William and Queen Mary's head on it; I had it from Strong first, and I returned it to Strong and he gave it to Bell, in the room that Bell calls his room; I had never been at that room before; I was to give them twenty pounds for the whole; I gave them nineteen guineas and a shilling, that makes twenty pounds; I carried the plate away with me; nobody went with me; I went to my own house; I saw Strong, he came about half past nine to know whether every thing was safe.</p>
               <p>What to know whether it was all put into the crucible? - I suppose so; while he was talking about that, in came Mr. Jealous and asked Alexander where it come from, and he said, from Fleet-street; in the room where I weighed it, I asked him does it come far or near, and he said, it does not come far, it comes from Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>It then became necessary to put it in the melting pot sooner? - Yes, a great deal the sooner.</p>
               <p>You was taken into custody? - Yes, and sent to New-prison.</p>
               <p>How long was it before any body came to you? - Bell came to me in the afternoon of the Sunday; he came to see me, and told me, if I held my tongue nothing could hurt; Bell was taken that night; that work bag was wrapped in the basket, to keep the plate from gingling; it was put in by Bell and Strong; I delivered it to Mr. Carpmeal, they were the same I bought of the prisoner; I gave twenty pounds for it.</p>

               <p>Were these lads drunk or sober? - Sober, and very decent.</p>
               <p>How was the flap of the cellar window fastened? - With a smallish dog.</p>
               <p>How was that dog fastened? - I believe it was not much fastened, they might lift it up on the outside.</p>
               <p>How were the doors fastened? - Locked and bolted, and all very safe; and we came down stairs and unbolted them; there was but one dog, and that they some how or another got up.</p>
               <p>It was but badly fastened? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Will you describe a little more particularly the nature of this flap, does it project from the street, or is it flat on the pavement? - Flat on the pavement.</p>
               <p>Then upon this flap there are two doors I suppose? - No, only one.</p>
               <p>Then there is this put which you call a dog on the pavement; is there any communication from the cellar to your dwelling house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How lately before had that been opened to let down any liquor? - Upwards of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190085"/> three weeks; I have been examined before Sir

               <p>Then do you recollect telling my Lord Mayor that you really could not tell whether the brewer might not have left the door open? - I am sure it was fast, because I took hold of the bar to see, for we had been alarmed the night before.</p>
               <p>When you found these lads they were quite clean? - Yes, and very sober; I believe he had the same coat on he has now, and clean and decent; I found no implement of house breaking at all, nothing but a key atop of the cellar stairs; there is a door in the tap-room which we fasten at nights; therefore in order to get at any thing valuable in the house they must break through that door, except going into the cellar; the cellar windows are very shallow, not above four or five feet.</p>
               <p>When you saw Burdett, you said, I am astonished you should get into scrapes so near home? - His father keeps a public house close to me.</p>
               <p>I may venture to ask this, which is an odd question to ask of a prosecutor, what is his character? - I heard them say he was a very bad boy; an idle boy.</p>
               <p>But an honest one? - I never heard much of his honesty; his father said, I am sorry to meet you on this occasion; I shall be very glad to send him abroad.</p>

               <p>My partner called me from my stand, and I went down; and the window of Mr. Hearn's door was open; we found Evans first laying on a butt.</p>
               <p>Describe how you found him? - He was laying along upon three or four butts; I asked him what he did there; then my partner came down and we took him up stairs.</p>
               <p>What account did he give of his being there? - He said he fell into the cellar.</p>
               <p>Was he in liquor? - I did not perceive him in liquor at all.</p>
               <p>Where did you find the other prisoner? - I found the other prisoner between the butt and the wall in the cellar; when I asked who was there twice, he did not answer; then says I, I will strike you with my staff; I told him, it was him I wanted, and nobody else.</p>
               <p>Jury. How did you find the flap of the window? - Over the curb, about six or nine inches, I will not say to an inch or two; finding it in that manner we supposed somebody to be in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Court. It was not lifted up quite? - It was not, it did not lay in the grove or rabbit.</p>

               <p>Did you know the pencil to be yours? I had it the day before, and it was broke when it was found upon him, I did not know it by any particular mark, I thought it might be mine, the handkerchief was mine, I knew it by its being so very dirty, and two direction cards in my own hand writing, they had been in the coat pocket where the waistcoat was.</p>

            , you have been guilty of an offence of this sort; aggravated as it was, you have added greatly to that aggravation by attempting to keep yourself from the hands of Justice in the manner you have done; the offence was certainly a very bad one, and when persons attempt to support such conduct by attacking those whose duty it is to bring them to justice, and by attempting the life of those people that come to apprehend them, it is peculiarly necessary they should be made examples of; in this case it is not owing to you, but rather to the hand of Providence, that the lives of these persons were saved; the sentence therefore is, that you be transported for seven years to Africa</p>

               <p>The prisoner Roger worked with me some time, as a shopmate, he went away for three or four days, and the master sent me after him, he came to work again, and asked me to buy a watch of him.</p>
               <p>Recollect as near as you can when that was? - I believe it was some time in February, but I cannot say.</p>
               <p>The beginning or the latter end? - I cannot say, I knew of his being taken into custody, it might be about six or eight weeks before he was caught.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. How long after your things were lost was it, that you got the warrant against these people, and had them taken up? - It was a good bit after, I do not know how long.</p>
               <p>What is the date of the commitment? - The 5th of June.</p>
               <p>Baker. It was in February that I bought the watch, it was a small silver watch, it was pawned for a guinea, at a pawnbroker's, Charnel-street, Grosvenor-square; the prisoner, Roger, took me to the pawnbroker's where the watch was, and I took it out of pawn, and gave him half a guinea besides, I took the watch and kept it afterwards, till I had a summons come from Litchfield-street, and I went and gave the watch to one Mansfield; the prisoner Roger was not in custody, the prisoner William was; it was some time in February that the prisoner William was taken up; I might have had the watch a fortnight, it was the latter end of February.</p>

               <p>Was the watch you delivered to Mansfield the same watch that you bought of the prisoner? - Yes; he said he had a watch on board a ship, I did not enquire, as I always took him to be a very honest man, I never saw any misbehaviour before, I never saw him wear a watch before.</p>

               <p>Court to Baker. How long before you gave the watch to Mansfield was it that you bought it? - I cannot say, to the best of my knowledge it was some time in February; I cannot tell how long I had the watch.</p>

               <p>Had you it a week? - Yes, more than a week; I gave him half a guinea, and took the duplicate in my own name, and it was some time after I bought the watch that I took it out of pawn.</p>
               <p>Might that be a month? - I do not think it was.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoners. You have both been convicted upon evidence which appears to me, as it has done to a very cautious and attentive Jury, perfectly satisfactory, each of you of felony, but unquestionably your degree of guilt is extremely different; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190103"/> misfortune of the younger prisoner seems to have been that of having a very abandoned and wicked father, who, instead of protecting his younger years and training him up in the paths of honesty and virtue, has been unquestionably the means of bringing his son as well as himself into the situation in which they stand; in such a situation the case of the son deserves compassion, the case of the father deserves none; and if the law had made it a capital crime, few would have deserved that sentence more; but the law has not made it a capital offence, and the punishment of the father, wicked as he is, must be short of death; but when we consider that he has been the instigator of his son to commit this crime, of which he was to be the partaker, and has afterwards sought to cover that crime, by bringing a perjured witness into Court; it appears that no punishment short of death can be too great for that offence; the offence of the son, would under the influence of the father alone, call for a milder degree of punishment than I think it will now admit of, because it was committed with the circumstances of a breach of trust, rising in the night and robbing his fellow apprentice while he was in sleep; I therefore think that less punishment than the usual one of transportation would not be adequate to the offence of the son; the sentence of the Court is, that you

               <p>My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, the prosecutor stood as I came down stairs; I asked him what o'clock it was, he said, six or half past six, and I wished him a good morning; I should think if any body had robbed him, they would not have stopped to have asked questions; why did not the woman follow me, I went gently from the door, and I went to the public house over the way.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Kemp. I saw nothing of him; I run immediately; I never saw him till I saw him at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>I am a coach-maker; I saw this cart opposite my house on Tuesday; it stood against the shop, as it has done a good many years; I saw the prisoner in the shop where I work, he was talking about bringing some little wheels, I bargained with him for the wheels; I went out to see what was the matter, and I saw the prisoner walk with it under his arm; I did not see him take any thing out of the cart, I called halloo, and he began to run, and then I called stop thief, he ran down to the bottom of the street with the cag under his arm; it was thrown down; I did not see him throw it down.</p>
               <p>Was he out of your sight? - Never, from one end of the street to the other till it was thrown down, then he turned the corner, and was out of my sight for a few<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190106"/> minutes; I went to the bottom of the street as quick as I could; I saw the prisoner coming along in custody to our shop.</p>
               <p>In whose hands did you see the cask? - It was an entire stranger to me that had it, and they gave it to me directly.</p>
               <p>Should you know the person again if you was to see him? - Yes, the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Do you believe the cask that is now produced in Court, was the cask that was under the prisoner's arm? - It was the same size; I believe it was the same; I gave the cask to Cheese the distillers man directly; Cheese marked it at the Justice's, and made a long stroke and a little one; here is the mark.</p>

               <p>Upon the oath that you have taken had you been sitting down in the park at all that night? - No, Sir; I had never opened my lips to any body breathing.</p>
               <p>I understand you have since found the centinel? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You was along with a man, I was passing with a girl, ask him one question, whether I did not tell the men that are over him at St. James's the next day, that I saw him on duty, I accused him of it before my serjeant in the street, and told him every thing of it, and he denied he was there.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not see him till a fortnight after.</p>
               <p>Did he accuse you before the serjeant? - No, he did not.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The next day that I saw him, on the 25th of June.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Did you charge him before the serjeant? - I said to my serjeant there is the man that I saw last night.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you see that man the next day? - I never saw him for a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Did he accuse you the next day?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I say the next time that I saw him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, my Lord, he said he saw no harm of me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him whether when Lord Harrington's servants were walking with him, I told him of the things that he had done, and if he would come the next morning, there were three men that did accuse him of these things, that he had connections with him in the park, and when Lord Harrington's black servant heard it, he left him.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did he charge you with indecency before Lord Harrington's servants? - He said he saw me with a man in the manner that he has now been saying, and before Lord Harrington's servants, when the other two ran away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why did not he take me up before that time? - I did not know him, I could not have known him if he had not attacked me the second time, nor I should not have known the other two.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him whether that man that stands along with him at the front gate of the park did not say he would not stand with such a man unless he cleared himself up, for he was a man that was not sit to talk to a man? he only took me up for defence of his own character, he would not have taken me up, and said nothing at all to me if I had held my tongue.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Would you have me ask him that question.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to let me consider of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190109"/> if you please to ask whether he was not sat down on one of the benches with a soldier, and whether I did not pass by with a girl? - I never was off my legs, nor saw any woman in company with any soldier.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I dossed my shoes off my feet, and went and run up to the place to hear, I could not hear what passed, but as soon as they got off their seat, says the soldier, I will have something more to drink.</p>

               <p>He is in the same regiment with you? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you know the other two men? - I did not, they were strangers to me; I think two of them belonged to the Cold-stream, and the other to the third regiment, I do not know that I ever saw them before in my life.</p>
               <p>What regimentals had they on? - Two of them had two Coldstream coats on, that is the second regiment, and one of them had the third regiment; two of them were grenadiers, and one was a hatman.</p>
               <p>Of what regiment is the prisoner? - The first, he was on duty at that time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was on duty there.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner on duty? - Not in the park, he belonged to the king's guard that night, he went off to his guard that night; the prisoner belonged to that guard that marched off the parade that morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What business had he in the park at that time of night? - He might be walking through to see his wife safe home.</p>
               <p>But his business did not require him to be in the park? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. He was obliged to be near? - Yes; but he had liberty to go any where in the park, or assist any sentry.</p>
               <p>Where is the guard room? - Just by the park.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether I did not ask him if I was the man, before Lord Harrington's servants, and he said no?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I said he was the man that first demanded the money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor then said to Lord Harrington's servants that I was not one of them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There was only three soldiers in all, and the prisoner was the first man that made the expression of money; this was the man that said damn my eyes he must give us some money.</p>

               <p>I was not the man that spoke a word to him, neither wrong nor right till the sentry was charged with him; I had no conversation with him; I was along with a girl at the same time; I came down the park, and a soldier and he had a tustle; the three men said they would have something to drink, or else they would take him to the guard-room, and he said he would give them no more; then he went to Lord Harrington's servants, and I came up; the prosecutor had an apron on, and a round hat; and his hair was tied at that time, and his apron was tucked on one side; and when I saw him with the soldier, his apron was wrapped up plump round him; and when he got up he put down his apron; I said to the prosecutor, you know you have behaved indecent to the soldiers, and am I one of the men; no says he, you are not; and when I told the black servant the whole of it, he would not go no farther; I went to the guard-room, and told the serjeant of it; the next morning I could see never a marshalman, but I asked the man that took care of the king's chapel, I described the prosecutor as a tall man that stooped in his walk; he could not tell me his name; the next day I went on guard, that was the 20th, and I asked the name of the marshalman, they said, I believe by the description it is Mr. King; says I, I saw him doing things he should not, with a soldier, one night between ten and eleven; I could not see him that day; I constantly told of it, and was told that he went in the report of a shake; and the marshalman said they would not stand with him without he would clear it up; I never was reported to captain, colonel, or serjeant for wronging any man; I never was in prison before in my life; I am lately come out of the country; I have not been long in the regiment; Mr. King would not come down to speak to me when they went up.</p>

               <p>Court. Take care what you say; are you sure that there were three soldiers besides the prisoner? - Yes, two of the second regiment, and one of the third.</p>
               <p>Court. Take care you do not swear<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190111"/> falsely; you may answer for that in another place? - Then the prisoner came up and said, sentry I would take them all to the guard-room if I was you, which I refused, and would not take him; I told him they were more able to take him than I was, I was not able to take four to the guard-room; the prisoner walked off to his guard immediately, the other three soldiers and the gentleman went towards the guard-room, where I was centinel.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. How many soldiers were there? - Three, the prisoner and two more; there were only three in all, and the prisoner was the first that collared me opposite Marlborough-wall, and the first man that demanded my money; I am sure that it was the prisoner; I was worse used by the prisoner than by any of the others; he swore he would have money; I swear to him from the recollection of his voice when he spoke to me the second time, and from the threatening expressions he made use of.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoner. Have you any other witnesses to examine? - I came and told the serjeant in the guard-room that night; I told it the next day to the Marshalman, and the prosecutor might have come down to St. James's, and have taken me up any day; he knew I was on guard every fifth day; and if he could have sworn to my voice, why did not he come the next day, or the day after? it was three weeks before he took me up.</p>

               <p>I am a serjeant; on the 15th of June, about eleven at night, the prisoner came to the guard-room, and accused a gentleman, one of the marshalmen (he did not mention his name) with sitting with a soldier in the park, upon one of the benches, with one arm round the soldier's neck, and the other hand in his breeches; I heard no more of it; on the 25th of June, that was ten days afterwards, I saw the prisoner speaking to the prosecutor in St. James's street, fronting St. James's coffee-house; I did not hear what passed; I was standing in front of St. James's gate; I saw them talking together in the middle of the street for about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Was you before the magistrate when this man was taken up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you say this at that time? - I was only asked to the soldier's character, I did not mention this.</p>
               <p>How came you not? - I was not asked that question.</p>

               <p>Court to Serjeant. What has been his general character? - He never was taken up for any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>What has been his general character as a man? - I know no other of him than I know he lived with a woman of the town.</p>
               <p>Did he bear a good character as an honest man? - I never heard to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe you was asked as to his character before the magistrate? - Yes, as a <rs id="t17860719-69-deflabel341" type="occupation">soldier</rs>

               <p>What character did you give him before the magistrate? - All that I said was, that he now and then neglected duty, and came dirty to duty at times; I was not asked whether he was an honest or dishonest man.</p>
               <p>Court. Then I ask you now what has been his general character? - I never knew him dishonest.</p>
               <p>What has been his general character, men have characters, I do not ask you to particular acts? in what reputation has he generally been for his honesty in the regiment? - He has never behaved amiss any farther than what I have told you.</p>
               <p>That is not an answer. - I never heard him accused of any dishonesty.</p>
               <p>Then he has had a general good character? - Yes, as an honest man, I never heard any thing to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Are you of the same regiment with that man? - Yes, Sir, of the same company; I have been in the company seven years.</p>

(Produced and deposed to.) I found her in Bell-alley, Golden-lane; I asked who was the person that lost their watch, the prosecutor said, I am; I said, where is the girl that robbed you; he said, here; I took her into custody, she confessed she had the watch; I asked the prosecutor if it was his, and he said, yes; I have had it ever since; there is the picture of a woman on the chain; I cannot say the maker's name, or the number, the seals are red.</p>

               <p>Did he always persist in denying it? - When Sir Sampson asked him if he had taken it, his answer was, it was a hard question to answer. (The half crown and shilling produced.) It has not been in my possession till I came into Court; it has been in father's possession ever since; he could not attend.</p>
               <p>But how do you fix that the money you are going to produce now is the same you took from the prisoner? - By the mark which corresponded with the marked money in the drawer.</p>
               <p>Jury. You doubted the mark on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190116"/> shilling, was the mark that was on the half crown the same that was on the shilling? - The same mark undoubtedly; the shilling was taken first before I went to the shop, the half crown was taken the time I was in the house; and the half crown I could particularly swear to, because I particularly examined it after I found the shilling had been taken.</p>
               <p>What sort of marks were those that your father put on the money? - With the rim of the shilling and the half crown they formed a triangle.</p>
               <p>(Shewn to Court.)</p>
               <p>Court. The lines meeting upon it formed a triangle with the rim of the money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the same mark put on the shilling and on the half crown? - I think on one parcel the mark was rather larger than on the other.</p>
               <p>But I speak on the parcel which was found on the boy, the shilling is the same? - Exactly the same, except it had been made by a rule.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect no specific difference between the mark on the shilling and the half crown? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Had the shilling and the half crown of that parcel which he took the same mark? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you examined this mark then to see whether they have the same mark? - I have, and they agree as perfectly as possible.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any specific difference (I do not mean by line or compass) between the shilling and the half crown? - I do not.</p>

               <p>The half crown, that has the impression plain upon it, was that which was found upon the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you observe on the other parcel the difference of the marks? - (Shewn to the Jury.) - I can speak with greater certainty to the half crown than I can to the shilling, although in my own mind I believe as to he shilling, the impression on the half crown is stronger, and I particularly examined the mark to see whether it was plain, whether if it was to be taken away I could distinguish it again.</p>

               <p>The money the prosecutor lays to my charge is the money I received from Mrs. Morrice.</p>

               <p>The prisoner talled three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Evans. Is this place kept locked? - It was generally, but I cannot swear it was then.</p>

               <p>What acts can you give us an account of that she did from which you so collect? - If you asked her a question she would not give you an answer; and if she did give you an answer, it would not be the proper answer but the question we asked her.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect any particular instance of that sort? - If you asked her how she did, she said when she got up she did not like to go to bed, and when she went to bed she did not like to get up.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any thing else particular?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190118"/> - Yes, Sir; on the 30th of May I went up stairs to her apartment to ask her whether she would have any beer, and she sat with her hands before her, and never made me any answer, but looked very wild at me indeed, I asked her again, and she made me no answer; I was very much frightened; I turned round under a pretence to buckle my shoe because she should not see that I was frightened.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was she alone then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. What did she say or do? - I turned round, because I thought if she thought I was frightened she would break out; she said nothing, but kept her eyes fixed, and looked very wild.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any other instance of her talking wildly? - Yes, Sir; she told me several times she would haunt me.</p>
               <p>How long was that before? - It was about a month.</p>
               <p>Then before the time that this accident happened, from all that you saw of her you took her not to be in her right mind? - I am sure she was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, Prisoner's Counsel. I believe she complained once that you had been pelting her? - The deceased told me so, she was up in her room when she said that, and the deceased with her, and I below stairs, doing my work, and she said to the deceased, there is Nanny now a pelting of me.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Ham was her sister? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did they live in harmony? - They lived very happy ever since I have been there.</p>
               <p>I believe you was going away, you was so frightened? - I gave my mistress, Mrs. Hawkins, warning a fortnight before this accident happened, and she asked me why; I said, Madam, I beg your pardon, I hope no offence, but you know Mrs. Hughes, and I am afraid she should break out; I have seen her pick the skin off of her lips till the blood has run down over her chin.</p>
               <p>You had no other objection to your place? - No, Sir, no other; I was used very well, I have been there almost four years.</p>

               <p>How near do you live to the house where the deceased lived? - About twenty-five yards.</p>
               <p>Tell us what you know about the deceased's death? - I know very little about it; I was sitting at the door, at No 11. in Pater-noster-row, on half a hundred of potatoes; I was looking over towards Mrs. Ham's door, and I saw the sister hanging some meat out, I think her name was Hawkins, as she was hanging the meat out I heard something fall, I judged within myself it might be a sheep or lamb, Mrs. Hawkins cried out and knocked against the door with a knocker, and I thought it was remarkably odd; I crossed the street, and went in behind, and I said Mrs. Hawkins what is the matter; indeed Sir, says she, I do not know, but I am afraid there is a good deal the matter; says I, pray who is in the house, you have no thieves I hope; she tried to open the door of the back room, and she could not, she looked between the wainscot, and I looked over the glass, and I saw nothing but a little child sitting, and Mrs. Hawkins dropped down on her knees, the bottom pannell of the door was split from top to bottom, and I whipped my foot against the pannell and opened the door the value of an inch and a half, and I saw the breast of a woman covered with blood, with a black petticoat on; then I said to the man that lives at next door, for God's sake, Mr. Morgan, break the door open, I had not power, I was so frightened, then I came out of the shop; when the door was broke open I did not see into the back room, I only saw her lay, and I shoved her clothes to get into the room, I came away immediately, I did not see the wound.</p>
               <p>Was you often in the family? - I used frequently to be backwards and forwards, and joking with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190119"/>Did you ever see any thing particular in the prisoner? - The prisoner has always had a remarkable wild look.</p>
               <p>Do you mean that she had such a kind of look as caused a doubt in your mind that she was not right in her mind? - I really thought she was not right in her mind.</p>
               <p>Jury. Have you ever heard any of the neighbours say that there was any thing the matter with her? - I have heard the servant maid should say that her mistress had been very wild at different times before this thing happened, I believe a week.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Had you seen much of her the last two months before the accident? - I cannot say I had, but I saw her the Monday before, going into a green stall, with the same wildness, much in the same form as I have always observed.</p>
               <p>Who told you that the maid was going to leave her place on account of it? - I heard of it, but do not know who told me; I was informed that she was gone away.</p>
               <p>You know so little of the family that you did not know whether the girl was gone or not? - No, I did not mind the girl.</p>

               <p>I live next door; on Saturday the third of June, about nine, I was standing at the shop door, and I heard the sister cry out, and I went in to know what was the matter; hearing her in such distress of mind, I said, good God.! Mrs. Hawkins, what is the matter? she cried out, Betsey! Betsey! I looked through the window that looked into the room behind the shop, and I saw a little child sitting; I said there is nothing the matter with the child; I thought she meant the child Betsey; she was trying to get the door open; I went to the door and forced it open, and there I saw the body of Mrs. Ham dead; her throat was cut; Mrs. Hawkins desired I would send for a surgeon; I said I thought a surgeon would be of no service, for she was was quite dead; then she sent me for Mr. Hawkins; when I came back there was a great bustle about the place, and they got the body up stairs; but how she came by her death I know not; then after some time there was a rumour spread about, that there was a woman got out of the one pair of stairs window backwards, and was gone into an adjoining back place; and I and another neighbour got over out of my yard into this place to look for the person that was got out of the window, and we found in this place the prisoner Hughes.</p>
               <p>In what situation did you find her? - I believe she was sitting; she was in a kind of a shut up place that there is under the stairs in the slaughter-house; we asked her to come out, which she did; I asked her how she came to do such a thing as to kill her sister (supposing she had done it) and she seemed all of a tremble and twitter; she did utter some words; but I cannot be positive what they were, after she was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Have you been pretty much in the family to see much of the prisoner? - I have lived in the neighbourhood but a few months before, but I had often spoke with her.</p>
               <p>Had you made any such observation of the prisoner as might enable you to judge of her state of mind, whether she was sane or not? - Upon my word I can say nothing to that; I was once with Mr. Hawkins, and he said he thought his sister Hughes was in a very bad way; I said I was very sorry for it; but not knowing any thing of it, I did not enquire what way; I thought she might be going in a decline; she had bought things of me; I sell physical herbs; she had bought two or three times a pennyworth of valerian root to make tea, which is reckoned a very good thing for the nerves and lowness of spirits.</p>
               <p>Jury. When you forced open the door and saw the deceased did you see the prisoner? - No, nobody but the deceased and the child.</p>

               <p>I was going round Spital-fields market about nine, on the 3d of June, at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190120"/> end of the street, and I saw several people run over to Mrs. Ham's, and I run, and went into the room where the deceased lay, and her sister Mrs. Hawkins was holding her up on the floor with her back towards her lap, and I said good God! Sally how came this done? did she do it herself? Mrs. Hughes was with her, and I said, do your think she did it herself? and she said no, it is Mrs. Hughes has done it, and nobody else, and God send she had not left them together; Mrs. Hawkins kept crying out for the doctor; I took hold of the chin of the deceased, and held up her head, to look at the wound, and I saw it was desperate, and I said, a doctor will be of no use to her, the body is dead, all the doctors in the land can be of no service; then Mrs. Hawkins said, call Mrs. Hughes down, I went up one pair of stairs, and that was fast, and the two pair was fast, I went into the garret, and looked every where, and out of the garret window, I came down stairs again, and told Mrs. Hawkins, and she desired me to go up stairs again; I did so, and burst open the door of the one pair of stairs; when I came into that room, I looked all round it, and into a little bedroom; I could find nobody; I went up two pair of stairs, and broke that door open, and in the garret I could find nobody; I came down and assisted to lift the dead body up; in moving her we saw the knife lay by her side, and I said, good God! Sally, did she do this thing herself? here is the knife; and she said, good God! so it is: then Mr. Try and Mr. Little came in and the doctor, and he said he could do her no good; then I went out of doors, and there was an alarm given of a woman going out of a one pair of stairs back window, over the tiles, after I had told them of it I came out of doors again, and me and another went into the slaughter-house, through Mr. Morgan's; he was looking over the wall into the back yard, and I jumped over the wall, and Mr. Morgan followed me; I saw a stick in the yard, I took it in my hand, and went round the slaughter-house and found the door on the double lock; it was a spring lock; I said, she is not gone out this way; I went to another little door underneath the stairs, and pulled it open and there I saw her fit under the stairs; and I said, good God, how could you do this wicked deed? the answer she made me was, she did not know, the devil had been very busy with her, and they had had a great many words; I looked at her to see if she had any thing in her hand to do me a mischief, being a dark place; I took hold of her by the hand and said, you must come along with me; Mr. Morgan was behind; she came out immediately; I asked her several questions, but to say what she answered me particularly I cannot; I said, God forgive you to take the life of your flesh and blood; only look at your hands and mine bloody with your sister's blood! whether she said, God forgive me! or what I cannot particularly say; people kept crowding in, and after that Mr. Reeves and I took her to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Was you acquainted much with the prisoner before? - No, I was not particularly.</p>
               <p>Had you any sufficient opportunities of making observations of her? - I never heard any thing particular about her before, neither of the neighbours, or of the maid servants; I never asked.</p>

               <p>What do mean by a bad state, do you mean as to her health or to her mind? - She was quite out of her mind.</p>
               <p>Had she given any instances of insanity either in words or in actions? - Very much.</p>

             that conclusion? - I was going up stairs into my own room about a month before; I heard her groan very much, and beg of the Lord to send peace to her soul; I went into my own room, and I came down stairs into the deceased's room from the prisoner's room, I heard something fall with a great force; I returned back hearing the fall; at my return into the room I found it was the bellows that fell down; I went to Mrs. Hughes and she immediately fell down on her knees; she foamed at the mouth and fell all along; after that I raised her up and put her in a chair; she beat her head against the mantle piece, and tore her hair, and begged of God to send peace to her soul; she afterwards beat herself, and pulled her handkerchief off her neck several times; I put her handkerchief on her neck, she said, she would jump out of the window; she got up on a sudden and took a candle out of a closet, and lighted the candle by a remarkable good fire; I asked her what she was going to do; she said, she was going to light the fire, I told her there was a very good one; she stared and looked very wild and put her hand all over the fire; she stared and I went to put the candle out, and as I put the candle out some of the hot tallow fell on the prisoner's fingers, and she asked me if I wanted to kill her; I said, no.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole from that time to this do you think that she was out of her mind? - Very much so.</p>
               <p>Down to the very time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, you have heard this evidence, what do you think of it.</p>
               <p>Jury. The woman is insane, there is no doubt of it.</p>

               <p>Did the deceased return the d - n to the prisoner? - No, Sir, he did not; the prisoner said, d - n your blood I will pull your wheel off; so do, says the deceased; then the prisoner came on the inside of our dray, on the left hand; the prisoner brought his horses from behind the dray to the left till he got past the dray; he turned his horses head towards the middle of the road; he said nothing but run over the deceased's head.</p>
               <p>How did it happen? - Mr. Carpenter fell down, the wheel cut his shoe and broke his buckle, and threw him down; he fell down to the left and the wheel went over his head; I was on the off side of our dray and the prisoner was on the near side of his horses; he had three horses; I am a carter; I have been so above thirty years; I know the road well.</p>
               <p>In one cart passing another that is before it, which is the usual and proper side to pass on? - When we are following a carriage, and there is a stoppage, our place is to turn to the right hand.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Leaving the carriage you pass on the left hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This man passed to the left instead of the right? - Yes.</p>

               <p>When he had got past the cart he was then close to the left hand side of the road? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then was it not necessary for him to turn his horses to the right, to get into a proper part of the road again? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Do you think he saw where Carpenter was at the time he turned his horses to the right, from your judgment where you stood? - I do not know he did, nor I cannot say he did not.</p>
               <p>As well as you could observe at the time did it appear to you that he intended to drive against the horses, or his cart against the man? - No, Sir; I do not think so, I think that when he said d - n your blood I will pull your wheel off, I take it he intended to hit the wheel, but not the man; the prisoner did not look back, he went on, I followed him and brought him back; I said to him, do you see what you have done here, says I, you have done wilful murder; and he made me answer, it was an accident.</p>

               <p>Leaving off work on Wednesday, the 3d of May, between seven and eight, I went with a parcel in the Strand, I called in at the Castle public house, and the prosecutor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190126"/> and the prisoner were near the box where I sat, and he shewed me a small piece of paper, making motions as well as he could, and I could not make it out, he seemed very uneasy; some time after they left the house, the prosecutor and the prisoner together; I saw them do nothing, only they were together; in about a quarter of an hour after, as I was going home, a little below Temple-bar, between that and Shoe-lane, I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor, and another man together, the other man and the prisoner had hold of the prosecutor by the arm, and the prosecutor had this portmanteau upon his shoulder, and the other, not this man, seemed to be hauling the prosecutor along, and before they came to Shoe-lane the prisoner took the portmanteau from his shoulder; the other two that was with him seemed to force the prosecutor along, till they came quite to the end of Shoe-lane, and there the prisoner, with the portmanteau, run up Shoe-lane, I ran after him, and overtook him, and took him by the collar, and asked him where he was going; he said what was that to me; I asked him whether it was his property; and he said it was, and I had no business with it; I brought him to Mr. Sharp, and he took him into his house; the portmanteau was delivered into the watch-house, to the constable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. Where was it you first saw the prosecutor? - At the Castle in the Strand.</p>
               <p>Who was in company with him at the time? - Another man and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did the other man seem to be acquainted with the prosecutor? - He seemed to talk his language.</p>
               <p>The prisoner could not talk his language? - Not that I know of, I did not hear him.</p>
               <p>What state were they all in? - I be- believe the young fellow, the prosecutor, seemed rather in liquor.</p>
               <p>What weight was the portmanteau do you think? - I do not know, about twenty pound; for what I know, they all appeared to go out in company together.</p>
               <p>Did not the prisoner, when you came up with him, appear to be a little in liquor? - I did not take notice.</p>
               <p>At that time he had the portmanteau upon his back? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you by when this portmanteau was taken? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was not the portmanteau taken from the prosecutor's back apparently by his consent at the time? - I do not believe it was.</p>
               <p>How far did the prosecutor walk with these two men before the man turned down Shoe-lane? - No time at all, it might be a quarter of a minute when he got the portmanteau.</p>
               <p>How far did this man go down Shoe-lane? - He went to the first turning, and turned that way was which is Crown-court.</p>

               <p>The first I saw was at a public house in the Strand; I was with the last witness, and saw the prisoner, the prosecutor and another man drinking in a box together; I could not tell the conversation; I was in another box along with Grimes, the prosecutor came up to us with a direction, and asked us if we could tell him; it was somewhere by St. Martin's-lane, but we could not make it out, so the young man was laying on the table, the other man came and took him in his arms into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190127"/> box where they were sitting; in a few minutes after the prosecutor took the portmanteau into the tap-room, and sat upon it, and put his hand over his head as if sleepy; and in a few minutes after they went out of the public house; and in about a quarter of an hour after, me and Grimes saw the prosecutor with the portmanteau in the street; we could not hear the conversation; the other man had hold of the prosecutor by the a rms; the prisoner was on the other side; and just before they came to Shoe-lane, the prisoner got the portmanteau; whether he took it from him, or whether he gave it him, I cannot say, I saw no force used; and at the end of Shoe-lane the prisoner hung back, and run as hard as ever he could go up the lane; my partner says this young man is done out of his property; he run after him and brought him back; I came up to him and said, is this your property? yes, says he; I took the property to the owner.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Where was it that the prisoner first had your portmanteau? - In the large street.</p>
               <p>How far in the large street before you first lost sight of the prisoner after he had taken the portmanteau? - As soon as he took the portmanteau from my shoulder, I lost him at once, I saw no more of him; coming back again I saw a parcel of people in the street; I ran up the street, and there I saw another man holding the portmanteau, and he run up and said, that is the man.</p>
               <p>How long had you been in company with the prisoner and his companion? - We were a very short time together; we were in that public house three quarters of an hour.</p>

               <p>Can it be opened from the outside? - Not that door that goes into the house; there is a hasp that it cannot be opened on the outside; we washed in the kitchen next to that where the door was.</p>

               <p>Did you observe whether the door from the kichen was fast when you came down? - It was fast, I cannot recollect when it was open.</p>

               <p>On the Monday morning or the Sunday night was you disturbed? - I never waked on Sunday night till seven the next morning, nor on Saturday night; I heard nothing each night; I very seldom wake of a night; the coachman was up before me; the things were always in the stables with him; yesterday morning I was coming from London to Tottenham, I called at Mr. Armstrong's, and met Mr. Siddons, says he, how do you do, young man? I am glad to see you here again; says he, I wish I had thought on this affair, for on Monday morning after the robbery was committed, I met

             was just at the entrance of our yard, he stood there talking with some of our people, but I cannot tell particularly which; he was a dustman, and had just shot a load of dust; his cart was at the dust hole, a little way from him; the prisoner came over the way from the Coach and Horses, and spoke to

            , and says to him, why don't you come and speak to this man over the way; and Anderson says, it is of no use for me to go, for I have no money to pay him; and then the prisoner went up to him and said, you b - r I will make you go, and struck him at the same time.</p>
               <p>Did he go up to him in a threatening angry manner? - I am not positive; but by the manner it must; he then struck him immediately.</p>
               <p>Where did he strike him? - He struck him on the side of the head.</p>
               <p>What did the deceased do upon that? - He rather drew back from the blow, and rather smiled, but Jenkins followed him up, and gave him a blow with the same hand on the head, and at the same time his foot went crossways of his private parts.</p>
               <p>Do you think he meant to kick him there or did he only mean to trip up his heels, can you describe a little more particularly in what manner he kicked him? - His foot went crossways.</p>
               <p>Do not you think he meant to trip up his heels? - A man meaning to trip up a man's heels could never be so high as that I think.</p>
               <p>What was the consequence of the second blow? - He reeled round and fell backwards into a cart which stood with the tail to the ground.</p>
               <p>Was it his own cart? - No, it was another Cart; and the prisoner went to him and said, you b - r I could fight you with one hard, when he was laying in the cart; and the deceased answered, let me alone, for I am not able to stand against you, you have pretty well done for me already; the prisoner then pulled him out of the cart.</p>
               <p>Had it the appearance of lifting him out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190132"/> the cart or dragging him out? - It had not much the appearance of lifting him up, it was more in the manner of pulling him out; after he pulled him out of the cart he set him on his legs and he fell down afterwards; after that he took him round the arms and drew him across the road, to the Coach and Horses, between twenty and thirty yards; I did not like to interfere in it; there were more present that might have interfered as well as me; he took him into the house.</p>
               <p>Did the man when he fell into the care seem very much hurt? - Yes, he did, he changed countenance, and put his hands across; he seemed to be very much hurt by the kick, I do not think he was much hurt by the blow; he fell from the kick into the cart.</p>
               <p>If he appeared to you at that time to be much hurt, why did not you interfere? - I did not like to interfere in it with such sort of people; they might have done me an i njury as well as another; there were others there might as well have interfered as me.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner say any thing at any time about his having hurt him, or not having hurt him? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Did the deceased strike the prisoner at all? - Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner never said any thing about having hurt or not having hurt the deceased? - I did not hear him say a word.</p>
               <p>You have been examined before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the account you gave then a true one? - Yes, as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner say any thing about Anderson? - Not that I ever heard, I never heard him say that he had hurt him or had not hurt him.</p>
               <p>Did any body join with the prisoner in this? - Yes, one Boulton was in the cart; when he was pulled out, one of them said, I cannot tell which, when he was set on his legs, the b - r was not hurt; that was when he was pulled out of the cart.</p>
               <p>Who was Boulton? - He was another dustman; they were all dustmen together.</p>
               <p>Did the deceased make use of any provoking language? - Not a word, which I was amazed at, as he was a very swearing man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Where was Boulton when I came out of the Coach and Horses? - I did not observe, you came out with a knife and a bone in your hand.</p>
               <p>Jury. When the prisoner came out with a knife in his hand, if he had been maliciously inclined, and had a mind to take away the man's life, he had an opportunity? - He had a knife when he came over; he put it out of his hand, he made no use of it against the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. I fancy you will find that he did not intend to take away the deceased's life; but there will be another question; murder may be committed without absolute and direct intention of taking away a life.</p>

               <p>Did the prisoner make any answer to the deceased when he said he had got no money? - No; he struck him without saying any thing.</p>
               <p>Upon that blow did either of them say any thing? - No; Anderson seemed to make a smile, upon which the prisoner struck him again directly, and as soon as ever struck him, he made a swinging kick at him, and kicked him in the private parts, and he turned round and fell into a cart; it was not a kick straight forwards.</p>
               <p>

               <p>After the second blow and the kick what happened? - When he was in the tail of the cart the prisoner threatened to fight him with one hand, and the deceased said he was not able to stand, for he had done for him already.</p>
               <p>Did the deceased appear to you to fall backwards by the force of the blow and kick? - He reeled round and fell into the cart; then I went away to carry a bushel of cinders, and when I returned I met them drawing him across the road, that might be about three minutes, I did not go above thirty yards, the prisoner had the deceased under the arms, and was drawing him across the road.</p>
               <p>Describe as near as you can in what manner he was drawing him across the road? - He had him under the arms, and was drawing him along, he drew him against the steps.</p>

               <p>Take hold of that man that stands in the Court, and shew me how he dragged him? - He dashed him against the steps. I did not see him thrown down violently, but he let him slip down, he threw him down like upon the steps, he let him go, and down he dropped.</p>
               <p>Not as if he meant to do him a mischief, not like dashing him down? - No.</p>
               <p>After the deceased told him that he was not able to fight him, and that he had pretty well done for him already, did the prisoner offer to strike him after that? - No; he did not.</p>
               <p>Did you see any more? - No, not then; this was on the Thursday; on the Sunday following a woman came and begged of me to go and cut off the deceased's beard; I went, and found him in bed, and on the hind part of his head the hair was all cut off the back part of his head, and there was a very large bruise, as broad as the palm of my hand, and as black as could be; I saw no bruises any where else; he complained much of his head, and appeared light-headed; while I was shaving him, he said, gentlemen, pray do not squeeze me so hard; he said nothing to me about the hurt, nor I did not say any thing to him.</p>
               <p>Jury. You did not observe his head hitting against the stone, when he let him down on the steps? - No, I did not; I saw him on the Monday; I then saw the place again, and in the middle of the place there were three specks, like three drops of tallow.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner come across the road and speak to the deceased, and ask him to come across the way and settle the reckoning that they had, and the deceased said it was of no use to come, for he had no money.</p>
               <p>Then the prisoner had some concern in the reckoning? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it at all explained what that reckoning was? - No, Sir; it was an old reckoning; then the prisoner said no more to him, but up with his fist and hit him on the side of his head, and with that the deceased drew back, and made a smile, and he up with his fist and hit him again, and kicked him at the present time he hit him.</p>
               <p>Describe in what manner he kicked him? - He made a kick at him and kicked him right across here.</p>
               <p>Did he kick straight at him? - No; his foot came askew at him, he kicked above his heels, he kicked at his thigh; it did not seem to me to aim to trip up his heels, he did not kick straight at him, but askew.</p>
               <p>What was the consequence of that blow and kick? - He fell down into the tail of a cart with the vengeance of the blows and kick; then the prisoner Jenkins came up, and run his fist in his face, and called him a b - r, and said he would fight him with one of his hands.</p>
               <p>What did the deceased say to that? - He said he was not able to stand against<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190134"/> him, for he had almost done for him already; then the prisoner took him out of the cart, and set him upon his legs, and he fell down, he could not stand with the violence of the kick; then he took him under the arms, and drew him all across the road, after he had drawn him all across the road, he let him drop on the steps.</p>
               <p>Describe as near as you can the manner in which he let him drop on the steps? - He did not fling him down with any force, he only let him drop with his own weight on the steps, he did not fling him down as I saw.</p>
               <p>Was you all brother workmen together? - I work for another man.</p>
               <p>When he tumbled backwards into the cart, did he fall with violence? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did his head hit against any thing then? - Yes; he fell with great force, and the back part of his head hit against the bottom of the cart.</p>

               <p>I was present when this happened, I saw the prisoner come up to Anderson, but I was not near enough to hear what he said, I saw him strike him.</p>
               <p>How often? - Once.</p>
               <p>What more did you see? - I saw him kick him on his private parts.</p>
               <p>In what manner? - I cannot tell how it was done, I was not so near him as the other witnesses.</p>
               <p>Did you see the deceased at the public-house afterwards? - Yes; he recovered after he came over.</p>
               <p>How long after? - I cannot say how long it was, it was the same day within about three quarters of an hour; there was me and the prisoner, and the deceased, and another man, we were drinking; the prisoner and I was playing for a pot of beer, and I won the pot of beer of him fairly, and the prisoner wanted to cheat me out of it, and it came to a quarrel, the prisoner struck me, and I struck him, and we went out to fight a battle, and a gentleman gave us some silver; after our battle was done, says he to the deceased, I will knock your head off with one hand, and the deceased said you have no occasion to take one hand for I will fight you with both.</p>
               <p>Did they fight? - Had it not been for the landlady of the public-house, and me taking him apart, they would have fought.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner sober at this time? - No, Sir, he was not, far from it.</p>
               <p>Was he sober at the time when he struck the prisoner? - No, Sir, far from it.</p>
               <p>He was considerably in liquor? - Yes; very much so; the deceased and me went out the next day for a load of dust.</p>
               <p>Court to Wilks. Did the prisoner appear drunk or sober when this happened? I do not know how he was, for I cannot tell many times when they are drunk, or when they are sober.</p>

               <p>You are widow of this unfortunate man that was killed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time did he come home in the evening after the accident? - About nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>What situation was he in that evening? - He said, when he came into the room, he was not well, and he sat down on the bed, he did not say any thing to me that night, only he was not well; he got up and went out the next morning, along with me, I work in the same yard.</p>
               <p>How long was you at work? - About three hours; he complained very much in the morning, and was very ill; I persuaded him not to go out.</p>
               <p>Did he say to you at any time how he got the hurt; what hurt did he complain of most? - When he came with the horse and cart into the yard, he supported himself up by the head of the horse, he appeared to be a dead man; the first complaint he made, was, that this man kicked him in his private parts.</p>
               <p>After that, when he grew worse, what did he complain of? - A violent pain in his head, he did not mention any part.</p>
               <p>Did he mention to you how he himself<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190135"/> thought he had got the hurt in his head? - Not till the Sunday following; he desired me to look at the top of his head, which he said was much hurt; I cut the hair off the top of his head, and asked the other witness to shave him, and when the man shaved him, he asked him whether it was not the ill usage he received from the prisoner, and he said yes.</p>
               <p>Did he at any time describe to you in what particular manner he got the bruises at the back of his head? - Upon his death bed he told me that it was by his dragging him across the road, and dashing his head down against the edge of the stones; that was what he said about five hours before he died.</p>
               <p>When did he die? - On Sunday was three weeks.</p>
               <p>That was the Sunday se'night after the accident happened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. HODGES sworn.</p>
               <p>I think I was sent for the 27th, to the Marybone infirmary, I think it was on the Tuesday, but I cannot particularly say.</p>
               <p>In what condition did you find this man? - I found one side of his head particularly very much bruised, his face, and head, and eyes were very much swelled; he had a great deal of fever about him at that time.</p>
               <p>Did you find any other particular bruise that attracted your attention? - Not particularly.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect, particularly, a large wound on the back of the head, near the top? - This was on the side towards the back, that was the principal bruise.</p>
               <p>Had he any delirium? - The nurse told me he appeared at times to be what she called wandering; when I first saw him he answered my questions perfectly sensible; the young gentlemen of the hospital had seen him before, I bled him, and attended him from Tuesday till the Sunday morning; I heard on Monday morning that he died on that night.</p>
               <p>How soon did you apprehend any thing like mortal symptoms coming on? - Why, Sir, from the first time I saw him I apprehended particular danger; in the first place the quickness of his pulse, and the next day I found him with a great degree of delirium, and an increase of fever.</p>
               <p>Did you apprehend a fracture? - I did apprehend that there was a fracture, and I made an opening down to the bone, and found no fracture.</p>
               <p>Was there any suppuration? - Yes; there was a large quantity of matter between the scull and the scalp.</p>
               <p>Was it on the fleshy scalp, or on the membrane that surrounds it? - It was exterior to the pericranium.</p>
               <p>Was the pericranium very much inflamed? - Considerably so.</p>
               <p>Did it terminate in a mortification? - Not absolutely so, but tending as much as could be.</p>
               <p>What did you in your judgement apprehend to be the immediate cause of his death? - I should suppose from the injury he had received from his head whatever it was; from the violence of the blow or bruise whatever they were.</p>
               <p>That was probably the primary cause, but what I mean is this; did you find any thing on the brain? - Yes, I did; I found the membrane that covers the brain very much inflamed.</p>
               <p>Any matter formed within? - No; but the vessels were filled very much with blood.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask the surgeon whether the man had not the venereal disease very bad? - I never heard of any complaint of that; the injury on his head was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I and another man were drinking at the Coach and Horses, and we saw Anderson stand across the way, just by the water trough of the red-lion, says he, go and fetch him over to have some beer; I went and laid hold of his arm, says I, Billy come and have some beer, says he, I have no money, says I, never mind that, if I ask you to drink I do not ask you to pay, and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190136"/> took hold of him, and drew him along; then he hit me a knock on the head, then I hit him another, then he up with his foot, and gave me a kick over the shin.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Consider in making your defence that there were a number of people present, and unless you can call witnesses to prove your defence, you will not do your case any good.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. So far as hurt the man I did not mean to hurt him any more than my own brother; I was in liquor, I had been drinking all day.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any witnesses here that saw the affair? - Only the gentlewoman of the house.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep the Coach and Horses at Paddington; I did not see this affair happen out of doors, I only saw it after they came in; there was a fight, a quarrel arose, that was the first that I saw between a stranger and the prisoner; they fought; after they came in, the deceased and the prisoner would have fought; I would not let them.</p>
               <p>Was the deceased as willing to fight as the prisoner? - He was; I laid hold of his jacket to keep him from the other; he went away some time, and came again and drank out of the same pot, and he sat down and drank for some time; he called me out of the bar, and gave me a shilling; I took the pot of beer out of it, and I had a remarkable small six-pence, and he said that would do very well, and he said Nancy had been out all day a drinking, and had been drinking part of the week; the prisoner had been at our house about an hour; he was very much in liquor; the deceased had not been at our house for some time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The second day I went to see how the man was? he did not want any thing; I asked him to drink a glass of wine or any thing; a woman that lived in the house came up, and said his wife had been out all day, and had brought him bite or sup.</p>
               <p>Is that woman here? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Godly. How long have you known the prisoner? - Four months; he is as quiet as any that comes to the house; I never saw any other; I never heard that he was malicious.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. A day or two after I said to Boulton, if the poor fellow is so bad, I will put in a shilling on Saturday-night, and you put in what you like, and we will make a gathering for him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three other witnesses, who said he was a quiet peaceable man, not malicious nor revengeful.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, it seems to be necessary for me shortly to state to you the general outlines of the law on this subject: the killing of a man is always criminal, unless it is altogether involuntary or is in self-defence against a person who is doing an unlawful act: it is criminal in a vast variety of different degrees; the killing of another which amounts to felony, may be either felony or man-slaughter; a killing which is the result of deliberate malice, or what the law calls malice prepense, is in all cases murder; a killing short of that not justifiable, which is either done on a sudden provocation, or where there has been no provocation; where it is done in a manner that does not argue malice, is an offence of a lesser degree, under the denomination of manslaughter; however, by malice prepense the law does not necessarily imply a direct and deliberate intention to kill, for whereever that exists the case is put out of all doubt, and there is no difficulty in the consideration of it; but there are degrees of malice far short of that, which if death ensues, amount in the eye of the law to murder, as where a man kills another in the prosecution of an unlawful and felonious act; there, though he did not actually intend to kill the person he has killed, yet the felonious intention with which the act was accompanied supplies that malice which the law requires, and every killing with a felonious intention is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190137"/> in the eye of the law murder; again, where a man either without provocation, or on a very slight provocation makes use of a weapon or an instrument which is likely to occasion the death of the person to whom it is used, to effect a purpose which was short of death; if it is done without provocation, or on a slight procation, and death ensues, it is murder: there is another violence that is murder, which is, where a person in consequence of a previous resentment which has a degree of malice in it, attacks another with the intention of doing him some personal injury short of death; that being in the prosecution of a deliberate intention to do him a personal injury, if death ensues, the party is answerable for it, and guilty of murder in strictness of law; because he was prosecuting unlawfully and maliciously a deliberate intention to do the person some mischief; and where a man on a slight provocation, or on the sudden without provocation, gets into a quarrel with another, and prosecutes it with such a degree of cruelty and violence as is likely to produce fatal consequences, in that case, though the first beginning of it is not so criminal, if it is prosecuted with that degree of cruelty and violence, and death ensues, it has been justly accounted murder; the case that you are now to try will come within one or other of the two last descriptions that I have stated to you; (Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence, and added) it is perfectly clear from the evidence, that this prisoner did not intend to kill the deceased; and the questions for your consideration are first, whether you think that at the time he came over to the deceased, he came over with a preconceived and deliberate purpose of doing him a bodily mischief short of death; for if you are of opinion that he came deliberately and coolly over to beat this man without sufficient cause, death ensuing that will make it, in my opinion, murder; or if you are of opinion that he did not come over with such intention, but are of opinion, that he dashed his head against the steps with intention of doing him a further mischief, I am of opinion, (if it arose from cool and deliberate malice on the part of the prisoner, though void of intention of prosecuting that malice to death) it will be murder; if you think there was no cool and deliberate malice of any kind from the prisoner to the deceased, but what happened was on the sudden, taken up in the moment, without using a deadly weapon, and without intention of of killing, then it is not murder.</p>

               <p>I found the things coming home on the stairs, the apron tumbled out, and I put it in my pocket to go down to shew it to Mrs. Balls; my husband was not at home, and she was busy in the shop; my husband did not come home till ten; on the next day my husband and I went out, and on our returning back we found our door had been broke open; I said, I knew nothing of any thing of Mrs. Ball's, but I owned to the property: the stairs being a thoroughfare, I did not know but somebody might have dropped them; for there were people passing.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What was the value of those things that were found? - I value those that were in our presence at two guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Ball. How came you to know the bundle was in the bed? - I went to the bed to search for my sheet and blankets.</p>
               <p>Had you been in the room before? - Yes, I had; it was by order of Justice Abbington; he said, in case it was my own furniture, I had a right to go in and examine whether my blankets and sheets were there.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman in Parliament street, this gentleman came to me about half past ten, and said, he had been robbed the night before of his watch, and the person was gone through Privy-gardens, I refused to go, because it was out of my bounds, and in another parish.</p>
               <p>Court. Why so? - I said, bring the person to me; I have been checked for it.</p>
               <p>By who? - By the church wardens.</p>
               <p>Court. Then I am sure the church wardens ought to be checked by the Court of King's Bench.</p>
               <p>Watchman. The prosecutor told me the person that robbed him was in Privy-gardens, and run into a sentry box; the woman was brought to me, and I took her to the watch-house, I searched her but not minutely, as the robbery was done the night before; she denied robbing him; she owned he had been with her the night before, and had given her a couple of shillings and a pint of wine.</p>

               <p>Did you ever hear her say any thing about the watch? - No, she denied it; when we came up to Privy-gardens I heard the woman say here is the man, I must run; and accordingly she run into a sentry box.</p>
               <p>Who did she say so to? - To some other women that were there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scott. What time of the evening was it when you went with your friend? - Between ten and eleven.</p>
               <p>Was it dark? - It was.</p>
               <p>There were several other women besides this woman? - Yes, and they all fell upon me.</p>

               <p>Mr. Attorney General opened the case as follows.</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, this is an indictment against the prisoner at the bar, founded on an act of Parliament made in the 10th of the late King, by which it is made a capital felony for any persons to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190146"/> the number of three or more, armed with fire-arms or other offensive weapons, to seize and carry away uncustomed goods; there is likewise another clause that makes it the same offence to be assembled in order to assist in carrying such goods away; and the only question I shall have to lay before you is, whether you are satisfied that the prisoner is one of the persons that was so assembled: It may be proper, though certainly it is not necessary that I should state to you the policy and intent with which this act was made and continued; it was made at a time when (as I am afraid the case is at present) the revenue of this country could not be collected without danger to the officers, which made it almost impossible to collect such revenue; and the smugglers at that time (as I am sorry to say they have continued to this) not contented to carry on their trade with the evasion of the law, did then and still do endeavour to effect that evasion with violence, which the prudence and circumspection of the officers make it impossible to effect any other way. Gentlemen, the evidence will not leave any room to doubt of the prisoner's guilt: It seems that on the 21st of April was a twelvemonth, (and the reason of this prosecution not having been commenced sooner arises from the absconding of the prisoner) this prisoner, together with several other persons, much more than the number of three, and whose names will be mentioned to you by the waterman who ferryed them over to the Plymouth side of the river, between twelve and one in the night came over to Plymouth side, from a place I think called Corsham, each of them with bludgeons in their hands, which will be described, and concerning which there will be no doubt at all of their being offensive weapons, for some of them had irons on their ends, but all of them loops at their ends, by which a man could hold them in his hand in order the more effectually to strike, the end of them being extremely heavy. Gentlemen, the officers on their duty that night were in expectation of their coming, and they were watching for them; about one o'clock they saw twelve or fourteen of the smugglers coming in a boat belonging to one

            , a waterman; each of them had tubs flung with cords in his hand, which they call an anchor; they proceeded to Plymouth dock, except the waterman, who had no hand in the business but that of bringing them over, they had each of them a bludgeon; the officers let them go a little way, and then immediately appeared and endeavoured to rescue these casks, and accordingly they did get four of these casks into their custody, upon this the smugglers rallied, and they attacked the officers, and from their number, which was much greater than that of the officers, they very soon overcame them; they knocked down old Kingsforth, and beat him in so horrid a manner, as really I could hardly have believed that men in their desperate situation could have been guilty of; they first of all broke his leg, when they had done that one only of the officers remained to carry him away, the others were so terrified; he carried him to the public house, and laid him down at the door, and then they fell upon him again, and beat him till he was rendered such a spectacle as hardly ever was seen; and I am informed at this moment he is totally incapacitated from doing and business, and his life for some time was despaired of Gentlemen, in this scuffle the other man Taylor had his leg broke, and the other escaped. The only question that you will have to try is, whether this man was one of the number: in order to prove that, I shall call in all these officers, or many of them, who will give you a general account of the manner in which these men came over; old Kingsforth and another cannot speak to the identity of this man, but there are two other witnesses that speak positively to him;

             the waterman will prove to you, that this man was one of those that came over that night, that he was one of those that had the casks after they were rescued from the smugglers, and that he afterwards came over on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190147"/> What were they beating Kingsforth with? - With sticks.</p>
               <p>What sort of sticks? - Very large sticks, bludgeons we call them.</p>
               <p>What was his stick? - A bludgeon; they call them bats in their place; they are generally used by those people that carry these liquors.</p>
               <p>You say you are sure you met Gray; which way was he going, towards the smugglers or from them? - They had beat me off the cags; and I met him going to join them; I did not see him strike with his bludgeon.</p>
               <p>Was he using it as a walking stick when you met him? - No, not walking with it, he was swinging it in his hand; I did not see him do any thing with it; he joined the other party.</p>
               <p>What were they doing when he joined them? - They were beating Kingsforth; I saw Gray and Andrews about five the next morning going over the water together.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner doing any thing when Kingsforth called out his leg was broken? - No, it was before he called out that his leg was broke that I saw him; they were so thick that I could not possibly see every one that struck him.</p>
               <p>What dress was this man in? - A short jacket; I saw him in the morning going over the water with Andrews.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner say any thing? - Andrews abused me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoners Counsel. Did they not say it was a common ferry boat? what did you do when Kingsforth called out that he had broke his leg? - We went back to help him to a public house, the smugglers took their cags and carried them away to Mutton Coe; they carried them off, and then they returned again afterwards, and came out, and said they would murder some of us.</p>
               <p>Where was that? - Up at the corner of Hutchins's house, the bottom of Liberty-street.</p>
               <p>Did you see Gray at that time? - I cannot say that I did.</p>
               <p>You say that he had a jacket on? - Yes, a short jacket.</p>
               <p>What might be the colour of it? - It might be a little greyish, by the looks of it, I cannot be particular; I only looked in his face and passed by him.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen this Gray before? - Yes, Sir, many times before; I knew him very well by his face.</p>
               <p>Can you tell what this cask was that was taken? - I do not know, I did not taste it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. In what situation did you first see the prisoner at the bar, what was going forward then; did you see him come from the boat? - No, Sir; the first that I saw was when he went to join the people; he seemed to come from the street.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was it light then? - It was not quite dark, it was moon light.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You rather choose a dark night in order to detect these people; you could see very plainly all that was going forward? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you did not see this man do any thing at all, neither carry a cag, nor do any thing to annoy any body? - No; I do not know whether the prisoner might or might not have a cag.</p>
               <p>But when you saw him he had none? - No.</p>
               <p>The others at that time had? - He had a knotty stick in his hand, they call them all bludgeons, there are all sorts of them, some knotty and some smooth.</p>
               <p>You say that they had some of these bludgeons as long as two feet and a half? - Yes; they are not fit for walking sticks.</p>
               <p>You have known this man a long time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was a common porter about Plymouth-dock? - I did not know him at that time.</p>

               <p>When you went to assist Kingsforth, he said his leg was broke; did the prisoner stay to assist you? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see Gray after that time that Kingsforth's leg was broke? - No: I did not till the next morning about five.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wilson. Was the prisoner's stick smaller than the rest? - No, I do not know it was; some might be a little smaller; the cags were by them when I saw them beating Kingsforth.</p>

            , the prisoner, is the person I mean.</p>
               <p>What did they bring with them? - They brought cags, and put them into the boat, they all brought cags, but one had no cags.</p>
               <p>Which was that man? - I really cannot tell.</p>
               <p>When they got on board your vessel with the cags where did you go? - We went to Mutton Coe, near Plymouth-dock; when we came there we took the cags out of the boat, and carried them on our shoulders; they had a stick a piece.</p>
               <p>What kind of stick? - A stick about three feet in length, to the best that I can tell; some call them bats, and some call them bludgeons.</p>
               <p>Are they walking sticks? - No; they are not for walking, they are too large, they are to protect themselves; as much as I can learn, if any body comes to molest them, with these things they defend themselves.</p>
               <p>How do they carry these sticks, you say they are pretty thick? - Carry them! Sir; in their hands.</p>
               <p>What became of these men when they got on shore? - They put the cags on their backs, and were proceeding to the dock.</p>
               <p>What happened? - Kingdom said to me, you may as well go with us, and I did.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner one of them? - He was.</p>
               <p>When they went up had they a cag? - Yes, they had.</p>
               <p>Had he one of the bats as you call them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In your way to Plymouth-dock what happened? - In the space of a few minutes the Custom-house officers came running after us, and I immediately stopped, and the Custom-house officers looked after me to see if they knew me, and I saw the officers come up to the smugglers; to these men I have been naming.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner one of them at the time they came up? - He was in the party when they came up; then I saw a great bustle among them, and some went up Liberty-street, and some went up James-street, and some round a single house which stood by itself.</p>
               <p>What did they do? - Some of the officers, Mr. Kingsforth in particular, went round there; I did not go round after them, but they began beating him, and he cried out very much.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190149"/>What did they do to him? - They beat him very much; I cannot say whether they broke his leg at that time, because I was not round the house to see; after that they took their cags, and away they went round Mutton Coe; after that I saw two come up round this house, where Mr. Kingsforth was beat; I went up James-street, there were two men, I imagined they were two of the smugglers; they came round, then they came down James-street a second time.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner one of the men? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. There must be three persons besides the man? - There were eight or nine of them came directly after them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Your Lordship knows two former witnesses have said that there were but two; the Attorney General, with his usual candour and good sense said he had no evidence of the second beating.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What the eight came down? - The two were down before the eight; I imagine they were joined, I was not a very great way from them.</p>
               <p>What were the words mentioned? - Just as Mr. Taylor was a little way from Mr. Kingsforth, says they we will murder some of you yet; says Kingsforth my leg is broke.</p>
               <p>Jury. Who said so? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. They went away, and fairly left the place.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You do not know whether the prisoner composed one of that company? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. You cannot go into it because they fairly left the place, and returned again; did you see the prisoner any more that night? - No; I saw him the next morning about five; I came down to look for my boat, and it was taken away, and one of our watermen was there, his name is

               <p>Did he go out without one? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Was not Gray that man that came in without a cag? - He certainly must come in without a cag, because they were put into the boat before he came in; the cags are put upon the beach before they are put into the boat; I cannot say Gray came without; I cannot say which it was.</p>
               <p>When you came out of the boat one of these men said to you, Tom, you may as well come up along with us? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you any other passengers in the boat except these that you have named? - Not that I recollect, not that I remember.</p>
               <p>Cannot you get no further than that now? - No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>So you walked up innocently enough, you carried no cag and did no harm in walking up? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Now when you came up, you saw the Custom-house officer running after you? - I stopped, and he looked at me to see whether he knew me, and then soon after this affray began.</p>

               <p>Then you saw no more of him till he and Andrews came down to the ferry next morning, that was about five, Andrews was drunk? - He was rather in liquor.</p>
               <p>He was a merry Andrew for that day in short, when Andrews was abusing the man, the prisoner said, you fool, you had better be quiet? - He did not say you fool, he said, you had better be quiet; I saw no more of the prisoner from that time till he went to Guernsey.</p>
               <p>How came it that you who was walking so innocently should find it necessary to stay a whole month at Guernsey? - Because they said I should be taken up; because they could not pitch upon any body else as an evidence; if they pitched upon me I must be an evidence.</p>
               <p>Either you must prove as an evidence or be hanged yourself? - Yes, or else leave my country; I had a letter from my wife, and she said, I was as safe at home as at Guernsey.</p>

               <p>When was it you went to any body concerned for the crown? - I went to nobody, I was subpoened; I was not asked any thing about it before I was subpoened; I never told any body my story before I was subpoened, to the best of my remembrance; I think not.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mrs. Davey? - Yes.</p>

               <p>But from the time that you stopped when the revenue officers came, you never saw this man at all after that night? - I did not; I cannot tell how many went up James street; the officers pursued after those that turned round the corner, round the single house; some of them went up James-street immediately.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. At the distance you stood could you distinguish whether Gray was one of them that was beating Kingsforth, upon your oath, if Gray had been beating him should not you have known him? - If I had seen him; I was not near enough to know whether Gray beat him.</p>

               <p>(Examined by Mr. Solicitor General.)</p>
               <p>I was with my father April was a twelvemonth, at Mutton Coe.</p>
               <p>What passed there? - The first thing that happened we saw the boat about half after one going over for some liquor; we expected it about two to come back with the liquor; and as we were laying wait for the liquor, as we suspected, they came with the cags on their backs; and we pursued after them, and took some cags away from them.</p>
               <p>Do you know what these cags contained? - One contained Geneva.</p>
               <p>Foreign or home? - Foreign.</p>
               <p>What number of persons might they be that you were pursuing? - I suspect them to be fourteen or fifteen; I cannot say justly.</p>
               <p>What passed when you came up with them? - I was not the first that came up with them.</p>
               <p>What did you see when you did come up with them? - I saw three cags that were saved, and the officers and I pursued after more; and my father cried out his leg was broke, and he cried for me to come to him; but two of our party went to my father's assistance before I could come; I had one cag of Geneva in my hand.</p>
               <p>What became of those cags that were so seized? - They were rescued from us all but this.</p>
               <p>What became of that one? - They took it away by force afterwards.</p>
               <p>Had these people any thing in their hands but those cags? - They had bludgeons in their hands.</p>
               <p>Be so good as to describe them? - Between two and three feet, unlawful weapons which they carry instead of fire arms.</p>
               <p>Were you present before your father cried out his leg was broke? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>What passed between your party and the smugglers? - I cannot say; I went round the house; and my father cried out; I did not see what passed.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190152"/>Did you yourself taste the contents of the cask that you speak of? - I staved the cask and the liquor flew all about; I tasted it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You came up before your father had been beat, before his leg was broke? - I was up before his leg was broke.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoner and tell me whether you saw him at all? - I know him, but I did not know him to be one.</p>
               <p>Did you see that man there at all? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - I cannot say that I did.</p>
               <p>You have seen him before to day? - Yes, Sir, and I know him to be a smuggler.</p>

               <p>Mr. Attorney General. It is not evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It comes out of the man's pocket, and I am telling my Lord what it is; to be sure it cannot be read without the Attorney General was to consent.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. I must complain a little, and I do complain of attempts being made that ought not to be made; the idea of desiring the Attorney General to consent: the Attorney General could not consent, and the Judge would tell the Attorney General he ought not to consent.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I told the Judge what it was, and I shall do so in prosecutions for five hundred years, should I continue in practice so long, risquing all the indignations of all the Attorney Generals in the world; it was the fault of the prisoner that he took it out of his pocket, not mine.</p>
               <p>Mrs. DAVY sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep the public house, called the Rising Sun, in James-street, Plymouth-dock; I did in April, 1785.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the morning of the affray between the revenue officer Mr. Kingsforth and some smugglers? - I do; and Mr. Kingsforth was hurt.</p>
               <p>Do you remember seeing the prisoner that morning? - I do.</p>
               <p>What time did he come to your house? - As nigh as I can guess, about one in the morning.</p>
               <p>At that time when he came into your house, was there any noise or any disturbance or affray in the street? - No, Sir, not till a great while after he came in; I got up to let him in; he had been in bed a quarter of an hour before I heard the noise, then I heard the outcry of the officer.</p>
               <p>Did he go out upon that occasion to join in the affray? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure of that? - I am quite sure of it.</p>
               <p>How long did it continue afterwards? - A great while afterwards; he sat down till day break, till my husband got up; he sat in the tap room all the while; then my husband opened the door just at gun-fire, and then the prisoner went away; he went strait down to Mr. Hutchins's, the Fortune of War, the ferry place; he must necessarily go past that house; he had a blue jacket and a round hat; I am sure he came in before the affray was, a quarter of an hour before it began.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. Who came with him? - Another person, I do not know his name; that was the same man that went away with him in the morning.</p>
               <p>How came they to come to your house? - They knocked at the door; I went to the window, they said they wanted my husband; I went down to let them in; they did not tell me where they had been, nor what they came for; whether that man went over the water with him I cannot say; he went out with him; there was no disturbance at the Fortune of War that night before; they had been in some time; it was a quarter of an hour after that I heard a noise.</p>
               <p>What was the cry you heard? - I heard a great cry, and I heard murder cried.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How happened your husband did not get up to let him in? - He was very much in liquor; I have known him three or four years, he is a very quiet harmless man.</p>

               <p>What said Moses? - Says she you may sell Mr. Fonseca from me, tell him to give me the ten guineas; says I, ten guineas is a great deal of money, I said, I think if you have two or three it will be enough; they were to have the ten guineas not to appear against Mrs. Cole or Fonseca; I told them I would bring them an answer in the morning; I told Mrs. Fonseca; says she I durst not do a thing without my husband's consent, I may as well give ten of my teeth.</p>

               <p>The case opened by Mr. Attorney General.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I am extremely sorry that I am obliged, by the duty of my office, to bring two indictments in the same sessions, but so it happens; and this is an indictment founded on an act made in the last sessions of parliament. It was thought necessary to enact, That if persons shall endeavour to resist revenue officers with a degree of force which especially denotes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190160"/> the intention under which they act, that although such resistance may not occasion murder, yet it shall be a capital offence: Under these circumstances I think I need not take up your time to shew either the wisdom or the necessity of this regulation; I shall leave it to your own breasts and considerations: it will be sufficient for me to state the law; - it will be for you to decide whether the prisoner falls within that law or not; - I shall then have discharged my duty, and I doubt not but you will discharge yours. Gentlemen, two years ago it was necessary to pass the following law, 24th

            , who was the commander of a revenue vessel; another charge is, for having committed it within four leagues of the shore: There are other counts charging the prisoner with aiding and assisting others to shoot: I need not state the law on this subject, every person who is present at the action, although he himself is not an individual actor, yet if the mind goes along with them, and they are assembled on a felonious purpose, and a felony is committed, he being present countenancing the transaction is guilty, as if he was actually the person that fired. Now the evidence is this, on the 4th of April last, the Hawk and the Lynx, two revenue vessels, were stationed at the port of Falmouth, and about six in the morning they saw the Happy-go-lucky riding at anchor about two miles from the shore, and from Penzance; as soon as ever she discovered them, she immediately hoisted her gib fail, and stood towards the Land's end; and the Hawk and the Lynx having their colours hoisted, though that is not required in this count of the indictment, but I should think fairly myself, that unless the vessels had that about them, it would be too much to say that they were within this act; however, these two vessels had their colours hoisted, but more than that they were perfectly known to the smugglers, as well as you Gentlemen are to each other; upon their endeavouring to escape, the two revenue vessels crouded fail and gave chace, they immediately prepared for an engagement, as has been too usual, like two enemies; accordingly between seven and eight they got within hail of the smugglers, and then Williams, who commanded the Hawk, hailed them twice, and ordered them to bring to, or that he would fire upon them; upon which refusing, and no answer, two muskets were fired, no answer was returned but this, a general volley of fire-arms from the smugglers, and afterwards a broadside, and immediately after a skirmish ensued, which ended in the loss of the lives of some of the smugglers; I do not find any of the king's officers were killed; they fought the Hawk for three quarters of an hour, and the Lynx ran in between them, and having a broadside from the Lynx which I believe killed their captain, they wore off; this ship had on board swivels, blunderbusses, half pikes, muskets, and in short was a ship completely armed for the purpose of resistance; the commander of this ship, and the mate, had both fallen in the action; there were no less than thirty-five of the crew, of which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190161"/> the prisoner was one; they were all committed to the castle, from which all of them but one, who is an evidence, made their escape, either by neglect or roguery of the soldiers, in a night of two after their imprisonment, and it was not till lately we could apprehend the present prisoner; whether they are gone to Guernsey, I cannot say, and perha ps we shall not be able to take them without the laws are better enforced, for which party is the strongest is at present a doubt. I shall call to you one Cotton who will tell you that the prisoner, and he, and thirty-three others, were a crew of smugglers; that they left Guernsey on the 31st of March, and effected the landing of some brandy on the first of April; and in short, that an action began in which every one of the crew took a decisive part. Gentlemen, this man will appear in the light of what the law perhaps may consider an accomplice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. My Lord, as Mr. Attorney General states that this man may appear to be an accomplice, and as it is at present uncertain whether it will be permitted Mr. Attorney to call him or not, (for it will depend on the circumstances that shall be proved anterior to his evidence) I hold it improper for him now to state what that evidence will be to the jury.</p>
               <p>Court. The counsel for the crown have certainly a right to open the case.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. To open every part of their case saving that which may be subject to doubt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. Your lordship will give me credit, that I should not have brought a case upon the credit of an accomplice only.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You are a man whom I extremely respect, but it is my duty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney. I say this man would stand in such a predicament that his evidence ought not to convict any man, but, Gentlemen, I shall call to you witnesses who were on board the revenue vessels, who will tell you the manner in which the smugglers fought, and the manner in which every one was engaged on the ship's striking. Gentlemen, although some Judges have been of opinion that it is the best way not to begin with the accomplice, I believe none have yet determined that you cannot begin with him, and many very learned Judges have permitted such a person first to be examined, leaving it to the good sense of the Jury not to give him any credit unless he is confirmed; therefore it is totally immaterial to me with whom I shall begin; I am to prove this battle, and this firing, the prisoner's being present and assisting; which if I do I shall have discharged my duty to the public, and then I am perfectly easy what the event may be: I shall leave the prisoner in the hands of you and my Lord; you are the Jury who are upon your oaths; and I shall be more happy if it be possible that this prisoner shall prove himself to be innocent, than if he shall appear to be guilty, as I fear he will.</p>

               <p>I was mate of the Hawk in April last; I was on board the 4th of April last, about five being off the Lizard, in company with the Lynx; we saw the Happy-go-lucky, lugger, laying under Mullion Island.</p>
               <p>How far is that from the shore? - About half a mile.</p>
               <p>At what distance was the Happy-go-lucky from the shore? - About a mile and an half, or two miles.</p>
               <p>Do you think she was three miles? - No.</p>
               <p>You saw her in this position? - Yes, she was laying at an anchor; we then hoisted our revenue colours; as soon as she perceived us, she cut her cables and made sail, and stood to the westward, we immediately crowded all the said that lay in our power and gave chace to her; about a little before seven we came near to her.</p>
               <p>What is the force of the Hawk? - Fourteen guns.</p>
               <p>What size? - Six pounders.</p>
               <p>When you came pretty near her what past? - We hailed her several times in order<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190162"/> to bring he to, on purpose to send our boat on board her.</p>
               <p>Did you receive any answer to your hail? - No, they paid no regard to it; the first mate that commanded the vessel at the time, ordered two muskets to be fired; I was present.</p>

               <p>What was the purpose of firing these muskets? - To bring her to.</p>
               <p>Did she then bring to? - No, she paid no regard.</p>
               <p>What was your next step? - In a few minutes we came a little nearer her.</p>
               <p>How near? - Within pistol shot or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>What did you do next? - We observed the guns all pointed aft, and the men all under arms.</p>
               <p>What does the guns being pointed aft mean? - Ready for action, and the people were all standing by them with their matches ready for a broadside.</p>
               <p>What passed upon this? - As soon as we came up along side of her; the action began; I cannot say which fired first.</p>
               <p>How long did the action last? - Near about an hour.</p>
               <p>How did you come to a conclusion? - The Lynx lugger came up between the Happy-go-Lucky and the Hawk, and fired a broadside, into the Happy-go-Lucky; immediately the people on board the Happy-go-Lucky made a motion with their hands, that they would strike.</p>
               <p>How did you dispose of her after she had struck? - They sent a boat on board of her from each vessel; the action lasted for about an hour; I cannot say within a few minutes; I did not go on board till the ship came into harbour; part of the prisoners were brought on board of the Hawk; I was present.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner at the bar one? - Yes, he was; I know him very well; I am sure he was one.</p>
               <p>Did you go on board the vessel when she came into harbour? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What number of guns did she carry? - Ten guns.</p>
               <p>Ten carriage guns? - Yes, and a parcel of swivels, and muskets, and harpoons, and boarding pikes.</p>
               <p>What ammunition? - All sorts, and a very large quantity.</p>
               <p>What was the number of the prisoners? - I cannot say how many, I saw fifteen of them in the castle together; but I do not know the number of them.</p>
               <p>Do you of your own knowledge know how they were disposed of after they were got on shore? - I saw them put into Pendennis castle; I did not see the prisoner put in, but I saw him there; I cannot say how long he was confined there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Between the Lynx and your vessel you gave the smuggler a pretty good dressing, how many men were killed? - I heard there were two, the captain and the mate; the name of the captain was

               <p>Did you find any smuggled goods upon her? - I did not go on board her; she lay along the shore.</p>
               <p>How far had you chased her from the place you first discovered her before you had an opportunity of hailing her? - I suppose it might be seven or eight leagues before we had an opportunity of hailing her.</p>
               <p>How long did you chase her? - About two hours.</p>

               <p>Jury. Cannot you recollect which fired first? - I cannot because we were so close together.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Then all you can answer is, that at the time you fired your guns from your vessel, there was a fire returned from theirs? - I cannot say which fired first.</p>
               <p>If they had fired first you must have seen it of course? - I do not know whether we could or not.</p>
               <p>When you first discovered her I suppose you wanted to get as near her as possible? - Yes, they knew us as soon as they saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190163"/> us; we intended to get as near as possible; we kept up a pretty brisk fire; I cannot say what ammunition we expended; we had no men killed on board of us, but it was not for the want of their good will; I heard there were thirteen or fourteen wounded on board this vessel.</p>
               <p>Did you know the mate of this vessel? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You do not know how many men they carried? - No, Sir, I cannot say.</p>

               <p>You had an opportunity of boarding her soon after she came into the harbour I take it for granted? - I had not, Sir.</p>
               <p>How far were you at the time this action began from the port of Penzance? - We were in the port of Penzance at that time; It was a clinch work built ship, it had a running bowsprit.</p>

Was you on board the Hawk revenue vessel on the 4th of April? - Yes; at five in the morning I saw the Happy-go-lucky, we were off the Lizard; she was laying under the islands; we made towards her from the Land's-end; we were about two miles or a little better off her, she cut her cable and made fail towards the Land's-end, which was directly from us; we hoisted our revenue colours and made fail after her, we came up to her about seven; we hailed her first to bid her bring to.</p>
               <p>Did she regard that hail? - No.</p>
               <p>What did you do then? - We fired a musket, she paid no regard to that, we fired another.</p>
               <p>Did she bring to then? - No.</p>
               <p>What did she do? - She kept on still, and when we got nigh hand to her, she fired two guns, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. She fired two guns at you? - Yes, that was just as we got abreast of her.</p>
               <p>What distance might you be from her? - I suppose about a pistol shot, hardly so much.</p>
               <p>Could you see or observe what they were doing on board? - Yes, they were making every thing ready for action.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by making ready for action? - Every man to his quarters; when she fired two guns, we poured in a broadside, and she continued firing as fast as she could, and we continued firing.</p>
               <p>A regular engagement? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long did it last? - I suppose it lasted pretty near an hour.</p>
               <p>What is it that was fired? - Great guns, small arms, and swivels.</p>
               <p>Had you any swivels? - No, Sir, the swivels were fired from the Happy-go-lucky; then the Lynx came in between us and fired a broadside upon them; then she immediately struck.</p>
               <p>Upon her striking, did any body go on board her from your ship? - No, not then.</p>
               <p>Did you go on board at any time? - I went on board after she went into the bay.</p>
               <p>Were any of the crew brought on board of your ship? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. There were no men sent out of the Hawk at first? - No, they went from the Lynx, three men.</p>
               <p>How soon after were the prisoners brought on board the Hawk? - About half an hour.</p>
               <p>Who brought them? - I do not know; there were eight or ten brought on board the Hawk.</p>
               <p>What became of the rest? - Some were put on board the Lynx, and some left on board till we got into the bay.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoner, was he one of them? - Yes, he was brought on board the Hawk; I saw him afterwards when I went on board the Happy-go-lucky; he was left on board the Hawk; he was brought into Falmouth in the Hawk; I did not see him after till he was put away from the vessel; I heard he was put with the rest of the prisoners in Pendennis castle; she run athwart us first.</p>
               <p>What guns did she carry? - Eight<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190164"/> fours and threes, as we suppose by the size, and two short nines, besides many swivels, and boarding pikes.</p>
               <p>Did you see any ammunition on board? - Yes, small shot.</p>
               <p>A great deal of shot and powder? - Not so much powder as shot.</p>
               <p>What sort of a built vessel was she? - A clinch bottom vessel.</p>
               <p>What sort of a bowsprit? - It runs in and out.</p>
               <p>At first you say there were three men went from the Lynx on board her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who brought the prisoners from her to your ship? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had you ever seen the prisoner before he was brought on board the Hawk? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Every body was brought? - Yes, except two men; it was five on the 4th of April, when we began to crowd fail; it was not very light then; but we could see the vessel, she was ahead of us, we went after her in a straight line, and she went the way to get out of the bay.</p>

               <p>Unless she could have seen through your fails, she could not see your colours? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Not till you came along side of her? - We fired two muskets in order to bring her to.</p>
               <p>When you came along side, do you say the Happy-go-lucky fired two guns? - They fired two guns after we fired two muskets to bring to; we hailed her first; we fired two muskets to bring her to; we came up along side of her, and she fired two big guns to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>When you shot up to her so as to become broad side and side, the king's vessel was most active? - The Happy-go-lucky fired two guns first, and after she fired them two guns we gave her a broadside.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long have you been at sea? - These two or three years.</p>
               <p>Not more! I was in hopes I should have had an old sailor to have talked to; what is your situation on board this vessel? - A carpenter.</p>
               <p>When you was called to quarters by the captain and mate, I suppose you went at first? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know the commander of the Happy-go-lucky? - Yes, I knew him before he went there.</p>
               <p>And a desperate fellow he was? - Yes, Sir, he was by his actions.</p>
               <p>And the mate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This man was either a mariner or a passenger on board the vessel? - Yes, there were no smuggled goods on board.</p>
               <p>The prisoner had no interest on board the vessel? - None at all; we hoisted our colours at the flag-staff on the mizen mast head.</p>
               <p>Court. Within what distance might that be discerned by the Happy-go-lucky in the track you were both failing? - She saw them I suppose when she run right athwart of us; she was within hail, within pistol shot.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. As the colours were on the mizen-mast head, a vessel bearing ahead of course cannot see them? - They came right out of the bay a-head of us and they could see the colours then; that was before we fired.</p>
               <p>Then if your colours had been hoisted at the main-top-mast head, or the maingallant-mast head they would have been visible? - Yes, they were only visible just before she run athwart of us; we edged away; then she might have seen our colours.</p>
               <p>That lasted not very long, I take it for granted, so that all the time you was in chace of her she could not see your colours? - She could see our colours before we spoke to her.</p>
               <p>You fired the whole broadside into her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now, honest fellow, how is it you know the hail, your situation is below deck? - Yes, Sir, but not till the action begins, when the action begins my situation as carpenter is below.</p>
               <p>When you were coming up along side, was every man in the vessel at quarters? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190165"/> Yes, every man on both sides, their vessel and ours; I did not go down till she fired.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wilson. Who was the commander on board your ship at the time? -

               <p>I belong to the Lynx; I am chief mate.</p>
               <p>Do you remember on the 4th of April last, seeing the vessel called the Happy-go-lucky laying at anchor? - Yes, near a mile under the Mullion island; as soon as they discovered us they cut their cable and made sail, we hauled into water and went after her.</p>
               <p>When did you come up with her? - The Hawk came up with her about seven; I saw the Hawk come up with her.</p>
               <p>What time did you get up with her? - Near to eight.</p>
               <p>What were the Hawk and the Happy-go-lucky doing when you came up? - They were doing nothing then, but there had been an engagement three quarters of an hour before we came up; when we came up we went between both vessels and fired a broadside into the Happy-go-lucky.</p>
               <p>What did the Happy-go-lucky do in consequence of that broadside? - They made signals with their hats that they would strike.</p>
               <p>Had you signals on board your vessel? - Yes, on board both; we fired a broadside into the Happy-go-lucky and she struck; I went on board her, and the boatswain, and one of the foremast men; when I went on board, I asked where the captain was, they told me the captain was killed and the second mate; and there were a great many more wounded; then we hoisted out the Happy-go-lucky's boat and sent the people on board the Hawk.</p>
               <p>Can you say the prisoner was one of the those people? - I cannot say that he was.</p>
               <p>You did not know him? - No.</p>
               <p>What number did you send? - I cannot tell, I did not number them, I suppose a dozen or fourteen, more or less.</p>
               <p>You did not particularly observe them? - I cannot say he was one.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing of them afterwards? - No, I never saw them after.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not know the prisoner by sight? - No, she was a clinch built ship, a running bowsprit; she had ten carriage guns on board, and plenty of ammunition, and swivels and small arms, and blunderbusses.</p>
               <p>When you first came up with the Happy-go-lucky, what did all the people on board appear to be doing? - When we fired that broadside then they all seemed to shy off the decks as fast as they could.</p>
               <p>You was not near enough to discover what the men were doing at the time the engagement began between them and the Hawk? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. There was no smuggled goods, nor any property there? - No.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What ship did you belong to on the 4th of April last? - The Happy-go-lucky; I was before the mast.</p>
               <p>Where was she on the 4th of April? - She was at anchor under Mullion island.</p>
               <p>From whence did she come? - She came from Guernsey, failed from there the 1st of April.</p>
               <p>What was she loaded with from Guernsey? - Spirits.</p>
               <p>What had she done with those spirits? - She had landed them on shore at a place called King's Cove.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts is that? - It is near Mounts Bay; when she had so put them on shore; she had landed part of her cargo on the Saturday night, she landed the remainder part the next night; that is on the 3d.</p>
               <p>On the 2d and 3d of April had she landed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190166"/> this cargo that she brought from Guernsey? - Yes.</p>
               <p>On the 4th when she was laying under Mullion island what did you perceive? - We perceived two luggers.</p>
               <p>What did you do? - We did not rightly know what they were, but we perceived they were making for us.</p>
               <p>Then on perceiving that they were making for you what was done on board your ship? - The watch on deck cut the cable.</p>
               <p>Is that the quickest way of getting off? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was the reason of taking the quickest way of getting off from these vessels? - I do not know, it was the captain's orders to make fail.</p>
               <p>You got off in the quickest manner you could? - Sail was made immediately, to get immediately all hands we could up.</p>
               <p>Did those vessels follow you when you made off? - Immediately they made sail and followed in chace.</p>
               <p>How many persons were on board the ship? - Thirty three, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>These vessels giving you chace, did they come up with you? - The Hawk came up with us very fast.</p>
               <p>What passed on board your ship? - The captain gave orders for getting every thing clear, for if they had come up he was fully bent to engage them.</p>
               <p>When the Hawk did come up what state of preparation were you in? - We were all clear about the deck.</p>
               <p>Were the guns in any state of preparation? - Yes, Sir, there was preparation to receive them when they came.</p>
               <p>Were they loaded? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were matches ready or not on board? - Every thing was ready for engagement, some of the crew were to the large guns and some to the small arms.</p>
               <p>Were you all employed one way or another? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were none sick or absent from the deck at that time? - None sick.</p>
               <p>Were all those-thirty three from the ship or were any of them passengers? - None passengers.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner one of that crew? - He was.</p>
               <p>Where did he come on board? - I cannot say, he was on board of her before I came on board; I had been on board eight days.</p>
               <p>Court. What part of the ship was the prisoner in at the time of this engagement? - I believe he was abaft.</p>
               <p>Was he employed as a mariner in the same manner that you were during these eight days you was with him in the ship? - Yes.</p>
               <p>All the same as yourself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When the Hawk came up how did you receive her? - The Hawk came up and she hailed, and said some words but I could not rightly hear them; they might hear aft but I did not.</p>
               <p>What answer was given? - No answer at all.</p>
               <p>Court. Had the Hawk any colours hoisted? - Yes, at her mizen-top-mast head.</p>
               <p>How long had these colours been flying? - We saw the colours flying all the time of the chace.</p>
               <p>What colours were they? - They were Custom-house colours.</p>
               <p>When the hail was not answered, what was done on board the Hawk then? - There were some muskets fired.</p>
               <p>Upon those muskets being fired, did any thing pass on board? - She came up along side of us, and immediately the action went on and we fired as fast on both sides as we possibly could.</p>
               <p>Jury. I understood him at first at the former part of his evidence, that he saw two luggers making up to them, but he did not know what they were, and now he says he saw the colours flying all the time? - I knew the colours when they came along side I saw the colours flying, but did not know what colours they were till they came along side.</p>
               <p>Mr. Soliciter. Where are revenue cutter colours usually hoisted? - The usual<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190167"/> place on board of such vessels as these is the mizen mast head.</p>
               <p>Had those ships any other colours besides at any other place? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Were there any guns fired out of your ship? - There was no firing out of our ship before they fired the two muskets.</p>
               <p>But was there any gun fired out of your ship before they fired the broadside? - No.</p>
               <p>Could you distinguish which of the vessels first fired a gun after the two muskets? - The Hawk to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>What space of time was there between their firing and yours? - Not a moment.</p>
               <p>And you were all ready to receive them before their fire was given? - All ready.</p>
               <p>You did not answer their hail or their shot? - We did not answer their hail as I heard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor. In which case, my Lord, the act of parliament says the revenue cutters shall fire.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you take them for when you ran away from them? - We took them to be two revenue cutters.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. How long did this engagement last? - I believe three quarters of an hour before the Lynx came up.</p>
               <p>Jury. You had ceased firing before the Lynx came up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you struck before the Lynx came up? - No.</p>
               <p>What was the reason of their ceasing firing on both sides? - Because, Sir, the cutter's lugger shot a head of us, and our sails were shot away, and would not hold wind, and we were put at a distance from each other, and the Lynx came up and poured a broadside, and the captain and mate were killed.</p>
               <p>What became of your vessel after she fired? - Immediately after the captain was killed, who was a very resolute man, we struck; but he had threatened that he would blow the brains out of any man that offered to lower the fails, or strike.</p>
               <p>What became of you, the crew of the Happy-go-lucky, after you struck? - Immediately they hoisted the boats out, and took us that were well on board of the revenue vessels, the wounded were left in the Happy-go-lucky.</p>

               <p>Was the prisoner taken out of the Happy-go-lucky? - Yes; we were carried to the port of Falmouth, and put into Pendennis castle; the prisoner was also put there; we continued there five or six days, I cannot rightly be sure.</p>
               <p>Were those arms on board your vessel at the time you went to Guernsey? - Yes, they were on board it when I came on board; they were all hid under the fails; but when we came within sight of the English land the guns were mounted.</p>
               <p>How long had you been on the coast of England before you were taken as you described? - About four days; the guns were in their proper situations during those four days; after we had landed our goods we put them below, but in the time of the chace the captain ordered them to be brought on the deck.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you know for what pur- you went on board that vessel? - I had been sick, Sir, for a long time, and I was in great distress.</p>
               <p>Did you know when you first entered on board that she was a smuggler? - I knew she carried goods, but I did not know that she carried any guns.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You shipped on board her at Guernesy? - Yes, I made two trips; the captain concealed the guns; I did not know there were any.</p>

               <p>What expressions did he use to the men to make them bring the guns upon deck? - He told all hands to go and get the guns up; he was a very resolute man, and threatened to shoot any man that attempted to strike or surrender; the prisoner had made three trips; that was my second trip in her.</p>
               <p>Had he any thing in his hand by which he could have carried this threat into execution?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190168"/> - He had two pistols and a cutlass; the mate was killed.</p>
               <p>Had they both an interest in the cargo? - I cannot say; we had none; we were going back to Guernsey; the captain and mate insisted on our firing.</p>
               <p>Before the Lynx came up, you had ceased firing? - The Lynx came up and poured in a broadside, and killed these two men, and we struck that moment.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath do you believe that if any man had lowered or struck, he would have shot them? - He certainly would.</p>
               <p>You have no doubt but he would? - He would actually have done it.</p>
               <p>Were you then sighting at the hazard of having your brains blown out? - If we had resisted he would have blown our brains out on the spot.</p>
               <p>You have told us that the revenue colours were hoisted at the mainmast? - Yes; in the course of the chace the revenue cutters were astern of us; when they came nearer they fired some muskets; it might be two or three, I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>One question more, as you are a witness for the crown I take it I have a right to ask this question, upon the oath you have taken, do you believe that the prisoner either had any malice at all to any body on board the ship, or that he at all resisted in this engagement from his own free will?</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General objected to this question, and it was waved.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you made two trips in her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you landed goods both times? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At the first time when you came within English shore were these guns then hoisted? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>How happened that? - Because he never had them mounted without he saw something.</p>
               <p>What did you see when you got the second time within sight of the English land? - I saw a vessel under the land, and took it to be a lugger.</p>
               <p>What as you came to land? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. What station was the prisoner in? - He was a foremast man; he was at some of the small arms; he was abaft, but I cannot say whether he fired; he was not serving the guns in the waste before the mainmast.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The guns were never mounted till you saw something on the second trip? - No.</p>
               <p>You were shipped then? - We could not get away; we were shipped.</p>
               <p>Court. When these guns were mounted on the second trip, were you all of you on shore? - No, he would not let a man go on shore.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. We call no witnesses.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say.</p>
