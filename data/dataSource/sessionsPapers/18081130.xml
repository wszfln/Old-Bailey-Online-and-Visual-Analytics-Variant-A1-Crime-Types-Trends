            . I am a carpenter. On the 3d of October, about half past six in the morning, I was going to my work, I met the prisoner Hankey with the copper on his shoulder in Greek street; I did not take any particular notice then, but went on to my work in Soho square; I saw the prisoner Clark come out of a house at the corner of Greek street; he shut the door after him and spoke to another man, and they both went down Bateman's buildings; that is the turning after Greek street.</p>
               <p>Q. That other man is not here - A. No; he was here last sessions. I thought they had no business in the house; I went on to my work, I met the witness Hathaway; from his information we followed them down Greek street, and just as we got to Queen street the other two men came up.</p>
               <p>Q. What two other men came up - A. Clark and Procter. We proceeded to follow Hankey, that had the copper on his shoulder, into Litchfield street; there he knocked at the door and took the copper in.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning might that be - A. About twenty minutes to seven. I was about half a dozen doors off when he knocked at the door; as soon as I got up to the door he was coming out again without the copper; I met him at the door and laid hold of his collar; I told him that he was my prisoner; he asked me what for.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you an officer - A. No. He immediately up with his fist and struck me on my breast, gave himself a wrench and got away from me, and ran into Grafton street, where Clark and Procter was standing; he ran between them, made a kind of a stop. Clark said something to him and he run off again directly into West street, into Castle street, and into the Seven Dials, where there is a great many turnings, there I lost him: I turned back to the place where the copper was left, I met Procter there; directly he saw me he ran away: I ran after him with the cry of stop thief; he was stopped in Newport market; I took him before the magistrate; he was tried last sessions.</p>

            . On the 3d of October, at half past six in the morning, I was going to work, I saw two men lurking about at the house, 27, Soho square, the corner of Greek street; I looked at them and I saw one of them go up to the door; a working man was coming by; he came away; I went up to the rails of Soho square, and I saw the prisoner Hankey go up to the door again of No. 27; the door was opened and he went in. I ran to our shop, which was about an hundred yards from the square, and told the men what I saw; they did not come with me; I ran back again, and as soon as I got in the square I saw Hankey come out of No. 27, with the copper on his shoulder; Clark came out afterwards and pulled the door after him and was talking with Procter, that was with Hankey; they all went down Bateman's buildings, that come, into Greek street. I met with the witness Packer; I told him what I saw, and we followed the man with the copper.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the copper on his shoulder then - A. Hankey; and the other two men were behind; I followed them to Mr. Sholey's, 27, Litchfield street; he knocked at the door; the door was opened, and he went in. I turned my head round to look for the other two prisoners; Hankey came out and ran away; I ran after him and lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that Hankey was the man - A. No, I am not sure that he was the man, because I was at a distance from him; it was something of the same sized man; he has a different dress on now.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at him now - take your time - A. I am almost sure it is the same man. We turned back and met with Procter; he saw us and ran away; we ran after him and cried out stop thief; he was stopped by the butchers in Newport market.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the man that was tried - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the copper - A. Packer fitted it in the place where it was taken from.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Neither of the three men that you have been speaking to had you ever seen before - A. Procter and 
               <persName id="t18081130-1-person58">Clark</persName>
             I have seen before, and knew them.</p>
               <p>Q. Hankey you had never seen before - A. No. I saw him at the door with Procter; I saw his face plain.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from him - A. About twelve yards.</p>
               <p>Q. When Hankey was taken to the police office, you was taken there to identify him - did not you tell the magistrate that you by no means could say it was the man - A. I told the magistrate I could not positively swear to him; but now I see him I know the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your memory is helped by a longer time - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you now attempt to say he is the man, yet a quarter of an hour ago you could not - A. I can swear he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. You indicted this man along with Procter, who was tried last sessions - A. He was indicted.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen him from the time he was engaged carrying the copper, when you before the grand jury - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300004"/>Q. You did not know whether his name was Hankey or Smith - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. to Packer. What became of the copper - A. After I took Procter to the watchhouse, I went back to Mr. Sholey the coppersmith, and told them that they had got a copper; I went into their work shop, and there were three coppers; there I pointed to one, and said a man brought that one in this morning; I knew it to be the copper that Hankey took in; I put my name on the copper, and afterwards I fitted it to the place where it was taken from.</p>
               <p>Q. Then this copper that you found on Hankey's shoulder, you took and fitted to where - A. No. 27, Soho square, the corner of Greek street.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose house was that - A. Mr. Gedge's.</p>
               <p>Q. You are very sure then that the copper you found there you had seen on Hankey's shoulder, and that it fitted that place. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You had never seen any of the men before - A. I knew Clark; the other men were perfect strangers to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go into Mr. Sholey's where you found the copper, till after you took Procter to the watchhouse - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did that take place - A. About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore what they do at Mr. Sholey's place you do not know, you found a copper there - A. Yes, and two others.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Sholey here - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to Gedge. Is your house the corner of Greek street in Soho square - A. It is No. 27, Soho square; the corner of Greek street.</p>

            . I am an officer belonging to Worship street office. On the 18th of this month, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was in the Commercial Road; I saw the prisoner with a knot on his head, with a cask and a sack upon the knot; he was leaning back; resting it on the rail that parts the road from the field; I asked him what he had got there carrying; he said painter's oil, you may see by my coat that I am a painter; he said he brought it from an oil shop farther down the road, and he was going to carry it to his master, a painter, in the Borough; I asked him if he had brought an order from his master for it, or whether he had a bill of parcels; he said, neither; I told him he must go with me to the next public house, which was the half way house, that I might see what it was; we took him in there, took it off his head and set it on the floor; it began to work;

             was with me, and two more. I told him it was beer, not oil; he said then it was ale, he got it from a brewhouse farther down; he had it from a man in the brewhouse yard, that wore a dark coat and a white apron, but he did not know his name; I asked him if he had paid for it; he said no; he was to pay a pound note for it; and he had some once or twice before; he paid for it all at once when it suited him; sometimes in a week or a fortnight afterward. We saw Mr. Whiffing's name on the cask, and on the sack; we sent down to the brewhouse. Since then I have been sent down to take charge of Mr. Whiffing's man; the prisoner's brother worked for Mr. Whiffing; he acknowledged to me that he had taken it for his child's christening; on the Saturday following he was going to have his child christened at St. George's church. Mr. Whiffing promised to forgive the man if he would tell the magistrate; the magistrate thought it not right, and sent him here. The prisoner said afterwards he found it outside of the brewhouse wall.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you perceive it - A. I perceived it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel it - A. I just slighty felt it; I put my hand down into my pocket, my watch was gone; she ran off with the watch and went towards the palace. I went to the centinel that was on duty and told him that I was robbed of my watch; I did not pursue her any further because she was gone out of my sight; this was on the Saturday; on the Wednesday following I saw the prisoner at Queen square office.</p>
               <p>Q. When you perceived the watch going why did not you stop her - A. It was done momentary, and she ran away; I did not perceive which way she went.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the Wednesday, Wagstaffe, one of the witnesses, came up to the office, and said he knew where the watch and the prisoner was; I went with him and apprehended her; Wagstaffe gave up the watch at the office; I have had it in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>- WAGSTAFFE. I am a soldier. On the 29th of October, near one o'clock, I met the prisoner against the Queen's palace; my wife, I, and the prisoner went to the White Horse, suttling house; we had a glass of gin each; my wife told me that the prisoner had got a watch; I asked her what she had got by her side; she said a watch; it was tied by a string to her side; she shewed it me, but refused to let me have it in my hand. We came out of the suttling house, the prisoner, and my wife, and me, and we all went home to my apartment and dined together. I sat in a chair and pulled her on my knee and asked to let me look at the watch again; she gave it into my hand; she told me a gentleman had given it her, during a month while he was gone in the country, she did not know his name; I told her I should detain it till I heard a further account of it. When I heard she had robbed a man in the park I accused her of it; she said that she lit of the gentleman in the park, and while they were in conversation she took it out of his pocket; I delivered it up before the magistrate to Mr. Renny.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This gentleman was coming from St. James street: me and two more young women were going along, he asked us to walk with him; we did. He and I sat down in the park. When I left him I kicked my foot against it, I picked it up, I found it was this watch; I did not know that it belonged to this gentleman.</p>

               <p>Q. How are you sure that the piece of copper that he dropped from his hand, is the piece that he put in his breeches - A. Because he had no other piece about him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he could not have got it from any other person - A. No, he could not, because he had not got above ten yards.</p>
               <p>Q. There is nothing on that bit of copper that marks it to be your father's - A. No; but that I found at his house I had marked the day before.</p>

               <p>"Yours I received, and in order to answer your request, and to bring things to a more speedy conclusion, have to inform you that you can by no means make a demand or expect an agreement from me, as not being my lawful wife. What I am going to explain will no doubt surprise you; however I think it necessary, in order that I may give you no longer suspence, but hereafter you may pursue your own method to take the law against me, or otherwise, as you may think proper to answer your ends. - I have to inform you that at our first meeting I deceived you; in doing that I deceived myself also. If you look back, you must see my behaviour to you at sometimes was somewhat odd, but it was not without a reason, and my reason was this - I have another wife, and have had three years and a half past, and by her I have had two children living and one dead; I left her in an hour I supposed my affairs were in a precarious state, which obliged me to leave my country and friends; but at this time I understand things are reconciled between them and me, and I am determined at this time to live no longer in adultery; and I am sure you can have no desire, from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300009"/>what I have heard you say respecting a married man - I now have explained the matter as far as I dare say you can wish; as any more can be of no consequence to you. I leave you to act as you think proper, when I will bid an everlasting adieu to London and you. Hoping that you will meet with a person that is more worthy your affections, and to end your days in unity and love (which could never have been the case with me), I remain your well wisher, but equally injured</p>
               <p>"R. A. FENTON.</p>
               <p>"P. S. If you answer this, as I hope you will, in order to inform me how you will act, I will either send you something now, or at Christmas, according to promise; and hope you will ever look forward to yourself, and give up a man who has acted so basely. Adieu for ever and ever."</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Have you been able to find him - A. He was not found by me, but by his third wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you able to discover him - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you try to find him - A. I took out a warrant against him about a twelvemonth ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not try before that twelvemonth ago - A Yes; I went down to Romford where he resided; in consequence of that he left Romford; then I could not find him.</p>

On the 14th of October, I left my watch in my breeches, hanging up in the stable; I locked the stable door, and left the key in the door, at about half past one; I returned at about half past four; I missed my watch.

Yes; I apprehended him at his master's stable; the prisoner went with me to his room, he unlocked the box himself; I found this watch in his box; I asked him how he came to steal the watch; the prosecutor told him it would be better for him to confess.</p>
               <p>Q. Then do not tell what he said - A. I took him to Enfield; the lock was off the watchhouse door, I took him to the Nag's Head; he sat very quietly with me; as soon as the smith had put the lock on and brought me the key, I took him out to put him in the watchhouse; he broke from me as soon as he got out of the public house door; he kept away for five or six week; he was taken last Saturday; he is the same man, he has a wife and two children.</p>

            . Last Friday evening, about half past six, I came opposite Shoreditch church, I saw the prisoner with a sack on his shoulder; I took hold of the end of the bag, I asked him where he was going with them; he said he was going to an inn; I said what inn, he said the Basing house; it struck me that he had stole the rags; I knew the gentleman, Mr. Holmes, that he worked for, he lives opposite of me; I then went to Mr. Holmes to know whether they had sent any rags out of the warehouse; I then stood out of door, till he came back. I asked him where he had left the rags, he said at the inn; after that he went into the warehouse; the prisoner then said he had not been out of the warehouse, he had no rags at all; I told him he had, I saw him with the sack on his shoulder; I took him by the shoulder and took him to the office; he confessed that he had taken them and took me to the place where he had sold them; we took the rags and put them in the sack and took them to Worship street; the sack had Mr. Holmes' name upon it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM - . Q. Are you Mr. Holmes's foreman - A. Yes. About half past six, on the 25th of November, I left the prisoner at work; I w<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300010"/>warehouse to Mr. Holmes's brother, where he lay dangerously ill; I had not been long there before Mr. Holmes's brother came up stairs and said I was wanted; I came down; the officer asked me whether I had given orders to take any thing out; I told him no; he said he had seen one of the men with a sack on his shoulder, and that he said he was going to take them to the inn. I immediately went down with him to the warehouse; I asked the prisoner what he could mean by it. Then the officer said he must take him into custody. As he was going to the office, he acknowledged that the man that worked with him helped to put them in the bag, opened the gate and let him out of the premises with the bag; then he took us to the shop where he had sold them; there I asked him what bag he had brought them in; he said it was one of his master's bags with his master's name on it; this is the bag; it is my master's, his name is upon it. We asked the woman where the bag was; she said it was where he put it himself; I took it; I then went to where the rags lay; I said these are my master's property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The man that worked along with me let me out of the door with them, and put them on my back and told me to take them there to sell them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

On Thursday the 3d of November, the prisoner, accompanied with another person, came to my master's shop and staid in the shop about half an hour; when they were gone, in a few minutes I had occasion to suspect them and followed them; I overtook them about fifteen yards from the shop; I told them that Mr. Harvey wished to speak to them; either the prisoner or her companion said, what can Mr. Harvey want with me, that she had taken nothing but what she had paid for. When they came near the shop door the prisoner attempted to pull a silk shawl out of her pocket, as if to throw it away; I seized the shawl while she was making the effort. Mr. Kimber came up and apprehended her; they were brought into the shop; the constable picked up a print behind her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you see it drop - A. No; I only saw the shawl taken from her person.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley Whose property was the shawl - A. It was the property of the prosecutors.</p>

               <p>Q. How many people serve in the shop - A. Eight or nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that shawl had not been sold - A. I can positively swear that shawl was not sold; I can swear it is Mr. Harvey and Lamming's property, by the private mark.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not cut off you private marks upon goods being sold - A. No.</p>

            . - Mr. Alley. You are a city officer - A. Yes. On the day spoken of I saw the prisoner about thirty yards from the shop; the witness Birkett ran after the ladies, and told them they were wanted; they resisted; I assisted in bringing them back; Curtis put her left hand on her right hand side and attempted to throw away a shawl; I laid hold of it, and Birkett took the shawl from me; I let the lady go in before me, and as I let her pass she let a piece of print drop from under her gown or pelisse; my foot reached the print before the other end reached the ground; I said here is the print likewise; she said it did not belong to her; I picked it up and shewed it them; I took her with the other up stairs into a private room and had them searched; nothing was found upon them up stairs.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Jury to Birkett. Did you see her stealing any thing - A. I supposed her to be stealing of something; I watched her very closely, I saw her with her hand under her gown as she stood by the window; I saw her hand in the shop window; I saw her turning her head; she was watching for fear any body saw her; I seemed to mind my own business, but I saw her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How came you to drop this now and not mention it at first - A. I answered the questions that were put to me.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say that property was stolen out of his shop - A. I have not a doubt of it; we had a piece of print that the selvage was discoloured; the fag end is gone. On the 26th of September I brought it up out of the warehouse; we had but one piece of that pattern in the house; I have not the least doubt it is the same piece.</p>
               <p>COURT. Let the jury look at it.</p>
               <p>JURY. This is a double selvage; it is very common to have a selvage discoloured: it is impossible to swear to a stain of that description; they are faded in the selvage in folding them.</p>

On the 19th of this month, about five o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into my shop with a woman with her; they asked me to shew them some silk handkerchiefs; I shewed them the whole I had; one of them - I believe it was the prisoner, told me that her friend wished to buy a bed-gown: I shewed them several pieces of print; among them was the one I have in my hand. After they had looked over the goods I had shewn them, they told me there was none that would do, the price was too high; they went out of the shop; upon their going out my wife saw there was something under the prisoner's petticoats, it stood out on her left side; I immediately jumped over the counter and ran to the door; I saw a man taking this print from under the prisoner's petticoats; he immediately ran towards Golden lane, and I followed him. When he came to the end of Golden lane I believe I was not more than three feet from him. He saw me behind him, he sprang from the pavement to run across the street; as he was jumping a horse and cart was coming down the lane, he jumped against the horse's head, the horse turned his head, and the prisoner passed and went round behind the cart; I was at that time near enough to put my fingers on his shoulder, but not near enough to hold him; he at that moment threw the print out of his right hand under the cart that was passing; I turned round immediately and picked up the print. On my picking up the print I saw the man who had got the print from the woman was gone some distance, that I thought my pursuing him was useless. When I returned home the young man told me that the two women were not out of sight, he pointed them out. I immediately ran over and caught the prisoner; I brought her to my house, got a constable, and had her taken to the Poultry compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the woman you saw in your shop - A. I am confident of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not she time to have gone away - A.There were near three or four minutes had elapsed from the time I went out to the time I came back; I am certain, and will swear to the woman.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Foy. Mrs. Foy told me the prisoner had got something away, as she was bulky; I observed that the prisoner had got something under her petticoats. On looking out of the door after her, I saw her give a man the print. I immediately told Mr. Foy of it; he went after the man and took the print. I watched the woman which way she went. Immediately Mr. Foy came back I told him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the same woman - A. I will swear to the woman; I never lost sight of her, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see me stand by the counter, or touch any of the goods in the shop - A. No.</p>
               <p>Pris. I never laid hold of any of the goods; it was my gown sticked out behind, which the lady saw. I never was suspected in my life.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I went into the shop I asked to look at a silk handkerchief; I said I would give six shillings and sixpence, or seven shillings, that was the most I could afford to give; I did not like the pattern, they were too large; the woman that was with me is every morning down at Billingsgate; she went out full five minutes, when the gentleman p<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300012"/>me and ran after somebody; I made a full stop, and said to the woman, her name is Kitty, this is the way to Chiswell street. I was going after my husband the same time.</p>
               <p>Jury to prosecutor. Had you shewn that print at the time she was there - A.This print I will be upon my oath I had in my hand, shewing to the friend of the prisoner, not two minutes before the prisoner went out.</p>

Mr. Read sent for her up stairs and asked her how she came by these shoes; she said she had them before she came into our service, some she bought and some she had given her. Mr. Read sent for a constable; he found a duplicate in her pocket, where she had pawned three other pair, which afterwards proved to be ours, and a handkerchief of my daughters.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any character with her - A. I had a character, but not from the last place; I desired her to go before her time was expired; she would not; I thought she staid with a view of getting more shoes. I do not know what else it could be.</p>

             READ. After my wife had shewed me the shoes I called ke up and asked her where she had got them shoes; she said one pair was gave her by a young man, two pair she bought of Mr. Neave in Whitecross street; knowing them to be my property I sent for an officer, I desired the officer to search her; among other things she pulled out this small box, containing three duplicates, one for three pair of shoes. I then took the officer up stairs with me, with the shoes, to examine her box. Mrs. Read described that she found the shoes in such a manner in the box; she said no, they lay in such a way; I said, then you confess the shoes were in your box, she said yes; I said officer take notice of that, fearing as the shoes had been removed from the box she might say they were not in the box.</p>

            . Q. You are a pawnbroker - A. Yes, I live at Mrs. Fothergill's, 106 Aldersgate street. On the 12th of October, I took in three pair of shoes; I took them in of a woman; I have seen the prisoner's face, before but I cannot swear that she pledged the shoes; they were tied up in this handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. These shoes that my mistress accuses me with, the pair of brown velvet I had given me, and two pair I bought of Mr. Neave when I had been there a fortnight; on the Tuesday evening I went out, I met with a person that I never saw before in my life; she said she had a duplicate that I should have for three shillings: I bought the duplicate of her. I can take an oath I never saw the shoes before.</p>

               <p>COURT. You took it in your cart - A. Yes; I took it out to take to the house; the porter brought it back and said they were removed; I drove to Wood street; I am sure the same parcel was put in again in Wood street; it was in the middle part of the waggon; I took and put it between two trusses, where it could not fall out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. What sort of a waggon is it - A. It is boarded at the bottom and railed round the side; the parcel could not fall out by accident.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was it so low that any body could put their arm in - A. They might put their hand down between the rail and move the parcel, and so take it out between the rail; it could not get out without being taken out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. When you had put the parcel in the situation you have described, what did you do then - A. The porter took out another parcel to deliver, and while he delivered that I turned the waggon round; he was gone a quarter of an hour delivering the other parcel; he came back and demanded this same parcel again; I went to look for it, and it was gone. I have seen the parcel since.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Grove, 93, Wood street, he is a watchmaker. On the 8th of October, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was in the yard shutting up the shutters, a parcel was thrown over the wall of the yard; I took it up and carried it into the shop to my master; when I got in to the shop I saw the prisoner standing at the street door window; he walked past the shop window; he stood at the corner of the court one minute, and then he came in; he said if you please, sir, will you give me the parcel, a drunken man has thrown it in your yard; my master bid him come in; he asked him where he lived; he said in Bethnal Green; Mr. Grove put several questions to him, and he run away.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner was at the window - A. Yes; and I am sure that is the man that came in the shop and had the conversation with my master in the passage; I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . Q. We understand you are a watch maker living in Wood street - A. Yes. The little girl who spoke last brought the parcel to me, and while she was with me waiting while I wrote a note, she perceived a man; I saw Simpson and Pitfold on the parcel; I was going to write to these people to inform them that I wished to see them, not wishing to keep a thing that I suspected I might be stolen; the girl says, there is some man looking in at the window; I said open the door and ask him in; upon which he vanished; another, or the same man, came; he came in whining and crying; he stood in a singular position, appeared much shorter than what he was, with his leg behind him keeping the door back that it might not be shut; he said if he did not get the parcel he should lose his place; he solicited for the parcel, saying that a drunken man had thrown it over my pales; I said if he came in he should have the parcel; he came a little matter forward; I asked him what sort of a parcel it was, the colour of it, and what it was wrapped up in, and a variety of such questions as that, to which he could give me no satisfactory answers; upon further requesting him to come in, he pushed the door back and the child against the wainscot and ran away, and I ran after him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say about being a porter - A. He said he had to carry the parcel; if he did not recover the parcel he should lose his place; he did not say he was a porter. I had a large candle in my hand, of which we had two or three in the shop. I ran down Love lane, up Great Love lane into Wood street again, where he was taken; I never lost sight of him, and once had hold of him; but he being a heavier man than myself he got away; I had like to have fell, my hand was upon the ground; I got up again; he never was further from me than I am from you; I never lost sight of him. This is the parcel; he could not give any account what the contents were nor what it was covered with.</p>

               <p>Page. That is the parcel I put in the waggon; it is directed to Simpson and Pitfold.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time did you set out with the waggon - A. At five o'clock, or rather before; it was after six when we missed the parcel in Wood street.</p>
               <p>COURT. How far was your waggon from Mr. Grove's - A. The waggon was very near the Castle inn.</p>
               <p>Grove. About an hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Your back yard has a paling - A. Yes; rather higher than I could reach; at the back of the yard is a court, which is a thoroughfare; I rather think it was intended to be lodged there; not to be thrown over.</p>
               <p>Q. Open the parcel and see what it contains - A. It contains twenty four yards of cambric.</p>

            . I am a servant to the last witness. On the 10th of November last, in the morning, the prisoner was seen to take three dozen locks; he went away then with them at two o'clock, and returned to work again on the same day; I put him to work up in the warehouse. I saw him put one dozen of locks in his pocket; after that I came into the front shop; he was seen to put another dozen in his pocket, by a lad that is in court, he came down and went out; I followed him as far as Old street, Goswell street, I collared him and one dozen of brass locks fell from him; I took him to the constable. He searched him, and found a dozen of iron locks in his possession.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PHILLIPS. I am an apprentice to Mr. Freemantle. On the 10th of November I went up stairs for some nails for the carpenter; on the top of the stairs I saw the prisoner put one dozen of locks in his pocket; they were so wrapped up as they are now; I told the foreman; the prisoner went down the stairs, and went out of the shop; I shut the door after him; the man went after him.</p>

               <p>Q. How much money was gone - A. A twenty pounds bank note, a ten pounds bank note, five one pound notes, four dollars, four half crowns, ten half guineas, the rest in shillings and seven shilling pieces; it altogether amounted to seventy nine pounds eight<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300015"/>shillings; I had reckoned it on the day before; I put it in the middle top drawer, I locked the drawer and put the key in my pocket; the money was in a purple leather glove.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you seen any of this property since - A. No, none at all.</p>
               <p>LUCY ALIPHANT. I live in the same court. On the 22nd of October. I saw Mr. Murphy between twelve and one break the windows.</p>
               <p>Q. Murphy is the man that is not taken up - A. Yes. I saw Murphy break Mrs. Shaw's windows; Mrs. Steward ran out and locked the parlour door. Mr. Murphy on seeing her lock the parlour door, went in and burst it open, he went in the parlour, he pulled out two or three drawers; he took up the poker and tried to open the middle drawer that had the money in; he found that he could not open it, he came out and said good bye to you all. The prisoner was standing in the court; he said to Murphy, will you have any lush.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that - A. Liquor. Murphy did not answer; Weston said a second time, will you have any lush; Murphy turned round and said to Weston come here; Murphy and Weston went into the parlour both together; Murphy took up the poker and tried to open this drawer with the head of the poker again; Weston says you b - r, take the point of the poker, and give it a jerk against the lock and you will soon have it open, which he did; he opened it and took something out in a purple leather glove.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you standing all this time - A. I put my head through the middle window which he broke; I stood in the court and saw all this done.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what was in this glove - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Which drawer was it he took this glove out - A. The top middle drawer; Murphy put it in his left hand pocket; Murphy and Weston came out together, they went down the Adelphi through the dark arches.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw them both go in at the street door - A. Yes, the street door was open; Murphy broke open the parlour door.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hyde. Which of the drawers was it you kept your money in - A. In the top middle drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had left it there on the Saturday when you went out and you missed it when you came home - A Yes.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 22nd of October, Mrs. Steward came to me at Bow street and told me that Murphy was breaking the windows, and Mrs. Shaw was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Weston - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Murphy - A. He was a shoemaker; when I went down the drawers were all upon the ground; she said he had broken open this little drawer while she had come to fetch me; she said her mistreses' money was in that drawer and he had taken it all away. In about half an hour afterwards, from information, I took the prisoner at a public house; he was drinking; I searched him, I found a half guinea, two seven shilling pieces, nine shillings in silver, and twelve penny worth of halfpence; he said his father paid him two seven shilling pieces the Saturday before; we took him before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how it came about their doing a thing of this sort in the middle of the day - every body having an opportunity of seeing them - A. I fancy Murphy had formerly lived with this woman, and they had parted some time. I had him in custody for beating her; he was in goal half a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he taken away any clothes - A. No; I fancy he only took the money; the clothes were all on the floor. He had only come out of goal the night before; he was in for three months for beating of her, and he had been in for three months before; I have had him in custody three times; as soon as he came out of goal he went and beat her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had they been together - A. Twenty four or twenty five years.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. Twenty five years I was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you tell me something of this sort before - you had seen this Murphy before - A. I lived along with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Your name is Hyde now - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever married to Murphy - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you married to Hyde - A. On the 3rd of November.</p>
               <p>Q. That was after the violence happened - A. Yes; I lived twenty five years with him: I was but fifteen years old when he first got hold of me; I have had fourteen children by Mr. Murphy.</p>
               <p>Q. Then perhaps he claimed some of the goods in the house - A. He sold all the goods in the house to Mr. Allen.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish you had told us this before - A. I thought you knew of it.</p>
               <p>Q. He had sold the drawers - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was not your drawers - A. Yes, it was, because I bought the things back again of Mr. Allen; Mr. Murphy delivered the house up, and the landlord let it me; I have had the house sixteen months. I had the twenty pounds note twenty years ago and the ten pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you got the money when you and he lived together - A. Yes. I went by his name, nobody knew but we were married till he exposed it himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you passed as man and wife - you having this property and putting it this drawer, he claimed all this property - A. He did not know that I had got it; when he had not left me a month he took away a twenty pound note and broke this drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. You both lived together in the same house you used the furniture together - as he passed for your husband, he considered every thing as his - A. It could not be his, because he did not work for it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember on Saturday the 19th of November having any snuff sent to you - A. Yes; my brother sent me thirty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that - A. I have placed it in the indictment under the duty alone; the duty is two shillings and three pence; the snuff is worth from three shillings and six pence to four shillings a pound. The snuff was in a cartridge paper bag, cased over with sheets of brown paper, and corded; it was a snuff in imitation of Dutch rappee; I received it about five o'clock in the evening; I received several other parcels at the same time; I had occasion to go out; I placed it on a cask at the farther end of my shop; I missed it on Monday morning. On Wednesday morning I saw the snuff again in the possession of Mr. Hancock the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know it to be your own - A. I could not swear to it, but my brother could.</p>

             I am a tobacconist, and brother to the last witness. On the evening of the 19th of November I sent thirty pounds of Dutch rappee snuff to my brother, I manufactured it, and sent him some other parcels; but I am not accurate what the other goods were.</p>
               <p>Q. Who packed the thirty pounds of snuff - A. I fancy my porter; I merely shewed him the cask; I saw it when it was packed up, there was no directions on it; it is customary for us to put the weight on it; I am not certain whether the weight was on it or not; the porter set off with it between four and five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you should know the snuff again if you were to see it - A. I am perfectly persuaded that is the identical snuff that I sent; I saw it again on the Thursday following at Hatton Garden office.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. You gave orders at your manufactory that this Dutch rappee snuff should he made up in a parcel and sent to your brother - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How your servant made up the parcel you do not know - A. I shewed him the cask and he went with me to the cask.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him make up the parcel - A. No; I saw the contents of the parcel after it was packed.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon you to say whether the parcel that you saw packed answered to this snuff or not - A. I cannot say but there may be other snuff at the bottom of the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. You have sent out several parcels of this snuff - A. No; there was never any of that operation sent out above five pound, except that thirty pound then; and I have only sent one thirty since, and that was to my brother.</p>
               <p>COURT. When you was at the office did you examine your snuff - A. I examined it and smelt it; I firmly believe it to be my snuff.</p>

            . Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar, do you know him - A. Yes. On the 19th of November I saw him at the Butcher's Arms, Clare market; the prisoner and one that made his escape was in the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you - A. I am a shoe maker.</p>
               <p>Q. How is the parlour situated with respect to the tap room - A. There is one door goes into the tap room, and another door goes into the passage; we were in the passage where the parlour lays to the right of the passage; it is the back room to the tap, only a partition between; I observed a large bag, I did not know what it was then, it was laying on a table on the right hand when I entered the room, and a ham on another table.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any body else in the room but these two men - A. No person whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the room light or dark - A. Only a fire light and a borrowed light from the tap room; I entered the tap room before I went into the parlour; I saw some suspicious people in the tap room; I said to Ekelsoe, we had better stop here and keep the door; Ekelsoe and Hancock were with me; we all went into the parlour. The prisoner made his escape from Hancock, and got into the tap room; Hancock called for assistance; we went into the tap room and Hancock was in the act of taking the prisoner from under the tap room table.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other man - A. He made his escape. When the prisoner was taken he said he knew nothing about the ham or the bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. You have told my lord that you are a shoemaker - are you in a large way of business - A. I live at No. 9, Ormond place.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you keep a shop - A. I had a stall then and I have now.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the only way you have of getting your livelihood - A. I have a situation in Queen square church of bell ringing.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not get any thing by hunting out people, and giving information - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not employ yourself in that sort of business - A. No, I do not.</p>

            . I am an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. You were left alone in the parlour - A. Yes, next the stair case; the prisoner stood by a round table near the middle of the parlour, and on a table laid a ham; the snuff was on a table by the side of the room tied up in this paper, and this is the string, the top of it was open, as if it had been examined; and near it on the table sat another man, that I supposed was in company with the prisoner; no candle in the room, nor no liquor that they called for; there was a fire in the parlour. As soon as I saw the snuff I asked them what game they had been after, and smelled the snuff; one of them said nothing. I then told them I should take them in custody on suspicion of having stolen these articles. After Deer and my brother officer went out of the room I attempted to fasten the door, I was not able to fasten it. When I had secured the one that got away, I was going to search him; immediately the prisoner at the bar ran out of the parlour behind me and made his escape into the tap room; finding that, I left the other man and ran after him; in the mean time the other man escaped; which way he got out I know not. The prisoner ran out of the parlour into the tap room, and shut the door in order to shut me in; but I was too quick upon him, he had scarce time to throw himself under the table, between the legs of the other company. I seized him by the collar, drew my cutlass and drew him out: I threatened the rest of the company if they rescued him; I took him into the parlour and handcuffed him; my brother officer took him to New prison; I took the ham and the snuff; it has never been out of my custody. Carrying the snuff under my arm, the bottom of the packet fell out; I put it into this bag; that is the paper and the strings. I can swear it is the same snuff that was in the paper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. You say the man that made his escape was the man that sat nearest the snuff - A. He was the nearest.</p>

            . I was going down Swallow street, towards St. James's church; at the corner of Maddox street, I perceived a man pulling a woman very roughly; I crossed over the way; he then had hold of her by her left arm, which he endeavoured to twist round, swearing at the same time that he would break her arm; I asked him what the woman had done that he was using her so ill in that way; he said she had stole a pair of stockings from him at the Green Dragon public house, at the corner of Maddox street; she said she had not; I told him if he thought she had got them to get a constable and have her searched; he seemed to be very much in liquor; he still persisted in saying that if she did not deliver the stockings up he would break her arm; the woman seemed to be in great pain, and a gentleman who was present seized him by the collar, loosed his hand from her arm, and told her to go about her business. She went as far as the end of Hanover street, when the prisoner followed her, seized her again, brought her to the Green Dragon door, and endeavoured to go into the house, but the landlord of the house pushed him out, and said he would have no more of him: then I told him he had better take the woman to Marlborough street; she said she was willing to go any where before a magistrate. They went down Swallow street into Little Argyle street, where I lost sight of them; I went down Swallow street to where I was going; I stopped to speak to a person at the end of Conduit street, and happening to turn my head, I saw the prisoner running down Swallow street, he had got a something in his hand that appeared like a shawl that the woman had upon her neck; I saw the witness Gibbs running after him, I pursued him down Conduit street, I overtook him in Maddox street; I asked him what he had done with the shawl that he had in his hand, he said if you will go into that house we will have something to drink, and I will tell you all about it; I told him I would not; he immediately darted across the street and ran up Swallow street into Hanover street, Hanover square, crossed Hanover street to the door of Hanover square room; there he took the shawl from his hat and threw it down that area; he ran across Hanover square, turned up Prince's street, there I lost sight of him; I did not see any more of him till I saw him in the hands of Mr. Plank, the constable; I stopped at the door of Hanover room, and the man brought me the shawl out of the area, and I delivered it to Mr. Plank.</p>
               <p>Plank. I have got the shawl and handkerchief; I received the shawl from the witness Richardson. The handkerchief was thrown down the area at the corner of Prince's street, Hanover square; I saw it there; I asked Mr. Elliot's servant to bring it me; he did.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The woman and me were drinking at the Green Dragon in Swallow street, I had a new pair of stockings in my hat on the bench; I went out to make water; while I was gone she ran away with the stockings; they cost me two shillings and nine pence; the people in the house told me to run and fetch her back; I ran and overtook her in the street; I catched my hand upon her shoulder, and the shawl came off in my hand; she drawed a mob of people around me; I set off and run down the street, I threw the shawl down the area; the people ran after me, I was very much in liquor: the constable met me in the street and took me to the office. The woman had been asking me to go home with her before; I was to give her half a crown to stay all night.</p>
               <p>Plank. I think it my duty to state that the woman was in liquor at the time; I do not think she hardly knew what she was doing of.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you state that in your examination - A. I thought you would have asked me; it did not strike me till I got down.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. You have heard the account that the prisoner has given - how much of that account is true - A. It is a false account; I am a married woman. I have had ten children. I had only part of one pot of beer that afternoon, that was not with him; he came in the house just as I was going out.</p>

               <p>Q. That will not do, you must not shuffle with me - when did you hear he was in custody - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after he was in custody did you hear of it - A. Three or four days.</p>
               <p>Q. That was in October - your husband must know of it, because he went out of town on Tuesday, just at the time of the sessions - A. Not upon that account.</p>
               <p>Q. I did not ask upon what account - you must have heard of this in October, now we are in December; he went out of town last Tuesday, the 29th of November; these are the dates - You did not see any particular bundle given to the prisoner - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner takes loads - A. No: he takes no loads.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner - A. He is a watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us just now he was a porter, he had a knot at your house; you know that nobody in the city can take loads but a fellowship porter - A. No, I do not know, upon my honour.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called seven witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I am a labouring man; I live at No. 9, and Mrs. Price lives at No. 7. On the 16th of November, Mrs. Price came into my room; she said she had been robbed since she had been out to work in the morning, and asked me to lend her a light to go down in this cellar; she took the light and went down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with her - A. No; she went by herself; in about five minutes she cried out stop thief; I went to her assistance; I found her extended upon her back in the entry; the prisoner was making his escape out of the entry; I laid hold of him; he punched his head in my breast and shoved me across the channel; I held him and called for a light; when the light came I saw he had a coat on that belonged to Mr. Price, and a waistcoat under his arm, and a pair of Mr. Price's breeches on him likewise. The neighbours in the court came round; he seemed rather shy, because living in the neighbourhood some time back; he wished me to go into the house; I did; he asked me then to go down in the cellar to shew me where the stolen property was concealed; after I got this bundle I asked him if there was any more; he said yes; he took me to another part of the cellar; under the cellar stairs there was another bundle, and a coat lying on the top of the bundle; I took the two bundles and the coat and gave them to a neighbour, and desired her to keep them till Price came home, to know whether they were his or not. Some time after he gave me these small clothes off him, and said they belonged to Price. Price came home in about a quarter of an hour; he said they were his small clothes. I gave them up to the officer.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. On the 25th of November, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came into my master's yard and asked me to go and drink with him, which I refused; he came again, the second time, and asked me the same question; I told him, no; then I saw no more of him till about three or four in the afternoon. I heard a rustling in the pit; I got up from my business where I was, I saw him going down the yard with a deal upon his back; I followed him and asked him what he was going to do with it; he said he was going to have it cut; I asked him where he was going to have it cut; he said he did not know, a person ordered him to take it away, he was going to have four cuts in it; I said, very well, you know what you are going to do. It was a fourteen feet three inch plank. At the bottom of the yard are two iron gates; when he came there, I said, I think you have carried this deal far enough, you may as well rest it here; he said, Samuel, will you go and have a glass of gin; I said I do not care, let us have something to drink; he went out of the gate and I at the back of him; he wanted to go over to the Falstaffe liquor shop; I said I did not like to go there, I did not like the people nor the stuff they sold, if he would go to the Pigeon public house, I would go with him; I got him in the Pigeon public house, I followed after, and set my back against the door when I got him in; when he found my back against the door he thought himself taken, he rather tustled with me to get out; I told him it was of no use to try to get out, I was upon my guard, he should not go; he tried the second time; I collared him and shoved him against the chain; we had two or three ups and downs. There were five or six people in the tap room, they did not assist me. I kept my hold till Tipper, the officer, came and took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Ponder's sawyer, the top one, asked me to help to take the deals home with him; I said I did not care; he said they lay along side of the pit; I went and brought one out and laid it in the street; he told me to go and take the others out; I went into the yard; Mr. Ponder's and Mr. Beazeley's men were there; I took out the plank; this man followed me; when I found myself in an error I was surprised, I did not know what I did; I might ask him to have some gin.</p>
               <p>Q. to Ponder. Had this man any right in your yard - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body any right to take any deals out of your yard - A. No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

It struck me that I would go out of the room to the waiter and get a constable, if I saw any suspicious characters I would have them taken up. While I was requesting the waiter to get me a constable; Mr. Bell, the high constable, came up, and said he was sufficient; a person came up to me; from his information I went to the mistress of the tap; I enquired if a snuff box had been left with her; she said, yes; I looked at it and desired that the person might be taken in custody if he came after the box; after I had been in the room a short time, a messenger came and said the gentleman had come for the box; I enquired of the prisoner if the box was his; his answer was, that he found it; I asked him where; he said near the sheriff's carriage as he was going into the room; I told him I was robbed of it, I did not know where he might find it.

The sheriff's footman came in, and he set in the room a quarter of an hour after the sheriff came in; he asked me if I had any snuff; I told him I had none; he asked me the favour to get him half an ounce, he gave me the box to put the snuff in, and said he would call for it; then he went away.

               <p>A.Then you entered the Park from Spring gardens - A. I entered from Charing cross.</p>
               <p>Q. That is Spring gardens - A. Yes, and I went out at the Palace. When I entered the Park I think it was ten minutes to a quarter of an hour after ten; I proceeded through the Park.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The gate is locked at ten, therefore it could not be after ten.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You proceeded through the Park - A. Yes; I proceeded leisurely through the Park, and took a seat on a bench, situated between the avenue leading into Pall Mall and the stable yard. There were other persons sitting on the bench.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it - A. A fine moon light night, warm and remarkably clear. After being seated a few minutes the prisoner came to the same bench; the other persons seated were in conversation, they talked on subjects of the day, and volunteers were spoken of; the other persons soon left the bench; the prisoner remained, he said he was a member of a volunteer corps; he belonged to Marybone corps; in conversation he familiarly tapped me on the shoulder, he said he should like to see me at his house, as he was a butler in a gentleman's family near Manchester square; that he had the keys of the wine, and could give me a glass of good wine, if I would call on him; I said certainly not; he added that many respectable men came to see him; that as to my appearance looking like a gentleman, I might conceal my watch chain and seals in order that the persons who let me in, might not make any particular observation; he then invited me to take a walk with him; I immediately suspected some improper intention on the part of prisoner, and fearing that he might follow me in the street, I appeared to acquiesce; I desired him to walk forward toward Buckingham house with hope that I might elude him; the prisoner would only advance at a short distance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go on towards Buckingham house - A. He did go on, and I followed him; being moonlight the prisoner always had me in view; I proceeded on some time, the prisoner stopped till I approached him; I then, when arrived at Buckingham house, desired him to go forward, to I believe it is called Constitution hill; a road that leads towards Hyde Park corner; he remained at a very short distance from me.</p>
               <p>Q. He did advance but kept a short distance before you - A. Yes; I met a man cominging from Hyde Park gate; I enquired of the man.</p>
               <p>Q. If the prisoner did not hear what past between you and that man we must not hear it - I believe you spoke to the man - A. Yes; I walked on; the prisoner came up to me seeing, me stop to speak to the man.</p>
               <p>Q. On seeing you speak to the man he turned back again - A. Yes. I directed the prisoner to go forward some distance and that I would come to him; when we were at the distance of about thirty yards I crossed over the road under the shade of a row of trees, thinking to elude the prisoner in the shade and to return back to the Park unobserved by him. A soldier entered from Hyde park gate, came down the road near to the spot where I was; I proceeded on towards him, towards St. James's Park.</p>
               <p>COURT. You returned back again - A. I returned back a short distance before the soldier; the prisoner observed me, turned round and followed at some distance nearly opposite to Buckingham house; the soldier went towards Buckingham gate; the prisoner then came up to me and said shall we retire, and wished me to take a hackney coach with him; I swore at him and threatened to knock him down if he did not leave me; he said he could not part with me so soon, that as I was a nice man, he should like to have connexion with me; I renewed my threat, when he seized me by the arm, and said by virtue of his office, at the same time producing something from under his coat that had the appearance of a constable's silver staff; he said his name was young Sayers, an officer of the police, Bow street; he said if I made any resistance he should whistle and bring other constables to his assistance; if I would not accompany him quietly he would lodge me in the watch-house, in charge of an intention of committing an unnatural crime, and desired to know my address; he said he had some knowledge of my person, that he had seen me on guard at St. James's, that he was sure I was an officer in the Guards. He said if I would behave generously the business should be hushed up, and insisted in knowing who I was and where I resided; I had no hesitation to inform him my residence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Where was that - A. At the stable yard. I told him my residence was in Cleveland court, St. James's.</p>
               <p>COURT. That you told him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. In what state of mind were you in at that time - A. I was much agitated at the charge of a crime of such a nature.</p>
               <p>Q. When you informed him of your residence in Cleveland court, what then - A. He insisted upon having proof that I lived there; I took him to my apartment.</p>
               <p>Q. Your wife, I believe, was not at home - A. My wife was in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him your name and your employment - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q.After you got to your apartment was any thing said - A. I was going to observe.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did he go up to your apartment - A. Yes; he went into the house into my own apartment, into the room adjoining my bed room; he then enquired what I could do for him to avoid the unpleasant exposure which would have been the consequence of his giving me in charge; I replied, I did not know what he would require; the prisoner said he must have fifty pound; I stated that I had no such sum, and that he might do with me as he pleased; he then demanded<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300023"/>what I could do for him, and he lowered his demand from fifty to thirty, and twenty, and to ten pound, and persisted that if I did not comply he would take me away and lodge me in the watchhouse for the night; I told him I had not so much money by me; he observed that I could get money in the neighbourhood, he had no doubt I could procure it of the proprietor of the Queen's larder, St. James's tavern, called the Queen's larder, to which I objected; he then noticed my watch chain, and seals, these that I now wear, and that I might obtain money on my watch, chain, and seals; I observed at that late hour it would be very unlikely I should succeed; but as I knew Mr. Alder's in Berwick street I would go and try to obtain ten pound; I went Previous to my going out with the prisoner he required something to drink; he asked if I could give him some liquor; I did give him brandy, I believe; it was spirits; he drank two glasses; there was a Morocco liquor stand with four bottles; he took two glasses of some liquor, it might be mixed. I then went out with him and went towards Berwick street; at the top of St. James's street, Piccadilly, I took a coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he get in with you - A. Yes; I drove to Berwick street, to the house or near the house of Mr. Alders'; on my enquiry at Mr. Alders', I was told that he was gone to bed.</p>


               <p>Q. Did you call Mr. Alders up - A. I did; he got up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you obtain a ten pound bank note in exchange for your watch - A. I did; the prisoner was waiting my return.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you deposit your watch, and watch chain, and seals - A. Yes. When I came out I found the prisoner near the door; he demanded if I had succeeded in obtaining the money, and how much I had got; I told him that I had got ten pound; he said that I might have asked for twenty pound. He then said it was an unpleasant business, he took the ten pound note of me, I gave it to him; he said I should hear no more of it, but at that moment he enquired if I had any more cash about me; I had a half guinea, which he demanded.</p>
               <p>Q. You told him you had only half a guinea - A. Yes; he demanded that; I begged him not to take it from me; he renewed his threats, that if I did not give it he would call the watchman to assist him; I complied and gave him the half guinea. He then said the business should be buried in oblivion, and that I should hear no more of it. He then left me; I returned home.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Now, Mr. Butter, what did you part with the bank note and the half guinea for - A. Because I felt the dread of an accusation of that sort, and to get rid of a charge which my mind recoiled at, the reflection of which would have placed me, I considered, in the situation of a criminal - which would have exposed me to a public bar.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you act under that fear, and under that fear alone - A.Under that fear only.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day was the prisoner apprehended - A. He was apprehended on the 31st of October.</p>
               <p>Q. A fortnight before that, had he called upon you - A. He called upon me on Thursday, the 13th of October, while I was dining with my wife and family, he then came to my apartment and enquired of my servant for me; I was called down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he then make any demand of money from you - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. How much - A. Two guineas. He told me he was going to Portsmouth, that he was dismissed from the police office, in consequence of his being off duty on the night of the 8th of August, not having accounted for his absence; I desired that he would leave the house, that I would not give him a single shilling. He was loud, and threatened me with abusive language, that he would expose me. I insisted upon his leaving me; I took him by the arm to the door and pushed him out.</p>
               <p>Q. After this time did you go to Bow street to make a complaint - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What day did you see him next - A. The next day that I saw him, was the day that he was taken in custody, the 31st of October. He came to me at my place of business, at Mr. Wirgman's, in St. James's street.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, I believe, you sent for an officer and secured him - A. I did, sir.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. The prisoner desires me to ask a question of you, whether you do not know the usual hour the gates are locked - A. I know the hour, I believe the gates are locked at ten o'clock, but not always correct to a moment.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been quite a stranger to him - A. Entirely. I had never seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. You reside in Cleveland court - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. You say when you sat upon the seat there were a number of persons in conversation - did you give them any conversation - A. I believe there were two others, and, I believe, I joined in the conversation; who they were I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. When he proposed to you to take a walk after these persons went away, you went; you felt a little alarmed, and suspected that all was not right - you were desirious to get away - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You desired him to walk on towards the Queen's house - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. This was in the middle of summer - in August - at that time there was a great many people walking in the Park and soldiers upon guard - A. There were centinels, I believe, upon guard.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not communicate your alarm to any person - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you did not require the assistance of any of them to make your escape from the prisoner - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he walked on towards Constitution hill, towards Hyde park - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he turned back when you went in the shade - what do you mean by the made - A. The shade of the trees in the Park; the moon being up, and the trees afforded a shade; I did not go among the trees, I went into the shade caused by the trees.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time no threat had been made against you - A. None, sir.</p>
               <p>Q.You suspected that he meaned to rob you, I suppose - A. I suspected some improper intention.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not communicate it to some of the people that were walking there - A. I acted under the impulse of the moment, at that time expecting he would not leave me; he was close to my elbow.</p>
               <p>Q. He was before you, you said some yards - A. At times.</p>
               <p>Q. After that he said he was an officer and made<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300024"/>this charge - A. After that.</p>
               <p>Q. After some time you arrived at your own house - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said you were a lodger - A. I am a lodger.</p>

               <p>Q. Is the house kept by a man or a woman - A. The house is kept by a woman.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not suppose you keep a man servant - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any enquiry afterwards to know whether captain Marsdon was there - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You left the house and went for the purpose of getting ten pounds - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. The watch was set at this time - A. Certainly at that hour.</p>
               <p>Q. And at that hour there were several coaches on the stand - A. There were.</p>
               <p>Q. You went in a coach to Berwick street - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate it to the pawnbroker whom you know - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor did you ask his assistance, nor the assistance of any individual - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. The man you left at a distance from the house when you went in Mr. Alder's - A. The man I left at the corner of Mr. Alder's house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you in the house - A. I imagine fifteen minutes; I waited while he got up.</p>
               <p>Q. It was quite an unusual time, and after the time the act of parliament mentions - A. It was; it was from the knowledge that he had of me that I made the request.</p>
               <p>Q. It was after that, when you returned in the street, when you gave him the ten pound note that he made a demand for the half guinea - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make use of the same threat. -</p>
               <p>COURT. At the time you gave him the half guinea did he threaten you of the same thing - A. Unless I gave him the half guinea, or unless I complied with giving him the half guinea, he would place me in the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Not precisely making use of the same terms - A. I thought so.</p>
               <p>Q. He said he would put you in the watchhouse if you did not comply - he did not make the same charge - A. I concluded so.</p>
               <p>Q. He afterwards called at your master's house - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. This is two months since - A. Near ten weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. You communicated it to no person - A. When I thought it was right to have him apprehended I communicated it to a friend.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. When he demanded the half guinea you say he did not repeat the whole language that he made use of in the Park - had he made any charge to put you in the watchhouse after that - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Bow street, you have told me before, shortly after the 13th of October, when he came to you - A. Yes, immediately after that.</p>

               <p>Q. If it had not been for that impression you would not have parted with your money - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said you parted with it under the impression that the prisoner meaned to prefer the charge against you, which he had first held out and threatened you with, and because you felt the dread of an accusation of that sort, and to get rid of that charge which he had made against you - but your expression now is, that he would immediately take you to the watchhouse - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at that moment apprehend that he would take you by force - A. I did.</p>

               <p>COURT. You got up did you - A. I did.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. You say he seemed in great agitation, you gave him a ten pound bank note, and took his watch, chain, and seals - A. I did; I gave him a ten pound bank of England note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he then quit your house - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. I take it for granted if he wanted your assistance you would most readily have given it him - A. I would most assuredly; the watchman sat at my door; Mr. Butter seemed very much agitated.</p>

            . Q. I believe you have the management of the business of Mr. Wirgman in St. James' street - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 9th of August did either of the prisoners at the bar come to you at Mr. Wirgman's - A. Coddington, the prisoner at the bar, came to me soon after nine o'clock in the morning, at the house of Mr. Wirgman, and enquired for Mr. Butler; I told him my name was Butter; he said that Sayers was waiting for me in St. James' place.</p>
               <p>Q. That is close to Mr. Wirgman's - A. Adjoining; Mr. Wirgman's is the corner house; that he wanted to see me on the business that occurred the preceding evening; I went into St. James' place, leading to Cleveland place, my residence; I there found Cannon, and not to talk in the street I took him to my apartment in Cleveland court; the prisoner Cannon stated that he had been discovered absent from his duty in the park the night before, that he was obliged to account to the other officers on duty, and who claimed a share of the ten pounds that he had received from me, and that he was also obliged to state to the other prisoner Coddington, his absence.</p>
               <p>Q. By what name did he describe the other man - A. Wilkinson; stating that the other man, Coddington, (calling him Wilkinson) was an assistant clerk to the police office, Bow street, and that they required ten pounds more of me, or that they must prefer the charge which Cannon the night before had threatened me with.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of the conversation was it at all stated what that charge was - A. No, I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I must ask you what was the charge which Cannon had made on you the night before - A. The charge the night before that Cannon made was, that he should charge me with having committed an unnatural crime. Not having ten pounds, I told them they must give me time to procure it.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you to give any compliance to their demand - A. The apprehension of the threat which Cannon had made the night before of making that criminal charge against me.</p>
               <p>Q. You told him that you had not ten pounds then - A. Yes, but I would procure it by the next morning. I made an appointment with them for the next morning, to meet them in St. James's square at nine o'clock. The prisoner Cannon asked for some liquor, which I gave them some at my own apartment; they then went away.</p>

               <p>Q. That night did either of them, or both of them, come to Mr. Wirgman's - A. At a few minutes after nine that night they came to me at Mr. Wirgman's, at the moment I had secured the door of the shop; I was left in care and possession of Mr. Wirgman's property in his absence, having that morning left town for Brighton, to spend a month or six weeks there. The prisoner, when the door was opened to him, came into the house passage, and said they were come to me again.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them spoke - A. I cannot take upon me to say, they were both together, they were come for the money I had promised them, they could not wait till the morning, as I had appointed. I had not been out in the day to my friend where I expected; I told them that I had not been out to my friend, that I had no money. They then said that they were come from Bow street, and would take me in custody; I agreed to accompany them. One of the prisoners called a coach from the stand at the corner of St. James's place; I am not sure which. I got into the coach, the prisoners followed me. One of the prisoners said to the coachman -</p>
               <p>Q. Without knowing which still - A. I think Cannon said to the coachman, you know us, drive to Bow street; the coachman proceeded to drive a few paces, when one of the prisoners, I do not know which, directed the coachman to stop; he said to me, if you will behave like a gentleman and procure the money, we will not prefer the charge against you. I promised to try my friend Mr. Smith, the silversmith, in Bruton street; the coach was directed to stop in Bond street, near the corner of Bruton street; we got there and got out. One of the prisoners paid the coach fare.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass about your paying it - A. I was asked to pay it, but I had not got any silver about me. The prisoners accompanied me to the house door of Mr. Smith, and said they would wait my coming out. I went into Mr. Smith's house, I found him at home.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of your request of him, did you receive any thing from him - A I did, a ten pound bank note.</p>
               <p>COURT. I suppose you did not tell him what it was for - A. I did not. I staid a few minutes in Mr. Smith's house, and on my return into Bruton street the prisoners were waiting for me on the opposite side of the way. I went up to them, they asked me if I had succeeded in procuring the ten pounds, which I informed them I had, and which I gave to them.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know to which - A. I cannot say; I gave it to one of them, both being together.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Why did you give it them - A. Because of the fear and dread of being placed in the situation of a criminal of that nature, and they persisted in the polg their charge against me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you think they would have done to you - A. That they would have taken me in custody and lodged me in the watchhouse. They then told me that I might make myself happy.</p>
               <p>COURT. Before you go to that, did you believe them to be Bow street officers - A. I did not conceive them to be Bow street officers, though they held out that threat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. In what state of mind were you in - A. Extremely agitated.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300026"/>Q. When you said you apprehended that they would take you to the watchhouse; by what means did you conceive they would have taken you to the watchhouse if you did not consent - A. By force.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it then under the terror of that charge, of being taken by force, and charged with that crime, that you parted with that bank note - A. It was.</p>
               <p>COURT. I would much rather the gentleman would express himself - A. My motive was, under the apprehension of being taken by the prisoner, and placed in custody on suspicion of an intention of committing the crime alledged. It was under that idea I acted at the of the moment and gave the money. The prisoners took their leave of me after giving them the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at that moment under the impulse of any bodily danger to your person - A. Not exactly, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. That, I take you right, at the time you were not under the impression of any danger to your person - A.Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You then say they took their leave of you - did they say any thing at parting - A. Nothing more than I might make myself happy, that I should hear no more of them.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that did you see either of them again - A. It was on the 13th of October that I saw Cannon.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he come to you - A. At Mr. Wirgman's house of business.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect - I am asking about your own residence - A. They came to my residence in Cleveland court (I am speaking of the prisoner Cannon) while I was at dinner; he asked for two guineas, as he was going to Portsmouth, that was to delray his expences, that he had been discharged from his situation as an officer of police, in consequences of his absence from duty in St. James's park on the 8th of August; I told him I would not give him a shilling, and desired him to leave my house; I took him by the arm and pushed him to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you immediately after this apply to the office in Bow street for advice - A. Immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he come to you next - A. The next time he came to me was the 31st of October, the same month.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of advice you then sent for Mr. Anthony - A. Yes, he came to me at Mr. Wirgman's. I sent for a police officer and detained him; Mr. Anthony came and apprehended him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. It was Coddington that came to your house in St. James's street, he called you out - A. Yes; they were both in company.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannon was the spokesman, and said if you did not give the ten pound he would make the charge that he had the night before - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. In the presence of Coddington - A. In the presence of Coddington.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the other prisoner Coddington - was he an assistant clerk, or in any ways concerned in that office - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not apprehend Coddington - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. to Butter. On the 3d of November last, did you meet with the prisoner Coddington - A. I did; I passed him in George court, Brewer street, it leads into Prince's street.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it - A. It was soon after ten in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q.After you had passed him did you turn round and recollect his face - A. I recognized that I had some knowledge of him; I paused to recollect myself, and likewise also the prisoner looked back at the moment; he stopped and looked at me and ran off; I pursued him and took him in Berwick street, and lodged him at the public office in Marlborough street.</p>
               <p>Coddington's Defence. The things that the prosecutor institutes against, I am innocent of it. In the morning I was going out to get myself shaved when he stopped me upon the charge; I went with him to Marlborough street willingly, without any officer at all. I have been seven years in his Majesty's service; I was disabled in the service of major Abercrombie.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He made no resistance, there were so many people around me. A respectable man who was nigh me, I said to him, if I require your assistance I trust you will afford it me. I had no apprehension of his getting from me. A man went for a constable for me; he was not at home; I was advised to take him to Marlborough street office. As we passed through Poland street, he said, you had better be quiet, you will only expose yourself.</p>
               <p>Cannon's Defence. My lord, I have several people who knew me years ago, that knew my character. Since I have left the India house, I have carried lottery books, and before that I had got my discharge. I was recommended to the East India company by his royal highness himself.</p>
               <p>Cannon called four witnesses to his character.</p>
               <p>Coddington called no witnesses to his character.</p>

               <p>Q. Nobody but you and the women - A. The watchman came in, but I did not give him any thing to drink; we went down a street, which I believe is Arlington street, and there I stood talking with Webb a considerable time against a door; she rumaged about me a good deal, and when I left her I came into Piccadilly, to my lodgings in Park lane; on crossing the street, by the porter's lodge, I clapped my hand to my side and missed the book; I had it in a side pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. That is another woman, neither of the prisoner - A. No; I told her to go about her business; I was robbed of my book; at the very moment there was a man passing whom I did not know at that time; I went home to my lodgings; I saw no more of them that night; the next morning I was sitting in my own room in my lodgings, there came two people to enquire for me; they told me they had found a letter that I had respecting a horse; they asked me if I had not been robbed the over night; I told them I had and of what, and that they were in a book, and a letter I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they produce any thing to you - A. They shewed me the ten pound notes and a letter that I had from lord Titchfield, respecting a horse; I cleaned myself and went along with them to Bow street; the prisoners were there; I knew

            . I am a publican, I keep the Blue Post, Bennet street, the corner of Arlington street. The prisoners all three came into my tap room about twelve o'clock and called for a shillingsworth of brandy and water; they tendered a one pound note for the payment of it; I changed that; they sent for a second shillingsworth; I sent the change, eighteen shillings; I went to the tap room myself, I found the watchman there; I told him he must go, he had no business in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the watchman there, is that the prisoner - A. Yes; he said he would go. I returned to my bar; he did not go then; I went and ordered him out a second time; before they went they had half a pint of brandy and shrub; they tendered another one pound note for it, which I refused.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who it was that tendered it - A. I think the watchman, but I am not positive: my waiter came to me, and said sir, I think them women have been robbing some man, I have seen them shoving notes down their bosom; in consequence of what the waiter said I went into the parlour, I picked up a letter, I opened it, it was not sealed, which led to a suspicion that some person had been robbed; it is the letter the first witness has been speaking of.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Is that the letter that you had - A. Yes; that is the letter I lost.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hollings. The prisoners all went out; I sent for them, saying I would change the one pound note; they all three came back; the watchman said as soon as he came into the house, I had no occasion of being in such a hurry to turn them out, they should have spent a crown or more before they had left; I told them they should spend none there, they had robbed some one, I would detain them and have them searched; they denied having robbed any one or having any money about them except a few shillings; they seemed very much frightened. The prisoner Coddington, that was just now convicted at that bar, came in with them the second time.

               <p>Prosecutor. I am perfectly sure it is my pocket book.</p>
               <p>Webb's Defence. I had been to Bond street with a gentleman, he gave me a pound note, a guinea, and half a guinea, to get me some clothes. I met this woman, I gave her something drink; I met the watchman; I had a shilling's worth of brandy and water. This gentlewoman said she had picked up some notes in Oxford street; she gave one to the watchman to get it changed. The publican said he could not give change. As for that man, I never saw him before with my eyes till I saw him at Bow street. I am as innocent as a child unborn.</p>
               <p>Worley's Defence. The notes which the runner took from me in the house I picked up in Market street, before I saw this good woman. I told her I would treat her with something if the watchman would get change for a one pound note; the landlord said he could not give change: when we came out he sent his boy after us, saying that he could his change. We went back; the officer stood for no repairs; he took them out of my bosom. As for the gentleman that came to swear against me, I never saw him till I saw him at Bow street.</p>
               <p>Abbot's Defence. I was calling eleven o'clock. I went up to the White Horse cellar to put up the shutters; these two ladies went into the public house with a man, he asked me to come and have a glass, being a cold night; I went in, I asked who was going to give me a glass; mother Worley said the gentleman has altered his mind, he will not give you one; I went out of the house and put up the shutters. I went in and asked the mistress of the White Horse cellar what time I should ring the bell, she said half past three. I went and called twelve o'clock. Going my round I saw these girls: one of them says come over, I will give you something to drink at the Blue Post; I immediately went out of my box; this girl asked me to get change, and to get something to drink, she said let it be short and sweet; she asked me to call for a shillingsworth of rum and water; I gave it her; I never set down after she gave me the note. Mr. Hollings gave me a half guinea, a seven shilling piece, and a sixpence. Mother Worley said I will have change; I told her the landlord would not give her change; I returned the note back; the landlord ordered us out the second time; I went out directly; the girls followed me. Going up Arlington street, the landlord sent after me to bring these girls back; when we came back, he said to me which of the girls gave you the first pound note; I said Poll Webb; and who gave you the second pound note, I said Worley; he said he had a good mind to keep us all prisoners, he should keep the girls prisoners and turn the watchman out to do his duty. I did my duty till past two o'clock, when the patrol took me. I walked quietly with him to the watchhouse.</p>

               <p>Abbot called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Webb and Worley called no witnesses to their character.</p>

            . On the 26th of November, about five minutes past nine in the morning, I was going to the warehouse; I saw the prisoner and two others on the opposite side of the way; I saw two of them go up the court of Smith, George and Watson; them two came out, and they all went together to the Old Change.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any thing with them - A. Nothing at that time. They went into the Old Change and turned to the left; in about half a minute I saw them all three return; the prisoner had got a knot on his shoulder; I saw him go into the gate of the court of Smith, George, and Watson; all three came out; the prisoner had a box on his knot; I walked up on the opposite side of of the way, he had got ten yards from the door or thereabouts; I went towards him and said I believed the box was not his; upon which he threw the box down and ran off; I ran after him and cried stop thief; he was taken just at the end of Newgate street; I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the box - A. The box was not removed on my return, I believe; I found the box in Watling street, in the same place.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the box - A. I did not take any particular notice; I cannot say it is.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw a box on the man's shoulder - A. I did, he threw it down.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came back you saw it in the same place - A. Yes; it was carried into Mr. Smith's house by some of Mr. Smith's men I believe.</p>
               <p>JOHN FLINN. I live with Mr. Smith as porter. I knew this box to be in the court that leads up to the house at half past eight in the morning; I did not notice it till I saw it lay in Watling street, about ten yards from my master's; I stood by it till the prisoner was brought back. I helped carry the box into the court again.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that is your box that was in your master's yard in the morning, and you saw it in Watling street afterwards - A. Yes, it is marked PN 104.</p>

I heard him say is the landlord at home; I went out of the parlour, I said what do you want; he said, I have a sack of coals, will you buy them, he said they are very good coals, you shall have them for four shillings and six pence; I said bring them up; he said he would. I had an officer in the house, I told the officer there was a man had offered me a sack of coals. In the course of three quarters of an hour Wild returned, the officer remained in the room. Wild brought a sack of coals on his back; I told him I would have nothing to do with them, I did not think he had got them honest; he said never mind, I can soon sell them. Leadbetter the officer insisted upon looking at the coals. He took him in custody.</p>

            . While Leadbetter took Wild in custody, I saw a cart at the bottom of the court, I saw Mr. Brickwood's name on the copse; it was a coal cart and three horses. I found the carman tying up the tail of the cart, his name is Pullen; I asked him if a man had not taken a sack of coals out of the cart; he denied it, made his tail rope as fast as he could, and drove his cart away; I stopped it, he drawed off on the other side of the way in the Poultry; I told him I was an officer, I should take him into custody; I took him into the compter gateway and delivered him to Leadbetter in the Poultry tap. I went down to Austin, he was sitting in the cart, I told him to come out of the cart: he said he would not leave the team; I told him I should take care of the team; he then came out of the cart, I took him up to the compter and delivered him to Leadbetter; I then took the whip and drove the team to Mr. Brickwood's wharf in Upper Thames street. The sacks and bushel measure and ladder were laying at the bottom of the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay to see the sacks counted - A. Yes; there was only eighteen. On the next day I shewed the sack that was brought into Mr. Eldridge's by Wild to the foreman, before the lord Mayor.</p>

               <p>Q. Had Mr. De Roufigney any carpet - A. Yes; it was taken up stairs in the room where the servant slept about a year ago, I saw it there and opened it; about a month ago, I dare say, I missed it. The prisoner's house was searched, I was present at the time; the prisoner was at home; she lived in Plough court, Fetter lane. We found in her lodgings some shirts, stockings, night caps, handkerchiefs, a pencil case, and a cork screw.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know to whom they respectively belonged - A. Yes. They had all been in our house; I remember the time they were missing; I many times enquired of the prisoner respecting them; she said she did not know any thing of them, nor could she think what had become of them, it was very strange, she said.</p>
               <p>Q. Among the other articles was these a shirt belonging to Mr. Stoll - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner wash for Mr. Stoll - A. No. I enquired of her three months ago if she had any such shirt; she said no.</p>

               <p>Q. And the prisoner washed for him - at what time did you make the search at the prisoner's house - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300031"/>It might be three weeks or a month ago.</p>
               <p>Q. There had been an unfortunate quarrel between Mr. Roufigney and Mrs. Penn just before you went to search the house - A. I do not know of a quarrel.</p>
               <p>Q. Now we will see whether you and I agree in the definition of a quarrel - do not you know that Mr. Roufigney owed her fifty or sixty pounds - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know positively - A. Yes, he may.</p>
               <p>Q. And she did not get her money - she threatened to arrest him - A. Yes; but I do not know that she found any difficulty in getting her money.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, she did threaten to arrest him and he then paid her - A. Yes; she had no occasion of taking these means.</p>
               <p>Q. She could not get it without - A. No, that is not right.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath had not she been applying week after week, and month after month - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. However he has paid her - A. He has paid her with money that he has not received; he has been a great friend to the woman; she agreed to give credit.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not some of it two years standing - A. I believe some of it might.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of her demanding the money in this way Mr. Roufigney was not well pleased - A. He was not well pleased.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not he very ill pleased - A. He was not pleased certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. And certainly not being pleased was not he very angry, and said he would be even with her - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps that was too coarse English, he said it In French perhaps - A. I have heard him very angry.</p>
               <p>Q. Now how many days after his being very angry was it that you went to search her house - A. I dare say three weeks or a month.</p>
               <p>Q. So long as: that can you swear it was a fortnight - A. I cannot; I can swear it was a week.</p>
               <p>Q. You found some shirts; you found some things of Mr. Dowling's and Mr. Stoll; the cork screw who did that belong to - A. Mr. Turreneau.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you find that in a box belonging to William, who formerly had lived in Mr. Roufigney's house - A. I do not know that.</p>
               <p>Q. You know you had a man of the name of William live with you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Roufigney tell you he knew that box in which the cork screw was found - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>SARAH DONNOVAN. Q. You was servant in the house of Mr. Roufigney - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect a carpet belonging to one of the rooms being placed in your room - A. Yes; I was present when it was opened and part of it was missing; I saw a piece of it at Mrs. Penn's, it laid wrong side upwards; it was the same pattern as the carpet in Mr. Roufigney's house. I said nothing to Mrs. Penn; the first time I saw it in her room; when I went the second time I found the carpet there again.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you went the first time - A. It was two or three days before she was taken up; the second time was the day after; I then said to Mrs. Penn, Mrs. Guy sent me to see if I should know this carpet; she said this is not your carpet; I said it is Mr. Roufigney's there has been a great noise made about it, and there will be more; she told me to tell Mrs. Guy that I did not know the carpet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in point of fact know the carpet - A. Yes; there was another piece of carpet laid by the door, of a different pattern; she told me to tell Mrs. Guy it was not hers.</p>

               <p>Q. What were the prisoners - A. I do not know, they did not belong to my ship; the ship cabin had two doors, one had a glass; the door of the other side at the top part was entirely stoved in, where some person<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300032"/>had entered the cabin, and had moved several articles; among the rest this copper funnel; they had taken it from the top of the stove.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know by whom it was taken down - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all you know the cabin door had been broken and some person had got in - A. Yes.</p>

I was standing at our place on shore where we put our things in, I heard a noise as if cabin windows were knocked in; I listened again, I heard the glass break again, I went alongside of the ship, I saw Summers looking over the gangway, abaft the gangway; I said to him, who are you; he said, ship keeper. What noise is that aboard of that ship. - None at all. Who is aboard besides yourself. - Nobody but the mate and his girl taking a glass of grog in the cabin. I shall come on board and see your mate; I went up the side and told him to go and call his mate, I wanted to speak to him. I saw Shay sitting on the hatchway; I asked him who he was and what business he had there; he said he made his craft fast just along side, he was coming over to go on shore; I told him to stop by me for there was something going on that should not be, he should not go till I saw the mate. I told the man that called himself ship keeper to tell the mate that I wanted to speak with him. He called Mr. 
               <persName id="t18081130-44-person453">Johnson</persName>
             a number of times. I told a young man that came with me, his name is Howell, to fetch me a candle and lanthorn; while he was gone I told the man that called himself shipkeeper that no Mr. Johnson was there. Summers came rolling from the cabin as if he was very drunk; he shoved me and Shay, and told us we had no business there; he said you rascals get out of my ship. I said I shall not go out of your ship, nor shall neither of you, I am an officer here, till I see who you are. Shay put his hand in his bosom and pulled out this marlin spike and struck at my head. I dropped down, he hit my hat and knocked me backwards; I sung out murder and stop thief as loud as I could; Shay went over the side and Summers followed as fast as he could; Summers was the hindmost and he sung out stop thief. I passed Shay and turned Summers back. People by this time were coming out of their cabins; I had Summers in sight the whole time, and caught him and gave him in charge of Howell, while I went and seeked for Shay. Shay jumped into the boats in the bason; I said to the people, take care of him, he has got a marlinspike; two or three people in the boat took the marlinspike out of his hand and shoved him on shore to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure Shay is the man - A. Yes; I knew them both perfectly well by sight before.</p>
               <p>Q. You never lost sight of Summers - A. No. And as for Shay he made his escape into the boat with the marlinspike in his hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. The night was a very light night - A. It was a dark night.</p>
               <p>Q. You perhaps can see as well in the dark as in the light - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance were you from the gangway where Summers was - A. About two yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Shay you lost sight of - A. Yes: he went in the boat, the boat was a stern of the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find any thing in the possession of either of them that belonged to the ship - A. I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you tell me whether Cavill was one of the men - A. I had not a fair sight of them; I cannot say, I saw the other men.</p>
               <p>COURT. What time was this - A. A little after six; I walked about lady Morton's house, unobserved by them, and just as it got dusk I got into the house; where Jackson, another officer, was waiting for me; Budgel came in immediately after that along with my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Jackson in the house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. What did you do when you got in the house - A. Jackson shewed me down in the lower part of the house, and we shut ourselves into a room; directly behind the door that comes from the area into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that door was fastened - A. That Jackson will tell you; I did not see myself; I had a light in a dark lanthorn; we remained there for about an hour or a little better.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mrs. Butcher in the house at this time - A. I believe not; she was gone out I believe by Jackson's directions. After remaining there for an hour or a little better, there was a loud knock at the street door; that not being answered, in a little time after there was a louder knock; every thing then was quiet for a while, as much as ten minutes, and then I heard the area gate unlock at last, as if somebody had unlocked it; then in a minute or two after the gate was unlocked I heard some person come down the area stairs; some one attempted to unlock the area door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you distinguish the voices of any one - A. Not at this time; they for a length of time tried several keys; I could hear them change the keys, take one keys and change it for another, and put them in the area door that leads into the house; they were trying with the keys for about twenty minutes, and then some one who seemed to be standing upon the top of the area steps in the street, called out to the one who was below, damn you send it in; the one below answered, then hand me down the jemmy.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a slang phrase for an iron crow - A. It is one of the phrases that they have for it among many others. Somebody then came down the area steps; I heard the crow put it into the door and they began to wrench at it from without.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door at last forced - A. Yes, after some trouble.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then they began to wrench the door - A. Yes; the door then began to crack very loud, and a bell that was behind it rang, upon which they stopped a little; they then gave several other heavy wrenches, upon which the door burst and flew open. As soon as the bell was quiet they came into the passage, and one that came in called out to the others it is all right.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you observe whose voice it was - A. I cannot undertake to swear positively; I knew Starkey very well at that time, I do think it was him; I thought so then, and do now. I knew his voice, I do not swear positively.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. You knew Starkey very well before that - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you tell how many persons entered the house - A. As near as I could judge four; they said to each other, now go on and get a light; I heard them all go up stairs and walk about over my head; I had pulled my boots off before that, as any noise over the house was heard all about; I stood so very near where they were breaking in that as soon as I heard them up stairs, I went up after them; the light I had, I found from the heat of the lanthorn had melted away, they being so long getting in, was quite out. As soon as I got into the hall up stairs, I saw a light in the back parlour; it is a very large parlour, half as big as this court; I immediately ran into the room, I saw three men in one corner of the room, the further corner from me, and one near the fire place, whom I instantly seized hold of by the collar.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that - A. I cannot tell whether it was any of the prisoners at the bar; there was plenty of light, but the moment I entered the room, the moment I seized him, the light went out; there were two lights, I think; there was a good deal of light; I held this man and said something to him to stand still that he would be shot, or something of that; instead of which he pulled from me trying to get to the other men, I suppose for a second; he struck me on the beak, he put both his hands against my breast and drove me very forcibly away; I only had hold of him with my left hand, and I had my cutlass in my right hand; so with his forcing in this way he drove me towards the place where I had seen the other prisoners; there I heard a sound as I thought of an iron crow striking against the wainscoat close by me; I suspected that they were striking at me in the dark, I trusted to my judgment; upon which I drew one of my pocket pistols and fired at the place where I heard the noise; I called out to the other officers to make haste and get a light; I followed them up afterwards by the light that come into a place about as big as this place where I now stand, into a little passage; I afterwards found, though I did not know then, there were four of them and me in this little place. I was the outside one; I laid hold of some one and they pushed me out of the passage into the room again; there were iron shutters as I afterwards found; I was in the dark, I could not find my way after them; I heard a door break open; at that instant Jackson, or some of the other officers, brought me a light; I then saw which way they went; I followed them, and found that they had broke out at the back of the house, on the leads of the kitchen, the platform that covers the kitchen. As soon as I got there with the light, I saw the prisoner Starkey on the wall; I saw him on the coping of the back office; there is a short side wall that adjoins the dwelling house to the back office; he had got up from the yard, he was just rising upon his knee upon the back office; there was another man on the side wall; he had a coat on such as Cavill has on now, but I did not see him so as to speak to his person; I saw that they were escaping into Park lane, I immediately ran round to there.</p>
               <p>COURT. These part of the premises adjoin Park<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300034"/>lane - A. They go into Park lane. When I got round into Park lane I found the prisoner Starkey sitting on the bank on the foot path; there is a bank there that passes under the wall; I thought at first he had been shot, and said to him, Starkey, have you been shot.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew him very well - A. I knew him very well; I said, Starkey, what have you been shot; he said, that is not my name.</p>
               <p>Q. The man that you saw, had his name been Starkey - A. Yes, but he is commonly called Atkins as well as Starkey; I suppose that is what he meaned by saying his name was not Starkey; he said, no, I am not shot, my leg is broke.</p>
               <p>Q. He was then sitting down - A. Yes. I asked him how that happened: he said, as he was passing along under the wall a gentleman had jumped off it upon him and broke his leg, and ran away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Are you sure that was the man who was upon the wall, who was upon the platform adjoining the house - A. I have no doubt of it. The man I saw in Park lane I had seen on the coping, on his knee, rising.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then take him in custody - A. I did. There was another officer, Budgel, with me, I desired him to take him down Park lane; I believe Budgell ran up Park lane with me; he and some of the people took him back to the house; I found none of them besides; I returned to the house where they had carried Starkey; I went to the back premises then where these things had happened, upon the platform, there I found this iron crow just under the place where I saw Starkey going over the top of the wall, and half a dozen skeleton keys. I found a piece of green wax taper in the back parlour where I had seen the men; and on the leads I found a piece of cotton candle. I saw a great quantity of blood in the passage, and the ball of the pistol sticking in the door among the iron work, and a man's hat lying in the blood. I searched all the back premises to see if I could find any body that had been wounded. It was so very dark that we could not see any thing; there are trees planted at the back of the house; I could not see any one. They had sent somebody with Starkey to the watchhouse and to the infirmary to have his leg set; the watchhouse and infirmary is part of the house altogether. As soon as I saw the house was taken care of I went to the watchhouse myself; I had not been there but a few minutes before some other person brought in Lasper, and we stripped him immediately.</p>
               <p>COURT. Had you ever seen him before - A. I saw him in Park lane, but I did not see him in the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. In what state was Lasper when he was brought in - A. He had been shot through the thick part of the left arm; I took him to the infirmary likewise to be taken care of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was O'Brien the man that brought Laspar to the watchhouse - A. He was; his name is Owen O'Brien. They were secured. The next morning I went to see the house by day light. When I went into the back of the house I saw that the person who had been wounded in the room, had ran, after the door had been opened, to that part of the wall where I saw Starkey on; he did not get up there.</p>
               <p>Q. That you traced by the blood - A. Yes, by the blood; he had gone from that corner to the other corner of the yard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Towards Park lane do you mean - A. No; to the other side of the yard, to a flew: it seemed to me to be a flew that runs from nothing at the bottom to the upper part of the wall; he got up there and jumped over into the next garden; there, from the quantity of blood there was, he seemed to have stopped a short time; from there he had gone on to the leads of the office of the next house, and from there along the spiked wall, to within a few yards of South street in Park lane.</p>
               <p>COURT. This you traced by the blood - A. Yes, by the blood; it was not in drops but in a sort of a stream almost all the way. I tried these skeleton keys to see if they would unlock any part of the house, and this skeleton key unlocked the area gate, and none of the others would unlock the area door. Then I matched the crow to the breaks on the door, and it so completely matched as to enable me to say that crow broke open the door.</p>
               <p>COURT. You are sure that it was the crow that wrenched open the door - A. I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was Cavill apprehended - A. Understanding that Cavill was one of the men that was there, I left information at Bow street, and the other officers, that if they saw such a man he should be apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen Cavill before - A. I had not. I had seen such a man with such a coat on, but not so as to enable me to speak to him. By my information at Bow street he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he wounded at all - A. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Smith. You are an officer of Marlborough street - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. You know in this case there is a reward - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there is a large reward for three persons - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. You was about this house some time before - A. I was, the night before, watching about the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it from any information you received - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. You understood a robbery was to be committed - A. If the information I received was correct there could be no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q.You had an information - you went in the house expecting that a robbery would be committed - A. I certainly did.</p>

               <p>Q. You knew what was to take place - A That I could not know; I expected that they would attempt to break open the house, but I could not tell what would take place.</p>
               <p>Q. The servant was sent out of the house - A. That I understood was the case; but not by me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the house was entirely in the possession of yourself and your brother officers - A. Entirely.</p>
               <p>Q. You said that you saw some persons about there the night before, but you do not know that either of them were any of the prisoners - A. No, not the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went into the house you say you saw two of the prisoners in Park lane - A. I did.</p>
               <p>COURT. Which of the two prisoners did you see in Park lane - A. Starkey and Lasper and three others, but I had not the sight of their faces so as to know them.</p>
               <p>Q. Park lane is a place pretty well frequented - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300035"/>Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing extraordinary in them being together there - A. No, certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. They were some time breaking in - the persons who got in - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. You went up with a light - A. I had no light.</p>
               <p>Q. The first opportunity you had of seeing them was when you got in the large parlour - A. That was the first time, then I did not distinguish any of them; the light was at that instant out.</p>
               <p>Q. And during the whole time they were in the parlour together with you, you had no opportunity of distinguishing their persons - A. Not any; they said nothing, so that I had no opportunity of knowing their voices.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you could not speak to their persons nor their voices at that time - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. The men got away at the back of the house - A. Yes; in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw a man on the coping - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. It was dark then - A. No; I had a candle alight then. I was about as far from him, or a little further, than from to you.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a common candle, it did not throw a large glare of light like a dark lanthorn - A. Certainly not; I had a view of him for a second, only as soon as he could get from his knee.</p>
               <p>Q. Excepting the light of this small candle it was very dark - A. As dark as could be, the moon had not got up above the houses.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were in the parlour with the light they were near to you at that time - A. No, they were some distance.</p>
               <p>Q. There was an instant when you was in the room when there was a light - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was but an instant that you saw a person getting over, which you thought was Starkey - A. A very short time.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards went round Park lane, there you saw Starkey - A. Yes; there I saw Starkey.</p>
               <p>Q. You accosted him by the name of Starkey, he said that was not his name - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know he goes by the name of Atkins - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the reason you said before that he said his name was not Starkey - A. He knew me very well, he could not go and tell me his name was not Starkey only for that reason.</p>
               <p>Q. He said some gentleman had jumped off the wall and broke his leg - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, the persons who had got away had jumped off that wall - A. No doubt of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of lady Morton's house with respect to the furniture - A. There was a great deal there I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not in a state for the reception of the family - A. Certainly not; all the carpets were folded up; the house was not ready for the family.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, the servant was the only person there before you went there - A. As far as I know.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time these persons broke in you were the only persons in possession of the house - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. On the day before the robbery you could not identify the persons that were standing about the house - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. But on the evening of the robbery you could - A. I did; I saw five persons standing at the corner of Park lane by the post, in conversation, as I was passing on to lady Morton's house, and two of these five were Starkey and Lasper.</p>
               <p>Q. The state of lady Morton's house was as the house of any lady or gentleman would be when they are absent - A. Yes. This is the catch and the lock of the door that was broken off.</p>

               <p>Q. You went on the 3d and 4th of October in company with Foy - A. Yes. On the 3d we saw nobody that night, we went all about the street. On the 4th, at half past twelve at night, we were facing lady Morton's house, we saw five men come up towards the area gate; I stopped there; and three went to the front door and then they walked away; when the watch and the patrol were coming down the street they separated, some went one way and some another, and after waiting in the house till about two o'clock I went out to speak to the watchmen, and they said they had seen five suspicious characters.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of these five men you had seen that night - A. I did not know them then; I had known Starkey many years.</p>
               <p>Q. When next did you go to lady Morton's house - A. About a quarter before six in the evening on the 5th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any body in your way there - A. I did not, I went to lady Morton's house, and I told the servant that I was an officer of Marlborough street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think it necessary to advise her to go out of the house - A. After that.</p>
               <p>COURT. You went into the house did not you - A. Yes, I did. I saw her lock the door in Park lane first and take care of the key.</p>
               <p>Q. You fastened all the outside doors - A. Yes. I went up stairs when she was in the house, there came a knock at the door; I did not hear the name that was asked for, I retired because I would not be seen; Mrs. Butcher went to the door; for half an hour after this she could not go out, nor could I get the other constables in, because they were about the street then.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon, Jackson, after you came in did Mrs. Butcher go out - A. About half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What time might it be when she left the house - A. Near seven.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did Foy come in - A. Foy and all the officers came in before she went out; Foy was the first, then Budgell and

            . We all went down stairs into a room at the front of the house adjoining the area; there we waited some time before we heard any thing, and after some time came a knock at the door; after that, some time, came a louder knock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body go to the door - A. Nobody went to the door. Then some time after they knocked harder, and after waiting some time I heard a key go into the area gate; they opened it very easy, they waited some time and came down into the area, they tried several keys for some length of time, and none of the keys appeared to open the area door; we plainly heard somebody say send it in or force it in, or something of that sort. One said, hand down the jemmy. They then made a violent force at the door, the bell that was affixed to the door<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300036"/>very loud; they waited some time before they tried the door again; then the next try the door flew open with force, the bell rang violently again; after that one of them says, come in it is all right.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say how many persons entered - A. No; by their feet and their voices there appeared to be three or four; they said go on, get a light; we were without our shoes. Then Foy and the rest of us went up stairs, we all went up in the dark; Foy went first. When I was in the hall I could perceive the light; before I got into the parlour door the light was quite out; then I fixed myself in the door way leading from the parlour into the hall to prevent any of them from returning back; there I continued till the light appeared at the back of the house. I could not tell what part they were in. Then I followed Foy into the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. You followed where the light appeared - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time you saw Foy - A. I did. I saw one of the prisoners just rising off the coping: it was in a direction where Starkey lay; I could not tell Starkey at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw a man - A. I saw a man just rising from the roof of the back office facing Park lane.</p>
               <p>COURT. He was rising from where - A. From the leads; he got up upon the wall, he was upon his knee when I saw him, and he ran straight forward, he jumped over the spiked wall to the place where Starkey was found.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the wall next Park lane - A. Yes. Then Foy and Budgell ran round; in the passage that leads to the yard, inside of the house, there was a hat laying among the blood. I went into the house to fasten the street door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you follow the track of that blood - A. Afterwards I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how that blood came there - A. I suppose Foy wounded some of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. While you were at the door to prevent any of them from returning, did you hear any sound of a pistol - A. That was before I came there; there were two pistols fired in the yard; one in a direction for Starkey.</p>
               <p>COURT. When was it you saw these two pistols fired - A. When we got in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. One in a direction for Starkey you said - A. Yes, in a straight line in the direction where he run; the other more to the left; that is all I saw of them then, till Starkey was brought round.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this was it before Starkey was brought down - A. In about two minutes he was brought down. Foy and Budgell went round, and they with other persons brought him round into the hall.</p>
               <p>Q.What condition was he in - A. His leg was broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you able to say when he was brought in that he was the same man that you saw on the platform - A. I saw not his face then; I have no doubt but he was the same man that went in that direction, but I will not say he is the man. Then he was taken to the infirmary in Mount street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. The watchhouse and infirmary join together - A. Yes. In returning from the house, up Mount street I met Lasper, being brought to the infirmary with his arm bleeding, in the custody of O'Brien and another; when he was brought in the watchhouse I searched him, to see if he had any thing about him; I found nothing but a knife and a pair of scissars.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in company with Foy when he compared the keys with the door - A. I do not recollect that I was. I saw the crow compared.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go the next morning to the house - A. We went and examined the place, and we traced the blood round the garden.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Smith. You know there is a reward - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. You went with an expectation that a robbery was to be committed - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw some persons lurking about the house - you did not take the persons up who were lurking about the house - A I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not quite so good a thing taking up suspicious persons lurking about the house - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q.You, the officers, were the only persons in the house at the time when they came in - A. We were.</p>
               <p>Q. When the persons were in the house you did not see any of them - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. The only opportunity you had of seeing any person was in the yard - A. Not in the yard; upon the wall, with their back towards the houses.</p>
               <p>Q. The wall is some little distance from the house - A. Not a great distance.</p>
               <p>Q. You went in the yard and saw some person upon the wall - a pistol was fired at that person, whoever that person was, in a direction to that person - whether it hit him you cannot say - A Yes, I can; it was about four inches below where that person was. I picked the ball up.</p>

               <p>Q. Another pistol was fired - A. That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me two pistols were fired, one against the man on the wall and the other to the left; now take care, you have accounted for one, by saying one missed - whether the man upon the wall was Starkey you cannot say - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not there when Foy took out the ball in the parlour - A. I believe the ball is in the door or window shutter now.</p>
               <p>Q. Starkey is the man that has got his leg broke - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Starkey was not shot - A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see Starkey, or Lasper, or the other person there - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say who the person were - A. I cannot say, I do not know.</p>

               <p>Q. What time in the evening did you go there - A. It might be six o'clock, as near as possible.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any persons near the house - A. Foy went a little before me; just as we come to the corner of Chapel street, I saw five men standing at the corner of Park lane in Chapel street, about fifty yards from lady Moreton's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in conversation together - A. I could not bear them; they appeared as such, they stood close together. I saw Starkey and Cavill.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain they were two of the five men you saw standing there - A. I am positive upon seeing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300037"/>them there: I gave a sign to Foy, he walked on and went to the countess of Morton's house and went in; I followed him; Cavill was behind me following of me, I do not know whether he knew me or not; I turned down South street to the left; he turned down Park street again and went on the other side of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe him do any thing - A. When he passed he looked up at the countess's house, he then went into Chapel street again; then I observed he came round a second time; he was so near to me that I was obligated to go down a mews in Chapel street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know you - A. He must have known me, because I have seen him in custody at the office; then he went round again on the opposite side of the countess's house; and then I went into the countess's house, were Foy and Jackson were; I went down with Foy and Jackson, and Foy's brother, into the room next the area.</p>
               <p>Q. We hear that the men broke in, did you see either of the men in the house so as to know their persons - A. I saw Starkey in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the yard that the back parlour led into - A. It was; the back parlour led into the yard by a door; there is a kind of a platform there; there is a kind of a washhouse in the yard; I ran out of the back parlour into the yard with a candle in my hand alight; Starkey was exactly facing the door, then, getting up the platform, he jumped off where the spikes were; he either jumped or dropped, he went towards the further wall where the spikes were; I have no doubt of it being Starkey.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the other prisoners there - A. I did not; I saw a man drop to the left, I could not say who it was; there were some trees I went round with Foy; he took Chapel street I took South street; there was not a soul passed; I found Starkey sitting with his leg up; I said Starkey, is it you; he said no; I said I am positive it is; he said my name is not Starkey.</p>

On Saturday, the 1st of October last, about eleven o'clock at night, going from the pay table into Park street just turning the corner of Chapel street, I saw four men opposite of the house that I lodge in, standing at the door of lady Steward's steps, opposite of lady Morton's house; I then passed my own door and went to the top of Park street, the corner of South street, and then I crossed the road and came down and passed the four men, who were on the top of the steps; I then saw one whom I knew, of the name of Cavill; I knew Cavill by working with him in Bridge street, Blackfriar's road; I then went down into Chapel street again, and at that time the watchman was calling past twelve o'clock. On the 4th of October I saw him at the Bleeding Hart, Drury lane; I went in there in consequence of knowing Cavill resorted to this house; there I saw Starkey, Lasper, and Cavill, and a person of the name of 
               <persName id="t18081130-45-person474">Jack</persName>
             the Baker.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite certain that they were the men you saw there - A. I am; they were in company together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any conversation pass between them - A. Yes; I heard them appoint the time that they were to meet, this Cavill did.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did he say - A. This was about six o'clock in the evening, he did not say where he was to meet; they were to meet at nine o'clock on that evening, the Tuesday evening, and they were to do the trick at eleven o'clock; this was on the 4th.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand them it was to be eleven that night - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smith. Do not repeat what you understood, but what they said - A. They said they were to meet at nine o'clock and do the trick at eleven o'clock that evening; I then proceeded immediately to Marlborough street and gave information; I acquainted one of the officers with it, and I told him to be at my place by nine or ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You apprised the officers, did they come to your house that night - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they watch in your house - A. Yes; I put them in the front parlour of the house that I lodged in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you remain watching with them - A. I remained in the parlour with the officers. We stopped in the parlour till about half past twelve; there came five men up to lady Morton's door; four of them went up to the steps of the door; Cavill then crossed away and left them, and came under our window where we were, on the opposite side of the way, to watch them; Cavill was smoking a pipe.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of distinguishing that it was the prisoner Cavill - A. I knew his face perfectly well; at the time he had a red waistcoat on. Then the watchman was coming his half hour, calling half an hour after twelve o'clock; they all dispersed, I saw no more of them that evening. On Wednesday the 5th I went to the Bleeding Hart again; I saw Cavill there, Lasper, Starkey, and 
               <persName id="t18081130-45-person475">Jack</persName>
             the Baker.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this - A. Between one and two in the afternoon; Cavill then said I will go and see after so and so, see if the tools are all ready; that is the expression he used; he came back again: I remained there till he returned: he went out and came back again in half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Lasper, Starkey, and 
               <persName id="t18081130-45-person476">Jack</persName>
             the Baker remain there - A. Yes; they were in the house when he returned; he said it was all right, we are to meet at five o'clock, and I will be down to the house by six o'clock. I then came down to Marlborough street again, and left them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said about the house they were to go to - A. To lady Morton's, they mentioned the number, they said 228, Park street.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the number of lady Morton's house - A. I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them was it that said this - A. Cavill. Then I went away; I came from Marlborough street and acquainted the young woman of the house of it. I stopped in the house with her till the officers came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any knock at the door come while you were in the house - A. Yes; about twenty minutes before six, as near as I can say, while I was at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Who answered the door - A. The young woman. I went up to the door and opened the door.</p>
               <p>Q. When you opened the door who did you see - A. I saw Lasper come up to the door; he asked if general Douglas lived there; the young woman answered no, no such person lived there. This Cavill was then standing behind him upon the pavement; only Lasper was on the steps; Cavill was on the foot path.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner Cavill - A. I am sure of it, because I saw him between the hinges of the door, I knew him before; they then went away and the door was shut. This was between five and six o'clock on the 5th of October. In a short time afterwards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300039"/>I went out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me when next you saw the prisoner Cavill - A. When I went out of the house and came round South street, I saw the five men together. On the same evening, the 5th of October, I saw them in South street.</p>
               <p>Q. How near to lady Morton's house - A. Just about three houses off.</p>
               <p>Q. Was either of the men at the bar there at that time - A. Yes, all three.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do upon this - A. I then kept back of one side till an opportunity suited; I kept on the watch; I saw Starkey and Lasper go to the gate, and Starkey opened the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you near enough to see what he opened it with - A. I could not see that; I saw him open it with some kind of instrument, it rattled. After he had opened it some persons came past and they went away towards Chapel street.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did they come back - A. They were a considerable time; people came backwards and forwards; I believe it might be half an hour. Starkey and Lasper went down the area steps, and another person with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Starkey and Lasper you are certain of - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the other person - A. Jem Britten his name is, he is one of the five. Cavill then stood at the bottom of Chapel street along with

             the Baker, and after some considerable time, when I supposed they had got the door open, one of them said it is all right, come along.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them was it - A. I do not know, it was dusky. Then immediately Cavill left 
               <persName id="t18081130-45-person478">Jack</persName>
             the Baker and went down the area steps.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep your eye upon the area steps all the time - A. Yes. 
               <persName id="t18081130-45-person479">Jack</persName>
             the Baker went into Park lane at the back of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Cavill return - A. No; I waited at the front of the house till I heard the report of the pistol, and till Mr. Foy came out; when Foy came out

On the morning of the 27th, from information of my servant, I discovered that the bars of the window of the larder had been broken, and that the wirework of the window inside was forced open; the bars were the external security.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300041"/>Q. Describe the situation of the larder with reference to the house - A. The larder is not under the roof of the house, the situation of the larder is beyond the wood house; the wood house is between the larder and the passage, they all adjoin; you go through a covered passage, by the side of the wood house, to the larder, and the larder adjoins the wood house; the roofs are connected.</p>
               <p>Q. But the roofs of the wood house and the larder are not connected - A. No; but the wall of the house is the support of one side of the roof of the passage, and on the farther end of the passage is the wood house; on the opposite side there is a small yard; on one side is the house, on the other is the wood house, and on the opposite side is the larder.</p>
               <p>COURT. Going out of the house you go into the passage - A. No, we go into a small yard, and directly opposite the door that goes to the servants hall is the larder: in the yard, on turning to the left, you go into a passage, and on the right hand of that passage is the wood house, and on the left hand is the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How does the larder stand with respect to the wood house - A. The corner of the larder is joined to the corner of the wood house, and the wood house adjoins the dwelling house, and they all make a fence to the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. It is all completely your house - A. It is.</p>

Yes, I had fastened it up myself at nine o'clock that night, I locked the larder door and hung the key up in the kitchen; I went to the larder the next morning by seven o'clock; I found the key where I had left it the over night.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state was the larder on that morning - A. The window had been broken open and a considerable quantity of meat had been taken away. There was a flitch of bacon and two hams, and one pig's face, which I had cut in two, and another half of a face, which was cut in a different way, a round of beef, an aitchbone of beef, a clod of beef, and some cheese and butter; they were all taken out of the larder.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that all these things that you have named were in the larder at the time you made it secure - A. I am confident of it; I informed the butler, and my master was informed of it.</p>

After I secured the prisoner I took the meat to a man at the next house, his name is Martin. When the prisoner was apprehended he owned he did it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the prisoner, or give him any reason to believe, it would be the better or the worse for him if he confessed - A. I did. I fetched him out of the road; he was going away; I gave him in charge. I said, now Martin, if there is any more concerned, tell us; he said, there is nobody but myself. I left the goods in Martin's house; the groom took them to the magistrate.</p>

On the 3d of November, in the evening, about half past four, Lewington and Jones were in my shop, Lewington came in to buy some ribbon; I was informed by one of the shop women that she had stolen something as she was going out of the shop door; I followed her, and while I was looking after her, the prisoner

               <p>Q. Have you got the ribbons here - A. Yes; there is eighteen yards; it is worth nine shillings; this ribbon was dropped from Lewington, this blue ribbon was found on the ground, where they stood in the passage, after they were taken up; it was the ribbon that was wound round the block, and here is the lace that passed from Jones to Spike, and found upon Spike; it is worth thirty three shillings; I had seen it in the shop on that day; Spike denied ever having it.</p>

            . I was going into a shop in Newport street; Mr. Kenyon desired me to give him assistance, as he suspected he had been robbed; in the mean time I saw a piece of ribbon lay by Lewington on the pavement. I assisted in taking them to Mr. Kenyon's house.</p>

               <p>Lewington's Defence. I made up a bonnet for a little girl, she told me to bring her a yard of five penny ribbon she gave me the fivepence for the ribbon; I told the gentlewoman I wanted a yard of fivepenny ribbon; he made answer to the woman, you serve the thread and I will serve the ribbon; in the mean time I had this ribbon in my hand, I asked the price; he said six pence; I said I have got but fivepence, I want five-penny ribbon; I went out of the shop; he came after me and said he picked up this ribbon; well, says I, I do not know how that came there, I never had such a ribbon in my hand.</p>
               <p>Jones's Defence. I was going to Cranbourn alley the same day; I bought a new pair of shoes; I went into this gentleman's shop and bought three pennyworth of ribbon, and paid him. On my going out I met this gentlewoman, I asked her the way to Cranbourn alley; I never saw her before; I turned down the court, I met another woman with a pail in her hand, I said to her is this the nearest way to Cranbourn alley. He said come back; I said go along fellow; he said I will make you suffer, I have been robbed for a twelvemonth; he said to me and these two women, if it is in my power I will hang you; he took me into his place along with these two women, up stairs in the dark, and called for a candle; he stripped me start naked, all but my shift; he found nothing about me but the yard of ribbon.</p>
               <p>Spike's Defence. He pushed us all three in together; how can he say he saw the lace fall from me, when we were all pushed in together.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what parish that is in - A. That I cannot possibly say. St. Andrew's, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the prisoner; do you know him - A. No further than seeing him at Hatton garden on the Wednesday morning, when he had my property on him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that man come to lodge at Mayo's house - A. Yes, as they informed me; on Friday evening the 18th when I came home from work I found a man in bed, in the room where I sleep.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the evening was that - A. A little after eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to bed - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go out to your work the next morning - A. A little after six.</p>
               <p>Q. Now what things had you of your own in the room where you slept - A. I had a chest.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it locked - A. Yes, I had the key myself; it was locked when I got up and went out in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look in your box - A. No; I always try the lock to see whether it is locked when I go out in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you last lock it - A. The day before in the morning, before I went out to work; I wanted something out.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all your things safe in it then - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Now tell me what things particular you had in it - A. I had nine shirts, marked RH, and two neck handkerchiefs, marked RH, two pocket and two necks.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing else - A. Yes, there were silk handkerchiefs, one marked with a figure of nine, one pocket handkerchief not marked, a two pound bank note, half a guinea, and some silver, and three broaches; I went out to my work in the morning, I returned between twelve and one in the day; I went up into my bed room, I looked at my chest, I found it broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the lock forced - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it open or shut - A. It was shut; I tried to unlock it with the key, I could not; I put my hand<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300043"/>to the lid and lifted it up; then I missed the articles.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have you missed all the things you have related - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out in the morning you left the stranger in bed, did not you - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the things again - A. It was on Saturday the 19th I missed them; I saw them again on the Wednesday following; I saw three handkerchiefs and one shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all you saw - A. Yes. The prisoner at the bar had got the shirt on; when I came to the office it was taken off him, and then I could swear to it, it had got the name taken out; when he was first taken, when I first saw it, the name was taken out; I knew it by the mark in the bosom of the shirt, it was worked with a heart, I knew it by that, by the work of that heart; I believe to the best of my knowledge it was my shirt, I knew it by the frill, and every thing; I saw it was a new shirt; the person who made the shirt is in court.</p>
               <p>Q. Now with regard to the two handkerchiefs, can you speak to them - A. Yes, one is marked with my name; the pocket handkerchief and the other is marked with J. A. No. 9; it is a silk handkerchief; and a pocket handkerchief that is not marked; I know that, having had it for three years, for a particular reason; I know it as an old acquaintance.</p>

I asked him how he came to pick the mark out that was on the Wednesday, he said he had a right to pick the mark out if he liked, it was his own. Here is a handkerchief I found on him marked with R. H.; and this waistcoat I found on the 19th; I took these from him before Trott searched him; he had them under his arm when he was first brought into the office.</p>

Yes; I thought her to be a servant there; she said they were new people in the house; I brought her the two pots of beer and the change for the dollar; she told me to go and fetch another pot, I should have the five shilling piece when I came back; when I came back with the other pot she had set one of the other pots of beer on the step, and she had run away with the change; nobody knew nothing of her; I did not see her till I saw her at the office.</p>

Gentlemen of the jury, I lay myself under your protection, trusting that you will shew me that mercy which is ever displayed by a British jury; this charge alledged against me is false; there was a woman this boy knows that took the beer in; I should wish her to come forward; it is not right that I should be sworn against by this boy; I have been five weeks in Clerkenwell prison, and since I have been in this prison, which is a week, I have not had pen and ink to write to my friends.</p>
               <p>Pigot. When I gave her the change she took the beer into the passage to a woman, and said it was ordered, they must have it; the woman said she would have nothing to do with it; she told me to go for another pot; when I came with the other pot she had set one pot of beer down and ran off; she took the other pot and the change.</p>

               <p>Q. Where is that - A. In Houndsditch; I keep a green grocer's shop: the prisoner came to the door and asked me if I wanted a nice quartern loaf for a shilling; I did not look particularly at the bread because there is a great deal of bread brought down to Rag fair and Duke's place; I thought it was stale bread; as he was, turning away with it from the door, the bread appeared to me to be new and very good; when I came to the window I observed the basket under the window; he came out of the next house, a coal shop, and put two loaves in the basket, took up the basket, baker like, and was going away; I said to him you seem to have a deal of bread, is it your own; he said no, a man at Fleet market gave it him to carry, and he was going to carry it to Rag fair, he was a baker, and the man that gave it him was behind him; I told him to look for him; he could not find him; then I took him in custody; in the basket there were six quartern loaves, a half peck, and three half quartern loaves; I told all the bakers I saw to circulate it about. Mr. Jobbings's man came; he identified the bread and basket.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 18th of November, as I was passing through Fleet market, I met a man with a basket of bread, and by his appearance he was a baker; I asked him if he could direct a stranger to where he could get employ; he told me if I would carry his basket he would satisfy me for my trouble; I being out of employ agreed to carry the basket, I thought no harm in so doing; I went into this gentleman's house and offered them for sale; he told me he did not want the loaves; I put the basket on my shoulder, he came after me and took hold of me and asked me if it was my bread; I said no, I was carrying them for a man; he asked me where the man was that belonged to the bread; I told him he was behind me. The man came along with me to Houndsditch, as soon as I was taken in custody the gentleman was off. My lord, I am innocent; therefore I leave myself to the mercy of God, and this honourable court.</p>

            . I am a boot and shoemaker, I live at No. 18, Green Arbour court, Old Bailey; I have known the prisoner better than two years. On the 13th of November, about five o'clock in the evening, he sent my son to me to say that he had won a watch at a raffle; he came down afterwards to me in my own room, he asked me if I wanted to buy one; I told him no; he went, and returned with my son and said if I wanted to buy one I should have it for eighteen shillings; I then asked him how he came by it, he said he won it at a raffle; I asked him if he was sure of it, he said yes; I then asked him if he was quite sure of it, he said yes. I sent him and my son together to his master and mistress, to ask them if they were agreeable for me to buy the watch; they returned and answered that his mistress did not care what he did with it, he might throw it in the channel. After asking him if he came honestly by it, I paid him the eighteen shillings for it, and desired him to give it to his mistress to lay it out in clothes upon him; he said they owed him six shillings before, he knew better what to do with the money.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. Yes, I had but part of two pints of porter.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stop with her - A. About twenty minutes in Lisle street; I accused her with it; she said she had got no money of mine. I called the watchman, she would not let that watchman take her, she said he did not belong to the parish. I called out for another; the second watchman took her; that was the watchman that she treated with a glass of liquor when we were coming from the same public house. She was taken to the watchhouse and searched; no money was found upon her. I mentioned what sort of shillings; two of them had heads on them, and the other had a G on it, a crooked shilling; the watchman was called in and told to pull out his money; he pulled out three shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the watchman here - A. Yes; Wale is the watchman. The constable asked me if they were my shillings; I said they were.</p>
               <p>Q. These three shillings were found upon him were they - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say they are yours, do you not - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had lost the money before he came up - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore he was rather privy to it, though not present at the taking of it, all he could do was to receive it - was there no other person you was in company with - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you lost the money you could not tell - A. I lost it in that house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. I was sober, I think; I went strait from home into that public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the woman before - A. No, I never saw her before.</p>

             was brought in by the man prisoner on charge of robbing the prosecutor of three shillings. I searched her and found nothing on her but a battered sixpence and some halfpence. While I was searching the woman I heard the beadle say, watchman, is not that your wife; he said no. I told the woman to go out of the room. I said to the watchman, for the satisfaction of the man that has lost the money, and your own character, let us see what money you have got in your pocket. Out of his right hand breeches pocket he took three shillings and sixpence and laid it down on the desk; I told Smallway to look at the money; he did; and said they were the three shillings that were taken from his pocket.</p>
               <p>COURT. Let me look at the shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What were the marks on the shillings - A. Two of them had heads on them, and the crooked shilling had G on it; I am sure they are the shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. You come here to say that there was nothing but a G upon the other - A. Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. If you can swear they are yours, you must know - A. I am not sure now; it is a remarkable crooked shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear by the bend of the shilling - A. I know I had a plain one in my pocket. I wished to keep these till the last because they were the best. - (The shillings handed to the jury.)</p>
               <p>COURT. It seems to me to be a C instead of a G.</p>
               <p>JURY. It is C that is on it.</p>
               <p>Kimberley's Defence. When I went into this public house he asked me to have some beer; I did; he called for another pint of porter; after that we had a quartern of gin to drink; I gave him a part, and part I took myself. We came out of the public house and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300047"/>turned up the first street which led from the public house, where he gave me a sixpence; I asked him for more money, he said he would give me more if he had it; then upon my refusing him the favour, he caught hold of me and called the watch.</p>

            . I am an officer belonging to Worship street office. On Saturday, the 12th of November, between eleven and twelve at night, I met the prisoner in Kingsland road with a sack on his shoulder; I asked him what he had got in his sack; he said a cock; I asked him where he got it from; he said, from his master, where he worked, that he had given it him. I went to his master and enquired; finding that not true I detained him. I asked him how he could send me all that way to his master's, knowing it to be a lie; he said he was sorry, but now he would tell me; he then said he met a man in Kingsland road on the Thursday, that he offered to give him the cock; he said that he would not have it as a gift, he would buy it of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the month was the Thursday - A. The 10th. I stopped him on the 12th, on Saturday. He said that he bargained for the cock and paid two shillings for it, and that the cock was then alive. I detained him till the Monday and then enquired; I learned that Mr. Collings had lost a cock; I immediately sent down to his house; Mr. Collings's son came to the office and identified it.

               <p>Q. Where was his hat - A. He had his hat off.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any quarrel with him before - A. No; I never saw him before. He was taken with the hat.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner say, when he was charged with this, he took this hat up for his friend's hat - A. No.</p>

               <p>- I was going home on that night, about half past nine, I stopped under the gateway; I heard the cry of murder in the street; the rattles sprang in all directions; at that moment the prisoner came by me and went up a court with this stick and a hat, they were concealed under a large jacket, which sailor's wear; he endeavoured to hide himself behind some carts; I catched hold of the stick. When the watchmen came by, I said, you must be the man that they are looking after, and this is an unlawful weapon; then a scuffle ensued between him and me, I still kept hold of the stick; he ran; I cried out stop thief; he was stopped immediately. The prosecutor owned the hat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Arabin. So that stick you call an unlawful weapon - do not you know that is a common stick for a foreign sailor to have - A. That is for the judgment of the court.</p>
               <p>Q. What altercation had taken place before this you do not know - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. That old hat is not worth a shilling - A. I do not know that it is.</p>

            . I am a patrol. About half past two in the morning I was going my round, I found the prisoner at the bar concealed in a necessary in George yard, Chick lane; I told him to come out of there, as he had no business to sit there; he said he worked at Narrow Wall, Lambeth, and lodged in Jewin street in the city; I told him it looked very odd his being there, he must go to the officer of the night. I then took him to the watchhouse; the officer of the night saw him with these things in his bosom.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I took them not with an intention of keeping them; the carpenters would lend us any of them when we wanted them, and then we returned them back and put them in the place again. I took the liberty of taking these tools, intending to bring them back again the next morning. Going from Narrow Wall two or three of my shopmates called me; I went with them, and got so intoxicated that I hardly know what I did; what I said at the watchhouse I do not know, and the prosecutor cannot deny that he lent me any tools when I wanted them at any time.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Has Mr. How any partner - A. He has none except Mrs. How.</p>
               <p>Q. This wheel is not finished - A. It is not quite finished, it wants the nails putting in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you call a thing a wheel till it is quite finished - A. Undoubtedly it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a wheel - A. I can call it nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. to Gorman. Now honest friend, were you one of the persons that was treated by this person with some gin - A. I was not; I was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sober - A. He had been drinking, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he quite sober or a little drunk - A. A drunken man could not have managed that wheel.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that a sober man would carry a wheel in that manner, do not you think that a sober man would not have trundled it along rather than carry two hundred weight - A. I saw him carrying it on his right arm.</p>

               <p>Q. Could not he have got on much faster if he had trundled it along - A. Yes, he could, but it would have made an alarm.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath was not he quite drunk - A. He was the worse for liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not he very drunk - A. He could not be very drunk else he could not have carried the wheel along.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had a shopmate along with me, he was discharged; he asked me to go to that shop to ask for employment; I went to Mr. How's, Mr. Fletcher was not at home; the horse keeper said let us have some gin; I gave the girl half a crown to get three half quarterns of gin; I went away and did not take the change. I forgot myself and went back for the change; I did not take any thing.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

He did not call on the Monday; I believe it was on the Wednesday or Thursday evening he called; he was then paid seven shillings and eleven penee halfpenny; he said my account was right, fifteen pots and a pint, and one shilling and sixpence for liquor.

            . I am the officer of East Ham. I took the prisoner in custody and put him in the watch-house; I searched him, and found upon him thirteen penny pieces and one halfpenny, a knife and a key; I locked him up and went down to the stables where he looked after his horses; I unlocked the corn bin with the key I found upon him, and found seventeen penny pieces and seven halfpence in this bit of a lanthorn. I then told him that I had found this copper; he said he had taken them of Mr. Darton's foreman; I told him it had a very bad look of its being hid so; I told him he had better tell what became of the money that he received.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I cannot hear what he said - A. He told me he was robbed in a lane leading from Plaistow to East Ham by three foot pads; he had lost ten pounds.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I received the money from my master, Mr. Darton, in the taproom of the Cheshire Cheese, in gold, silver, and copper, to the amount of ten pounds; he put the halfpence into a bag and tied them up; he put the gold and silver in a bag; he saw me put it in my pocket; I delivered the halfpence into the landlord's hands while I got my horses out of the stable; then I hung it on the cart. I went to Whitechapel, I found the halfpence out of the cart; I turned back, I was afraid I had not put the halfpence in the cart, although I am sure I had. I have been five years in my place.</p>

            . On the night of the 5th of November I saw the prosecutor, he said he had been robbed of half a guinea and a half crown; he charged the prisoner with being the woman that had robbed him; I asked her for the money; there was half a guinea, half a crown, two shillings, and some halfpence, she took out of her pocket; he charged me with her; she said that if he had behaved like a gentleman to her she would not have took the money; he promised her two shillings, he only gave her one; she did not take the money from him, she found it on the bed where they were.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Might not the money have dropped out on the bed - A. I cannot say; I was on the bed. There is SW on the half crown, it is mine.</p>
               <p>Kennedy. He did not speak to the mark on the half crown till he was at the office.</p>

On Saturday night the prosecutor had been in company with another woman; he said if she could recommend him to a Welch or Scotch woman he would pay her for her trouble; I asked him two shillings; he gave me one shilling, and two pennyworth more halfpence; as for the money I did not see it; he said he had lost some money, I said I had seen no money; he shook the quilt and the money flew on the table. I cannot say whether it was his money, as I had some company before.</p>

I went to the door and watched her; she met this little girl in the street and took the pot of beer from her and some money; she put the beer down next door to me and went off down Gray's Inn lane.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. That gentleman who has witnessed against me, and said I was the person before the magistrate, he said I had a long sleeve gown on, and that is a thing I was never in possession of in my life. In the next place, he told the magistrate that he saw the woman give me two shillings and a penny in my hand. When the magistrate asked him again if he was sure - he said, no, he saw some money; he said it was half after seven in the evening, then it was dark. It is very odd he should come and swear against me in such a manner. I would sooner go to a prison immediately than take a false oath.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you lose your fowls - A. On Thursday, between four and five in the morning. I built up a shed close to my house, I lost them from there; I lost two hens and a cock. I heard the cock crow about four o'clock, presently after the cock ceased I heard a hen cry; I got out of bed, naked as I was, and went to the place, he pulled the door to with a string. I immediately pulled the door open and dragged him out by the collar; I called to my wife to bring my shoes; she brought my shoes; I desired her to call up a neighbour to assist while I put on my clothes; after I put my clothes on I took him to Islington watchhouse. I never lost sight of him. He had killed the whole of them; the cock and one hen he had put in the bag; I did not give him time to put the other in.</p>
               <p>- . I am a constable. The prisoner was brought to me. I took him to the office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been in the country the day before looking for work. I was very late and foot sore; seeing this shed, and being very much in liquor, and the door being open, I went in; there was a string to the door, I pulled it to keep myself as warm as I coold; this man pulled me out and took me to a dwelling house in the dark, and his neighbour came to his assistance; and as to the bag, I had no bag with me; from thence he took me to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I went back after I took him into the house, I asked him if he had killed them all; he said no; I asked if he had killed the cock; he said no; I would not have done nothing to him if he had not killed them.</p>

In the morning Fowler went out and came in again; he went up stairs, and returned down again in about ten minutes; he saw the landlady; he told her he wanted breakfast: he went away as fast as he could towards the Haymarket; the landlord and I called after him in the street, he must have heard us; he did not turn back, he was not above thirty yards off. The landlord went into the Haymarket, collecting of pots, and happened to see him having his boots cleaned; the landlord came home; Westcoat, I, and the landlord pursued him; we found him at the Dog public house with his slippers on, he had left his boots to be cleaned; he seemed very much alarmed at our presence; we brought him back to the George and sent for

             the officer; as soon as he saw the officer he put some papers in the fire. Gregory had him in custody the Thursday before; he knew Gregory; the ashes of the paper were taken out of the fire; it appeared to be a forged draft that he had in his pocket; I had seen it before he was searched; and nothing was found upon him. When we came to the watchhouse we asked whether we should send for some friends; he said yes, I have a friend living in St. James's palace of the name of Latham; Latham came. In the presence of the prisoner he shewed me a note and a hat he had received from the prisoner.</p>

            . I took the prisoner in custody; I searched him, I found nothing but sixpence and a few halfpence; he said he had never seen that note nor the silver; he said the sixpence he had in his pocket before, but the halfpence he picked up on the floor in the bed room. I was in the tap room when he put the paper in the fire.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I contradict almost all the evidence which they have given. In the first lace, the prosecutor says he did not ask what he spent the over night - he certainly did ask me; I told him I could not tell, as I was not there. With respect to their halloaing after me in the road, they did not, as I could hear them. I asked a parcel of boys where there was a barber's shop; from there I asked where I could have my boots cleaned, which was not above twenty or thirty yards from the place.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know Mrs. Williams - A. Yes, she was a customer of mine then; she lived in Charles street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know on the 9th of September of any goods delivered by him to her - A. I know by written documents in the book.</p>
               <p>Q. What was there delivered to the prisoner on the 9th of September - A. Bread and flour to take to my customers; in this ledger is the entry made at the time. I copied it from him.</p>
               <p>Q. You made the entry in that book from the account which the prisoner delivered to you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. I suppose some of your trade is on credit and some ready cash - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. If they have the money they return you the money - A. Yes; and when they come without the money they return it unpaid, and I make an entry in the book in their presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Read the entry - A.</p>
               <p>"A quartern of flour, half a quartern loaf, and a penny roll."</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other Mrs. Williams - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you that he had not received the one shilling and nine pence of Mrs. Williams - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he before he left your service made any discovery of this transaction - A. I often discovered him in an error.</p>
               <p>Q. My question is this - whether before he had left your service, you had discovered that he had recieved this money from Mrs. Williams - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 8th of October he left your service - how long was it after the prisoner had left you that you saw Mrs. Williams - A. In the course of three or four days. I told her that I had one shilling and nine pence against her, and then was the first time that I knew the money had been paid; about a fortnight afterwards I met the prisoner in the street, he said he lived with a Mr. Morris; I told him that he had taken money that he had not accounted for, I should have him apprehended for taking my money and not accounting for it; I saw him after that on the 1st of November, when I was taken up on a bench warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you took out any warrant, or made any charge before a magistrate before this 1st of November - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. There was an indictment against you for an assault - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300055"/>Q. Before the 1st of November had he made any accusation against you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time he lived with you had you differed - A. One morning I could not get him up.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what took place that morning did he at any time tell you that he would make any complaint against you - A. Never</p>
               <p>Q. Then the first time that you knew he had made a complaint against you before a magistrate was on the 1st of November - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he ever taken you before a magistrate before the bench warrant - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came before the magistrate, I suppose the nature of his accusation was his claim - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner present - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at that time make any communication of this transaction - A. I did; it stood over for a future day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. You and he had some difference while he was with you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had not threatened to bring you before the magistrate, you would never have preferred this charge - A. He never threatened me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he quit your house with the marks of your brutality upon his person - upon your oath, did not he quit your house with his hair torn up by the roots, and black marks on his face - I do not ask you whether you inflicted them - did not you see them - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did he quit your service with any marks of violence - A. Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Morris was a baker living about an hundred yards from your shop, from time to time had not you seen the boy going round with bread - A. I saw him but once.</p>
               <p>Q. You know that your wife saw him at Mr. Morris's - A. She told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons in the course of the day had this boy to deliver flour, bread, and rolls to - A. Near about twenty.</p>
               <p>Q. And the boy was to account to you upon memory for the delivery of flour, quartern loaves, half quartern loaves, and rolls - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, of course, he must say he received the money from some one - to a young lad can any thing be more easy than to make a mistake - A. I do not wish to say that he did it knowingly.</p>

            . I keep the Angel.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the last witness bringing in a bag containing oats and beans - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. The bag contained oats and beans - A. There was about a peck and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the house at the time - A. He was in company with Mr. Fagg's horsekeeper, we called him Jem. The prisoner was making high words with the cook; when this bag was brought in he ceased to be quarrelling; the horsekeeper took up his hat and lanthorn and went home. The prisoner sat silent a little, then he took the bag and went home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Fagg's man lodge in your house - A. No; in the neighbourhood. I asked the prisoner at the door how he came by that corn; he said he had got it at Uxbridge; I said I should like to see a sample; he said nothing, but went on homewards; I followed him, I went to his door, I called halloa; the prisoner came out; I said I was not satisfied respecting the corn, and insisted upon seeing some of it; I asked him where the bag was; he said the bag was within doors, but the corn was in the stable, the horse was eating of it. He conducted me to the stable; I went up to the manger and took out, with his leave, some handfuls of the corn; I then came home with the corn; it was oats and beans mixed, I have got a sample of the corn that I took out of the bag that night; the prisoner followed me and asked me what I hurried for; I said I have got what I wanted and I thought I should soon have him. The constable has the sample that I took from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards was the prisoner taken up - A. When I returned home I sat down in my own room; the prisoner came in and sat down; he went out; I judged he was gone to the horsekeeper; I went to the horsekeeper's room, he was gone out; it was about nine o'clock. I went to the magistrate to advise with him what was best to do. The prisoner was apprehended that night; I went to the horsekeeper; he gave me the key; I brought him to my house; he went away before I could get a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner's examination taken in writing - A. It was not, I believe. The prisoner said that he got them from Mr. Fagg's horsekeeper out of the bin; he said the horsekeeper owed him two shillings; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300056"/>called upon him for two shillings in order to buy corn for his horse; the horsekeeper said I cannot pay you, I will give you some corn out of the bin; he said that was the only time he had ever had corn of the horsekeeper; he knew those that had it.</p>

               <p>COURT, to Holt. Do they appear to be the same corn as Mr. Fagg's corn, so far as you can speak to your knowledge - A. I believe them to be samples of the same corn.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are precisely the same sort of corn.</p>
               <p>Q. What would be the value of these oats and beans - A. The beans about two shillings, and the oats about one, rather more than less.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The justice wanted me to confess, and almost urged me to say it; they said they would quit me if I would tell the truth; by their urging of me I said I had them of the horsekeeper</p>

            . I am a Thames police officer. On Thursday night about six o'clock, I let the prisoner out of the dock gates; he had a blue jacket, a pair of trowsers, and shirt tied up over his shoulder, with a bundle of sticks over them; he told me that he got them from a boy to carry to a slop merchant to get them changed, they did not fit him; I asked him to shew me the ship, that I might be convinced of it; he would not tell me the ship's name. I took him before the magistrate, and the boy came and owned the things.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. We had a good many people working on board; I was going home with a bundle of sticks, I saw a bundle tied up, I took it up and looked at them, I said I will take these things home, and when I come tomorrow I will let them know; I took them, and when I came off with the things I met the constable.</p>

            . I keep a lodging house for sailors in Worcester street, Old Gravel lane. On the 27th of October the prisoner came to my house, he said he had just come on shore; he produced a note for twenty nine pound six shillings for wages. I told him if that was the case he might stop. I went with him the next day to see his captain, he went in, and when he came out he said I am very lucky, I have seen my captain, I am to have the money to morrow; he asked me to lend him some money, I let him have a guinea and five pounds worth of cloathes. Going up Ratcliffe Highway a woman called to him, and said he had taken her in, he had borrowed money of her; I took him home, and was pulling his things off; he dropped his pocket book. I found the duplicate of the prosecutor's watch in it; and while I turned my back he whipped a watch out of my room.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I lodged in this man's house one night; I gave him a seven shilling piece to sleep with a girl in the house, he would not let the girl sleep with me; I asked him to give the money back, he would not. In the morning when I was coming out I picked up this watch on account of my money.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you owe him any money - A. No, he did give a seven shilling piece, he ate and drank five and sixpence; I offered him the eighteen pence, he would not take it.</p>

On Sunday morning I saw the prisoner bringing the cask along Golden lane; I stopped him with it; I asked him where he was going with it, he said he was going to take it home; I saw the name of Barclay, Perkins, and co. on it; I told him he must put it on his shoulder, and go along with me to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Where does Mr. Richardson live - A. In Cornhill, opposite of the Exchange.</p>
               <p>MR. GALLAWAY. Q. Did you print that book - A. I did; I printed it for Mr. Sanderson.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any directions for the title - A. General directions; that is, the title he handed to us.</p>
               <p>Q. I see his name is not in the title - to where did you afterward send the copy - A. To Cadell and Davis.</p>
               <p>MR. DAVIS. Q. What is your partner's name - A.

               <p>Q. Look at this book, did you at any time publish that book - A. We did, for Mr. Sanderson; he brought us the book, I think the title page was not printed; he said he had been recommended to us by Mr. Gallaway, to publish a work he was then printing for him, a book of the Island of Trinadad; he said there was nothing in it that any bookseller might have to object to, that he would lay as much as was printed before us that we ourselves might look into it; my answer to him was, that the nature of our business was so well known that no gentleman would put into our hands a book of public or private censure; that Gallaway must know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Marriott call upon you at any time - A. He did. I immediately, to the best of my recollection, directed the copies to be put away and told our servants not to allow another to be sold; I imagine that Mr. Marriott learned from our men that the circulation was stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Sanderson - A. He enquired the reason; I told Mr. Sanderson there were matters in his book of a libelous tendency, that was sufficient for us to stop the sale; I ordered all the copies to be put away; the copies were all then put away; I believe they were not taken away then.</p>
               <p>COURT. All this goes so far as to shew that somebody told him it was libelous.</p>
               <p>MR. RICHARDSON. Q. You, I believe sir, are a bookseller - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you publish that book - A. I did not publish it in the first instance, I afterwards sold it for Dr. Sanderson.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300058"/>Q. When did he bring it forward - A. I should suppose about the spring of the year 1808; he stated that he was the author himself, that he should advertise it in his own name, though the name was not in the title, but as a security to me, in the sale, he should do it.</p>
               <p>Q. You perceived that Cadell and Davis was in the title page - A. Yes. Dr. Sanderson stated to me if I thought it would do any injury to me, he would put his name in the title page.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he communicate to you the reason for publishing the work - A. I do not think he did; something passed about Mr. Marriott making objection to it. [Page 19, 75, 79, and 80, read, and a note at the bottom of the page.]</p>
               <p>Mr. Nowlan. The note comes not where the star is.</p>
               <p>COURT. The note ought to be introduced in its place; it must come in that part where the star is; if you transpose any thing, you may quite alter any thing.</p>

               <p>Mr. Reynolds to Nixon. You told me you did not know the exact time that Winstanley came in the prison - A. From recollection I do not know; from the documents it was in November.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember any message being sent to you by him, complaining of the treatment he had received in consequence of his being removed from that room - A. I do not recollect it; probably he might; he was very much in the habit of complaining.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he complain of bad conduct towards him, which you might prevent - A. It is not possible for me to recollect; I have a hundred of them complaints in a week. I remember a letter from my lord chief justice Mansfield, and I went to my lord chief justice upon it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing happening when Winstanley escaped out of prison - A. Yes, he called on me where I lodge, I did not see him; he left word with my landlady; I went to the Fleet prison to his room in the Fleet prison, knocked at the door, nobody answered; I went to No. 17, Mr. Chell's door, I knocked and asked if Mr. Winstanley was there, or where he was; he told me he was not there; he then considered a little while, and then asked me whether I washed for him; he said he went out on Friday night and nobody knew any thing of it but him, and that he would return on Sunday; I went down to Mr. Nixon and made enquiry, I did not tell him, I said I wanted Mr. Winstanley. Mr. Nixon made enquiry, he was not found; I went to his lodgings in Doctors Commons, there I saw Mrs. Chell in the room with Mr. Winstanley; I told him that I had been to the Fleet prison, that he was not there; he said it was a pity I went to the Fleet prison for all was spoiled by it. He wanted me to take a note to Mr. Chell, I told him I could not think of doing any thing of the kind; I told him I was obliged to go home. Mrs. Chell went away, she had a bundle, I cannot rightly say what it was; there was something in it like a dark coloured spotted cotton gown. In my way home I stepped into the Fleet prison, I made Mr. Nixon acquainted where Mr. Winstanley was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, to Woodward. In consequence of information that you received of Winstanley being out, did you go for the purpose of apprehending him - A. I did. On Saturday the 17th of September, I went to Wardrobe place, Doctors Commons; I went by myself the first time; when I came there he was denied by the servant of the house and the mistress; after that I went the second time with Hodgkin, one of the turnkeys. I went up to the two pair of stairs room, in the same house, without asking any questions, I found Wintanley;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300059"/>I told him I was come to take him home again. I took him in a coach with his paintings to the Fleet prison.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. Did not Winstanley tell you that he had written a letter to Mr. Nixon from that place - A. I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. And did not he beg a little time to pack up his things - A. Yes, and I gave it to him, as much as he wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Winstanley upon his return to prison - A. He was sent to a place of safety into the strong room - the strong room is equally as good as any in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this said by any one when he was taken to the strong room - there he shall stay as long as he is in the Fleet prison, and I will try to transport him - A. I do not recollect that Mr. Nixon made use of that expression; he said take him into the strong room.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that he did not - A. I will not; I do not believe he did; he might say he would keep him there as long as he staid, it was the only place of safety.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smith. Do you happen to know whether Chell was put in the strong room - A. He was there four or five days. I cannot swear positively.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she come on the Monday following - A. Yes, and that is

            , that Jew woman. Mr. Wood expecting of her, went and brought in an officer. When she came in the house I asked her if she bought blankets; she said no, she only bought hare and rabbit skins; my servant told her that she bought them, to her face; she had a white paper in her hand; the girl said she offered her some coffee. The woman was taken to the compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Your servant told her that she had bought blankets of her, what did she say to that - A. She did not deny it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask her what business she had there that morning - A. I did; she wanted to know if we had any thing to sell. My nephew had opened the door to her a week before; she then begged pardon, and said she had come to the wrong house. It was on Monday the 26th when she was taken up.</p>

            . I am an officer. Mr. Wood sent me on the 26th to take this woman in charge; Mrs. Wood said she was offering the servant some coffee. Jewson, an officer of the parish, was there; we searched her, so far as decency would allow; we could not find any coffee upon her. Going along Lombard street she came to a puddle; she dropped the coffee and pressed it in the puddle. I instantly put my hand in and took out the coffee.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find the blankets - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. What might one of the blankets be worth - A. Seven shillings a piece.</p>
