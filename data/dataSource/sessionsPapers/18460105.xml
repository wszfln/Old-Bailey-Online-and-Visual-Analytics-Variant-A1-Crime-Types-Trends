                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer and appraiser, and live at No. 5, High-street, Marylebone. In Oct. last I was engaged by a gentleman named White to distrain for rent at the house of Mr. French, No. 8, Robert-street, Chel<lb/>sea—up to the 8th of Nov. I had not succeeded in effecting the distress—on that day the prisoner called upon me—he told me if I would give him a warrant, something to hold, to show, he could probably get in—he had prior to that, called upon my employer, and he would not employ him—I gave him a copy of the warrant—I objected to give it him at first—he again asked me if I would give him one—I said, "On condition you do not move or do anything, but leave the man in possession, till you let me know"—if he had had to remove the goods he would have had my inventory—I did not give it him—I had not taken one at that time—I had not then seen the goods—if he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184601050006"/>
               <p>had been empowered to distrain or move he would have had my inventory, but I never empower my men to do so—I saw him again on the 10th—he drove over to me in a chaise, with a person who acts as potman to Stephen<lb/>son, and who was chiefly with him—the prisoner then told me that he had got possession, and that he had moved everything out—I said, "Oh dear! I am sorry for that, I wish you had not done so, why did you do so?"—he said it would not have been safe to have left them there, the woman (meaning Mrs. French) was such a devil she would have broken them to pieces—he said he had done everything correct—I said, "I am sorry you removed them"—he told me they were at his, or at a warehouse—he drove me to the Bee Hive beer-shop, kept by Stephenson—I did not go in then—I did about an hour after, after having been to Mrs. French to come to some arrangement—when he took me to Stephenson's he said, "The goods are impounded in this room"—it is a room a little below the stable-yard, one step—he had not showed them to me before I went to Mrs. French's—French's is a quarter of a mile from the beer-shop—I saw Mrs. French, and an agreement was come to between me and Mrs. French—it was in the prisoner's presence, and was made in his own handwriting—I had not received any key previous to making this arrangement—Stephenson did not at any time give me any key—I received the keys of Mrs. French's house after the arrangement—I did not receive the key of the place where the furniture was—I could not get it—Stephenson was not present when the arrangement was written—he was after<lb/>wards—I produce the arrangement—prior to that, the arrangement was all settled, and an order made out and signed by me for Mrs. French to have the things given up to her, except a part—the arrangement was witnessed by me, by a man who was present, and by Mrs. King—Spicer wrote the top of it, and my man wrote the bottom, and it was all read over in the presence of four persons at Mrs. French's house (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Eight chairs, mahogany japanned chest of drawers, a wash-hand table, a feather-bed, two French bedsteads, and a night convenience, to be retained by Mr. Doggett, Nov. 10, 1845")—they were to be retained for the sum of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the trifling expenses incurred that day—this arrangement referred to the things then at Stephenson's—I had seen the things at Stephenson's before this was written, whilst waiting for Mr. King, a friend of Mr. French's—I went with Spicer and his man to show me the goods—I then returned with Spicer to Mrs. French's, and made this arrange<lb/>ment—Stephenson was present when I saw the goods—I waited for him to come with the key—Spicer could not open the door, nor his man, or Mrs. Stephenson, and after waiting a few minutes Stephenson came and opened it, and I saw the goods in their presence—I saw Stephenson after the arrange<lb/>ment was come to—I showed him the arrangement in the presence of Mr. King, Spicer, and his man, and told him the arrangement that was come to—he said, "I am very glad to hear it; that is all right"—they were to send the goods up to me in a cart—I asked Stephenson and Spicer who would send them to me—Spicer said he would send them up next morning—Stephenson said, "Ah, that you can soon do in the morning"—Mrs. French was to have the other goods—I had given an order, which Stephenson took—the goods were to be delivered up to Mr. French—both understood that—they said in the presence of Mr. King and myself, that when Mrs. French brought the order signed by me in Spicer's presence, she was to remove the remaining part of the goods, except the eight articles which were to be sent to me next day—that was quite understood at the time—nothing was said at that time by Stephenson of his having any claim on Spicer, nor was anything said about it by Spicer himself—the goods were not sent back to me the following morn<lb/>ing—I sent a man after them in the afternoon, and on the following day,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184601050007"/>
               <p>and on the 13th I went myself—I saw Stephenson, and told him I had been look<lb/>ing for Spicer—he said he did not know anything of him—I said, "Why did not you send those goods up, as was arranged?"—he said, "Me send them up! what have I to do with sending them up? he has borrowed money of me, and I shall not let them go without 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I then went to look after Spicer—I did not succeed in finding him—on the 15th, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, I went to Stephenson's—I saw Stephenson inside the bar—I said, "I have come down again about these things, to know the reason why you have not sent them"—he said, "The things were all condemned and sold yesterday, and I have bought them," and he said if I did not get out of his house he would come and kick me out—I then saw Spicer coming in at the door—I said I should apply to a Magistrate, and said, "Why did not you deliver up the remaining part of the things to Mrs. French that I gave the order for?"—Spicer said they were all right, and I was in his debt—I said, "Well, you say I am in your debt, give me a bill"—he sat down in the tap-room and wrote this bill—after writing it he went and showed it to Stephenson, who was dressing in the place where the furniture was impounded—I did not owe him anything, and I said so—Stephen<lb/>son said I should have the goods for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this is the bill Spicer de<lb/>livered to me—it amounts to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—I did not consider I owed him anything more than for the men in possession, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, and the moving—neither Stephenson nor Spicer said anything about this demand until that occa<lb/>sion—Stephenson had asked 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 13th, and then it was increased to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have never been able to find the goods—I have never seen them since, nor has Mrs. French ever got the remaining part of hers—I have a list which was forwarded to me by Mrs. French.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been an auc<lb/>tioneer and appraiser? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About sixteen years, in the same neighbourhood—Mr. French had held over this house it might be six or eight months, I can<lb/>not exactly say—I have latterly made frequent applications, to get into the house; one day in particular I found the house closed against all appli<lb/>cants, and I kept a man waiting—I could not get admittance, because I did not attend to it every day—I went frequently, and never got in—I knocked and rang—I was answered, but the door was not opened—I did not try to get in at the back at all—I contented myself with knocking and being refused admittance—I was anxious to get the thing arranged—the parties left on the 10th—they agreed to give up then—Spicer had been to the house when I had called for rent prior to that—I had had the warrant for a length of time, and had never been able to get in—he came to me on the 10th, I employed him on the 10th, and he got in on the 10th—I do not recollect his saying, "This will be rather a tough job, Mr. Doggett; you must pay me for it"—I will swear no such words passed—he was to be paid for his trouble—I do not know that he employed two or three men to get in, or how he got in—I have kept men watching the premises in the day-time—the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I spoke of was to be paid instead of 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. rent—we forgave the remainder—it was on their giving up possession and paying 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for which certain goods were to be security that the mat<lb/>ter was arranged—I gave up my claim prior to any arrangement taking place—I did not say to Spicer, when he told me he had got in and removed the goods, "I am so pleased with you for this that I will pay you handsomely, and you shall have another job of mine at Old Brompton"—nothing of the kind—I was not pleased with him on account of his moving the property away—he came to me on the 10th, the same day he took possession—I had instructed him on the 8th—he told me the reason he took the goods away was because of the violent behaviour of Mrs. French—I went with Spicer to Stephenson's,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184601050008"/>
               <p>and, after waiting there some time, saw the goods in a bed-room of Stephen<lb/>son's man, after returning from No. 8, Robert-street—we had nothing on the road—I had to wait half an hour at Stephenson's, and I had some cigars, a pot of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. ale, and a little bit of steak, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. altogether—I did not pay—I said I would pay—I have not paid for it—I have not paid Spicer a farthing for what he did on this occasion, not when I was charged 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and told he would not give up the goods till I had paid him—Stephenson did not say to me that Spicer would not give up the goods till I had paid him—I will swear he said nothing of the kind—I do not know whether this was rather a difficult job—if it was anything extra, and I chose to make him a compliment for his trouble, that would be a different thing—I do not tell my men I am going to give them two, three, or five guineas, when my employer would not allow me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had no understanding with Spicer—I did not tell him to take such measures as he thought fit to get into the house—I gave him the warrant to hold, to show, as he wanted something—I told him to levy, if he could, in a legal way—I know there are such things as having to get into the houses of refractory tenants by stratagem—I have heard of such—it is sometimes a difficult and hazardous thing—I had not any spirits and water with Stephenson and Spicer, nor did I go away intoxicated—I had only 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of brandy and water—the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pot of ale was between four of us—I had the brandy and water nearly three hours after everything was settled and ar<lb/>ranged.</p>

I went to bed a few minutes after eleven o'clock—I saw the prisoner sitting in the tap-room, and left him there when I went to bed—it is the duty of Richards, our waiter, to close that room—I was called up by the police between one and two—I found the corner door of the house, leading into the street, open—the bar door was fast—I unlocked it, went in, and found two sixpences lying on the floor—(I had the keys up stairs with me)—I counted the remaining money—there were only four sixpences and a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece left in the till, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in copper—I had not been to the bar before I went to bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clergyman living in Wales, at New-house, near Cardiff. On the 28th of Nov. I was in town, staying at the Trafalgar Hotel, Charing-cross—Messrs. Glyn's are my bankers—I received the cash for this check on the 28th of Nov. in one 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., five 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and ten 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank notes—I put the notes I received into my pocket at the banker's, and when I got to the hotel I put them out of my pocket-book into my portmanteau, which was in my bed-room—that was, as near as I can judge, about four o'clock in the afternoon, or a little before—I locked the portmanteau and then went out to take a walk, and was out till nearly six o'clock—at near ten o'clock, when I went to bed, I opened my portmanteau, to see if the notes were safe—I had some difficulty in opening the lock, but I did open it, and found the notes gone—I had been out from four to six o'clock, and was in my sitting-room at the hotel from that time till I went to bed—part of my family were with me, and we had a sitting-room to ourselves—I made no alarm that night—the female servant came into the room early in the morning to light the fire—I told her I had lost 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes, and that they would be of no use to anybody, as I had the numbers—I saw the head waiter soon after—I went to Glyn's, I got there before the banking-house was open in the morning, and gave them in<lb/>formation—I remember Lake at the hotel—he waited upon me—I did not observe Bowen there.</p>

It is kept by James Barrack, and is in the parish of St. Martin-in-the-fields—the prisoners Bowen and Lake were waiters under me—Lake had been so about nine months, and Bowen about nine weeks—Mr. Lewis was at the hotel in Nov., and Lake principally waited upon him—Bowen may have assisted occasionally—they both had access to all the rooms in the hotel—on the morning of the 29th of Nov. I heard of the</p>

               <p>robbery of the notes—both the prisoners were in attendance at the hotel the afternoon before that—I saw Bowen there at eight o'clock, and did not see him again till the next morning—he would leave off work, according to the rules, at eleven o'clock, and should have slept in the hotel—on the 26th of Nov. Bowen had wished me to employ a person named Dancock as an extra waiter—I knew Dancock's father, but not the son—Bowen recommended the son to me—I knew his father as waiter at the Adelaide hotel—I have known him many years—he is a man of respectable character—I objected to employ the son, and did not, having heard he was a wild gay character—I did not usually sleep in the hotel myself, but I did on the night of the 28th, as my mother, who had come from the country, slept with my wife—I heard of the loss of the notes between eight and nine o'clock in the morning—about half-past eight—I saw Lake first, and Bowen directly after—Lake mentioned the robbery to me as I walked into the house, in the hall—I walked into the coffee-room and saw Bowen, who said, "Did you hear of Mr. Lewis having lost 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—of course I was astonished at the news—I said, "Why Charles, you have been out last night by the look of you"—he said, "No, I have not, but I am very unwell"—my master was informed of what occurred, and the police were called in—I was in communication from time to time with the inspector—on Sunday, the 14th of Dec., Ottway, the inspector, made a communication to me about the notes—that brought to my recollection the appli<lb/>cation which had been made to me to employ Dancock—Bowen was taken into custody in the course of that morning—I was not present when he was taken—after he was taken from the house I went on attending to the business of the hotel—it was not a busy day, but rather dull—Lake was still there—it was his business to assist me—Lake came to me and reported that Bowen had been taken into custody, and expressed himself in that sorrowful way that I took notice of it, and made the remark, "Well, I am innocent, I hope you are, George?"—he answered, "Yes, I am"—I said in a sharp manner," And I do hope if he is guilty he will be transported"—I then found Lake quite incapable of doing his business—he was the hotel waiter, that is, the private sitting-room waiter—we had a little dinner up stairs—I found he did not know how to get the tray ready—he was in such a confused state he did not know what he was about—at last finding him perfectly insane, not capable of doing his business, I said, "The fact is, George, you are concerned in the rob<lb/>bery yourself," to which he said, yes, he was—he then said, "I was driven into it by Charles or Charley," (meaning Bowen)—he told me Bowen had formed a plan to rob the Rev. Mr. Lewis, that he had obtained a key to fit Mr. Lewis's portmanteau, that having done so he brought the key to Lake and said to him, and "I have tried this little gentleman, (holding the key in his hands,) I find it just fits the portmanteau"—that from that time to the time of the robbery Bowen was in Mr. Lewis's room every day during Mr. Lewis's absence—that on the 28th of Nov., Bowen went into Mr. Lewis's room, between four and five o'clock, he first saw Lake, and said to him, (after having been in Mr. Lewis's room, and opened the portmanteau, and seen the notes,) "Wait till Talbot goes down to tea, and then you go in and get the notes, they are in such, a part of the portmanteau, and they are perfectly safe"—that as soon as they saw me go down to tea, both went up stairs together, Bowen gave Lake instructions to go into the room and stop up the key-hole, and should there be any noise to go out at the window and along the balcony into another room, that Lake, after taking the notes out of the portmanteau, according to Bowen's instructions, was half inclined to go out at the balcony, but thought the neighbours might see him, and he retreated from the balcony, opened the room-door, and came out the same way he went in—that Bowen was at the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184601050014"/>
               <p>room-door and took the notes from him at the instant—(the bed-room is on the floor where there are sitting-rooms)—he said that after Bowen had the notes they had not an opportunity of meeting again for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, business calling them in different ways, and in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour they met in a room, and Bowen said to him, "Why, you have got 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; there is 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for each of us"—Lake felt frightened and astonished at the sum of money they had stolen, and he said, "We shall get into trouble, let me take the money to Talbot and say I found it on the mat of the door," to which Bowen strongly objected, and said, "No, you may as well take it to Mr. Barrack, you should never let these head waiters know too much: have you got any silver in your pocket to pay for a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to London<lb/>bridge; I have a friend there who will take care of it, and turn it into hard cash"—that Lake took 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from his waistcoat pocket and gave it to Bowen—they made up their minds to get their work done as quick as possible, for Bowen to get out in a clandestine sort of manner, to get out if he could with<lb/>out my knowledge—that Bowen went off with the notes about eight o'clock, and did not return again till next morning, the 29th Nov., that Bowen told him he had given the money to Charles Wood, an under-waiter at the Ade<lb/>laide hotel, London-bridge—that Bowen said to him, "I shall write to Charles Wood and tell him to hand the money over to <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> Snow, who will be able to get hard cash for it," and that on the 7th Dec., Sunday, Lake asked leave to go out, which he obtained to go to Tunbridge Wells to see his friends, that he went over to the hotel, and saw Charles Wood, who told him Snow had run away, with the whole of the money—that he, Lake, said, "I plainly see you have led me into it, and are now going to divide the money without giving me my share, and unless I get some I shall tell all I know of the matter, I am much troubled in my mind about it"—I took particular care to inquire who Wood was, and Jem, the porter at the Adelaide, who he had named—he said while he was there Charles Wood said to him, when he said he would tell all he knew, that he should not do that for nobody knew anything about it but <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>, the porter, and it was quite safe.</p>

               <p>made any remark about Mr. Lewis's money, or where he kept it—I have helped him on with his great coat, but I think not during his last visit—I did not come down to you, and say he had a pocket-full of silver, or that I put my hand in his pocket—I never said to you or Lake, that you were not cunning enough to commit a robbery on Mr. Lewis, nor that I should like to get into his bed-room, and shake his notes, nor that if anybody could get hold of them, and well shake them, he would never miss them—I stated afterwards that there was some more money in a port. manteau, because I heard afterwards from Mr. Vernon, a friend of Mr. Lewis, that there was another roll of 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of notes—I said I thought Mr. Lewis must really have lost the notes on his way from the Bank, and I did suppose so—I never said I suspected a gentleman that used to visit Mr. Lewis—we had many jokes between ourselves respecting the notes, and I said if any one stole them here, it might as likely be Mr. Vernon, as any one else or more likely, as he had more access to Mr. Lewis's room than anybody else; but it was a mere joke between ourselves, to show the impossibility of the notes being lost there—on the Sunday morning you were apprehended you came to me and said, "A letter is come from Scotland-yard, there is something up now from the police," and shortly after Inspector Ottway and two others. came in plain clothes—they sent for me into the parlour, and asked me seve<lb/>ral questions—when Icame out you were very inquisitive as to their business, but having heard so much there, I had no doubt you were the guilty party, and I gave you an evasive answer—I told you "They want to know where I go to of a night, they suspect Mr. Lewis was robbed by some lady in an omnibus, coming from the Bank, and they fancy this lady goes to a house where I occasionally go to take my glass"—I am not in the habit of drink<lb/>ing with females in front of the bar—I have drunk in their presence—not modest females—I have been in such houses after leaving the hotel of a night—I have not spent so much money in those houses—I had never been to the Fulham-road before you were taken into custody—I know it now by my brother having taken a shop there—I never went to Bell-yard, Fleet-street, to take a shop there—I believe, from my brother's state<lb/>ment subsequent to your apprehension, that there is an agent there whom he applied to, and of whom he took the shop he now has—I had a gold watch in my possession both before and after the robbery—it was my wife's—I lived in Dublin about six years—I went there to live as principal waiter at the Northumberland Hotel, and was there three years—I then took the Victoria Hotel, in partnership with Joseph Gardener, and we failed—we did not pay all our creditors—we paid all we could—I left the house on hearing there was a writ out against me as I was out at market—I said I never would be taken, and did not return home, but left Dublin by the steam<lb/>packet at eleven in the morning—it was not at night—I brought my own wearing apparel with me, no one's else—I brought no plate but a dozen silver-tea-spoons, which I have now—I pledged the entre dishes to pay bills which came due—I do not know what became of them—I left the principal part of the linen behind—I took none away with me—I had my own private linen, which was my own before I went to the hotel—it was a good stock, and is not all gone yet—there was a gentleman once stay<lb/>ing at Mr. Barrack's, who had a small writing portfolio—it was not given into the charge of any one in particular; he left it in the public coffee-room, and said, "Take care of my writing-case"—it was not in my charge; it was thrown on the side-table—I returned it to the gentleman in two or three weeks, and he said it had been broken open—we afterwards convinced him he had broken it himself by his own key—at first he said he would take the</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of the A division of police. My attention was called to this robbery on the Monday, and I was in communica<lb/>tion from time to time with Talbot till the Sunday when Bowen was appre<lb/>hended—I made such arrangements as I thought proper for tracing the notes—I went to the hotel on Sunday, the 14th of Dec., having obtained infor<lb/>mation respecting some of the notes—I saw Talbot, and mentioned the name of Dancock to him—he made a communication to me, in consequence of which I took Bowen and locked him up in the station, about two o'clock in the afternoon, and I was there when Lake was brought in by another constable—Charles Wood, and a man who gave his name as <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> Bailey, were also brought there in custody with Lake—Wood and Bailey were put into the same place as Bowen—after they had been with him Bowen asked me if Lake was in custody—I said he was, and that he had told all about it—he then said that Lake had taken the notes, and he only handed to him 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if he said he had more, it was wrong, he must have kept the rest himself—in con<lb/>sequence of information I took Bates into custody that night, between twelve and one o'clock, at a house in a street leading out of Waterloo-road—I told him I took him for having passed some notes which had been stolen—he said he did pass them, and he thought they were all right, that he received them of <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>—I did not then understand who he meant—he said he had seen <hi rend="italic">jack</hi> that very day, and told him they should get into trouble about them—I asked if he could tell me where <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> was—he said he did not think he could—I said I must take him to the station—he then offered to take me where <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> could be found—he took me to No. 8, Rodney-place, New Kent-road—we got there between one and two o'clock in the morning—he rapped at the door and then at the shutter—a voice asked, "Who is there?"—Bates said, "Is <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> come home?"—the door was opened, and I found Dancock in the room—Bates said, "You must put on your things and go with us, I told you we should get into trouble with some of the notes"—Dancock did not speak at first—he afterwards said he had received them from a friend of his at the Adelaide hotel—I took him in charge—I produce two hats, one of which I took from Dao<lb/>cock, and the other from Bates; also a great coat, which Bates had on—they were taken before a Magistrate—Charles Wood and <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> were discharged, and the others committed.</p>

               <p>been to the house about eleven o'clock—it is sometimes four or five weeks before the policy is transmitted after the insurance is effected, and I have known it to be six weeks—it is according to the business they have at the office—they give no memorandum—they consider the insurance effected through me—the policy is sent to me at their convenience, and I forward it to the person—at the time this fire took place the policy had not been forwarded—I have known the prisoner ever since he has occupied the premises, about three years and a quarter—I do not know that he previously kept a small oil and colour shop—I knew he had a printing business in Cloth-fair—I made the necessary inquiries as to his character before I advised the party for whom I am agent to grant the lease of these premises—I received a very excellent character of him, and he has always borne that character since he has been on the premises—I consider 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year a good rent for the place—it was a mere carpenter's shed, but has been converted by him into a dwelling-house—at the time he took it it was all in a very dilapidated state.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know that he has from time to time used tar and other matters of that kind to keep the rain out from the roof? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He used to do so sometimes—I remember his applying to me for permission to tar the outside of the place instead of painting it, as required by the lease, and I objected—I knew he had been using articles of that kind to keep out the wet—I have been on the premises since the fire—I think I saw the remains of some furniture, but everything was so completely destroyed it is impossible to say—there might be a few articles on the premises—there were the remains of a few—I had asked him if the presses and furniture had been brought into the house, and he replied, "No"—his stock and utensils in trade were insured for 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that would include the presses—he told me he was going to bring two presses in addition to what he had there at that time—I am not a judge of the value of presses—I did not know that he had been unsuccessful in his business—he kept his rent regularly paid up as if he was going on with the business.</p>

On Sunday night, the 7th of Dec., about twenty minutes after eleven o'clock, as I was going up my staircase, I saw a little redness in the sky, and I saw some sparks fly up—it was a fire—our house is opposite to the entrance of Brain's buildings—as you go up the buildings the entrance to the prisoner's premises exactly faces you—it if not a thoroughfare—there are three houses of each side—on seeing the fire I immediately went down stairs, ran over the road, looked up the buildings, and saw the prisoner's premises on fire—I noticed the flame through the window over the door—the school-room was in dark<lb/>ness—I saw the flames perfectly—as soon as I came to have a clear view of the premises the flames were coming out oi the window—I will not say at the moment I first saw it, but the moment afterwards I did—when I first saw the house it was entirely in flames—I did not notice the time by any clock—I speak from recollection—it was about twenty minutes after eleven o'clock, as near as I can say—I stood and looked at it for a moment or two, and them</p>

               <p>I went out of the buildings to fetch my nephew; but finding my niece had outrun me, I turned back and looked at the fire again—I then went home to fetch the keys of the school-room, to save the daybook and ledger—it is my nephew's school-room—I know the prisoner—I saw him on, the 17th of Nov. in my nephew Mr. Allen's school-room—he and I were alone—I forget how the conversation began, but the prisoner remarked to me, that if a fire took place in that building it would be confined to those walls—I said it was impossible he could say where a fire would stop, as the buildings were very narrow, and I thought the whole of the houses would come down, or some<lb/>thing to that effect—he looked round and said, "Oh no, the fire would be confined to these walls, it would go no further"—I asked him whether he intended to set the place on fire—he said no, he hoped not—I told him it would be a dangerous experiment—I think he began the conversation by asking me whether my nephew had insured yet—I told him he had not, but he was on the eve of doing so; in fact, I think that very day he had gone about the business—the prisoner said he wished he had, or he wished he would, or something of that kind—I think this about the insurance was at the commencement of the conversation.</p>

I was in his school-room with Allen and the prisoner—the prisoner said he wished Allen would insure—Allen said he would as soon as possible—something was said about a railway at that time, but I do not exactly recol<lb/>lect what—the prisoner said he understood he could insure a twelvemonth's rent—my brother did not say anything to that—the prisoner said he had a fresh policy out—the conversation turned upon railways, and I do not ex<lb/>recollect what it ended in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a schoolmaster, and reside at No. 2, Bun<lb/>hill-row. About six weeks before the fire I took part of these premises of the prisoner for the purpose of a school-room—there was no internal communi<lb/>cation between my premises and the prisoner's after I put them into repair—they were quite separated then, but only by a wooden partition—on the Sa<lb/>turday before the fire, I left the school-room about a quarter past two—it was a half-holiday—I left my premises quite safe at that time, and no fire in the stove—no one slept in the school-room—I locked the outside door, and took the key with me—I was aroused about half-past eleven on Sunday night by a cry of fire—I went to the spot—the fire was then coming out through the windows of the prisoner's premises, and reaching round the corner into the first window of mine—there was no appearance of fire in my part—the fire continued until the premises were destroyed—I had not effected any insurance on my property there—I had frequently been into the premised occupied by the prisoner—the last time, I should think, was a fortnight before the fire occurred—I did not then go over the premises, but I had opportunities of seeing into all of them—the whole were filled with different materials, arranged without respect to order—there were printing materials—there were no presses there at all—there were cases of type, and a hetero<lb/>geneous mass of different materials, blacking-bottles, cobbler's lasts, and a variety of things unconnected with the prisoner's business, as well as things connected with it—I cannot state with any certainty the number of cases I saw—I cannot say they contained any type, they were on the top of each other—there was type lying in the room adjoining my school-room—it was standing on the floor, arranged—the type cases stood on the floor, piled one upon another—I cannot swear they held type—I saw no furniture there, with the exception of a Windsor chair, and one or two broken articles—there was no amount of furniture, nor any appearance of business going on—no busi<lb/>ness was carried on by the prisoner since I have occupied my portion of the premises—the prisoner for the most part left his key with me, until, I think, a week before the fire occurred—the last time he came to me for the key was, as near as I can say, on the Tuesday or Wednesday before the fire—he then told me he wanted the key, as he intended to bring some furniture into the place—I understood him to say from Highbury—I think that was between twelve and two o'clock—he looked in in a day or two after, to know whether any message had been left—I saw him on the Monday, the day following the fire, in Brain's-buildings—the persons from the fire—he were there then, Mr. Mallet, the head engineer, Mr. Atkinson, and the two Mr. Nynes—Mr. Nyne asked the prisoner, in my presence, when he was last on the premises—he said, "About twenty minutes past eleven o'clock on Sunday night," the night before—he asked him what he went there for it such a time as that on Sunday night—he said to get the keys that he had left behind him on Saturday night, to get his razors that were locked up in some drawer at Highbury—Mr. Nyne then said, "How is it you did not shave this morning?"—the prisoner said he had shaved, but in cold water—he did not appear as if he had been shaved that day—I said I had shaved, and was in the habit of shaving in cold water for years—he then said his razors were blunt</p>

               <p>the prisoner expressed his surprise that I was not insured—he seemed to be under the idea that I was—he said, "What, are you not insured?"—I said, "No, not for a farthing"—he expressed a doubt as to whether his insurance would cover his loss—I told him an inquest would be held on the fire—he said he could say no more at the inquest than he said then—I believe it was after that he said the insurance would not cover his loss—he said he had furniture there—I told him I knew of none—he said he had brought it in on the Saturday—I asked how he had brought it in, whether in a cart or truck—he said he had carried it himself from a person named Cummins, in Willow<lb/>walk, Tabernacle-square—I asked what quantity of furniture he carried him<lb/>self—he said, "Four mahogany chairs without the cushions"—he was asked if he had a light there on the Sunday night—he said, "Yes," and he recol<lb/>lected having stumbled as he was coming out of the premises with the light in his hand—I then asked him whether the light had fallen from his hand—he said no, he had grasped it tight—he came into my school-room several times before the fire and talked about insurance—he asked me whether I had insured, and he showed me his policy on one occasion, and he eventually told me he had altered it three times—he said the fact of my having a stove, which was in the centre of my school-room, affected his policy, and he was obliged to alter it on those grounds—he came to me several times about it, and once he showed me his policy, and said he had been obliged to have it altered on account of my stove increasing the hazard—I should think that was about three weeks before the fire—he asked me whether I should insure, and I said I intended to do so—on another occasion he told me he had again altered his policy to insure property on the premises—I think that was about a fortnight or three weeks before the fire—it was after he had spoken about my stove—he told me he had effected an insurance on property on the premises to the amount of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think—it was, I think, on that same occasion we were talking about fire, and he said if a fire took place there, it would be confined to the corner; that the wall of Mr. Bassington's was thirteen inches thick, and the wall of the house on the other side nine inches thick—I looked round and said, "Yes, a fire would indeed clear out the corner"—on one occasion I saw some black stuff on his premises which I thought was pitch, but which he told me was printing varnish—it was in the gutter of the roof—the gutter was full of it—that must have been five or six weeks before the fire—it was while my portion of the premises was repairing—he said the apprentices had filled the place up with it, he had a quantity of it there—there was a small tub of the same stuff standing in the yard—he told me it was printing varnish—I Went on the premises on the Monday morning after the fire—the fire appeared to me to have begun in the corner against the wall, where the black mark is on the model—one reason for my thinking so, was finding the wall blackened all round for the extent of three or four feet, like the smoke that would rise from the beginning of a fire—it adjoined that portion of my premises where my heaviest property was—there were vestiges of property left in that corner—my opinion is that some combustible matter had burnt there, and then gone to the other part of the premises—it must have been so—the fire commencing there would have scorched the walls before the flames gained sufficient ascen<lb/>dency to destroy the premises—I saw a pile of type cases in the corner near the wall, and I saw some type in them, but I did not lift them, and do not know what was underneath.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And was not the doubt he expressed, whether not being completed, it would cover his property? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, because the question I put to him di<lb/>rectly, was, "Have you paid up the demands of the office on you?" and he said, "Yes"—I said, "Then there can be no doubt about the safety of your insurance"—he expressed a doubt about the safety of his insurance previous to my telling him so—the ground of his doubt was not having his policy in his own hands, not whether the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would cover his loss—he conveyed to me that four chairs was about the extent of the furniture he had in the house—he told me that was what he carried in on the Saturday night—that was all he told me of—he did not tell me that was all he had—when I saw the flames they were coming out from this corner—(<hi rend="italic">referring to the model</hi>)—there is no window near there—there had been one, but it was boarded up—it had a wooden flooring—that was very little injured.</p>

On Sunday evening, the 7th of Dec., about a quarter to twelve, I was called to the place where the fire happened—the whole of the building was on fire when I got there—it took about half-an-hour to get the fire under—the roofs of the workshops were all burnt down—after that our officers were placed in charge of the building, one relieving another, from the time the fire was extinguished, till Tuesday, the 9th, so that no person could have an opportunity of going into them to put anything there, or take anything away—on Tuesday, the 9th, we commenced examining the premises of Mr. Allen, and on Wednesday we began to examine the prisoner's premises—the officers kept possession until then, from the time the fire was extinguished—on Wednesday I found these books saturated with <hi rend="italic">turps</hi>—(<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—I found them in the prisoner's premises, near the type-cases, where the black mark is on the model—they were in the same state they are now, wet—we smelt the <hi rend="italic">turps</hi> before we discovered them—they were under the rubbish which had fallen from the roof—it did not appear that any water had got to the books—the rubbish had sheltered them from the water—they were wet from the <hi rend="italic">turps</hi>—every leaf is saturated with <hi rend="italic">turps</hi>—I have had charge of them ever since, and they are in the same state as when I found them—I kept them locked up in a box in the engine-house—they have not received any wet of any kind since they have been in my possession—they were in one heap, near the wall—under these books I found a layer of shavings, some of which I pro<lb/>duce, saturated with gas-tar—they smell of it now—I know the difference be<lb/>tween the smell of gas-tar and Stockholm-tar—I should say this is gas-tar—I found nearly a sack full of these shavings under the books—in my judgments it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184601050033"/>
               <p>was impossible for the books to have been in the state in which I found them had the turpentine been spilt on them—in my judgment they must have been steeped in turpentine—there does not appear to be any turpentine connected with the shavings, that I can smell—they were about a foot in depth—on the day following we discovered another sack of shavings—part of the sack is burnt—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—it was lying on the floor with these shavings in it and about it—I did not find the remains of any burnt shavings about the same room—I found the sack of shavings within a foot of where we dis<lb/>covered the books, and close to the wall, that was burnt up—in my judgment the fire commenced in that corner near the party-wall—the wood-work of the building was quite destroyed at that corner—I found among the rubbish the remains of some chairs, and portions of an old bedstead—I have often seen and smelt the varnish used by printers, it is impossible I could have mistaken the smell of the shavings for that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know that turpentine is very often used for cleaning type? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have understood printers use a great quantity for that purpose—supposing the fire had commenced in the centre of the floor, and had been attracted to that corner, the appearance would have been differ<lb/>ent from what I saw; the shavings must have been burnt, and the bottom of the sack must have been burnt, but instead of that the upper part was burnt—the sack was lying lengthways on the floor, about three feet from the cor<lb/>ner, and about a foot from the party-wall—I observed nothing but rubbish between the sack and the other end of the room; I mean the rubbish from the building when it fell—there were some loose shavings at the further part of the building, over the entrance to the door—there were no loose shavings where the fire began, except those we found under the books—they were not in a sack—they were partly burnt—this is all the paper I found saturated with turpentine—it was not fastened together, but as it is now, folded toge<lb/>ther; not lying loose about, but in one pile, as if it had formed a book—there was no appearance of any books saturated with turpentine having been burnt—the room in which the fire commenced was about five or six feet by six—I cannot say whether there had been a door to it—all that part was quite destroyed—the loose shavings extended over the front of the doorway—there were none in that room—the shavings under the books extended beyond the books—there seemed about a sackful—there was a little rubbish between the books and the shavings, rubbish arising from the destruction of the building.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you find any other books or papers in the room in which you found these saturated with turpentine? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I found no<lb/>thing but the shavings between the books and the floor—on the Saturday following we found a turpentine-can, which I produce, and a sack of shavings—we found them against that black mark, towards the door from the yard—the sack was lying down—it was partly burnt, but the shavings were not—the can was standing alongside of it—there was nothing in it—I know it has contained turpentine by the smell of it—it has the smell now—the shavings we found on the Saturday appeared fresh, and those we first found were satu<lb/>rated with tar—there was no difference in the shavings themselves.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were there also broken bottles found? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, a great many—some had contained boiled oil, and there were two other cans, which I should say had contained turpentine—they were over the entrance of the door, not in the same room—I do not know whether boiled oil is used in printing.</p>

               <p>there at the fire—I went over the ruins, to examine the state of the premises—I directed my attention to this part of the building which is marked black on the model, and there found the books which have been produced—they ap<lb/>peared to have been soaked in turpentine—they are magazines, or works unbound—I found some type-cases—they were placed one on the other—part of them were burnt, and under the lowest of them were shavings—I examined the state of those shavings, and the underneath part of them, next the floor, appeared to be burnt—the shavings extended on the floor to within about a foot of the partition which runs across—the type-cases partly covered the shavings—the part that was burnt was underneath the cases—the shavings were soaked with tar—they were in this sack, lying under the cases—the other part was also burnt, but there was no tar on those, only on the shavings under the cases—I found the turpentine-can which has been produced.</p>

                  </hi>. I was apprenticed to the prisoner about five years ago—I was with him when he first came to the premises in Brain's-buildings, and I worked there for about a year or a year and a half—he then gave up the business—there were four apprentices at that time—it is about twelve months ago that we last worked on the premises—we left because he had no business—he wished the apprentices to leave, and we wished to leave too, and we went to seek work elsewhere—from that time down to the fire happening I did not work on those premises, nor know of any being done—I remember that on the 2nd of Feb. two sacks of shavings stood in the top room, by the side of the wall—I never saw them after that—a lot of birch brooms were in the same room—he had some pitch and tar—he bought the tar to tar the gutters to the tiles—I do not know where it came from—I know Mr. Bliss's warehouse, in Barbi<lb/>can—when I left, in Feb., the tar was in the top room; not the room over the entrance, but on this side—it was brought down stairs, and taken up again—there were two tubs of pitch, and one of tar—there was only one used; the other was taken up stairs again.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there any turpentine about? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I do not think he had a halfpenny-worth of turpentine in the place—he used to buy 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth at a time—he was obliged to use turpentine sometimes for cuts or pictures—he was not obliged to use it for the type—he did use it—he was married at the time I was with him—he and his wife quarrelled a great deal—I never knew her pawn his things—I know he used to knock her about—there was some printing varnish about.</p>

               <p>selling some furniture—I do not know who to—several brokers came, and I saw him show them this furniture—it consisted of two beds, two bolsters, two pillows, a double chest of drawers, a bedstead in the top room, a table and looking-glass in the kitchen, and chairs, a sofa and table in the parlour—he sold them all to a broker, who took them away—I do not know what he sold them for—he continued in the house after that—I cannot tell exactly what furniture he had left—there were beds and bed<lb/>steads, drawers and chairs, and several things—I do not think the things left, after what he sold to the broker, would have fetched more than 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I heard from him that the reason he sold the furniture was because he owed a person some money, and that person sent to buy the things in payment of the debt, but he (the prisoner) was not to have the money—the prisoner told me of the fire on the Monday evening—on the Sunday before that I remember his going out, but I do not know the time, nor what time he came home—we were in bed—I saw him on Sunday—he went out between twelve and one o'clock in the day—I never was at Brain's-buildings—I do not know what time he came home on Sunday—I went to bed about half-past nine, or from that to ten o'clock—he was out then—I saw him on the Monday morning—on the Tuesday evening he asked me if I knew the time he came in on Sun<lb/>day night, and I said I did not—the prisoner's wife died about the 20th of Sept. at Highbury.</p>

Get the key of the bed-room out of kitchen cupboard; also the pocket-book of my wife's, red; open the bed-room at the top of the house; open the middle drawer with the spring<lb/>key; take out of the right hand corner drawer, and with ring-key open bottom drawer, and take out watch and key: also out of corner cupboard near window the tickets in the letter."</p>

I went to these premises by the desire of the Company, to examine the rem<lb/>nants of the fire—I found vestiges of the following articles:—4 tin canisters, or cisterns, with printing ink; 2 iron-bound casks; leather covered trunk; folding steps; about 1100 wood letters; 5 woods; 15 old plough-knives; 20 binders' tools, letters and flowers, and 27 others; 12 binders' rules; 1 spanner for a press; about 5 cwt. of paper, various, as pamphlets, maga<lb/>zines, &amp;c.; 31 chases, imposing-stone and stand; 450 stereotype plates; 12 copper plates; an ink-roller; 68 wood type cases, stand for ditto; hand copper-plate press; about 2600 weight of type and furniture; 500lbs. fused metal; 6 pages of letter-press stereotype; a quantity of blacking-bottles; certain ink, German-stove, glue-pot; 6 tin cans, 5 mallets, a mattock, brass cock, a quantity of shoemakers' lasts; 3 shop show jars and covers, and muller and stone—in furniture I found an old cooking apparatus, 5 rush-seat chairs, 4 mahogany ditto, a hearth-brush, 1 pillar and claw mahogany-table, a 2-flap table, 1 Windsor arm chair, a Dutch clock, bellows, 4 iron pots, warming-pan, kitchen-fender, and 2 old wire ditto; 2 tin tea-kettles, 3 spoons, Waterloo bedstead, 2 scuttles, 2 blankets, 2 sheets, and a quilt, printed cotton bed furniture, and a check ditto; 4 old waistcoats, 2 pairs of trowsers, 1 pair of</p>

I live in Queen Catherine-court, Brook-street—I was in company with Murphy on the 26th of Dec., and coming home through Vine-passage, somebody came and said there was a fight in Harris's-court—this is a noted party, so we went to see what was the matter—I stopped at the bottom of the court, and asked some women what was the matter—Mur<lb/>phy walked up before me, and when I came up he was down, and four or five women round him and on him—I cannot say I saw the prisoners—I do not know them—a rush was made at me—I stepped back and took my coat off—Murphy's mother-in-law came to me and said, "If you don't save his life he will be killed"—I went up, and the first man that came up had the tongs—I took them from him—I cannot swear who it was—I afterwards saw the wound the prosecutor had received—it was a large cut—the flesh was very much separated on the forehead, and shivered up and down—it seemed a blow from some blunt instrument—he had another wound on the head and one on the mouth.</p>

On the 2nd of Nov., between eight and nine o'clock in the evening—I was with him in at the Coach and Horses pub<lb/>lic-house, Kensington—there was a raffle there—I saw the three prisoners there—White and Derman were there, they called for two pints of beer, and my husband called for another—Hogan asked my husband to let the beer go round—my husband said no he did not pay for the beer to have it go round—Hogan said, "No, you never come to a place to respect a person, except for beer or quarrelling"—my husband said he never had any of his beer, and he said, "I will take good care you never shall"—James Hogan said, "If you were within reach of my arm I would let you know"—my husband said he was there for him if he owed him any malice—my husband said, "I never saw an action of yours, but when you went with the Queen of Spain"—when my hus<lb/>band said "I am here for you," he did not put himself in a fighting attitude he merely stood up—I then went to Hogan and told him not to upset the company or kick up a <hi rend="italic">bother</hi>—he up with his foot and kicked me in the side—I was hurt—I bent over and told him not to kick up a disturbance with the company, and when I turned round I saw the three prisoner all beating my husband with their fists—they pushed him forward with his back on the tap-room table—Ann Hogan had hold of his eyebrow in her teeth—the other prisoners were beating him in all parts that they could come at him—he was thrown off the table down by the fender—he was up and down four or five times, no sooner up than down—this lasted about twenty minutes—I am certain they were beating him all that time—he asked Roach for God's sake to take one of them off him, for he should be murdered—Roach took Barry off him—Barry then turned to my husband and beat him again, directly Roach let him go—I got my husband away—he said, "Come home, I am killed," and complained of hia side—he was very bad next morning, not able to work—he got another man to do his work—ho was able to walk to the police court, but not well—he wanted a <hi rend="italic">buss</hi> to come back—he took to his bed on the Monday night and kept it till he died—he</p>

On Sunday night, the 28th of Dec., I was assisting my brother at his shop, and noticed a farthing in his till, of the reign of George II—I took it up, looked at it, and made an ob<lb/>servation to my brother about it—I then put it back into the till—when the prisoner was given into custody, near the station door, I saw him drop this had farthing—it is an old battered piece of coin—I picked it up—this other coin is the farthing which I had seen in the till.</p>

On Monday, the 29th of Dec, I saw the prisoner—he asked me to take a walk with him to the play—I said I had some work that would last me about an hour—I went out about three quarters of an hour afterwards, and passed Mr. Prince's door—it was between five and six—the front window-shutters were shut—I saw a light at the back when I went up the court—I saw the prosecutor's window half open, and the curtains blowing out—I went to the top of the court, and made an alarm—I did not find anybody near the spot—I saw the prisoner about three quarters of an hour after, about twenty yards from Prince's—he said, "Will you come to the play now?"—I said, "Yes"—I told him that Prince's had been broken open—we went to the play, and when we came back again, he went in and asked Mr. Prince what was amiss—the prisoner lent mo 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in copper, as I had no money to pay for myself at the play.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 3rd Jan., I was on duty in Cow-lane, about forty or fifty yards from the Ship public-house—while there I heard a whisparing over a wall, which induced me to watch—shortly after I heard a rustling, like the getting over a fence, and I heard some one say, "Be careful, don't break the glass"—I listened still till they appeared to come into a shed on the other side of the wall—I went and fetched some other constables—the yard belongs to the prisoner Breeson's father—I got up on the fence, turned my light on, and saw the prisoner Breeson come from behind a cart in the shed—I jumped over the fence to see who it was—he said, "It is all right, master; I sleep here; there is no one here but myself"—I took hold jf him, and handed him into the custody of a constable—I then searched further, and found the prisoner, Cun<lb/>ningham, sitting in one of the swing-boats they use at fairs, with his arm lean<lb/>ing on a peppermint show-bottle—he said, "It is all right, sir; I am just come in; I sleep here with Breeaon"—after placing him in the custody of another constable, I went behind the cart that Breeson came from, and there I discovered this coat, in the pockets of which were these six brass taps, a parcel of tobacco, and some pieces of old brass; and close to the coat I found ibis small dark-lantern.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 21st of Dec., I went to bed a little after one o'clock—I was the last up in the house—I had looked at the fastenings of the house, but not the upper part—the kitchen window that was entered I cannot say was fastened, but the shutter was up, and bolted—the window was down—about a quarter to eight o'clock, in consequence of my servant telling me something I went down stairs—I found the kitchen window open, and the shutter leaning against the windows—any person could get in by removing the shutter and opening the window—I came up into the parlour behind the shop, and found a mahogany sideboard cupboard forcibly broken open, and all the silver that was there missing—there was a silver mug, gravy-spoon, three table, three dessert, and seven teaspoons, and two pair of old fashioned sugar-tongs—I found the till in the shop broken open, and missed from it 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I missed my wife's work-box from the sideboard cupboard in the parlour—this now produced is it—it contained my wife's work, and various odd things—I do not know the prisoner.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 21st of Dec., about eight o'clock, I was called into Mr. Sanderson's house—I ex<lb/>amined the kitchen window—it was closed at that time—the shutter had apparently been put up with buttons outside to keep it up while a person went to bolt it—those buttons could be undone from the outside—the shatter was standing against the window as if it had been removed—I found a cup<lb/>board in the parlour had been forced open, and a piece broken off—the till had been wrenched open with a pair of scissors, which were on the counter—I went into the back garden, and found a step-ladder standing against a wall at the bottom of the garden, which leads into a dug-up garden at the back—it was in Mr. Sanderson's garden, but placed against the wall of the other—I had seen that ladder several times before, on the other side of the wall—I found there a number of foot-marks—they began at the foot of the ladder, on the other side—I could not discover any impressions on Mr. San<lb/>derson's side, the ground was so hard—I found some where the ladder bad been taken from, and covered them over—I traced them to the bottom of that garden, where there is a ditch, and just opposite that ditch I found the box produced, and the contents lying about by the side of it—there were a number of foot-marks there—I traced them along the field to the spot where Plowright pointed out where the men got over the fence—I afterwards went with Plowright, and apprehended the prisoner—Plowright said in his pre<lb/>sence, "That is one of them"—the prisoner said it was not him, he could prove where he was that night—I asked him how—he said the old people could prove it—I went with him to his grandfather's, which is about a mile from the prosecutor's house—I asked the grandmother some questions in the grandfather's presence, about the prisoner's sleeping—she said, "He did not sleep here, he had his supper here, and he went up into the loft over the cow<lb/>barn; I will not tell an untruth; he could get in and out there when he liked, but he was there at six in the morning"—the caw-barn is little more than the width of this Court from the grandfather's house—the prisoner made no reply to that—I afterwards asked to look at his shoes—he showed me the shoes he had on—his grandmother told me they were not the shoes he had worn, those he had only bought on Sunday morning—I asked for the shoes he wore on Saturday night—he turned round behind a door, and reached me</p>

I was standing at the corner of Charles-street, Drury-lane, with Clark, my brother constable—I saw a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, No. 2504, pass at a furious rate down Charles-street—I saw inside it a portmanteau, and a boot or shoe loose upon the top—I thought something was wrong, and we pursued the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> down Charles-street—I called out to the caiman to stop—he did not stop till he got nearly to the bottom of the street—he then stopped, and a man got out—I heard him say something about Tottenham-court-road, and he ran away—the cab went on further down the street, when it was stopped by Clark—when I got up to it I opened the door and looked in—the prisoner Reed was inside—I asked him if the property in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was his—he said no, it was the gentleman's that had got out and run away; that the gentleman wanted him to take it to Tottenham-court-road—I then told him to come out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, which he did—I had seen him pre<lb/>viously with a gang of thieves in Drury-lane—I told him to get into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> again, which he did, and I followed him—Clark got on the box, and we drove to Bow-street station—I heard Hutchinson the driver say something, but Reed was then inside, and I cannot say that he heard it—I afterwards took the luggage into the station—I have it here—it is a portmanteau and a carpet-bag, con<lb/>taining a number of the articles stated, a box of cigars, a bundle with eight waistcoats and a pair of trowsers, and another bundle with a pair of boot—he said the gentleman had given him the hat and the coat he had on for his trouble in assisting him into the cab with the things—I afterwards went to No. 21, Princes-street, Cavendish-square, between eight and nine o'clock that same morning, in company with Clark*—Clark put his shoulder to the door and it was immediately opened—two females were in the passage—we west in and found the house had been robbed, and entered the back way by means of a ladder placed to a water-closet at the back—a square of glass in the water-closet window was broken, and there were marks of feet down—they appeared to have got from that broken square on to the top of the cistern of the water-closet, and then in at the staircase landing window—I found some lucifer matches in Reed's pockets at the station—I found this jewel-case in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>.</p>

It was open. I said I would; he said, "It is very cold, here is a coat for you." I said, "Thank you."

I occupy a front shop and parlour there—there are other lodgers in the house, which belongs to a person named Kelly, but he does not live in it, he lets it out in tenements—no one occupies the shop but myself—I sleep in the back parlour, which communicates with the shop it goes out of the passage—the doors arc opposite one another—you</p>

I was the last person at my shop—I locked it up and took the keys into my bed-room about a quarter before twelve o'clock—next morning I was lying in bed, and saw a light come through the fanlight over the bed-room—I saw it go out, and then I saw the light again—I heard the padlock fall—I got up and got a light—I drew the night-bolt of my bed-room, and saw the prisoner half way in my shop—he went out into the street—I followed him, and cried, "Stop thief"—he made three or four attempts to strike me with a hammer or a crow<lb/>bar, and once he struck me on my thumb—I went out in my shirt, and saw the policeman catch the prisoner three doors off—I found my door was all broken open—the policeman has got the padlock, which he took off the ground—I saw it there—I never saw the prisoner, to my knowledge, before—I am sure he is the person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Jesse Jones, a linendraper, at Uxbridge. On the 23rd Dec. we had some printed cotton on an iron rail outside the shop—this is the cotton—I saw it safe about four o'clock in the afternoon—we did not miss it till a person came in and said it was stolen.</p>

On the 23rd Dec., about twenty minutes after four o'clock, I was looking out of my window—I saw Hay trying to pull down a piece of print which hung across the rail at Mr. Jones's—he could not get it off at the first pull—he came again and made another attempt—he came three or four different times, but could not get it—I then went out and met him in the market-place with some other boys—I could positively swear to him—I have known him for years—I then saw another <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> go across the way and hide himself at the corner of a gate<lb/>way—Harman then came up and got the print off the iron—Hay was at that time in the market-place, with other boys, which is twelve or fifteen yards from where the print was, but within sight of the place.</p>

I am agent and manager of the house, No. 150, Fenchurch-street—I engaged the prisoner to lay down some lead on the stairs at that house—I had known him before, but had lost sight of him for about two years—I was to find the lead, and he was to find the labour and judgment—I asked the prisoner to give me some idea of what the outlay would be—he made his calculation for his labour nine days at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-day, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; a labourer, six days, at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-day, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; making 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I agreed to that—I was to pay him 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for his labour, and if he could do it in less time he might—I went with him on Monday, the 8th of Dec., to Pontifex's in Shoe-lane, and gave orders for some</p>

Oqrs. 12lbs."—Mr. Isaacs came to me and wanted some lead—I sent him up stairs to get the order, then this pass ticket came down to me—I got the lead lowered, and it was cut—there was a proposition made to cut it on our floor—I said it would be perhaps inconvenient, but he had better go up stairs and get the order, and I would allow him to cut it—it was cut there—it is not true that we had not time and room for the prisoner to cut it—it is totally false—he did cut it there, assisted by a labourer—there were no cuttings left—the whole was carried off—it was cut into eight pieces, and carried off in two carts—Bone and Linwood were the two carmen—Linwood went first with his cart, and the prisoner went</p>

On the 17th of Dec, in consequence of instructions, I placed myself near Reid's brewery, in Liquorpond-street, about half-past six o'clock in the evening—I saw Mr. Smith's cart under the shoot of the brewery and the grains were shot in—there was a lad in the cart treading the grains down as they were shot in—I saw Tubbs standing between the wheel of the cart and the brewhouse wall—he had something like a part of a tin kettle in his hand, and as the grains came down the shoot into the cart I saw him guiding the grains so as to fall into a bushel basket which he had—he filled his basket, the grains were hot and smoking very much, which prevented the boy in the cart seeing what was going on below—when Tubbs bad got his basket full he took it across the road, and I saw a cart standing near Laystall-street—Badham was in the cart, and Tew standing close to the back part of it—Tubbs took the grains to Tew—I drew as close as I could get—Tew said to Tubbs, "I will give you 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for this"—Tew then took up the grains and handed them up to Badham, who was in the cart—Badham emptied them out, and returned the basket to the ground—Tew then gave Tubbs 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and said, "Can't you get me another bushel?"—Tubbs said, "O yes"—he took up the basket, but he saw me, threw it down and ran away—I secured the other two prisoners, and Coombs who was with me, ran after Tubbs.</p>

It is my own dwelling-house—about the 30th of June the prisoner came to my house—he had a female with him, who passed as hit wife—the prisoner stated he had just come by the railway, and would tike my apartments to lodge there—I let him my second floor back room till the drawing-rooms were empty, which would be in a fortnight—he and his wife took possession that night, and remained there till the 9th at Sept.—the prisoner said he was Captain Kelly—on the day he left; I missed a gold watch of mine out of a trunk—I had seen it about a week before—the trunk was not locked—it was kept in a wardrobe in the front kitchen—I went up stairs, and missed it—on coming down again I met the prisoner coming out of a room—he said to me, "What is the matter? you look extremely pale"—I said, "I have lost my husband's gold watch out of the trunk"—he said, "What a shame it is to rob a lone woman"—he did not say anything more to me about it—I went to my mother's to tell her about it, and next morning I received a note—I went home the next morning, and the prisoner and his wife were gone—the prisoner never returned—I went into his room and missed a razor and case, which had been my husband's.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Bentinck-street, and am shopman to a draper. About six weeks ago I put an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper—this is it—<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>: "A douceur of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. will be given to any lady or gentleman who can procure for the advertiser a permanent situation, mercantile or railway, legally saleable. Address A. B., Post-office, East Cowes."—I saw this adver<lb/>tisement in the paper—I had this piece from the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> office, cut out of the paper (I did not allude to this advertisement in subsequent conversation with the prisoner, nor show it to him)—I received a letter in answer to it, which was acknowledged by the prisoner—the advertisement had been in the paper three days before I received this letter—I afterwards had some conversation with the prisoner—I alluded to this letter, and showed it to him—he did not say anything about this letter—I showed all my letters that he had written to me—he said he could give me a situation of 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, if I would give him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and accept a bill of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was in consequence of these letters so re<lb/>ceived by me that I had an interview with the prisoner—this is one of the letters I showed him—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"43, Moorgate-street, City of London. Sir,—If you will give 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I am at liberty of giving you a situation of 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum on a rising salary. I do not ask the money down, but the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. must be paid into a London banker's to meet two bills of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, four and eight months' date. It is in a railway office, and forward your answer by post. I hold a situation in the line above mentioned. I have inclosed a card. Direct to either of our offices.

Sir,—I told you, I be<lb/>lieve, that I was about to use my interest under Government with two lines of property in or about February, but you would be required after Monday, 7th Dec, 1845. One line will be from Hyde-park-corner to Windsor; the other from London, branching off to Windsor, Aylcsbury, Oxford, &amp;c.

If you are not used to London, I will see you most respectably situated. "Sir, your obe<lb/>dient servant, <hi rend="smallCaps">B. BROWN</hi>." I wrote an answer to this letter and posted it—I then received this letter—<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"43, Moorgate-street, Dec. 4,—Sir, if you have business to settle, say on the 12th or 13th, you will see London. If you have no friends here I will see what can be done for you. Your obedient servant, B. <hi rend="smallCaps">BROWN</hi>. To Mr. Charles Jacobs." In this letter this other was enclosed:—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"Jamaica, Southern, Eastern, and Northern Railway, 43, Moorgate-street,—Sir, since you applied I have been offered 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would not make me forfeit my word; therefore, to make the matter safe, send up by return of post a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. order; and on the 13th, when you enter the office, an arrangement as proposed for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a bill. This may be shown to any of your advisers, but not to our firm, as it is a private and honourable transaction between us. I have private property lent out on mortgage in Somerset—Income-tax Office proves my income. If reference is required apply to A. G. Aquila, Esq., No. 94, Cheapside, Lon<lb/>don, or No. 4, Charlotte-place, Mansion-house, City."—I wrote an answer to this letter, and received this letter in reply:—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Jamaica, Southern, Eastern, and Northern Railway, 43, Moorgate-street, Dec. 5,—Sir, Understand me, that I do not want to cheat you out of the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. written for; but should the gentleman have called upon me who was about to become secretary to this move, and asked me who the clerk is, and I had mentioned your name, and then you to have failed in coming, that would have made me look very foolish. If you come to town on Wednesday I shall be most happy to see you, but you will not be wanted till the 13th, as the new offices will not be ready, and it would be a pity to waste the carriage of coming up twice. Do as you please. Send on Monday, and then say when you will for certain be in London. Sir, I am your obliged, <hi rend="smallCaps">B. BROWN</hi>. To Mr. Charles Jacobs." I came to town on the 10th of Dec. and saw the prisoner for the first time at the office, No. 43, Moorgate-street—there was something of an announcement of the Jamaica Railway on the door—on that occasion I produced the letters—the office the prisoner was to get me was clerk on the Prince of Wales, Oxford and London, and London and Windsor railway—I was to give him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down, and a bill at eighteen months for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not do so on that occasion, but made an appointment to meet at that office the next afternoon—I met him there, and this document was prepared at that time—all the letters which have been read were produced on that occasion, and next day he produced this agreement.</p>

I fairly told you in all my letters that I was about to project one or two lines of railway, and, further, I told you that before Christmas I intended registering the lines, and, further, you and me went to see one.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Welch, of Greenwich. The prisoner is married to my daughter, and does not live far from my house. On Monday evening, the 24th of Nov., I was at home washing, and heard a noise, and his wife screaming—I ran out through my yard and through his yard into the alley, and he was beating her as hard as he could with his fists—I came up and said, "Oh, you brute, don't kill her"—he said, "You old b—, I will <hi rend="italic">do</hi> for you"—he hit me on the face—I put up my hand, and then he hit me in the ribs, and broke three of my ribs—I staggered about, and then fell down—I do not know how long I remained there, but my husband came and lifted me up, and carried me in doors—some women followed me in, and got me to bed, and my husband went for the doctor—I was three weeks and never left my bed, and could not be moved in my bed—either two or three of my ribs were broken, and I am very bad now, and hardly able to be out of my bed—the prisoner and I had not had an angry word that day—he often beat me before, and once before he broke my ribs—that is four years ago last Aug.—I had given him shelter in my house about a month before he did this—on the Saturday before he had come and broke my back-door in, and beat me and gave me a kick—I do not know what it was for—I never said an angry word to him—I only said it was time he was in his bed—it was between twelve and one o'clock in the morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wharfinger and contractor, and live at Greenwich. In Dec. last I had a contract for laying down some pavement in a public street there—Bush and Downs were employed by me to lay down some stones for that pavement—Downs was a mason, and Bush was his labourer—I inspected the work that was going on there every day—I remem<lb/>ber going there when they came to a turning, on Friday, the 4th of Dec.—I set out a certain part of the stones at that corner—I noticed on that day two particular stones, what are called Rock-hill stones—the stones which I set out were between eight and nine feet superficial, that is, eight feet long and one foot wide; that would be eight superficial feet—I went there again on Saturday, the 5th—the stones were not there then; no, I am wrong in the time, it was on Thursday, the 4th, I went and saw the stones, and on Friday, the 5th, I missed them about half-past ten o'clock in the morning—I found Bush and Downes there at the work—I was endeavouring to bring in another stone to the spot which I had selected a particular stone to go into on the Thursday, and</p>

               <p>when I found I could not do so I went to the spot where I had seen the particular stone on the Thursday, and found it was gone—I asked Dowries where the stone was gone—he made use of a very vulgar expression, and wished to know if I thought he had eaten the stone—I then said, "I will see if there is any more missing," and in the result I missed two stones—I made some inquiries, and missed them—I mentioned that to both Downes and Bush—Downes said, God Almighty knew where the stones were, he did not—Bush did not say anything at that time—in less than two minutes I had a note put into my hand, and in consequence of what I learnt from that, I said to them, "How came you to put the stone into a cart this morn<lb/>ing?"—I asked them if they put the stone into a cart that morning—Bush said he had put some stone into the cart that morning, and he was very sorry for it—they did not mention any time in the morning when they had put it into the cart—I then asked them whose cart it was—he said he did not know, neither did he know the party driving the cart, nor the party the stone was for—Downes said he was not there when the stone was put into the cart, but Bush said to him, "You know all about it; you know I told you this morn<lb/>ing; for the party that received it, you know, agreed with us last night for the stone"—I then asked Downes how he came to let that particular stone go, when he was aware there was no other stone on the spot that would come into that individual place, and that I had appointed the stones to be laid there—I did not say anything more to them, but I gave them in charge to a policeman, who took them to the Police-court directly, at Greenwich—Downes was the mason; but neither he, nor Bush, his labourer, had any authority to sell this stone to Bond, or to any one else, only to work it in that work, and he perfectly well knew that I was in want of 2500 feet of stone beside, to do that work with—after the hearing, the case was remanded for a week—on Wednes<lb/>day, the 10th of Dec., Bond called on me—he spoke to me first, and said he had called to see me about the stone—I had never seen him till that day—I directly called my foreman, and said, "Now, what you have to say to me you will say in presence of my foreman"—I then asked Bond if I had ever, pre<lb/>vious to that moment, spoken to him, or had any dealings with him, or any transactions of any kind with him—he answered no, but that he wanted some stone, and he went to the men and agreed for some stone and that he was anxious to settle for it—I then asked him why he did not come to me instead of going to my men—he said he did not know—I then asked him whose cart it was that took the stone away—he said he did not know—I then told him that, as the men were remanded for a week, he had better go to the inspector, and give him what information he could upon it, as I considered it a bad case, and I thought it would be better for him if he could find out whose cart took the stone away, as he wished to appear so innocent about it—I heard him say afterwards at the Police-court that it was his son's cart that took the stone—he was then in the witness-box—some one connected with the Court put him there—I afterwards saw the stone, and it was mine.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever been tried yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know what you allude to—I never stood in the dock charged with felony—I have for a mis<lb/>demeanour—how can I tell what became of the girl who made the charge against me?—I do not know that any one took care that she should not go before the Grand Jury—I am perfectly aware that if I had given 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the malicious case never would have been brought on—it was heard before the Magistrates at Lewisham, and I was held to bail to answer it—I never saw the young woman appear—Mr. Whittle, of No. 7, Parliament-street, was my attorney—I suppose the young woman made a charge before the Magistrates, but I was not present when she made the charge—she charged me with attempting to ravish her—she was a servant of mine, and she had notice to leave, and, by what I understand since, she wanted to go to Lee races, and her mistress would not let her go, and then she brought this charge against me—it was all false, and I believe it was considered so gross that the Grand Jury threw it out—I did not see the girl in this Court or before the Grand Jury—my solicitor told me that 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would settle it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The girl never appeared before the Grand Jury, and the bill was ignored? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know, sir—the bill was thrown out, I believe—I do not know—I cannot tax my memory so far as to say whether it was in Aug., 1838.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, I ask you whether you do not know that the bill was not found, and that after your attorney told you that 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would settle it, the girl did not appear, and you came here to take your acquittal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I never came here and pleaded—I was living at that time at Sydenham—I staid at Syden<lb/>ham six years after that charge—I have now left Sydenham four years, and reside at Greenwich—I did not quit Sydenham almost immediately after that charge—I staid there about six years afterwards—I left there to reside at Greenwich—I have lived nowhere else.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did anybody call at your premises on the following morning after this stone was stolen, with the measure of the stone, offering to pay you the amount of the stone, before any charge was preferred against anybody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, sir, certainly not—the first I heard of anybody calling at my premises was on the evening after the men were charged—that was on the Friday evening—I gave them in charge on the Friday morning, the 5th of Dec., about eleven o'clock—that was the morning on which the cart came and took the stones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On that same evening did Bond, or Bond's son, come to your house, with the measure of the stone, offering to pay for it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was reported to me to have come on Friday evening—I was not at home—I am quite sure I was not at home—I saw him on Wednesday morning, the 10th—he had not been to my house at all, to my knowledge, between the 5th and the 10th—I heard he had been two or three times—I do not know Charles Bond—I had not seen any one connected with Bond before the Wednesday—I did not see Bond on Monday morning, the 8th of Dec., nor on the morn<lb/>ing of the 5th or the 6th—I learned, when I returned home on the Friday evening, that he had been to my house—I do not know that he is a respect<lb/>able tradesman at Greenwich—my father has not been in the habit of dealing with him, to my knowledge—my father employed a great number of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the Magistrate make this statement to you at the time you were before him, "I think the men have done you no injustice in selling this de<lb/>fective stone, and I can't see the least particle of felony in it"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The Ma<lb/>gistrate did say that, which I consider was very unjust—the Magistrate was Mr. Grove.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I live at the house of Mr. Thomas Hamblin, No. 3, Crayford-road, Camberwell. On Sunday, the 14th of Dec, a few minutes before eight in the evening, there was a knock at the door—I opened it and found the prisoner Smith there, with a letter in his hand, which he asked me to deliver to the lady of the house—I asked him where he brought it from—he said, "It is all right, take it to the lady of the house"—I asked him again where it came from—he still said it was all right, did I choose to deliver it to the lady of the house, if not he would shoot me—he put his hand into his pocket and drew out something which I took for a pistol—it was rather in the dark, but something shone—I then took the letter from him—Catherine Hamblin was at that time at home—I went and delivered the letter to her in the kitchen—the prisoner was in the hall—she went into the drawing-room with it—the man stood in the hall and I stood in the passage, which is the same thing—he was about three yards from the stairs, or not quite so long—I observed that he had a pistol in one hand, and the white handle of a dirk or dagger in the other—Mr. Phillips came out of the drawing-room, and Mrs. Hamblin after him—Mr. Phillips asked the prisoner by what right he demanded money there—I could not hear what the prisoner said—I then heard Mrs. Hamblin say something to Mr. Phillips, but I do not think the prisoner was near enough to hear what passed—she was on the stairs and he was in the hall where he was at first—Mrs. Hamblin then went up stairs—I did not see her go up—I heard the prisoner say he would give two minutes before he called his men in to plunder—Mr. Phillips then went up stairs after Mrs. Hamblin—he came down again and went to the prisoner in the hall—I did not hear distinctly what he said to him—I did not see him give the prisoner anything, but he spoke to him and then he went away—Mr. Phillips followed him to the door—I have no doubt the prisoner is the man.</p>

               <p>No. 3, Crayford-row, Camberwell. I was at home a few minutes before eight o'clock on Sunday evening, the 14th of Dec.—I heard a knock at the door about that time—I was in the kitchen—Mrs. Gallavan, who lives in my house, opened the door—I heard an altercation at the door—Mrs. Gallavan came to me in the kitchen, and gave me this letter,</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>—"For the lady of the house. My Lady, I write these few lines to inform you that I have been sent here by a gentleman for your money, and I must proceed in getting it; and if you refuse me, the men outside, twelve in number will come in and plunder the house; and if you make any noise your lives will be in danger.")</p>
               <p>The kitchen is on the same floor as the hall—I went from the kitchen into the hall—it is a square hall; and as I passed I saw the man standing—the prisoner Smith is the man, to the best of my knowledge—I went through the hall into the drawing-room—Mr. Phillips was there—I read the letter to him, and I think delivered it to him—I was very much agitated, indeed, on reading it, very much alarmed and terrified, I thought my life was in danger, and I made my way out of the house by the back door—I saw the servant next door, and told her to run immediately for the police—I then came back to the hall—I found Mr. Phillips there—he made some communication to me—I do not know whether the man heard it—he was still in the hall—I think it was in the hall that Mr. Phillips told me this, but, in my agitation, I do not recollect sufficiently—in consequence of what he said, I attempted to go out at the back door, to get money for the man, seeing he would not go out without—I did not hear him say so—on my attempting to go out at the back door, the man interfered to prevent me, with a pistol in his hand—he said, "You don't pass here," and closed the door—finding I could not pass that way, I went again into the drawing-room, and attempted to open the window to get out that way; but the man came out at the back door, and round the garden, and faced me at the window, as I was in the act of pushing it up—the drawing-room is on the ground-floor, and looks to the back of the house—there is a flower-bed under the window—I was in the act of pushing the sash up, and he came and lifted up the pistol, with his face close to the window—I saw the pistol dis<lb/>tinctly—he was just in the act of raising it, and was close to the window—upon that I quitted the window, and went into the hall, and the man had come back and was in the hall—he did not speak to me, or do anything then—I went up stairs—I could not find any money anywhere, and I went to see if I had got any up stairs—whilst I was up stairs I heard the man in the hall say, "Is that lady coming down?—two minutes more"—during the whole of this time I was in a state of very great alarm indeed—Mr. Phillips came up stairs after me—he pulled out a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and, after telling me what he intended to do, he went down stairs with it.</p>

I was paying a visit to her on Sunday night, the 14th of Dec, and about eight, or shortly after, she came to me in the drawing-room, where her sick husband was lying—(I did not hear the knock)—she was in a state of the greatest agitation and alarm—she produced this letter and read it to me; on hearing which, I went into the hall and saw the prisoner Smith—I went up to him, and said, "Pray, what is your business here, sir?"—his answer was," I am come for</p>

               <p>the money there is in the house; and if I don't obtain it in a very short time, I shall immediately call in the men that are outside, and the house will be plundered"—I saw a dirk in his right hand, which he evidently wished I should see; and whilst he was speaking with me, probably with a view to alarm me, he drew from his left hand pocket a horse pistol—he did not say anything, but went to the street door, opened it, gave a whistle, and in came a second man, armed as he was, with a dirk in one hand, and in his other hand what I believe to be a horse pistol—they spoke together—I did not hear what they said—there was not light enough in that part of the hall for me to distinguish the features of the second man—he stood just by the entrance of the door—there was a lamp on the left hand, and the light shone obliquely—I at first hesitated for a moment whether I should not make a grand dash at Smith and upset him, which I thought I had strength enough to do; but when I saw the other man close to his elbow, I thought it would be a very imprudent thing—I then went through the passage towards the garden, and he went too—I saw Mrs. Hamblin very shortly after—she had been out, as she has described, and came in from the garden—Smith said, "If I can obtain 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I will go away immediately, and take my men with me"—Mrs. Hamblin then went up stairs—she had not been up stairs half a minute before the prisoner called out, "Is that lady coming down stairs?" in a kind of authoritative tone, and he said, "If she is not down in two minutes with the money, the men shall cer<lb/>tainly come in and plunder the house"—there was no other person in the house but my sick brother-in-law, my sister, and Mrs. Gallavan—I followed my sister up stairs; and recollecting that I had received a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note two or three days previously from Williams, Deacon, and Co., I thought I would let him have that, because it might be a means of his detection—my sister and I came down stairs together—I went up to Smith with the note in my hand, and said, "Here is a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; if I give you this, will you immediately be off, and take your men with you?"—he said he would, and I gave him the note—I gave it him to get rid of him—I cannot say but I was somewhat alarmed; I think if you had been there you would have been alarmed too—there was cer<lb/>tainly a terror produced in my mind from what I read and saw—it was from that I was induced to give him the note—my sister continued in a state of great alarm and terror—the prisoner took the note, and went towards the hall door—I followed him—he turned round, and presented a pistol at my breast, and vowed, if I followed him, or even looked after him, he would shoot me—he then went out—I turned immediately from him, and he shut the door after him—within about five minutes after he was gone I went down to the police station—Inspector Campbell was not there at that time—he came shortly afterwards—he examined the garden and the drawing-room window, and the whole of the place—I think I saw him examine the flower-bed by the drawing-room window—I had received the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., note from Williams, Deacon, and Co., for this check, which I have, dated 10th Dec—I received the note on that same day, in exchange for this check of Mr. Pitman's—the prisoner Smith is the man to whom I gave the note.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-inspector, P division.</hi>) In consequence of information, on Sunday night, the 14th of Dec, about nine o'clock, I went to Mrs. Hamblin's house—the letter which has been read was put into my hands by Mr. Phillips—I went to the back of the premises, into the garden, and observed under the drawing-room window a little flower-bed with some footmarks on it—on the following Saturday I received from a gentleman named Reynolds a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note, which I produce, and on the Tuesday following I went to the house No. 3, Catherine-place, Walnut-tree-walk, Lam<lb/>beth—I knocked at the door—the male prisoner opened it—I asked if Mrs. Jones was at home—he said yes, and the female prisoner then came forward—I said I came from Mr. Attenborough, the pawnbroker, in consequence of a slight mistake in the change she had received for a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note on the 15th—she said the change was all right—I said, "You recollect the circumstance to which I allude: it was when you redeemed a watch in pledge for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and paid for it with a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—she said, "Yes, I perfectly recollect it, but the change, was all correct"—I then said, "I must now request to know from whom you received that note"—the male prisoner had retired into the inner room at that time, and he might not have heard what passed—she said, "From my hus<lb/>band"—I asked her when—she said, "On Saturday evening, the 13th," which was the Saturday evening preceding the robbery—I asked where her husband was—she said he was at work at Uxbridge, and he had brought it home on the Saturday night, and returned on the Sunday evening to Ux<lb/>bridge—I asked whom he was at work for—she said she did not know the name, but it was for a bricklayer and plasterer—I then gave a signal to Wright, the officer, whom I had waiting outside, and he came in—I said, "We will step into the inner room," and I went into the inner room with her—the officer followed me—the male prisoner was there—I then said, "The truth is, this note has been stolen, and your position in the affair will a great deal depend on the answers you give; I will now repeat the question I did before."</p>

I was in company with Mr. Campbell, on the 23rd of Dec, when he went to No. 3, Catherine-place—I waited outside—when I was called in I saw the prisoner Smith—I asked what he did there—he said he was a lodger—I asked him how long he had lodged there—he said a month—I asked if he knew anything of the female—he said no, he did not—I had seen Jones in the room at that time—I told him I must take him into custody on suspicion of stealing a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—he said he knew nothing about it—in the room where Jones was I saw a quantity of new ware<lb/>ing apparel, such as gowns, and also coats and things of Smith's—there was the wearing apparel of a man and woman—I asked Jones how she came by them—she said it was out of the money from the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—there was a new coat, two pairs of new trowsers, and three waistcoats claimed by Smith—he said they were all his property—I believe there were four gowns, not quite new—I took Smith to the station, and then returned to the room, and searched it—in a corner, under a box, I found this powder-flask, with gunpowder in it—and I found this pair of shoes under the bed in the same room—there are two rooms</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You fancied you were doing the Custom-house nicely? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, sir, I did not—the prisoner told me it was smuggled tea and tobacco—I did not think till afterwards that I was cheating the revenue—I do not know whether I believed that it was smuggled—I am certain the prisoner is the man—I know him by his features—the first time I saw him was between two and three o'clock) and afterwards at a little after six—he remained then about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I knew from my wife that the prisoner had called in the morning, and I was out—she was with me when I paid the prisoner the money, and was examined as a witness before the Magistrate—she did not say she did not believe the prisoner was the man—I do not know what she said, I was out of the room at the time—I did not require the prisoner to have his hat pat on, before I could swear to him—I did not at first say I could not swear to him—I am certain of that—as soon as I went into the room I said, "That is the man"—he was called out for me to look at him—that was the next day—Smith said in my hearing that he would not swear to the man unless he saw his hat on—he saw his hat on after he got into the room—my wife did not say, to my knowledge, that the prisoner seemed much stouter than the man—I did not hear her say that she did not think he was the man—she was frightened to that she could not say anything.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not you know that the prisoner has been trying to get your wife here as a witness? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know there has been somebody about there that said she was wanted at the Old Bailey—I have not been asked to tell her Christian name—some of my neighhours have—I do not know that that was for the purpose of a subpoena to bring her here—she is not here—I did not know she was wanted—some persons were there, and said she was wanted at the Old Bailey—they asked for Sarah lies, she said, "That is not my name, therefore I will not go"—her name is Elizabeth—I am quite sure the prisoner was at my place at a little after six o'clock, and he was there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and he was there about the same time in the afternoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in William-street, Waterloo-road, and am a coffin<lb/>maker and undertaker. I was at Mr. lies, on Tuesday, the 9th of Dec, and saw the prisoner, he came to me in the afternoon, as I was making a potato<lb/>bin in the passage, for Mr. Iles—I saw him again in the evening behind the counter—he had what appeared to me to be this parcel in his hand—he threw it down—I did not see any parcel opened—I saw a knife put in, and saw<lb/>dust come out—I am certain the prisoner is the man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You had never seen him before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not till that day—I did not say he must have his hat on before I could swear to him—I said his stomach seemed rather too high for me, but any man could make that—I wanted his hat on for more confidently speaking—he appeared a stouter lyyooking man when I saw him at the police-court, but his features and</p>

               <p>whiskers were exactly the same—I did not examine the parcels any more than sticking the knife in—I was not wanted to be one of the party to smoke the pipe, nor to drink the whiskey—I had my suspicion—I was not aware of the prisoner coming.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 9, Little Chapel-street, Westminster. The prisoner lodged at my house—I remember the 9th of Dec.—I saw the prisoner at home that day from dusk, about four o'clock, or a little after four o'clock till bed-time—he was cleaning my clock, and playing with my child till bed-time—he could not have gone that evening, and been ten minutes at Mr. Iles's in Kennington-lane—Mr. Iles's is about two miles from my house—I am positive the prisoner was at home that evening from about four o'clock till bed-time—I went to bed between ten and eleven.</p>
