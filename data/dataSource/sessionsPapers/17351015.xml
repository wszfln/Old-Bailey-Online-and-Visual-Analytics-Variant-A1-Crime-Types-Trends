Three Weeks and three Days before the death of the Deceas'd, I lett a Room up two pair of Stairs backwards to Margaret Hambleton, Widow. Her two Daughters (the other two Prisoners) lived with her, and she said she had another Daughter (the Deceased) who lived in a Merchant's Service, and that she seldom had an Opportunity of seeing her above once a Year. And I never saw this Daughter alive. There was one

            , that used to come to see the Prisoners almost every Day. On the seventeenth of September about noon, a Boy came to my House with a Coffin. I told him he mistook the House. He said, No, for Margaret Hambleton, my Lodger, had ordered it to be brought for a Maid who was out of Place and died suddenly. So I went up with the Boy to her Door with a piece of Packthread and a Stick put into the Staple, for there was no Lock; I bounced against it, and forced it open, and behind it the Deceased lay dead on the Floor, covered all but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173510150003"/> her Face with a piece of an old Flock Bed. There was no living Person there, nor any Furniture, not so much as a Stool or a Chair. I was frighted, and went down with the Boy. He waited for his Money, and by-and-by Margaret the Mother, and Rebecca her eldest Daughter came home. The Mother said to the Boy, I see you are got here before me. I asked her if she had any body dead in her Room. She answered, What's that to you. I told her if it was so, she ought to have acquainted me with it, Truly, says her Daughter, you have a great deal of Impudence to ask if any body's dead in our Room. You don't know nor never shall, for it is none of your business. And so they and the Boy went up I went and told my Neighbours, who sent for the Searchers, and I sent for my Husband, who was upon the Guard at St. James's - I do not know that the Prisoners ever had any Furniture in the Room, for I never saw them bring any in. The Searchers came about Candle-light, and we went up. The Door was then fastened as before. I got it open and we found the Body in the Coffin, and a Pan whelmed on the Lid. The Mother and Daughter were then gone out again, but in a little while they returned, and the other Daughter Peggy, and

The Searchers asked her why she did not tell the Neighbours of the young Woman's being dead. She said it was her own dear Child, her own dear Kitty, and she died of Convulsion Fits. There was a bloody Rag pinned about her Neck. There were black Marks about her Throat, a Bruise on her Temple, another on her Cheek, one on her Shoulder, and one on her Breast, but the rest of her Body was very fair; and the Searchers said, she could not die of Convulsions, because her Nails were white and clear.

She said she died in the Morning, and she did not care to disturb us. I look'd round the Room, and seeing only a Flock Bed no bigger than a Sack, I asked them if there was all their Goods, and what I must have for my Rent. The eldest Daughter said, they never designed to pay me any. Then she wiped the Purging at the Deceas'd's Nose and Mouth, and thereupon she bled fresh Blood, as if a Vein had been opened. I lay on the Ground Floor, and heard no Noise in the Night.</p>

We went first by Candle-light, but the Deceased bled so much at her Mouth and Nose that we could not observe the Marks about her Neck; but next Morning we went again, and found she was bruised much under the right Ear, where the Skin was raised and several Bruises about the Neck and Shoulders, but the rest of her Body was clear, and her Hands and Fingers were white and open. Her Mother said she died of Convulsion Fits, but I think she must have been strangled. For in Convulsion Fits, the Nails and Fingers will be black thus far, and the Bowels will presently turn green - I advised them to send for a Surgeon who had more Skill than I.</p>

About a Fortnight before the Deceased's death, her Mother told me that she was sick with Fits, and was to come home from her Service. I went to see her two or three Days after she came home; she had a violent black Eye, and looked as if she had been beat. I asked her if she had Fits, and she said no. The Saturday before the Deceased died, her Sister Peggy (the Girl there) came to our House crying, and said, her Mother had been beating her Sister Kitty (the Deceased.) I went down to a Chandler's Shop, and there I saw the other Prisoner Beck at the Door. She was crying too, and said to me, You never saw such a barbarous Creature as my Mother, I lifted Kitty off the Bed and set her to lean against the Window, and my Mother knocked her down on the Floor with her Fist, and said, D - ye, it's all along of you! and Kitty<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173510150004"/> looked up, and asked what that was for? On Sunday Morning I went to see her. She was sitting on the old Flock Bed which my Mother gave them out of Charity, for they had no other Furniture. I asked her if she knew me, and she put her Hand up to her Forehead, and said, O Lord, what must I do? She said no more, and they afterwards told me, that was the last Word she spoke. I went again on Monday (the Day before she died) and then she was dozing, but did not seem to be troubled with any Distemper - They said they had given her two of Ward's Pills, and next Day in the Afternoon I found her lying dead on the Floor. Her Mother said she died in Fits, and wiped her Nose, but the more she wiped, the more clear Blood came. They put her in the Coffin, and mop'd up some blood behind the Door, and then came to my Mothers and drank Tea. I came back with them at Candle-light, and several People were then in their Room. The Mother said, I think here is a hundred People, if I had any Goods I might be robbed. Beck wiped the Deceased's Mouth, and Blood came out of her Mouth and Nose.</p>

               <p>Mr. Wilkie, Surgeon. On Saturday after the Deceased's death, at the desire of the Coroner, I viewed the Body in St. Martin's Work house. On each side of her Neck there was a Mark of Fingers; the Skin was quite rubbed off across the Throat, and from one Mark to the other there was part of a black Circle, all which appeared to be made by a violent Pressure on the Gullet, and from thence I judge that she had been strangled. There was a Bruise on her Shoulder, but I did not think that material. As she had been dead so long, I could form no Judgment as to her having had Fits.</p>
               <p>Q. Could she have been strangled without leaving a Mark quite round her Neck?</p>
               <p>Mr. Wilkie. Yes; for by pressing the Gullet the Vessels would be obstructed, and she would be strangled of course.</p>

            . Webb's Father keeps an Alehouse in Vine-street, St. James's. He shew'd me this Hand-saw, and said his Son brought it home, and told him he pick'd it up in Chelsea Fields. I know it was the Deceased's Saw, for I bought it for him.</p>

               <p>Dr. Middleton. There was a large Fracture on the Right Side of the Head; the Skull was broke to pieces, and the pieces forced quite down upon the Brain by the Violence of the Blow, which without doubt was the Cause of his Death.</p>
               <p>Webb. I was coming with some Company from Chelsea, the Deceased and Palmer affronted us, and Palmer was the first Man that struck, and the Deceased was the next. - I found the Saw in the Field; the Justice bid me give it to the Constable, but he would not take it, and so I carried it to my Father's.</p>
               <p>Abr. Webb the Elder. My Son came home at Ten at Night, and brought the Saw which was bloody.

I'll take Care of your Bundle the while, and give ye Three-pence now, and Three-pence when you come back. So he gave me Three-pence, and I left the Cloth on the Bulk, but when I returned he was gone. After a long Enquiry, and describing him to several People, I heard that such a Person who used to follow such Practices, lodged at a Barber's Shop in Rose-and-Crown Court in Moorfields, and there I found him, and am positive that he is the Man, for I saw him plainly by the Light of the Evening, and a Light in an Apothecary's Shop.

She put one Hand under my Chin, and said, Come, my Dear, fill my Glass for me; and so I did, but putting my Hand in my Pocket soon after, I mist my Money, among which was a French Half Crown. I charged her with picking my Pocket, but she denied it. The Landlord came in; I told him I had been robb'd, but he only laugh'd at me. Then she offer'd me the French Half Crown to be easy, but I would not take it, and so she threw it upon the Table. At last, upon my making a Noise, a Constable came, and I desired him to search her, but the Landlord pushed her aside and would not let him. The Constable then said he must carry us both to the Counter. - I thought it was very hard to lose my Money and go to the Counter too.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He laid the Half Crown under the Candlestick, and said I should have it if I would humour him in his Way so and so, which is very unheathenly to mention; whereof when I refused, he charged me with picking his Pocket. <rs id="t17351015-15-verdict61" type="verdictDescription">

            </rs>.</p>
               <p>Col. Des Romaine. On the twenty fifth of October, 1733. about eight at Night, I heard some body knock at the Door. My Maid who was below, not coming up, I took a Candle and went to the Door my self. As soon as I had unbolted it, a Man thrust his Foot between the Door and the Threshold, and seizing me by the Shoulder, swore he must have my Money, and if I made a Noise, he would shoot me dead. However, I pushed the Door as hard as I could with my Hand, and cryed out Murder, and called to my Maid, and bid her call my Men to bring the Pistols. I was in hopes by this to make the Rogues think I had Men in the House, though I had none. But presently I was struck across the Head with a Cutlace. I still kept the Door to, upon which another of them said, D - him, beat his Brains out: and then I received such a Blow with the Butt end of a Pistol, that I lost two of my Teeth, and was afraid my Eye was put out. I fell down, and four Men rushed in. One of them went towards the Maid, and the other three rifled me of a Gold Watch, two Rings, about fifteen or sixteen Shillings in Silver. While they were searching my right Pockets, I slipt a Purse with six Guineas and a half out of my left Fob and thrust it under the Matt on the Floor. They tyed my Hands, and dragged me up Stairs, and threatned, and struck me again with a Pistol to make me discover where my Money was, but I told them I had none. They opened my Trunk, and took out a Box of Plate. The Trunk had a double Cover, in which I had forty five Guineas and a half. They did not then open the upper Cover, which gave me some hopes that they would not find the Money. They took two Pistols and a Silver-hilted Sword out of a Closet. One of them was for breaking the Blade, but the others opposed it. After this they all three took me down Stairs again, and at the Parlor Door I saw my Maid lying with her Petticoats turned up, and the fourth Man putting up his Breeches. He was very tall, and like the Prisoner, but I cannot be positive to his Face, for the Blood run over my Eyes, so that I could hardly see. Then they tyed my Hands behind me so hard, that the Cord was hid under the Flesh of my Wrists, which put me to such violent Pain that I thought the Torture of putting the Question could not be worse, and the Marks made by the Cords remained in my Wrists for a Year after. They put a Napkin over my Face and the Maids Petticoat and Gown over my Head, and in this Condition I remained from eight at Night till three the next Morning. They bound the Maid close by me in the Parlor. I heard her say, For God's sake let me alone. I could feel her move, and hear them go backwards and forwards. They came to me several times and beat me over the Head with a Pistol, but her Petticoat broke the Blow. One of them said, O ye old Rogue! You told us you had no Money. By which I concluded that they had found the Guineas in my Trunk. I desired them not to abuse me in that manner, but rather kill me, and so put me out of my Misery. Presently I felt something like a Hanger put under the Petticoat to my Neck. Upon which my Maid cried, For God's sake do not kill my Master, rather kill me. Between two and three o'Clock, hearing no Noise, I told my Maid that I believed they were gone. She said she feared they were not, and begged me for God's sake not to hazard my Life. However, I ventured to move about till at last I got my Back towards her, and she with much Difficulty untyed my Hands, and being thus got loose, I went into the Passage. I perceived a Light in the Fore Parlor, which at first gave me some Apprehensions<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173510150009"/> that they were not yet gone. But hearing nothing stit, I ventured forward and found no body, and the Door was left ajar.</p>

            . Brown and Whitlock * (who were since executed for this Fact) and I being Prisoners in the New Jail, agreed to rob Mr. Sherrack the King's Jeweller at Paddington, Brown and I were acquitted at Croydon Assizes, and Whitlock was acquitted in the Country. We committed several Robberies on the Highway. And Brown and I meeting afterwards at Paddington, we happened to quarrel, and so we parted without doing any business at that time. But I going into Southwark met with Whitlock, and went to drink at Pepper Alley. He asked me where Brown lived. I told him that Brown and I both lodged at one White's an Alehouse at the Hand-and-Flower in the Grainge near Barnaby Street. On the twenty fifth of October we all three met at White's and agreed to rob the King's Jeweller that Day, but we wanted another Hand. So we went to Rag Fair to see for Long Will, not the Prisoner, but another Long Will, one

             (Garscee) who kept a Brandy-shop in Tyburn Road, and asked him to go with us, but he said he had left off dealling that way, and that he did not care to venture again. Brown asked him if he knew where Long Will (the Prisoner) was. Yes, says Gassy, I believe he is at his Mothers, and I will step and fetch him; but while we we were talking, the Prisoner came in. We drank a Bowl of Punch together above Stairs, and told him what Lay we were upon. He made no Objection, but that he had no Arms, upon which I lent him one of my Pistols, and so about seven o'Clock we went to the King's Jeweller's House, but seeing an Iron Grate in the Door to look through, they said it would never take. However, says I, let us do Business if we can. Ring the Bell, and see whether they will open the Door or not. So we rung, and a Servant coming to the Door, we asked her if Madam de Batt was there. She answered, No, she is just gone. So we went away and consulted what do; we agreed to go to Col. Romaine's, which we did. Brown and I went foremost, and having put back the Bolt of the Yard Door, we came to the Door of the House and knocked. The Colonel himself opened it, and I thrust my Foot in between the Door and the Threshold, and struck him on the Head with a Cutlace. He cryed out Murder, and called to his Maid to bid his Men bring the Pistols. But we forced in, and as we were tying his Hands, Whitlock and the Prisoner came in, and I asked them why they did not come up sooner. We risled him and bound his Hands behind him, and carried him into the back Parlor. The Prisoner seiz'd the Maid, who came up with a Candle, and we tyed her Hands in the same Room. Then I and Brown and Whitlock took the Colonel up Stairs to make him shew us where the Money was, and left the Prisoner with the Maid. We began to break open a Chest, but he desired us to untie his Hands, and he would give us the Keys. We took out a parcel of Plate, and some Pearl Necklaces, but I saw no Money there, and if they found any they sunk it. We went up another Pair of Stairs, and turned the Beds up to examine them. We took a rough Draught of what was there -</p>

               <p>Mitchel. We gave a look round the Room, and then went into his Daughter's Chamber and broke open a Chest of Drawers and took out some Head Clothes and other Women's Apparel. We went again to the Colonel, bound his Hands again behind him, and carried him down Stairs with us. Coming into the Entry, we saw the Maid lying with her Coats up, and the Prisoner on his Knees putting up his Breeches. D - ye you Rogue, says I, You ought to think of other<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173510150010"/> things at such a time as this. And turning to the Maid, I said, my Dear, has he hurt ye? She made no answer, but cryed. Whitlock often went to the Colonel, and threatned him to make him discover his Money, and once he took a Knife and was going to cut his Throat. After this we brought the Things all into one Room and packed them up, and went away about three in the Morning. The Prisoner had the Plate in a Box, and I put what Goods I had in a Basket. We staid in the Fields till the Watch was gone off, and then took Water to Pepper Alley, and went from thence to White's in the Grange, where Brown and I and our Wives lodged. Brown's Wife let us in, and we went into her Room, where we opened the Goods and shared the Linnen. Brown and I and Whitelock went with the Gold Watch and Plate to

We went back and gave the Prisoner his Share of this Money, and two Guineas more for his Snack in the Brocades. It being then near Night, he said he must go over the Water, and would return in a little while. But I saw him no more till he was apprehended - I have known him four or five Years, but never was concerned with him in any Fact besides this.</p>

It not being quite light, I said to the Prisoner, I should know you by your Tongue. Is not your Name Blackwell, was not you a Soldier, and did not you live in St. Giles's, and sell Geese and Rabbitt? Yes, says he, and I have known you from a Child. Where did you get these Goods? says I; my Husband answered, they had been a Smuggling. But when he and Brown and Whitlock were gone to sell the Plate, the Prisoner told me they got the Goods at Colonel Romaines.</p>

We thought it not proper to seize him till that Man was gone, and so we followed at a distance, till coming towards the Vine Tavern in Holborn, the Man wished him a good Night, and bid him hold by the Horse's Main. Never fear, Cockey, says the Prisoner, for, D - my Eyes I shall do well enough. The Man being gone, we pulled the Prisoner off his Horse, upon which he cried I am a dead Man! my Glass is run, D - my Eyes!

I lay there an Hour by St. Paul's Clock, which I heard strike; and if they had not taken my Buckles I had lain longer; for having got my Shoes off, I at last got my Legs loose.

The Prosecutor started back, and the Prisoner gave him a Punch in the Face: We took him down a Lane and rifled him. They took his Hat, Wig, Watch, Ring and Money, and I took his Buckles. We tied his Legs and Arms behind him, and told him he should be released in a little Time. He asked us how he should know that? And Morpeth fired a Pistol, and said that was a Sign for one to come to his Relies; but this was only said to make him easy. We went thence to the Magpye Tavern at Bishopsgate, where they produced Half a Crown and two Half-pence. I said that the Gentleman told me that he had lost two Guineas. They swore then the Gentleman was a Rogue, and that People often pretend to have lost more than they really have. The Prisoner had the Watch and Ring to dispose of, and next Day he told us that he had pawned the Watch for a Guinea and a Half, and sold the Ring (having knock'd the Stone out because it had a Coat of Arms in it) for 4 s. 6 d. 5 s. 6 d. or 6 s. 6 d.

            . About Nine at Night my Apprentice sent for me from the Tavern, and told me the Prisoner, who was then in my Shop, had stole my Goods. I took the Prisoner backwards, and calling in two of my Workmen, I charged him with taking such Goods. After a long Hesitation, and often desiring me to go up Stairs, he gave me 16 Verges out of his Mouth (all of them were of no greater Bulk than a Chew of Tobacco) 17 Studs of Brass, 23 Ballances, 10 Setts of Steel Works, belonging to Watch - Movements, three Pounds and three Quarters of Brass, and a File, out of his Pockets. He said he was ashamed of and sorry for what he had done, and begged for Mercy, and that I would not send him to Jail.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I deliver them to you the Minute you came in, and tell you that I intended to buy them, and not to defraud you?</p>
               <p>King. No. It was a long Time before I could bring him to confess.</p>

            . The Prisoner came into the Shop for some Brass, and bought a little. Then he wanted some Ballances. I shewed him a Parcel, but soon missing some of them, I watched him. Next he asked for Verges; I told out 32, and saw him put several into his Mouth, and I had but 27 back; and besides, I miss'd a Dozen out of the Box; and after that I miss'd ten Steel Works; upon which I made an Excuse to send for my Master, and when he came I spoke to him aside, and told him what the Prisoner had done - All that the Prisoner bought came but to Nine-pence Half-penny.</p>

But from nine at Night to eleven I was not once out. The Girl came between nine and ten for two Herrings, and carried them away, but she came no more that Night, nor was she at all in the little Room. And Mrs. Tomson, who then lodged in the same House, but is since dead, was with me in that Room from eight till past ten: Next Day, as the Prisoner and I and the Spanish Embastinder's Silver Smith (who is now gone over Sea) were sitting in that Room, this Girl and another came in for a Quartern of Gin; they laughed and talked how they had served two Boys, and this Girl said, I paid his Shins with the Fire-shovel, I love to play at Man and Wife, but I do not like him. She came two or three times that Day for Gin, upon which the Prisoner said to his Wife, why do you let them Girls drink Gin? I would have you deny them.

Why, says he, It is like an Irish Leg, as thick at bottom as it is at top. With that she up with her Leg and kicked him on the Parts, and he hit her a Box on the Ear. She reel'd against the Door, and said, Call my Cosin, call my Cousin; she is at a Gin shop next Door. So came her Cousin (the other Prisoner Armstrong) with an Oyster Knife in her Hand, and swore she'd cut his Nose off. He laughed, and said, sure you won't serve me so? She swore yes but she would, and called him Irish Thief. She went out, he followed, she gave him a Push, and I don't know whether he pushed her again, but she turned short and stabbed him in the Breast.

I drest his Wounds, and they were both trivial, but for want of due care, the Hemorrhage of Blood from the Calf of his Leg contributed to his Death, for he was harrasded about for two or three Hours, and no body would take him in. And his Animal Spirits being exhausted, he might be be suffocated for want of having his Head laid in a proper position.

I had stood but a little while before I found her Hand in my Pocket, upon which I felt for my Watch, and it being then safe, I staid a little longer, and then we parted; but soon after I felt again for my Watch and it was gone. I described her to the Watchmen, and they found her on the Friday Night following. She confest before the Justice that she had the Watch, and by her Direction it was found at the Pawn-brokers; she says indeed that I gave it her, but this is the common Pretence of such Creatures to make People ashamed to prosecute them; but I knew better, and I hope others will follow my Example.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He picked me up, and took me into the Alley, where he offered such unseemly things that it is a shame to speak of them. He said he had no Money, but if I would oblige him he would pledge his Watch with me; and as he supposed I was commonly to be found thereabouts, he would redeem it the next time he saw me. <rs id="t17351015-33-verdict142" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>- Graham. About Eleven at Night the Prisoner came into an House where I was drinking. His Face and Hands were bloody, and he told me that his Landlord had abused him, and turned him out of his Lodging. It may be your Fault, says I, for when I lodged in the same House, the Man was civil to me. In a little Time I got up and went out; the Prisoner followed, and desired me to let him lie with me for one Night. As he was my Countryman, and destitute of a Lodging, I at last consented, tho' I had another Bed-fellow. So we went to my Room together. I undress'd and went to Bed before the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173510150018"/>My Money was tied fast in the Tail of my Shirt. My other Bed-fellow and I belonging to a Brewhouse three Doors from my Lodging, and being to get up early, I desired the Prisoner to lie on the farther Side, but he would needs lie next to me. In half an Hour my other Bed-fellow got up to go to Work, and after he was gone I am sure my Money was in the Tail of my Shirt, for I had it in my Hand. I went to sleep, and lay above two Hours, and having over-slept myself, I was called up in a Hurry to go to the Brewhouse; upon which I dress'd myself in such haste, that I did not mind whether my Money was safe or not; but in a Quarter of an Hour after I was come to the Brewhouse, I miss'd it. I could not immediately leave the Work I was then about, but in about half an Hour more, I went back and met the Prisoner coming out at the Street-Door. I asked him how he could serve me so as to take my Money, when I had been so civil to him. He answered; What a Noise you make, hold your Tongue, and you'll get your Money again. So we both went up into my Room, and he pulled off his Shoes, and bid me search him. I called to my Landlady, and bid her keep the Door till I fetched a Constable. But I never found my Money. I did not then know the Prisoner's right Name, for he went by the Name of Beau Nash.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He was in Liquor, and so was I, and I know no more of the Money than the Child unborn.</p>

            . I enquir'd who Morris was, and Northall answer'd, that Morris was a Smith at the lower End of Broad-Street. Northall came several Times about it, and at last he said he was employ'd by Devenish (the Prisoner) to whom the Note belonged, and to whom I must pay the Money. After this, the Prisoner came himself, and said it was his Note, and that the Name at Bottom was his own Hand. I had directed the Note, that Morris was a Smith in Broad Street, and asked the Prisoner if that Direction was right, and he said it was. I then asked him if he dealt with Morris, and how he came to owe Morris such a considerable Sum. His answer was, that he himself was a Back-maker; that the Money was owing for Nails and other Things in the Back-making Trade, and that the Sum was not considerable for a Man of his Dealing. This Account I thought was natural enough; thereupon I told him I hoped to get it discounted in two or three Days. For this Purpose I applied to Mr. Conran, and he to Mr. Green a Jeweller, who offered to give Rose Diamonds at a Market Price for the Note, which I agreed to, because I deal in them my self - It's Part of my Business, as a Broker, to get Notes discounted. The Brokers don't usually enquire after the Indorsers; though it's what we ought to do, but we leave that to the Person who discounts the Notes - The Prisoner came five or six Times to see if I had done it - As to the Indorsement, there is not a Letter in Morris's Name that is like his Writing.</p>
