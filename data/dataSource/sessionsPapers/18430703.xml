                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Fitzgerald, a surgeon<lb/>dentist. On the 21st of February, the prisoner, in company with two others, came into our shop—the prisoner requested to have a tooth extracted, and placed his finger on the one he wanted taken out—I looked at it and said it was quite sound—he persisted in having it extracted—I then asked him into the surgery at the back of the shop—he walked in, followed by his two com<lb/>panions—I did not intend them to go in—I had a coat in the surgery and a handkerchief in it—when I went to apply the instrument the prisoner slipped himself about in the chair several times, I presume to prevent his losing the tooth,</p>

               <p>and while that was going on, his companions left the surgery—a few minutes. after the prisoner left, after paying me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for extracting the tooth—I walked to the door to see him out, and on my return missed my coat—the witness Hill was sitting in the outer shop, and she told me something—the prisoner is a little altered since I saw him, but his face is well known to me, living in the neighbourhood—if he is the man he has lost the last tooth but one on the right-hand lower jaw, if he has got that tooth I will say he is not the man—he took the tooth away with him, and might have slipped it in again, cer<lb/>tainly.</p>

I was up stairs in my room—the prisoner was down, outside her own door in the court—I heard her say I had taken her candle and candlestick—I sent one of my children to say I had not got it—I put my head out of window—she used bad expressions, and said I had got them—I came out into the court afterwards, and she accused me of it again—I put on my gown, and went down with my candle and candlestick in my hand to show her it was not hers, and said I had no other—she immediately used bad expressions, took up a knife, and said if I said so again she would cut me—she cut me across the middle of my hand with a knife, then took up a fork and stabbed me in the left arm—I went out, and her husband and her, and another woman, followed me out and all beat me—I lent up against the wall to support myself, for I was quite faint with the loss of blood—a person fetched the police—when he came she had gone into her own room—I put my hand through the window, and pulled the curtain aside, to show the policeman where she was gone—the policeman told me to have my hand attended to, and he would take her in the morning—I went to the work—house—the doctor there would not have anything to do with it, it might be a locked jaw case—I was taken to Charing-cross hospital—they were two hours taking me there, from my continual fainting.</p>

On Thursday, the 15th of June, between half-past four and seven minutes after five o'clock, I had in my sitting-room a watch, on a stand on the mantel-piece, and a tortoiseshell snuff-box, inlaid with silver, mounted with a miniature, and supposed to be set in gold, con<lb/>taining several articles—I had the watch in my possession at twenty minutes after four—the private door was not open, but a latch-key was occasionally left in the hall—somebody must have got in by means of a latch-key, without breaking the door—I do not know the prisoner—I saw some of my property again on Saturday morning—I had seen the door secure myself, at half-past three, and my servants were out of the house at that time, and did not re<lb/>turn till afterwards.</p>

Bank of England notes and ten sovereigns for it—this is the cheque—next evening I was at the Ben Jonson, in Great Wild-street, with Stebbing—I had my purse containing the money there—we had three glasses of brandy and water among three of us—Stebbing went out to fetch a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> for me—he brought the driver into the house, and I am certain the prisoner is that man—I had got the third glass of brandy and water when he came in—I went to my purse and changed a so<lb/>vereign to pay for two glasses of brandy and water in his presence—my notes were then in my purse, for I wrapped them round a bill of exchange, and put them into my purse again—I went out directly from the front of the bar, and got into the cab—both me and Stebbing told the prisoner to drive to No. 16, Passmore-street, Pimlico—I am certain the number was mentioned—I fell asleep on the way, and was awoke by the prisoner at the top of Union-street, where I live, which is nearly a hundred yards from No. 16, Paaamore-street—I paid him his fare, as I had put 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my left hand trowsers pocket for the purpose, at the Ben Jonson—when I got out of the cab I went straight to my house—I did not come in contact with anybody between the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and my own door—I saw nobody—I went to bed directly I got home—all the persons in my house were in bed—I got up between five and six o'clock in the morning, and on putting on my trowsers I missed all my money—my purse was left, and the bill also.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carriage maker, and live in High-street, Shoreditch. On Wednesday afternoon, the 3rd of May, a man named Weymouth, who was tried last Sessions came to me, and the prisoner with him in a pony cart—Weymouth said he wasted to buy a phaeton body—I said I had not any by me at present, but it he would take me in his cart down to Deptford where I had paid for two, he could have one of them, and he took me down to Deptford—the prisoner drove the pony cart down, and Weymouth went in the cart with me—on the road the prisoner told me he was a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>man, that he drove a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> by night, and that he had a son who drove it by day—he said he had bought a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> about fifteen months previous of Wey<lb/>mouth, and it turned out his description was correct—when we got to Dept<lb/>ford, we all three got out—Weymouth selected a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> body, and he and the</p>

               <p>prisoner put it up in the cart—2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be paid for it—Weymouth tendered a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in payment, in the prisoner's presence—I could not give change—we all three drove back to my house, and got out—the prisoner did not come in—he stopped outside—the note was given to my daughter-in-law, who brought change back for it—I placed it on the table—Weymouth paid me, and took the rest—when he left my house he drove away with the prisoner.</p>

On the 29th of June, I saw the prisoner in the Western Dock, with a chest and a hammock—he presented me a pass, and said, "Will you overhaul my things?"—I examined the chest, and then I lifted the hammock, and I said, "What have you got in it to make it so heavy?"—he said, "Only my old wet things"—I desired him to unlash it, which he did partly—I finished, and found in it a silver spoon, and fork, a bag containing 12lbs. of sugar, another with 12lbs. of mixed tea, and another with 3lbs. of coffee—I asked how he came by the spoon and fork—he said, "O, I forgot to give them to the steward, they belong to the ship the <hi rend="italic">Sophia</hi>"—I asked how he came by the other things—he said a sailor on board Captain Selby's ship gave them to him—I knew Captain Selby's ship was the <hi rend="italic">David Lion</hi>—he said afterwards that he did not get them from Captain Selby's vessel, but from a sailor on board a foreign ship.</p>

I received directions from Mr. West to watch hit premises at Cowley—about eight o'clock in the morn<lb/>ing of the 2nd of July I saw Taylor stop with a horse and cart near Good<lb/>man's house, about a mile from the prosecutor's shop—Goodman came to the cart—Taylor took a piece of mutton in his hand—they both looked round, and then he gave it to Goodman from the cart—Goodman put it under his cost, and was returning to his garden—I took him, and took the mutton from him, and showed it to Mr. West.</p>

Mr. Maxwell said, if the horses did not look well he would take the allowance off me.</p>

Last Friday night I was coming home from Hatcham races, in the Old Kent-road, about nine o'clock, with Phillips and four or five others—as we came along the road by Hatchard-street, Kent-road, I saw the prisoner and several others standing on the footway—Mott was in advance of our party, and said, "Now, gentle<lb/>men, just move out of the way, so that we can pass"—they did not move at the moment, and he tried to force himself through—a person immediately struck, him in the face—that caused a general confusion and row—I was forced against the wall—the prisoner held his fist over my head, and said, "I will knock your b----y head off"—previous to that I felt a tog at my watch, which was in my pocket, but that was not done by the prisoner—one of my friends got out of the crowd—I immediately called "Police," and as he was coming along with the policeman the other parties made off—the prisoner turned round to get away—I collared him—a mob came up and pushed against us till the policeman came and took him to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police inspector. I received information on Tuesday, the 6th—I made inquiry, and apprehended the prisoner on the 10th—I went to his master's house, where he is a barman—I told him who I was and charged him with wantonly throwing a stone over Waterloo-bridge, thereby causing injury to a boy named Abbot—he said, "Yes, I am the person, and am very sorry for it"—he said as he was going across the bridge to Messrs. Hodges on an errand for his master, that he saw the stone lying in the recess, and thought he would throw it over the bridge and have a splash as he returned—I was on the bridge at the time it happened, and examined it—the projecting part of the bridge, which is a flat surface, had part of the stone work broken away, as if the stone had first struck on the coping of the bridge, and cut about two inches out, then fallen on the pier of the bridge, and I found that portion of the bridge was all powder, a sort of indentation made, as if the stone had rebounded from the parapet—it might have struck the boy where it was found—I saw the boy before and after he was dead.</p>

                  </hi>, jun. I am the son of Thomas Machin, and live in High-street, Deptford. On the 11th of May my attention was called to an adver<lb/>tisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper, which I copied myself—this is it.—(<hi rend="italic">Read.</hi> "£100. A respectable and intelligent person, with the above sum at im<lb/>mediate command, may be introduced to the situation of librarian to a public institution, now vacant by the death of its late possessor; the salary and per<lb/>quisites of the office amount to upwards of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum, besides a resi<lb/>dence, with coals and candles; the appointment is for life. Address to Liber, National Address Office, 282, Strand.")—I answered this advertisement the same day, and in reply received a note referring to F. W. Knight, 7, Great Union-street—I went on the 15th to No. 7, Great Union-street—I there saw the prisoner, F. W. Knight—he answered to the name of Mr. Knight—I told him I came respecting an advertisement in the paper, and respecting the note he sent me—I produced the note, but I do not think he read it—he said he was agent to the secretary of the institution, who had the power of appointing the librarian, and the secretary required a premium of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the appoint<lb/>ment—he told me the hours of attendance were irons ten till four o'clock, that it most be a member of the Established Church, and a person of good cha<lb/>racter, for which I must give testimonials—next day I took him two testimo<lb/>nials, one from a clergyman, and one from another person, and on the morning after I took him another—he said he would lay them before the secretary that evening, and he would let me know the next morning by the first post—the result was, that on the next morning, Thursday, I received this note—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>) "7, Great Union-street, Borough. Sir, I have laid your testimonials before the secretary, and am happy to inform you that he approves of them; so that there remains nothing now for you to do but to come up to town, take the reference from me, pay the deposit of one-half the premium to the secretary, and be appointed to the office. Please to call by half-past eleven to-morrow, Thursday, if possible, as there are several other gentlemen very anxious to immediately close the business, but whom the secretary does not consider so eligible as yourself. In haste. Yours, &amp;c. Francis William Knight."—I went the same day to Union-street—I saw the prisoner—he said the same as in the note—I had asked him for a reference, to know if he was a respect<lb/>able man, and he gave me this address, "James Smith, Esq., Wood-street, Lambeth-walk"—I went there and inquired—the servant said he was from home—while I was there Mrs. Smith came, who turned out to be the prisoner Sarah Knight—she asked my business—I told her, and she said she could give me every information no doubt, she knew Mr. Knight was a straightforward, honourable man, I could place any trust in him—she said Mr. Smith was from home, and showed me a piece of paper, in which was an advertisement—she said he was down at that place transacting some business, and Mr. Knight she had not seen for some time, that Mr. Smith had been away some days, and she did not know where he was residing—I then went back to Knight's, at Great Union-street—I told him I had been, and Mr. Smith was from home—</p>

               <p>he seemed surprised—I asked if he could not give any other reference—he said he was very sorry, but he had not previously told him of my coining—he gave me the names of two other persons, but I have not applied to them—he said the business must be settled that afternoon—he was so certain I should be sa<lb/>tisfied with my reference, that he had prepared the agreement during my ab<lb/>sence—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Memorandum of agreement between Thomas Machin, Esq. Jun., of 3, High-street, Deptford, and Francis William Knight, of Great Union-street, Borough. I, Francis William Knight, hare this day received from Thomas Machin, Jun. Esq., the sum of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., being the quarter part of the premium of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., agreed to be paid by the said Thomas Machin, Jun., Esq., for the situation of librarian to a certain public institution in the metropolis, the fixed salary of which is 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., per annum, with perquisites amounting to about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more; as, also, a suite of apartments, and coals and candles. It is agreed and expressly understood, that the said 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is lodged in my hands as a deposit, to insure the good faith of the said Thomas Machin, Jun. Esq., and that should I not succeed in installing and establishing him in the said situation, as above described, on or before Monday the 29th of May, I shall return the said 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the said Thomas Machin, Jun. Esq., without any charge or deduction whatever; the said Thomas Machin also, binds and obliges himself to pay the balance of 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., when he shall have been *** in the office, as witness our names, this 18th day of May, 1843. Signed Thomas Machin, Jun.; Francis William Knight."—On that I gave him fifteen sovereigns and a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note—he said he would meet me at the Berner's Hotel, Berner's street, Oxford-street, at seven o'clock, with the secretary—I went there and waited two hours—I neither found the secre<lb/>tary nor Mr. Knight—I spoke to the proprietor of the hotel, and mentioned my own name—he said there was a letter left for me—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"To Thomas Machin, Jun. Esq. My dear sir, I am very sorry to inform you, that a prior engagement, which I was not aware of, prevents Mr. Mon<lb/>tague from seeing you to-night, at seven o'clock, as appointed, but will see you to-morrow afternoon at four o'clock, without fail, to dine with him at the Berner's Hotel.
