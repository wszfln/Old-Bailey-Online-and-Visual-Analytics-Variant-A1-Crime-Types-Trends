On 19th March I sent my clerk, Mr. Shout, to receive change for a cheque—I received from him the amount of 565<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—among it, I believe, were three 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, I noticed that there were Bank of England notes to that amount, but I could not positively speak to the numbers of them—after receiving them I came up to London by the Great Northern Railway—I counted the notes over from Mr. Shout, put them in a canvas bag, and put them in ay trowsers pocket—I left at half past 6 o'clock that evening—I arrived at the Great Northern station in town at half past 9 o'clock—there were three gentlemen in the same railway carriage with me, two of whom I knew intimately, the other not so well, but I knew him as clerk to Mr. Glutton, of Whitehall-place, and I have seen him since—I went to the Great Northern Hotel—I went to bed about a quarter past 10 o'clock—my room was No. 46—I locked the door of my bedroom, and left the key in the lock—I got up about half past 7 o'clock, breakfasted, and then went to No. 3, Raymond's-buildings, Gray's Inn—I got there at a quarter to 9 o'clock—on putting my hand into my pocket, I found that the money was gone—that was my first intimation of my loss—I stopped the notes at the bankers', and telegraphed into the country.</p>

I have seen the prisoner Kingston at the Great Northern Hotel—I saw him there on the morning of 20th March, between 8 and 9 o'clock, he was breakfasting in the coffee room—a person named Branch was with him; I know nothing further of Branch than seeing him in the coffee room—I have since seen him at Manchester in custody—I saw Branch first at our hotel—I did not see him come down, I saw him come from the passage into the coffee room—it was from a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes after that, that I saw Kingston—Branch called for his breakfast previous to Kingston coming down, but he waited some little time; they ate at the same table—Branch had a small black leathern bag—when Branch came down he waited some little time, he said he had friends coming'down—he did not order his breakfast at the moment, he waited until, I might say, his patience was exhausted, and then he gave his order for his breakfast, and during that time Kingston came down, and he likewise ordered his breakfast—he was in the room with him a short time; he did not remain more than a quarter of an hour after Kingston came down; they left the coffee room together—I do not remember how they left the hotel.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The witness was directed to apply the pliers to the key in the lock, which he did, and they turned the key with ease</hi>)—in consequence of information I received on 19th April, I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Persia</hi>, she was then under weigh for New York—I there found the prisoner Howard—I said to him, "Good morning, Mr. Howard, how do you do?"—he said, "Very well"—I said, "Are you going out with us!" he said, "Yes"—I then said, "I want to see your luggage, to see your berth, to see if there is anything there that don't belong to you"—he said, "Yes," he would show me his berth—I searched him, and found this pas<lb/>sage ticket on him—in a belt round him, I found 115<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in English gold, seventy-eight American twenty gold dollar pieces, thirty-two American tea gold dollar pieces, thirty-four five gold dollar pieces, two two and a half gold dollar pieces, forty-five one gold dollar pieces, and two quarter dollars in silver, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in English silver; it amounted altogether to about 535<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I searched his luggage, and among it was this instrument (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have tried this to a door, it might answer the purpose of putting a key out of a door from the outside, where there is no projecting nipple—I have triad it to certain keys outside the doors, and found it to fit—nothing further passed between us that is material—I then took him into custody.</p>

The prisoner Russell was his porter—we missed some property—I discovered some on Russell, and in consequence of information I went with Mr. Smith to Grouse's premises—he keeps a shop at South-row—I met him outside his premises—the policeman told him he had come about some stolen property, which had been traced to his possession, and some duplicates which he had sold to the witness Smith—he said that he knew nothing about it—Smith said, "You had better tell the truth, because I have told everything"—Grouse then said he had got the goods to pawn from a young man who represented himself to be a traveller—he was then asked by the policeman why he sold the tickets to Smith—he answered, that the traveller had told him to pawn the goods, and if he did not return in a day or two, be could keep the tickets—I think the value of the property that Mr. Gugniere lost was nearly 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a great deal of it is produced—this is part of it.</p>

The prosecutor was brought there about a fortnight ago, in the evening, between 8 o'clock and 12 or 1, I cannot recollect exactly, as there are sometimes a dozen of these cases in the course of the evening—he had an incised wound across the nose, from one cheek to the other—it was rather deep on the left cheek, but was not bleeding very copiously—I put in three sutures, and strapped it up—it was exactly the sort of cut that might have been caused by a razor—I did not probe it, and do not know whether the cartilage was injured—I have not seen him since—the wound was continuous, and was exactly as if a razor had been stroked across the face—it would require considerable force to do it, because it went right into the muscles—it will disfigure him to a certain extent, there is a little scar.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's husband, unfortunately—we live at No. 30, Gardner's-lane, York-street, Westminster—I was in work at this time, I had been at work at two different shops that week—on Satur<lb/>day evening I got home about 10 minutes after 6 o'clock—I then had tea, and went out to market with my wife—coming home, about a quarter to 9 o'clock, there was a public house, and my wife said, "Go in here;" we did so—I drank a drop, she began to get quarrelsome, and in about five or ten minutes I left the beer on the table, and went home, and she followed me—I got home close upon 10 o'clock—I was sober, I had had a share of two pints with a shopmate of mine, at the King's Arms, at Pimlico—I went out after tea, and met a woman, who paid for some gin, and I had some of it, and then I had the beer at the Adam and Eve—I was in liquor, but was not tipsy; it did not deprive me of my senses—the prisoner told me that she had had a drop of gin extra; she was excited—when she got home she began to quarrel with me because she did not have sufficient money—I said that I had not any more to give her, and said, "I will not stand here and wrangle with you, I will go out and leave you"—she laid hold of my coat, and tore it off my back; I pushed her, and she laid hold of my trowsers, and tore them; I went to the street door—I was having my trowsers pinned up, the land<lb/>lady opened the door, and I opened my door in the passage; that was about ten minutes after my wife tore my clothes—while talking to the landlady, my wife came out of my room, put her hand over the landlady's right shoulder, with a razor in it, drew it over my face, and said, "There, you b—, take that"—I had not struck her, I only pushed her when she tore my coat off—I was taken to a druggist's shop, and I must have bled a quart of blood there, and a great deal going along—I afterwards saw a razor in the possession of the constable; it was kept in a shaving box on top of a shelf in the room where my wife lodged with me, and was there that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business as a ribbon manufacturer, at No. 25, Wood-street, Cheapside; I have one room on the second floor. On Saturday, 31st May, I locked up my premises, and left them perfectly safe—on Monday morning I went, and found the padlock broken, the pre<lb/>mises had been entered, and I missed the whole of my stock of ribbons, worth 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., except a very small portion—they consisted of a quantity of lutestrings and Petershams, which are waist ribbons, and these narrow Petershams for the neck, but the bulk were wide, for the waist—there was also a small quantity of black gauze ribbon—I immediately communicated with the officers, and on 24th June, from what they told me, I accompanied two officers to the shop of William George Wilson, in Beech-street, Barbican—that is a low neighbourhood—I saw the officer Foulger find a quantity of lutestrings, Petershams, and gauze (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are of a similar quality to what I lost; they are mine—I haw no mark on them—here are three patterns of Petershams, in a variety of colours—they are manufactured exclusively and expressly for me by one manufacturer, who is here to-day; I only sell them to respectable retail drapers, of the first class—I have sold as large a quantity of Petershams to one customer—I find here two pieces of Petersham, in an undressed condition and unwatered—I have them dressed and watered in London; they are almost invariably sold dressed and watered—I have occasionally sent out one or two pieces in this con<lb/>dition, but a very small quantity indeed—I have no doubt that these two pieces are my property, but cannot say whether I have sold them at any time—it is not so rare that it would excite suspicion to have it—the value of the property here is about 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the Petershams are about half that value—I have seen some ribbon purchased by my wife, it was Petersham, similar to what I find here—I sell it to the retailers at 31<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a piece, rather more than 10 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per yard—some of the lutestrings were rolled on blocks—I find the rolls are nearly all cut; they are about one-third of what they were when taken from my place, as if some had been sold—when William George Wilson was taken, this property was taken possession of—I never send out ribbons of this sort without blocks, and it is very unusual for them to be kept in a draper's shop in this way—on the same evening, the 24th, I went with two officers to the shop of John Wilson, No. 19, Clare-street, Clare<lb/>market—I judged that it was a draper's shop, but it was in the middle of the night; it is rather small, but not so small as the other—I saw a quan<lb/>tity of lutestrings and Petershams (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) taken possession of by the officers; among which were these ten pieces of Petersham, in an unfinished state, neither watered, dressed, nor on blocks; also some lutestring similar to what I lost on the night in question—these two rolls of lutestring I speak to from certain marks—the value of the property found in William</p>

               <p>George Wilson's shop is about 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., out of which the Petershams were worth 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—during the time I have been in business I have never sold so large a quantity of Petersham ribbons to any customer, nor have I ever sent goods out in this state, without blocks, and without dressing, and many of them are half pieces—it is very uncommon for us to sell half pieces—the largest retail shops generally buy these in quarter pieces, nine yards long, or in eighths—I found among the Petersham ribbons at John Wilson's shop some similar to what my wife purchased—the waist ribbons I sell at 31<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the piece, except one pattern, which is 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; my wife purchased some of that—I should sell this at about 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard; I do not pay as low as 6 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per yard—one of these three patterns found at William George's shop was only ordered of the manufacturer about two months previous to the robbery, and came into my stock about a fortnight afterwards, and some colours which were in my stock were ordered as late as three weeks before the robbery, and were not in my stock till ten days or a fortnight previously, and some of the others, found in John's shop, the same.</p>

On 24th June I accompanied Foulger and Mr. Hutchins to William Wilson's shop—I heard Foulger say to him that the lutestrings were stolen property, and he answered, "I bought them months ago"—I said, "They, have not been stolen a month"—he said, "That is when I bought them"—I took him into custody, and took him to the station—the charge was there read over to him—he said, "I have no further answer to give than what I have already given."</p>

On the night of 24th June I went to the house of John Wilson, at No. 19, Clare-street, Clare<lb/>market; it is a drapery, haberdashery, and millinery shop combined; it is a moderate sized shop. I was in plain clothes, and was accompanied by sergeant Hewlett; Mr. Hutchins did not go with us; he came afterwards—I saw John Wilson at the back of the shop, and told him we should like to speak to him privately—he took us up stairs, into his sitting room—I told him we were both police officers, and we had received information that he had bought a considerable quantity of ribbons lately—he said, "No, I have not"—I said, "You are certainly not bound to answer any question that we may put to you"—I took from my pocket the three pieces of ribbon that Mrs. Hutchins has produced, showed them to him, and asked him if he had not bought some of that kind—he said, "Oh, yes, I have bought a lot of these"—I said, "Who did you buy them of?"—he said, "I bought them of a traveller, or an agent"—I asked if he had an invoice with them—he said, no, he had not—I asked if he knew the name of the person that he bought them of—he said, no, he did not—I then asked what quantity he bought of him—he said he should decline to answer that question—I asked if he had any account of them—he said he had a memorandum of them at the time he bought them—he did not show me any—I then went down stairs with him, and we saw twenty-seven pieces of ribbon, chiefly Petersham, in a green box—he showed them us—we then waited till Mr. Hutchins came, and after he came the prisoner directed his shopman to bring down the remainder of that lot of ribbons from up stain; and he brought down a paper parcel, and a hat box, containing ninety-three pieces in the two—what he told the shopman was to bring down the remainder of that lot of ribbons; the shopman had seen the others; in fact, he called the shopman up to him in the private room, and they had some conversation together, which I could not exactly hear—Mr. Hutchins iden<lb/>tified the property—while they were searching the shop I went up stain with the prisoner; he wished to go up; and after we came down, and they told me they had looked the place entirely over, I asked him if he would show me the memorandum, or show me an account of them in his books—he said there were the ribbons, he considered he had accounted very satis<lb/>factorily for them, and he should answer no further questions—I told him I considered his account not at all satisfactory, and I should take him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 242). I was on duty on Friday, 6th Jane, in Essex-street, Beth nal-green-road, about a quarter before 5 o'clock—I saw a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> driving down Essex-street and along the Old Bethnal-green-road—they came to the Barley Mow beer shop, Jackson was on the box—they stopped at the Barley Mow about ten minutes—I did not see them till they returned again to Essex-street, in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I stopped the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and asked the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man where he was going—he said the party that was inside was gone—that was the man who had been riding in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, that I did not see—I looked into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and saw the silk that has been produced and identified by Mr. Cook—I showed him the same silk that I saw in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I took Jackson into custody—I found on him this pocket handkerchief, some lamp cottons, some lucifers, two dupli<lb/>cates, a skeleton key, and a knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Jackson's Defence.</hi> He says it is a skeleton key; where I live, it was dropped to me out of a window, and one ward was broken; I have had it in nry pocket ever since; I was going down Old-street at 4 o'clock that morning, I saw a man standing at the corner of a street, he asked me to go for a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, as he had got some goods to take to Bethnal-green; I went, and came back with the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and the young man put the property in; he asked me to go with him, and we went to Essex-street; he went'and stood at the corner of Essex-street, and he said the persons were not up; he said, "Drive away," and we drove away, and as we were coming back we were stopped by the policeman; that is all I know about it; if I had been guilty, I could easily have jumped off and ran away; this prisoner is nothing at all like the man that I got the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> for.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warder at the House of Correction in Coldbath-fields. The prisoner was a prisoner there under my charge—he had been under my charge fox about a fortnight—on 24th Jane, he com<lb/>plained to me of his bread being light; he said his loaf of bread was small—I told him I could not help its being small, if he thought proper he could have it weighed—he said he did not wish to have it weighed, provided I gave it to him the same as I did to other prisoners; he said that I picked out the small bread for him—I told him that I would not allow him to accuse me with that, he might see the Governor upon it if he thought proper—he said he would do so—he then asked me to put the loaf in the cupboard for the Governor to see it; I did so—previous to that I weighed it—the prisoner could see me do it—it weighed six ounces—the prisoners get twenty ounces a-day, divided into three parts, then there is ten pounds allowed the contractor in every hundred for the allowance, so that the prisoners shall not have less bread than is allowed them—they do get twenty ounces a-day, taking one loaf with the other—this was about half past 5 o'clock in the evening—the prisoner slept in the dormitory that night—there we other prisoners there, the room sleeps one hundred—on the next morning, about twenty minutes to 11 o'clock, the prisoner was taken before the Governor with regard to this charge of the light loaf—I took the bread with</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185607070048"/>
               <p>me—I told the Governor in the prisoner's presence what had occurred the over night, as I have stated now—on that, the prisoner said that the officers had an antipathy against him—the Governor said he should not allow the prisoner to make the assertion he had done the night previous, if he had anything to say he could see him and make his complaint; and he should stop part of his dinner—I took the prisoner back to the yard, and put the loaf in the cupboard in the day room, where the men get their meals—the prisoner was by the side of me at the time—he said he bad intended to ask the Governor for the loaf—I said he might have done it if he had thought proper—nothing more passed—I took him to his work—it was in the dormitory, it was his work that day to clean and sweep the dormitory and put it to rights—it was about 10 minutes to 11 o'clock when I took him there—there was nobody else working there—I locked the door of the dormitory and left him there—about 20 minutes to 1 o'clock I went to the dormitory again—I unlocked the door, and on opening it the prisoner stood on the step of the door; there are steps leading up to the dormitory, and there is one step inside the doorway—the prisoner stood on that step—not a word passed between us—as soon as I opened the door the prisoner struck me just by the corner of the right eye; he struck me in this way (<hi rend="italic">raising his Jtand and striking downwards</hi>) as hard as he could force it; he struck me with all his might and gave a grunt at the same time—I was going to shut the door, and he gave me a second blow across the hand and cut me across the knuckles; I could not see what he had in his hand, it was so momentary—I locked the door; he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> against it, but I had sufficient strength to push against him and lock it—I hastened down to the hall and there I saw the doctor—I had this cap on when I went to the dormitory (<hi rend="italic">producing some pieces of a cap</hi>)—at the time he delivered the blow at my head, this fell into the dormitory, and afterwards he cut it up and threw it out of the window.</p>

               <p>and said that he did not wish to hurt me—his words were, "I don't wish to hurt you, Mr. Hoare"—he gave this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) into my hand; it was wet with blood, and just in the same state as it is now, with this tow round the handle—I said to him, "How came you to do such a thing?"—he I answered, "He may think himself a lucky fellow;" that was all that passed—the prisoners are not allowed to have such knives about them—the prisoner would not have such a knife when working in the dormitory—I subsequently asked the prisoner where he got it from, and he said he did not wish to say, it would be ascertained by-and-by.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a miller, and live at Windmill-hill, Enfield. Between 1 and 2 o'clock on 17th June I heard a noise—I had had a cow blown the night before, and I thought my son had got up to look at it—I took no notice of it—in three or four minutes afterwards I heard a noise in the lower part of the house; I got out, and looked out of the window—the room I sleep in is in the front of the house—I did not see any one, but saw the path gate was open—there is a garden in front of the house, which leads into a private road—the shutter of the lower room window was broken open—I called my son, and after that saw the prisoner Sharp run out of my house, by the front door—he ran down the path into the road—(it was between light and dark)—when Sharp got out in the road he whistled, and Jones came out at the same door, and went down the same road after him, and they whistled again—I saw Leary standing in the road when Sharp ran out of the door—when they had whistled again, the three of them ran away down the road towards Barnet—they ran away, as if together—one of my sons, Benjamin, went after them—I afterwards examined my house—the window was open—the shutter was hanging off; the iron plate through which the pin went was wrenched off—I had fastened it up, between 9 and 10 o'clock at night—in the front room I had two tea caddies, which had contained tapes, and threads, and a parcel of things—all the contents were</p>

Between 1 and 2 o'clock on the morning of 17th June my father called me, I got up immediately—I saw one man run out, and a whittle was given—I had not heard any noise before I saw a man—he ran out from the front door of the dwelling house—my room is just over the door, I saw the back part of the man—he never was oat of my sight from the time he left the house till I left him at the police station—it was Sharp—when I looked out he was running down the path—on seeing him run I followed down stairs—I first put on my clothes and went down and went out of the front door—I heard a second man go out an I was going down the stairs—after I saw the first man running and heard the second man go out, I heard a whistle again—I heard the first whistle when the first man ran out—I could not tell who whistled—I went down the path, and saw three men running on Slade's-road to Barnet—they might be fifty yards down the road when I saw them running, and between fifty and a hundred yards from me—I fol<lb/>lowed them—they went as far as Mr. Slade's and turned into Russell's foot<lb/>path-field—I should think Mr. Slade's is a quarter of a mile from my father's house, it is in the Barnet-road—I heard them speak one to the other—I fol<lb/>lowed them up Russell's footpath-field—I let them go on about a mile till they came to some cottages in Old Park-lane, where I was well known—they wene walking then—they ran about a mile and then walked—I walked after them till they came to those cottages—I then walked before them and charged them with breaking into my father's house—one of them, I believe it was Leary, said I must be dreaming—I said I did not think I was, and asked them to go with me to the police station—Leary and Sharp said they would—Jones said he should go his own road—we all four went on together by the Green Dragon in Mann's-lane—that was the direction in which they were going—when we were in Mann's-lane, I called out for a constable—I should say that was another mile from where I came up to them, between two and three miles from our house—I heard a constable run and stop at the Green Dragon—he said, "Halloo;" I hallooed again, he came up to us and I gave the prisoners in charge—they said they could easily have</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Hopkins-street, Golden-square, and am a tailor. On 6th July, about 3 o'clock, I met the prisoner in Church-lane, 8st Giles's; I went with him to a gin shop—I went afterwards and had some oysters—I came back to the same public house, and it was closed—he then took me up a small street, and put his arm round my neck, across my throat—it nearly cost me my life—I had not breath to call out; I tried, and could not—he pressed my throat violently—while he was holding me in that way, a man and a woman came up and took all my money—I had a sovereign in my trowsers' pocket, and two halfcrowns and a shilling—I had the money safe when I parted with my friends, before I saw the prisoner—I had taken my money out when I paid for the gin; I think the prisoner had seen it—the man and woman went off the prisoner let loose my throat, and came down the street—I could not see whether he walked or ran, my sight was bad by his strangling me—I lost sight of him—I got sight of him again—he was standing in an archway—I did not see how he got into the archway.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I live at Caroline-street, Ratcliffe, and have been in the service of the Trinity Company twelve years, and am still On 24th June I was with Neil at the Turk's Head, about half past 2 o'clock in the morning—we were talking about sailing, and the prisoner came in and interfered with us—Neil went out, and went down our alley—I waited while the prisoner went out, and walked out after him—I sat down on the butcher's step, and saw Neil leaning on a post—I had had a drop to drink, but knew what I was about—when the prisoner and prosecutor were together, I came up with my eyes as if I had just woke up, and ran down, and saw the prisoner strike Neil with his hands, I thought, but I took the prisoner by his hands, and he had a knife—Neil was lying on the ground, bleeding—I saw him strike Neil one blow, but what he gave him before I cannot say—I never saw so much blood in a human being in my life—I shouted, "Police!" and in four or five minutes a policeman came—I had been drinking, but had a good deal of my senses about me—Cox, the police constable, gave nie a very nice rub with his elbow, and I got a very nice character from the prisoner, but I am not a paramour of women, though Mr. Pelham stated it in the <hi rend="italic">Weekly Dispatch</hi>, and I may lose my character through it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you known Neil? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Since his infancy, we were brought up together—I met him going home that night,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185607070060"/>
               <p>but had only seen him twice these five years—I was with him about a minute before we went into the Turk's Head—it is about 120 yard off and I walked there with him—I did not see the prisoner before we got into the public house—there was no female with him—I do not know a person who goes by the name of <hi rend="italic">Scotchey</hi> a prostitute, I do not know who the girl is at all—I had been with no woman but Cox—the policeman took me for a person who had been with <hi rend="italic">Scotchey</hi>, he swore that I was there, but I was not—we were in the public house about half an hour—the prisoner left not half a minute before I followed him—I was sitting on the step when Neil crossed over, I do not know what he crossed over for, on my oath—I saw him leaning on a post on the opposite side of the street, as we men do for hours at a time—I did not see Neil go down the street, I dozed off for about half a minute's sleep—I went down the street because I saw Neil receiving a blow, but I did not know that there was a knife—I only saw one blow—there was not another blow after I got there—I heard a rumbling noise which opened my eyes when I was in a dream, and happened to look at these persons, who were about twenty yards down the street—I just opened my eyes in time to see a blow struck, and before he had time to strike another I had him by the wrist—I did not see where the prisoner went.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MARTIN'M'KEW</hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 87). On 24th June I was on duty just outside the Turk's Head, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor there—I saw a blow struck, but as I came to the end of Narrow-street, I saw the prose<lb/>cutor on top of the prisoner, and the prisoner with a knife in his hand—the prosecutor was bleeding very much, there was a great quantity of blood, Neil was quite insensible—I lifted him up and gave him to Leonard, who came up just at that time and kept him up, as he was not able to stand—I did not see him lay hold of the prisoner—I saw this penknife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his hand, he opened his hand for me to take it—neither of them said a word, but I took the prisoner in custody in consequence of what I saw—Leonard assisted the prosecutor till we met a policeman—he went about 200 yards and was obliged to fall, we took him on a stretcher to the station—the prisoner said going along, that he was on his way home when he met a young woman who asked him for a pint of beer, and said that he would give it to her if she could find a place open, and she took him into the Turk's Head, and that on his way out he was followed by three, who knocked him down at a little distance from the shop, and he had nothing else to defend himself with but a knife.</p>

I am a surgeon of 10, Commercial-place—I saw Neil at the station, he was bleeding profusely from a wound on the upper lip and and another on the left side of the face to the extent of an inch and half or two inches—the upper lip was completely divided, and there was a slight wound</p>

               <p>on the back of the head, he lost a great deal of blood—he was very violent while I was dressing the wounds, he was drank—he was in no danger.</p>

On 24th April, about half part 9 o'clock, I closed the house, and went to bed about 20 minutes to 10—I was awoke before daylight by a noise—about 6 o'clock in the morning I got up; I first went up stairs, and then down stairs—I saw the parlour door ajar—I opened the door part of the way, and two men rushed on me, struck me on the side of my face, and I lost my senses for a moment—I beard my mistress scream, and I lost my senses again—when I came to myself; a man was kneeling on my side with a knife in his hand, which he held to my throat, and said, "Will you be quiet?"—I said, "Yes, if you will let me alone"—I then saw that there was a chopper, and a piece of wood lying by the table—he then put me in a chair, and while doing so another man came down stairs, and said something to the man that was with me, which I could not understand—one took one hand, and the other the other, and took me into the kitchen—the man that came down stairs asked me where I the plate was—I said that all I knew was three silver spoons—he said that they were only old things, and asked me where the money was—I told him that I did not know—he then held the knife to my throat, saying that I might do which I liked; tell him where the money was, or they would have I my life; that they had killed my mistress, and would kill me—I then told him all that I knew was in the house, I told them where the money was—they were going to take me up stairs, and I asked for a shawl, and a little water, which they let me have—they then took me up stairs, and I showed them where the money was—one of them broke the drawer open in the front parlour where he first attacked me; he then said something to the man who was standing by me, which I did not understand—he took a rope out of his pocket, one tied my hands, and the other my feet; the one that was with me the whole of the time then went up stairs, leaving the other with me—before they did that they carried me out of the front parlour into the back, after tying my hands and feet—he then went up stairs, and when he came down they wanted to bring my mistress down into the cellar, but he objected to it; he said, "They want to bring the old woman down into the cellar, but I object to it"—after they were gone, I got the rope loosened by working my arm on the arm of the chair, and then I got out of the window—I saw four men, their faces were covered; one with a red handkerchief, one with a piece of crape or net, the other with a piece of crape or linen put over his head, and his hat, on top of it, and the fourth I only saw through the crack of the door; I think his face was covered with something, but am not sure—when I got up stairs my mistress was tied with her hands across, and the rope passed under the bedclothes, and then tied round her legs, a thick handkerchief was tied over her mouth, and two pillows over her face—I found these strange tools (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the wash house, about an hour after they left—this piece of steel was among them—this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) belongs to my mistress, I know it well—when I was taken down stairs I saw now they got in—the brick wall was broken down by the side of the wash house door, which was closed; that was fresh, and was large enough for a man to get in, it was about a foot from the ground—a man getting into the wash home would have access to the rest of the house; it is a passage leading from the wash house into which they broke, it is by the wash house door—if you got through the hole you would find yourself in the passage, and could get into the dwelling house—there was nobody whatever in the house but myself and my mistress—I know who I succeeded as servant, by sight; her name was Charlotte Towers, but it is Horwood now—about six or seven weeks</p>

               <p>before the burglary, a man and woman came to my mistress's house; it was on 3rd Feb.—I recognise Fleckart as the man—it was the day before this letter came (<hi rend="italic">produced, dated</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">th Feb.</hi>)—I was not at home when they came, I came in while they were there, about half past 5 o'clock, or between 5 and 6 o'clock; it was Sunday, and I had been to church—my mistress told me, in the presence of the man and woman, that they had come to tell her that Mr. Rush had had two fits, and was lying at Salisbury—I said to my mistress, "Never mind, people have two fits, and they recover"—I then seated my mistress into a chair, because she was very ill; she is a very old lady—my mistress told me that the man (Fleckart) was ill—they wanted me to go with them to Mr. Bush's office, as he was going to be telegraphed—I did not go, I offered my brother or my father to go—the woman said to Fleckart, "Never mind, dear, you can call to-morrow, as you go to Waltham Grose"—my mistress told me to look at the man, to as to know him when he called the next day, and I looked at him—(he did not call the next day, another man called, and brought a note)—Fleckart appeared ill, and had some gin and water; he was then shown into the yard, that is where the brick wall is, through which the hole was afterwards made—he could see it when he was in the garden, and could see the door adjoin<lb/>ing it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> About how long were you in a state to observe the four men? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About half an hour—they were there from 6 o'clock till ten minutes to 8 o'clock—it is about half an hour that I can speak to seeing them, it might be more, I do not think it was lees—I answered them when they put questions to me—the man that held me told me that if I was not hurt then, I should not be—the only thing I asked them was to let my mother know how I was tied—I did not have a good deal more conversation than I recollect the particulars of—I asked them not to kill my mistress; and they told me that they would drop a line to the inspector to tell him to come and untie me—the shortest of the four did not speak to me at all, the other three did—the one who did not speak to me is the one who I cannot positively swear to having a mask or not—I had not an opportunity of observing him—I was about the distance from him that I am from that table, but I only saw him through the crack of the door—I am sure there were four men there, and that I saw a man through the crack of the door—the door was open, and I saw between it and the poet—through the opening, not the crack, it was wide open—he was not standing there long—I was sitting in a chair—I did not hear them all go up to my mis<lb/>tress, but I heard them all four come down, because I was sensible when they came down—I heard two come down first and two afterwards—one of them used very foul language to me—the other two were drinking gin at the time in the room where I was, the fourth standing so that I could see him through the crack of the door—he did not stand there before he went up and after he came down; but I was carried from one parlour to the other—I did not-see the four men till they had come down—I did not see them give the fourth man any gin, but they took a bottle of gin out and left it on the stairs—it was through the back parlour door that I saw the man standing—the woman who came seven weeks before, was taken in custody, but I could not identify her—I say that the man that was there was Fleck<lb/>art, I had never seen him before—I saw him again on, I think, the Tues<lb/>day morning after I saw him on the Sunday, walking along the street in Newington, near the Cemetery; I did not speak to him, I was in a green grocer's shop—he looked at me and I knew him directly—I did not see him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185607070064"/>
               <p>after that till the Sunday he was taken into custody—a policeman came for me and told me be Lad got a man in custody—he did not tell me who—I went with Mr. Rush, I knew that I was going to see some man, I did not know who—I thought I was going to see if he was one of the thieves—nothing was said to me about the man who was there on Sunday—he was there on Sunday about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after I was there—I offered him some spirits because he was going to drink water, but he declined—I heard him speak to my mistress—he had lit a candle before I went in, for my mistress to write her collector's address down—I was not there, but I found a candle alight when I came in, and a man, whom I say is Fleckart, and a woman, who kept her veil down all the time—on the Sunday following, when I saw Fleckart, I went back to my mistress directly and told her—on the Monday some man brought a letter, that was not Fleckart—I received the letter—when I saw him on Tuesday it was between 10 and 11 o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you quite sure of that, because it is important? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am—I will not be positive about the Tuesday following the Sunday, but to the best of my belief it was Tuesday—I will consider; yes, it was Tuesday, I am sure—I have stated that before the Magistrate—it was at the shop of a person named Arbour at Stoke Newington, not Newington on the other side of the water.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, residing at Stoke Newington. I know Mrs. Isabella Humphreys—I have visited her professionally a few times—I saw her last evening, about 7 o'clock, she was in a state of extreme feebleness, quite incapable of making the effort which would be necessary to come into this box—she is about eighty years of age—she is in a perfect state of feebleness, in a state of physical exhaustion; her vital power is exceedingly feeble.</p>

               <p>was not the same man—to the best of my belief Fleckart is the man who came with the woman—the letter produced is the same the man brought the next day—he was alone—that letter opened my eyes—I did not take particular notice of that man—I cannot say that either of the prisoners is that man—the man said he would wait for an answer—I declined giving any answer—he asked me to give him something, and I gave him a shilling—I sent my servant for a fly, and I went to town to Mr. Bush's—when I was in the fly another man came to the window and begged me not to go, and said, 'Discharge the coach'—I would not—I do not know that I should know that man again—I cannot say that either of the prisoners is that man—when I got to town I found that the story about Mr. Rush was untrue—I remember the night of the burglary—I first felt something shake my head, and then I heard a noise; I awoke my serrant who slept in the same room, it was scarcely light at that time; I then heard a noise as you let off a volley of guns; I asked her if she heard a noise, she said, 'No;' I did not go to sleep again; I sat up in the bed; my servant did not get up till some time afterwards, and first went up stain and came down again, and ran down the stairs—I heard a scream in the house, and then heard footsteps running up the stairs, as of more than one person—some persons came into my bed room, I cannot say I saw two, but one held my right hand down by my side, and the other held my left hand; it looked like two black dogs jumping on the bed—the men said to me, 'Where is your money?'—I screamed, and they said, 'Will you be quiet' using foul language, and put a hand over my eyes, and pinched my nose, and held my lips, and caught me by the throat, and I could hardly breathe—when they found that, they took the hand from my mouth—they said to me, 'We have killed your servant, and we will kill you, 'and one said, 'Give me a knife, and I will cut her throat—they broke open every drawer and every locked place—there were three in the room, two on the bed and one breaking the drawers—the man on my left side put a rope round my right wrist and then tied my two hands together, and he then passed the rope from my hands to my legs, and tied my legs together—they then tied a handkerchief over my mouth and round my head, and put two pillows over my head, and I could not scarcely breathe at all, and I was everything but dead—I had a silver watch tied round my neck with a tape—they took that watch from my neck—the watch now produced is the same watch, it had a cracked glass in it; it had a common key attached to it with a piece of tape—I had a great many sovereigns in the drawers, I cannot tell how many—I had received on 14th Jan., with Mr. Bush, a lot of money—I put that somewhere in the room—I think I had other money then—I had a silver teapot, and some silver spoons and forks, two gold watches, one diamond ring, and other jewellery—I missed all the money and the articles I have named from the bed room—I afterwards saw that the drawers in the front parlour had been broken open, and I missed three or four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes—I had received the notes from Mr. Birch, a tenant of mine, in Grove-lane—I had some gold in the front parlour, in a little table drawer, I do not know how much—I missed that gold also—the lock was broken open of the table drawer—when the men left, in going down the stairs, one of them said, 'That is the day we will come'—my gold watch I gave 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for—I did not touch any of the money I received when I was with Mr. Bush—I have no doubt that Fleckart is the man who came in February with the woman on the Sunday—the</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Clapton, and am carman to Barber and Sons, plumbers and house decorators. On the morning of 25th April about twenty or twenty-three minutes to 8 o'clock, or thereabouts, I was driving a pony and van in Springfield, Upper Clapton—I had been on a message—I was coming towards Stamford-hill, out of Springfield—I met two men—when I first saw them they were on the run, but as they approached me they ceased, and came to a walk—they were coming in a direction, from Stamford-hill towards the marshes, in a direction from Mrs. Humphreys'—they were about half a mile from Mrs. Humphreys' house—they were dressed in dark clothes, both of them wearing red wrappers up to the chin—I noticed the men particularly—Fleckart is one of the men—I noticed him particularly, because he so much resembled one of our work<lb/>men; one of our painters—I have no moral doubt that he is the man—I saw two other men about eighty yards behind the first two—they came from the same direction, and when they came to the end of the road they hesitated for about a moment, as if they were doubtful which way to turn; they then came on towards me—they walked fast—as they came near me one of the men took off his hat, took a red handkerchief from it, and wiped it over his face; that completely hid his face, so that I could not see it—I believe Horwood was one of the men, but I cannot swear to him—his trowsers were spotted up to the knee, either with whitewash or paint, but I thought he was a painter—the men passed within two yards of me—they all passed me within the same distance, close along side—there was not a soul else about that morning—I am sure that the man I recognized was not the painter I knew; he was at work in the City at that time, at the Alfred Fire Office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, living at Tottenham High Cross. On 25th April I was at work cleaning out the River Lea, and saw four men, I recognize Fleckart as one of them—he was walking in this way (<hi rend="italic">with his hand to his groin</hi>)—he seemed to hold himself up—he had on a very dark coat, it appeared to me like a dark green coat—three of them had red handkerchiefs round their necks, one had a bundle, and one had some<lb/>thing</p>

               <p>like a box tied up in a handkerchief—they were coming down by the waterworks wall when I saw them, from Lea-bridge—I was at work just below Lea-bridge, near the waterworks—I was on board the <hi rend="italic">Sampson</hi>, that cleans the river out; the men were going towards Stratford, on the Essex side, the Waltbamstow side—they were going towards Temple Mills way—I did not see them come across Lea-bridge—they were all four together.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, N</hi> 27). I know the locality about Lea-bridge pretty well—I know the Temple Mills—persons going from Stamford-hill towards Temple Mills would cross over Lea-bridge—the high road from Stamford-hill would take them through Hackney, and that way into London; but when they get to the turnpike at Clapton, turning to the left would take them to Lea-bridge—that is a less frequented road than the high road—as you cross Lea-bridge, the Temple Mills are on your left; that would take them back again nearly opposite Stamford-hill—I beg pardon, it is the Copper Mills that are on the left, Temple Mills are to the right—persons going over Lea-bridge to the neighbourhood of Whitechapel, could go to London without going to the Temple Mills; they could go near the Temple Mills if they thought fit—it is between Lea-bridge and London—I took Fleckart into custody on this charge on 5th May—he was at his own lodging—I told him he was charged with being concerned, with three others, in committing a robbery at Mrs. Humphreys', at Stamford-hill—he said, "Have you any one else?"—I said, "Yes, two men and a woman"—he said, "Good God, I am <hi rend="italic">sold!</hi>"—I said, "You are further charged with going to Mrs. Humphreys' house, with a woman, five or six weeks ago, with intent to commit a robbery"—he said, "Well, if I went with a woman on that occasion, that does not prove that I committed the burglary; I can prove I was ill the day it was done"—I had not said anything to him about the day upon which the robbery was effected, and I made the reply, "I have not said what day; what day are you speaking of?"—I do not think he made any reply to that—I left an officer in charge of him—I saw him again two or three days after—I asked him how he felt this morning—he said, "Very weak"—I said, "You are not able to be moved yet, I believe"—he said, "No; I hope in a few days I shall be able to get on my legs, and get out with you.; and if you will allow me to go with you, I think I can take you to the other parties," or "to find the other parties," or words to that effect—"I think I can take you to find the other parties," those were the</p>

               <p>words, "but I dare say they would kill me hereafter"—I took Trowers into custody on the evening of 4th May—I told him he was charged with being concerned, with others, in committing a burglary at the house of Mrs. Humphreys, at Stamford-hill, on 25th April last—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I said, "You must go with me to the station"—he went with me—on the way he said, "Stop; I think I can tell you a little about it; there is a man living over the water, in the Westminster-road, by the name of Fleckart; a woman named Perkins, residing in Lion-street, Kent-road; they keep company together; they frequent my brother-in-law's house, in Trafalgar-street, Walworth; I remember Fleckart and the female coming and talking to my sister, on several occasions, at my brother-in-law's" (Horwood is his brother-in-law), "and on one occasion I heard my sister telling them what a good lady Mrs. Humphreys was, and what a rich lady she was;" and he said, "My brother in-law (Horwood) and myself agreed to meet Perkins and Fleckart at Kingsland-gate; Fleckart said he would go and have what the old woman had got; we met at Kingsland-gate; Fleckart and Perkins went on the hill, and my brother-in-law and I fol<lb/>lowed them; Fleckart and Perkins were to go inside, and me and my brother-in-law were to remain outside; Fleckart and Perkins went in to Mrs. Humphreys' house, and came out again in a short time, saying, 'We cannot do it now, without we part them'"—he then said, "I know nothing of the burglary myself, and that is all I know about it"—I then took him to the station—in consequence of what he stated, I went to Horwood's house, and gave him in charge of another constable—I told him what he was taken for—he said he knew nothing about it—I then went to No. 4, Paris-place, New Paris-street, Lambeth, and found Fleckart there—I have stated what passed between us—I produce some tools which I found in the front parlour of Mrs. Humphreys' house—I examined the hole that was made in the wall leading into the passage, next the wash house—that was where the entry had been effected—I found that these tools had been used in forcing the brickwork out, and two or three drawers were broken open—in consequence of information, on 28th May, I went down to Portsmouth; I found Payton living there, at No. 8, Park-street—he was employed as a warder on board the <hi rend="italic">Stirling Cattle</hi>, convict ship—I went to his house on 2nd June, for the first time—he was not in the way when I first went, I met him on the road the same afternoon, as he was going on duty; I stopped him, and said, "I understand your name is Payton"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I am an officer belonging to the London police, I have come to make a little inquiry respecting a man named Henry Slark, who has recently been discharged on a ticket of leave from the ship on board which you are warder; I understand he has been lodging at your house"—he said, "Yes, he has"—I said, "When did he first come to your house?"—he said, "On 28th or 29th April I believe"—I said, "Did any one come with him?"—he said, "A female"—I said, "Did he bring anything down with him?"—he said, "Yes, a carpet bag, and it appeared to be rather weighty"—I said, "Do you know where he is now?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Have you not heard from him since he left?"—he said, "Yes, I had a letter from him"—I said, "Have you got that letter?"—he said, "No, I have burnt it"—he said, "I hope you will not mention this to head quar<lb/>ters, that he has been lodging at uiy house"—I said, "Perhaps not, if you will assist me in finding the man Slark"—he promised me he would do all he could, and with that I parted from him—on Saturday, 7th June, in con<lb/>sequence of what I heard, I procured a search warrant from a Magistrate,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185607070071"/>
               <p>and went with it to Payton's house—I did not show him the warrant—he was in bed—he came down stairs, and said, "Have you heard anything fresh?"—I said, "Yes, I have, something very serious against you, Payton" I—said, "This robbery that he is accused of at Stamford-hill, there was a great deal of plate and jewellery, and other property stolen, has he left any behind at your house?"—he said, "No, he has left nothing at all here"—I said, "Do be cautious, if I should trace anything, or find anything after this notice, it will be a very serious thing with you, you had better look minutely and see"—he said, "I am quite certain there is nothing here"—I asked him if he saw Slark with any watches at the time he was there—he said, "No"—I said, "Has he given you a watch, or left one here, has he given you one for a keepsake?"—he said, "No, there is no watch here"—I said, "I am informed you had a watch on board the other night that you had never been seen with before"—he said, "Good God! who could have told you that? what will they say next?"—I said, "Payton, I have a warrant to search your house, and I am waiting for the superintendent to come, and no doubt you will be taken into custody"—upon that he paused for a second, and then got up and went out of the room, and went up stairs with his wife, who I believe was at this time in the passage—in about five minutes his wife and he came down stairs; his wife had a watch in her hand, and said, "Here is a watch that I found upstairs, which they must hare left behind"—he said, "You must not take that guard, that is mine"—there was a silver guard to it—I took possession of the watch and chain—I said, "I shall take charge of the guard, if it be proved to be yours, no doubt you will have it again"—I then left—I afterwards went again and searched the house further, but found nothing material to this inquiry—he was taken into custody—I came up to London, and showed the watch to Mrs. Humphreys—it is the same watch that has been produced to-day; it is the watch that was produced before the Magistrate, when Mrs. Humphreys' deposition was taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plumber, painter, and glazier, of No. 11, Dunstan-street, Kingsland-road. I know Horwood, he is married to my wife's sister—I know Trowers, he is ray wife's brother—I recollect, last Jan., going to a lodge meeting at the King's Arms, Milk-street, Spitalfields—Horwood was there, he is a member of the society—Fleckart came with him, and was introduced by him as his friend—he called Fleckart <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>, and said that his friend <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> was the man for Mr. Humphreys' <hi rend="italic">job</hi> that he could make tools, and was not afraid to use them—Fleckart was within hearing when that was said—I shook my head at Horwood to tell him not to speak in that manner; I did not tell him—I told a police constable afterwards of that—on a Sunday morning, after some parties had been to Mrs. Hum<lb/>phreys' house, and an attempt had been made, I saw Trowers—I think it was in Feb.; I went out with him, and said, "I understand Mrs. Hum<lb/>phreys' house has been attempted to be robbed, and you know something about it"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I told him I was sure he did know something about it—he then told me that he and <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi> (that is Horwood) and <hi rend="italic">Annie</hi> (Mrs. Perkins) met a friend of his at Shoreditch Church, and walked up the Kingsland-rond—he said, "I and <hi rend="italic">Annie</hi> walked up the left hand side, and <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi> and his friend walked on the right hand side, and carried the tools; we walked till we got near to Mrs. Humphreys' house, and then we parted; the man and <hi rend="italic">Annie</hi> got into Mrs. Humphreys' house, and me and <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi> watched outside; they stopped in, the house for some time, and then they came out, and said that they had not got any<lb/>thing; that Mrs. Humphreys treated them so well that the men had not the heart to rob her"—he also said that when <hi rend="italic">Annie's</hi> brother came home, whose name I hear is Slark, he would break into the house if he got down the chimney, or had the slates off the house, or got in through a brick wall, for he was a very determined fellow—I pressed him, of course, to hare nothing to do with such an affair, and so on—a few days, or a week after<lb/>wards, I saw Horwood, and he told me the same story as Trowers bad told me, that he, and <hi rend="italic">Annie</hi>, and they all met at Shoreditch Church; but, in addition, he said that his friend <hi rend="italic">ill</hi>, the engineer, was the man that weni, and that he would go through the chimney but what he would get in—I afterwards heard of the robbeiy being committed, and saw Horwoed and Towers together at Horwood's house, in Trafalgar-street, Walworth, about two days after it was committed—I think it was at the latter end of Feb., or the beginning of March, that I heard that the robbery was committed—I told them that the house had been broken into, and Trowers said that <hi rend="italic">Annies</hi> brother and some of his <hi rend="italic">pals</hi> had done it, and Horwood said the same—they asked me whether I knew how much was taken away—I told them I did not—they said that if they saw the tools ihey should know whose make they were, and that what was stolen was far enough in the country by this time—about two days after that I saw Horwood, in the presence of his wife, who is vory deaf; she cannot hear, unless you speak</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185607070075"/>
               <p>loudly to her—she said that she wished she had never spoken about it; she wished her tongue had been cut out rather than she should have spoken about it—when Horwood was taken the policeman took me to his house, and would not allow me to go away—he told me that must not go away, I must keep with them—Horwood said'that he should like to see the took, that he should know them—he said so several times, but nothing further.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you make any communi<lb/>cation first to the police? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it was about January; it was shortly after the meeting at the lodge—Towers is my wife's brother, and Horwood married my wife's sister—have not known Horwood above two years; I have known Towers a longer time—have been convicted; a quart pot was bent one day, and took it out of the house, and was going to throw it over a wall—there was nobody on the other side to catch it—it was con<lb/>sidered that stole the pot, and was convicted, and had six months, that is eleven years ago—have never been convicted before that or since, but have got an honest living—am a plumber, painter, and glazier—I work for customers whom have, respectable people—in Jan. last had many customers, I was at work—know the policeman Langdon by his being a policeman—never was a witness for him in any case, nor has my father to my knowledge—nobody took me to this lodge meeting at the King's Arms, I went by myself; there is a meeting every week, it is the Loyal United Friends—saw Fleckart there, he came with Horwood, did not see them come in, but I should naturally suppose they came together, they were acquaintances—know that, because Horwood introduced Fleckart to me as his friend on that evening—Horwood is a member—there were a few people in front of the bar whom I knew, being members of the society—I told the policeman what Horwood told me, and told the Magistrate—I told several policemen at the time—shook my head at Horwood, thought it was a shameful thing for him to endeavour to do such a thing—I thought it was very imprudent to talk openly of such matters; thought, as an honest man, that it was very imprudent of him—I did not think it might interrupt the harmony of the meeting—the robbery was committed in Feb. or March—hardly knew where Mrs. Humphreys' house was, know now; did not know exactly where it was situated in Jan.—heard of it first by Horwood telling me that his wife had robbed Mrs. Humphreys while she lived with her, and that he intended to have some more of her money—first heard of the robbery when was told by a policeman at Hoxton—cannot say exactly whether that was in Feb.—did not tell that policeman of the conversation at the lodge—had told other policemen before that, one named McNallen and one named Jefferys, that it was their intention to rob the house; told them that in Jan., twice or three times—I mean to say that told those two policemen in January that Horwood and another man intended to rob Mrs. Humphreys' house—did not tell Langton, I did not happen to meet with him nor Bovis—have not seen a single policeman here that told—think it was a man named Watts that stated that the house was robbed, I am almost certain; he knew that had told the police beforehand that it was their intention to rob this house—I know that because he told me so—he told me that the house had been robbed; I suppose that was because he had heard, very likely he might have heard it—I had not told him at the conversation at the King's Arms—am not certain that Watts did tell me; it was either a man named Watts or Jefferys—do not know what made them tell me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What made you tell me just now, that they told you because you had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185607070076"/>
               <p>told the policeman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, most likely; I do not know the sentiment of their minds—I had told them previously that I had heard, in Jan. last, that they intended to break it open, and I told the police of it—it was in the middle of the day that he met me, or in the morning, I will not swear which—Watts is not here that J know of, or Jefferys; I should know them if I saw them—he knew ray name, he is not a friend of mine; if I see a police<lb/>man I consider him to be a respectable man, and speak to him—he knew my name, because I have lived in that neighbourhood for years, and all the policemen know my name; he called me Smith—I have known Watts ten years, but I cannot say whether it was he or Jefferys—it was in March that they first told me about the house being robbed, I never heard it till I heard it from them—that policeman, whoever he is, I had known for some time; I do not know who it was, it was spoken between two or three of us—I am not certain that it was either Watts or Jefferys; I think it was one or the other; I think it was Jefferys—it was either one or the other—I am not certain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If either Watts or Jefferys told you that Mrs. Humphreys' house had been broken into, would not the natural reply be, "I heard in Jan. that it was going to be broken into?" <hi rend="italic">A. I</hi> had told Jefferys—I mean to say that Jefferys was the man I told—I believe the house was guarded, the police ought to have guarded it after the information I gave, if they did not do so—I have not seen a single man here to whom I mentioned this conversation—I have not been drinking with Langdon—I have been in the same room as he has at Worship-street—I never recollect drinking with him in my life previous to this affair—I heard of the robbery in Feb., and saw Towers two or three days afterwards—I saw Trowers first, and mentioned the affair to him—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a letter which I have had sent tome—Ido not know whether it is necessary to show it, I got it last Tuesday week—I do not know who it is from, there is no name to it—I did not tell Troweis what the prisoner told me, but I told him that the house had been broken into, and he said that <hi rend="italic">Annie'ss</hi> brother had done it—his name, I believe, is Slark—I saw him once, I believe; if he is the same man he has dark whiskers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does he pass for <hi rend="italic">Annie's</hi> brother? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I saw him at Mrs. Perkins' house; I saw a man who I expect was the man—he was not called Slark there—I rather fancied he was the man, I do not know the man personally.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How often did you see him there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only when Mrs. Perkins was taken into custody—he was in London, but I do not say he is the man—I have seen Mrs. Perkins two or three times, I have been there with Horwood, and it was there that I saw the man—it was not a visit, he has called when he went past—I was with Horwood, because he is related to me—I went twice to Mrs. Perkins', we had some gin one day—it was on the morning that Mrs. Perkins was taken that I saw the man there—I went because the police made me go—Trowers told them, and I told them as well—I mean to say that there was a man there, Who I thought afterwards was Slark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he there when you and the policeman went in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not go in, I stood outside the door, and he was in the passage—I believe he ran away—I cannot tell the place where he is—I hope you will have him here before long—I knew Mrs. Perkins by no other name than <hi rend="italic">Annie</hi>; I saw her first about eight or nine months ago—I never asked Horwood or Trowers if <hi rend="italic">Annie's</hi> brother had come home—when I told Horwood of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185607070077"/>
               <p>burglary, and he said that <hi rend="italic">Annie's</hi> brother, or some of his <hi rend="italic">pals</hi>, had done it, I said, "I suppose <hi rend="italic">Annie's</hi> brother has come home then 1" and he said, "Yes, he has"—he made a laugh of it, and said that it was all right, a long was country before now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Horwood. Q.</hi> What is the reason you did not come and give your evidence when I was taken into custody on 5th May? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I was told not—you were discharged and were at liberty for six weeks before they took you again: you discharged on the first occasion—my brother told me not to give evidence, but that the better plan was for me to go home, and go to bed, as I was tired—the police kept me out the best part of the night, and I did not think it necessary for me to go.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long were you prevented by the police from going away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From 9 o'clock at night till 4 or 5 in the morning—I might have gone away at 3 or 4 o'clock, and during that time I went to Horwood's—I might have gone home if I thought proper—they took me home in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, about 8 o'clock, but I think I might have gone at 4 if I felt disposed—I cannot say that I waited of my own accord—I fix upon 4 o'clock, because that was the time that they went to Perkins', and I went with them—I was still detained, they told me that I must not go away—I came back from Perkins' to the station with them, and they took me home in a <hi rend="italic">cub</hi> at 8 o'clock in the morning, and left me there at large—it was about 9 o'clock, I think, when I met my brother, and he told me that I had better go to bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Horwood. Q.</hi> Do not you owe me a bill for work I have done for you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not—I did not come and obtain a coat from your house under false pretences—I never had a coat from your house in my life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COOPER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is your brother a friend of Lewis's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He knew him by seeing him—he is no particular friend.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you search Horwood's drawers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I was never on unfriendly terms with Horwood—I do not owe him any account or bill—he did a Little job, which I paid him for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

On 26th April, I was called in to attend Fleckart, professionally, for inflammation of the testicles, which I think was recent, it was very acute—recent inflammation would be of that acute kind—he said that it happened from assisting an in<lb/>toxicated person up stairs—a person with a testicle of that sort could not walk many miles—he might have walked, but with very great difficulty indeed—a man with an inflamed testicle would walk easier with his hand below it, supporting it in his hand—I do not think holding his hand in his pocket, and pressing against the nerves would give ease to it—I think he would hold it, in his hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at 8st Thomas's Hospital This prescription is mine—on 24th April, Fleckart came to me, he was suffering from inflammation of the testicle—it was very much inflamed—I ordered him proper medicines and desired him to take them that night and apply some leeches—he had the leeches—that was between 11 and 12 o'clock in the morning—I did not see him again that day—he limped a good deal—in my judgment it is very improbable that a man with that complaint could be out at night.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it of long standing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I ordered hot water after the leeches; they do sometimes give quick relief, so as to relieve the pain—exercise afterwards would bring back the inflammation—he would not he positively disabled from walking, but he limped a great deal; every step caused him great pain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When leeches are applied, does not the bleeding some-times continue for a considerable time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sometimes for many hours, and sometimes it does not—I ordered eight leeches—I should not expect that a man who has had eight leeches, and taken a blue pill, would be out to commit a burglary—the papers are brought to me, with the date on them, and if the date is wrong it would attract my attention directly—I have no hesitation in saying that it is correct, and that it was on the 24th—it is the duty of whoever does put the date on, to see that it is done correctly, and I always look to see that the date is correct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the paper was brought, was the word "April" attached to it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—from my general habit of business, I feel sure that I should not have filled it up unless it was properly dated, but I do not say that I have any recollection of this particular transaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Looking at that, is it your belief that the "April" and the figures are written by the same person, and by the same person that usually fills them up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at it again; from your knowledge of the writing, which I understand you have repeatedly acted upon, can you undertake to express an opinion whether these figures are the writing of the surgery man at the hospital? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe they are—I have got familiar with his figures, as well as the rest of his writing—I believe the figures are his writing—then is no date of the year; I am quite sure it was this year—it is not usual in these out patients' cases to put the date of the year; they are simply given for the patients themselves, and when done with they are destroyed—the day of the month is put to enable the medical man to know each time the patient attends—I am quite sure it was not 1855—they would not have given him the medicine unless he presented the letter on the same day that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185607070081"/>
               <p>it bears date—the name of the party and the residence is in the writing of the surgery man—I should suppose that was the same man who wrote "April 24th," judging from the character of it; I do not say that it if is; I I did not see him write either.</p>

Fleckart is my son-in-law; his wife is my daughter—I recollect his coming home with medicine in April last; he showed it to me—it was Thursday, 24th April; that I can vouch for, because he was very bad, and I paid attention to him—I saw some medicine which he brought home; it was leeches—he came home with them, I think, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon—I understood that he had come from the hospital that day, and I believe there was a letter, but he did not show it to me—he went to bed immediately he came in—he sleeps in the front parlour, and I in the back—his wife was there that night, and she applied the leeches; I did not see them applied, but I was there the whole night—I saw the blood afterwards; that was about 5 o'clock in the afternoon—the leeches were applied immediately he went to bed—I saw a lotion—I can undertake to say that he remained at home, and in bed, the whole of that night; he never went out—I never went to bed; I stopped up to attend him; I saw him frequently, and he was in great pain and suffering—I do not know whether he took a pill—next day, the 25th, he was very bad indeed, and in bed the whole day—he never was out of bed till they took him away—on the 26th he was so bad as to be obliged to send for a doctor; Mr. Gough was sent for, and continued to treat him till the police came and took him away from the house—I am not in the habit of taking a drop too, much—the prisoner was obliged, some two or three weeks before, to assist me up stairs, and he hurt himself, but it was not through drink; I was certainly sick; he was obliged to help me, and I consider that he strained himself—it was some weeks before the 24th that he met with the accident.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the leading man of the joiners in Woolwich Dockyard. On Sunday evening, 15th June, I was coming from the station at North Woolwich, intending to proceed across to the other Woolwich—I was standing on the barge or dummy—my daughter was there—she had just landed with some more friends—there was a crowd of persons on the dummy—I felt myself shoved against from behind—I turned round, and was confronted with the prisoner Smith—I put my hand round, thinking my handkerchief was gone, and 1 said, rather angrily, "Where are you shoring? there is plenty of room"—he made no answer—I turned again to speak to a little boy, and I felt a second pressure—I was still keeping my hand in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> pocket, on my handkerchief, and turning to pat the little boy's hat right—I felt another pressure on the same side, the right side—I turned immediately, and heard my daughter <hi rend="italic">sing</hi> out—I had a watch in my right hand waistcoat pocket, attached to a short gold guard chain, which was through a button hole—my daughter said, "What is that man doing? he has taken your watch"—I looked, and found my chain hanging, and my watch was gone, and Smith also—I recognized him so well that I know him again—he was with another person, not with the other prisoner—I did not see Smith after the first pressure—I ran as fast as I could to the policeman at the railway station door, which might be 100 yards from the dummy—I saw Smith again in two minutes afterwards, when the policeman was coming out of the Pavilion tavern, with both the prisoners in custody—I said, "That is the one that took my watch;" a crowd collected, and it was neces<lb/>sary to put the prisoners in the place where they take the tickets—the constable left them there with me, while he went to the superintendent—Smith said, "Let us go"—I said, "I will see you hanged first"—I said I should very ill spare the time to prosecute, but I certainly should do it—Smith said, "You have got your watch," or "You will get your watch, what more do you want?"—Garrett said, "You did not see me there"—this is my watch, and the one I lost—here is the swivel attached to it.</p>

I am stationed at Woolwich—I know the prisoners—on Saturday morning, 28th June, as near 1 o'clock as possible, I saw them in company in the High-street—they came from the direction of the Steamboat Pier—they were 500 or 600 yards from it, and. about half a mile from Mr. Sparrow's, going towards it—they went into a public house—about a quarter to 3 o'clock I saw them together again at Rolf's Steamboat Pier—I was in plain clothes—Anderson was carrying this bag on his back, which I have had ever since, and Wilmott had these two umbrellas and stick (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his right hand—he took two tickets for London—they then had fifty or sixty yards to go to the dummy—they went on board the boat for London, and I followed them—they went to the aft part of the boat—Anderson set the bag down, and they stood and talked together, they then went to the fore part of the boat—Anderson carried the bag again, placed it down, and they both Rat down together—Wilmott put the umbrellas by his side—I went up and asked them where they had been to-day—Anderson answered, "What do you mean, sir f"—I laid, "Have you been to the barracks?"—they said, "No"—I said, "What have you got in this bag?"—Wilmott replied, "What do you mean, sir?"—he was then in the act of getting up—he went across towards the gangway, and ran out on to the dummy—Anderson was about to follow him—I laid hold of him, and called, "Stop thief!" after Wilmott, who was running up the steps—one of the captains caught hold of him and brought him back—Wil<lb/>mott asked me what I was taking him for—I told him for having taken two umbrellas—he said, "I never had them"—with some assistance I took them and the bag to the police station, having tied their hands together—when we got to the station I undid the bag and asked Anderson how he accounted for the possession of the property—he said, "I never had it"—the bag con<lb/>tains a writing desk and fourteen pairs of boots and shoes, the name, "J. W. Sparrow," on it—I found on Wilmott a counterfeit half-crown and a skeleton key merely to open a latch; but I do not think it was made for any particular latch, and fourpence halfpenny in money, and on Anderson,</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Sparrow, a solicitor, of Wool<lb/>wich. On Saturday, 28th June, the family left home, about 10 minutes before 11 o'clock, and I was left alone in the house—there are two offices where the business is carried on, one of them opens from the street, and then into the inner office—if a person goes into the house from the street door they can get by the passage into the office—there was nobody in the office—this desk is Mr. Sparrow's—I saw it that morning, after I was left alone in the house—it stood behind the door in the back office on a little shelf—this bag was in Mr. Sparrow's house that day, but it does not belong to him; a considerable quantity of boots had been sent for for the children to try on, and eight pairs were left in this bag, in the back office—I put it there myself—these things were all safe after the family left, on Saturday—about 3 o'clock a policeman came, and took me to the station, where I saw the things, and claimed them as my master's—I do not know their value—my master is not well.</p>

Q.</hi> When had you seen the umbrellas? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw them every day, because I had to dust them—the family had gone into the country, but only for two days; it was very fine, and they did not take the umbrellas—Mr. Sparrow left at 10 minutes before 9 o'clock, and Mrs. Sparrow, and the child, and nurse, at 10 minutes before 1—there were no clerks and no boy in the office—I and the nurse are the only domestics—I had not missed the articles before the policeman came—I bad not left the house—I went into the office just after Mrs. Sparrow left, to put the books on a ohair for the man who was to call for them in the course of the after<lb/>noon—there are papers and other articles in the office, none of them were disturbed—I noticed the umbrella stand when I went past it, because I put a cotton umbrella into it which was down stairs, out of its place; that umbrella was left, and is there now—I can swear to these umbrellas, this one has lost part of the top, it had a round knob about the length of the, silver.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engine driver in the employ of William Mor<lb/>gan and Son, rope manufacturers, Jamaica-level, Rotherhithe. The prisoner was in their service—on Wednesday, 11th June, I was at work on the pre<lb/>mises—I cannot say exactly how many of us there were at work—there were two in the frames where they frame the rope—I was at the engine—one was winding, and Coombes was padding—it is my duty to light the gas all over the premises—I did so that night, <hi rend="italic">barring</hi> the tar house gas, I did not light that, it was not required to be used that night—I lighted the gas about 9 o'clock, it might have been a little before—when I lighted the other gas I looked at the jet in the tar house—there is only one burner there—I turned it off correct, so as to be sure that the gas could not escape—I felt it, and tried it—at that time there were no signs of fire—there had been no fire under the tar kettle for twenty-four hours—they call it a ket<lb/>tle, but it is a copper set in brick work—I walked into the tar house at half past 8 o'clock to see if everything was right—I remained on the pre<lb/>mises until the fire broke out—after lighting the gas I went into my engine room, and attended to my engine—this occurred about 20 minutes to 11 o'clock—the engine house is about ten or twelve yards from the tar house—I came out of the engine house at 20 minutes to 11 o'clock—I observed no sign of fire about the tar house at that time—I went up to the frame which is at the upper end of the ground, and had not been there a minute or two before I heard the signal bell pulled—that is a bell which is pulled when the work gets foul, for it to be stopped—I turned round to pull the line off the clutch, and saw the tar house all in a flame—I directly ran to the engine house to draw my fire from the boiler—as I was running down, Coombes was the first one that met me, by the stoke hole door—he came across from the direction of the tar house door—he was running up the ground to<lb/>wards the frame, and I was running towards the stoke hole—he said to me, "The place is all on fire"—I said to him, "You must have done it," using an expression which I do not wish to repeat—I did not hear him make any reply—when I first saw him running, he was about ten or twelve yards from the door of the tar house—if he wanted a light in the tar house he had no authority to light the gas without my assistance, nor had any one else on the premises—they should ask me, it is my business—next morning, Thursday, I went to have a look at the ruins, about ten o'clock, and I saw that the plug was out of the jet in the tar house, and I put a wooden one in in case I should forget it on the following night—as soon as I saw the fire on the Wednesday night, I went and turned off the gas, and lighted it again in a few minutes, after they had got all out at the lower end; we could shut it off from beyond the tar house without affecting the gas there—I have never seen the plug since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am ten years old. I live with my father and mother at Matilda-place, Botherhithe—I was employed at Messrs. Morgans rope factory for about two months—on the night the fire happened I was assisting Coombes in his work, padding junks of yarn—I do not know how many junks there were in the tar house that night to be done—I saw Coombes fetch a junk out of the tar house—he brought it outside against the outside wheel—there is a loop hole near where the junks are and a truck upon which it is turned after it comes out—he put the junks through the hole—I was inside and he was outside—I do not know how long it takes to pad a junk—there was no other junk taken out after that one—I saw Coombes come into the tar house about two or three minutes after that junk had been taken out—he said he came to see how many junks then were, he had a bit of rope yarn alight is his hand when he came in—there was no gas alight in the tar house at that time—I came away from the tar house after that, no, I stopped at the door—there is a gas light outside the tar house near the door; that was alight—I saw Coombes light a bit of rope yarn at that light, and then he went into the tar house—I was standing so that I could see him after he had gone into the tar house—I saw that he was going to light the gas inside—he did not light it, he attempted to light it but did not, he came away from it, came over with the yarn and threw the rope yarn on to the junks—there was some band stuff there as well—I did not see anything there besides the junks—when he threw the lighted yarn there, it was on fire—the prisoner then came out and pulled the bell to stop the work—Massey called out "Fire!"—I did not call out—it was after Massey had called out "Fire!" that the prisoner pulled the bell—I went down the ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you had any light in your hand that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I had a match—I had it in the tar house—I lighted it and threw it outside in the ground, through the hole—I had put it out when I threw it out I had got that match on the Millpond Bridge, not at my master's, I found it, I only found that one—the prisoner was outside when I lighted it and threw it away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You lighted the match in the tar house, did you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I pulled it against the wall to light it, not near the junk, nor near the gas—no one was there when I lighted it, Massey was outside, just outside the door—he is a little bigger than me—nobody else was near the door besides Massey; me and Coombes and Massey were working together—Massey is not here—when the fire began Massey was just outside the door along with Coombes against the hole—that is not close to the tar house—I do not know how far it is, it is further than across this court—we were all three together when the fire began to blaze—a man named Coppick was there, he was putting the junk on the jigger; he got the junk from the tar house—I was working with Coppick the first time—he is a good deal bigger than rne, he is as big as Coombes—he had got the junk from the tar house before the fire, a good bit before—my master called me in next morning and asked me about the fire—at first I told him I knew nothing about it, and then I told him about</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185607070097"/>
               <p>the lucifer match—I did not say anything about Coombes until I got to the Magistrate—I told my lather and mother when I got home that the place was set fire to—I did not tell them anything about Coombes, nor about the lucifer match—I did not see the plug in the gas pipe, I did not see anybody pull it out—I knew where it was—Coombes lighted the piece of ropeyarn at the gas outside, just facing the door of the tar house—I do not know whether Massey saw him light it, he was against the hole—there was a boy named Feakes there, he was along with Coppick, putting the junk on, and Murley was putting the junk on—Dryden is a man.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is the place where the jigger is, called the winding shed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that is against the outside wheel, as you go down the ground—you cannot see from the winding shed into the tar house, there is a wall between—Massey was against the hole at the time the prisoner had the light in his hand—the truck is the thing that the rope is coiled on, and then it is taken to the winding shed—Massey was against the truck, dose against the winding shed—I could not reach the gas burner in the tar house—I do not know why I did not tell Mr. Morgan about this directly I was asked—it was half past 12 o'clock that night when I went home; that was the first night I had worked there—the work used to be goiug on night and day—my father and mother were in bed when I got home, I saw them that night, I told them there was a fire; I did not tell them about the lucifer match, or about the prisoner having a light in his hand, and what he did with it—I cannot give you any reason why I did not—I went to bed as soon as I got home.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There are men and boys employed at this work, are there not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, one man has two or three bop to attend on him—I usually worked with Coombes—he was outside at a wheel, and I was inside, he had a boy outside against the hole; my work inside was to take the junk off the ground and shore it through the hole, and then the boy outside took the junk and pulled it away—I lighted the lucifer match, and blew it out, and then chucked it outside, I did not want to set the place on fire—I am sure I threw it outride—that was just when we were going to take the junk out, about a quarter of an hour before I came out of the tar house—I did my work after lighting the match—I was hauling it out at the same time, hauling it out with one hand, and I lighted the match with the other—I am quite sure I did not set fire to it then, it was quarter of an hour before the fire, I am sure of that—I only had one match—I had had it all day since the morning—the prisoner could not see what quantity of junk there was from where he stood outside—when he brought this junk out he told me he was going to see how many junks there were—they at first said that I did it: master did not say so, the men did—I had not told them about the match before that, they did not know about it—one of the boys first said I did it, he did not say I had done it with the match—I had not shown the match to any of the boys in the course of the day—I did not know I had it in, my pocket in the course of the day—I had been at work there two months—I went to work from six o'clock in the morning till six at night, this night Coppick asked me to work there all night—I went to work at six o'clock in the morning, and had been working all day, and Coppick asked me to work all night, and I said I would—I forget which of the boys it was that said I did it—all of them said I did it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Glebe-terrace, and am foreman to the prosecutors. On 11th June, the prisoner was at work at their ropery—there was a great deal of work to get through—I told the prisoner at 5 o'clock</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185607070098"/>
               <p>that afternoon that he would have to work late at night, both him and his brother—he would have to pad the remainder of the junks that wore left there were three left then—I told him how many there were—they were in the tar hotwe—his work was padding the yarn, that is coiling it round—the time it takes to pad a junk depends upon what sort it is, some take longer than others, it might take two hours to do some of them—it is ne<lb/>cessary to pad them separately—they come out through the hole—I was not on the premises at the time the fire took place—I went about ten minutes past 11 o'clock, when the boy came and knocked us up—about half-pagt 6 o'clock next morning, in consequence of what one of the men said, I looked at the gas in the tar house, and found the plug was out—I had not obserad it the night before; that would cause the gas to escape—the plug was about eight feet from the ground—the gas branch did not appear to be at all injured beyond the loss of the plug.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Does not the person employed as the prisoner was constantly go into the tar house to get junk out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; either he might do it himself or get the boy to help him—the course of the work is for the boy to stand inside and hand the junk out through the hole, and the man outside puts it on the wheel—I went to the place after the fire, it was then all burnt down—the firemen were there—they went into the tar house, and a great many people also—I cannot tell whether the firemen pulled the plug out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of William James Morgan, and am in partnership with him and my brother as rope manufacturers. I manage the business—it is in the parish of St. Mary, Rotherhithe—the prisoner was a labourer in our service, but not a first class labourer—he received about one seventh leas than a first class labourer—I have heard him say many times that he ought to receive more money as he was quite as good as the other labourers, but we considered that he was not—in the performance of his duties he had business in the tar house—he had to go in for each junk if the boy was too small to put the end through; after that he had to put it on a truck and take it down to the ground, about thirty yards down below</p>

               <p>the tar house and winding shed, and run it out its full length, 100 yards, or thereabouts, and then pad it up—I cannot say how long that would take, because the yarns might be broken; it might take two hours—it was decidedly his duty to finish one junk before he took another—after the fire I saw him several times, and asked him questions, but he would not answer—I asked him where he was when the fire took place, and said, "You and Coppick had to take the junk out, and one of you six must have done it"—I he had said that he knew nothing about it—I repeated that several times, and then he said, "I have said what I know, and I shall say no more," and stood very sullenly against the desk.</p>

"I do;" "Were you there when the fire broke out?" "I was;" "Had you any gas alight at that time?" he said, "I shall answer you no questions;" I said, "Well, Coombes, I understand you are the last man seen in the tar house before the fire broke out;" he said, "Well, that you have got to prove"—I was in uniform—I took him to Mr. Morgan's office; he said, "Coombes, you were one of the six, and it in evident that one of you must know some<lb/>thing about this fire; where were you at the time?" he said, "I shall answer you no questions"—Coppick was there, and I think he said that he was padding his yarn; on his making that observation, the prisoner said, "Hold your tongue, you fool; let them talk, I shall say nothing"—upon that the prisoner was given into my custody—I have searched in the tar house for the plug belonging to the gas pipe, but have not been able to find it—the gas branch is 6 feet 8, or 9, inches from the ground to the burner, I measured it yesterday.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, L</hi> 76). I was called to No. 77, Granby-street—I saw Ann Laws on the step, bleeding very much from a wound on her head, and her gown covered with blood—I searched for the prisoner, and found her in the next house, No. 78, concealed under the bed—I told her she must come to the station—she made use of very bad expressions, and said, "I <hi rend="italic">bleeding well</hi> won't"—I took her with difficulty, she clung to the bed post—I took her to the station—I with the last witness found this knife—on the Monday morning I took the prisoner before the Magistrate—she was very abusive, and when the Magistrate committed her for trial, I went to tell her to go to the cell, she said, "You b—I will not," and she spat in my face.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical student, at St Thomas's Hospital I was on duty that week—I remember Ann Laws being brought in—she had a wound on the right side of the head, just over the right ear—it was about an inch long, and about half an inch deep—it was made by some cutting instrument—it might have been done with this knife—I did not think it dangerous.</p>
