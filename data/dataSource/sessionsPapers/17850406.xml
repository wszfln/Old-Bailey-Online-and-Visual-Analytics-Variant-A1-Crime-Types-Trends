               <p>Did you know the child? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it one of his children? - I believe it to be so, according to the mother's discourse.</p>
               <p>Was it a boy, or a girl? - A boy.</p>
               <p>What age was he? - Not quite nine, till next June I think; the father came after the boy out of the house.</p>
               <p>Was he running out? - No, walking; his father had a poker in his right hand, and he hit him over the left side of his head with the poker; he bled a good deal, and I saw the blood run to the collar of his shirt.</p>
               <p>Do attend to me particularly; did the boy come out first? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the father get before him at all? - No, the door stands up in an alley, and the child came out side-ways to shun him, and met his father with the poker in his hand, and he hit him on the left side of the head; and the child came over to me, and held up his two hands, and begged me to save him; I put him on my own stairs; about a quarter of an hour after the father came to me, and said, damn him, where is he? - I begged of him to qualify his passion; the father went to his own habitation, he came again, and brought a little dish, what we call a penny dish, with about a pound of meat in it hot; he said the boy had eaten four pounds all but that bit, while he had been to the mother to the hospital; he asked me where he was; I told I would not tell him, without he would promise not to beat him again; he did not say whether he would or not, but he went away to his own apartment again; and in about half an hour he came to me again, and asked me where he was; I told him, I would tell him if he would not beat him; otherwise I would not; he said he would not; I went up to the child and said, Joey, your daddy wants you; and he said, has he got ever a stick in his hand? I said no my dear; I took him by his right arm, and carried him in doors to his father; and he said nothing to him that night, nor I did not see him beat him, or hear him that night; but the next morning about five, he cried out sadly.</p>
               <p>What did you hear? - I heard him cry out, dear daddy, dear daddy.</p>
               <p>In what manner? - Crying out in a very loud manner,

               <p>Court. Could you see what he struck him with? - It was a poker, upon my honour; but to swear to the poker I cannot.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the wound, or any thing? - I cannot say I did, for I was rather flurried; but there had been a scab on his head, on that place ever since.</p>
               <p>Had his head stopped bleeding before you carried him home? - No, it had not, but it did not bleed so fierce as it did at first.</p>
               <p>Did not you offer to wipe off the blood, or any thing of that sort? - I did not upon my word, I was so much flurried, I really did not.</p>
               <p>Did you see him the next day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there a scab there then? - Yes, and to the day of his death.</p>
               <p>The bleeding was stopped? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts was it particularly? - On the back part of his head, among the hair.</p>

               <p>I lived next door to the last witness, and keep a chandler's shop: on the 12th of February, on a Saturday in the afternoon, the mother of the child came over to me for a peck of coats; I asked her how her little baby did, which was sucking at her breast, she said it was better, but her little boy Joey was very ill, and she had just been up to the Dispensary for three papers of powders for him; then you see, Sir, she said that her child had been very ill for some time; with that I said, it is a very good thing, it is very well you are come home, for your child has been used very ill; then she went over to her own house.</p>
               <p>Why did you say so, did you know the child had been used ill? - Yes, by screaming out, the neighbours were always calling to the prisoner, and saying he was a second Brownrig, using his child ill.</p>
               <p>Have you ever heard the child scream out? - Yes, several times.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the prisoner beat the child? - Never in my life; about dark I went over to see the child, not knowing he was in that condition; when I went in his mother was standing by the fire side, and I said Mrs. Thing-a-me, where is your little boy? and she said here, in the cradle.</p>
               <p>Court. Why he was eight or nine years old? - Yes, but he lay in a cradle when I saw him; she took a candle and shewed me the child, and when I saw him I was so shocked, I thought I should have dropped into the cradle.</p>
               <p>What appearance had he? - By his head, he moaned most bitterly.</p>
               <p>What was the appearance that shocked you? - I said to her, dear me, Mrs. Thing-a-me, what have you done to your child, have you poisoned him? - she said no.</p>
               <p>Did she say any thing about her husband? - No, his head was swelled terribly, then I went into my own place again; I went over again presently, and asked her how he did, she said, he was very bad indeed; I said Mrs. Thing-a-me, is he in his senses, and she said, O yes! Madam, says she, you shall hear him speak, I have just been talking to him; says she,

               <p>How can you tell he was beating him? - Because I have heard the blows up two pair of stairs, I have heard the blows in the morning by five o'clock, and sometimes late at night; and the last time he was down stairs, I was coming down, and I looked through, and I saw the child coming out of the door, and the prisoner was going to kick him, and he lifted up his foot to kick him, and the child cried out, O daddy.</p>
               <p>Did he kick him? - He did not kick him, but he pulled him by the hand, and hit him over the face.</p>
               <p>What with? - With his flat hand, then he was running out of doors, and he caught him, and the child cried out, and he put his hand and stopped his breath, and he pulled him in by his arm, and the neighbours cried out shame; I said afterwards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060005"/> to the child, has your daddy been beating you? he said, yes, my daddy has a new way of beating me, because the neighbours should not cry out shame.</p>

               <p>I lived opposite, I frequently used to hear the child cry out in a most shocking manner, my husband and I have perfectly heard the blows; the child used to come into my shop, I keep a chandler's shop, and he said, his daddy was always beating and kicking him.</p>
               <p>Was that at the time you have heard the blows? - No, not then, but he was frequently beating the child, every day two or three times a day, he was hardly free from crying out.</p>
               <p>Court. I think you are not to tell us what the boy said, I would not have you tell us what the child said, especially at that time, that he was running from his father's house to you, because you see, gentlemen of the Jury, that declaration was not upon oath, nor was there any thing that would bind the child, nor was he in that sort of state, to inforce what he said to be true; as for instance, the declarations of dying people not expecting to recover, have that influence on their minds and conscience at that time, which makes them equal to an oath; and that desire that they must then have in point of conscience not to speak a falshood, is equal to evidence upon oath; but there was no influence on this child's mind at that time: and another thing, in consequence of his provocation, and perhaps being ill used by his father, he might exaggerate what his father had done, being angry with his father, and his father with him; therefore, I think these declarations are not to be received in evidence, for if that was the case, you see what dangerous consequences might ensue.</p>

            . I agree intirely with my brother, I think this evidence ought not to be received: all evidence against prisoners is to be on oath, with one exception, which is a declaration without oath, by a person who conceives himself to be in a dying condition, as to the author of the in jury he has received; and that is upon this ground, that the situation of such a party creates an obligation upon his mind to speak the truth, equal to the sanction of an oath; that of necessity applies only to the particular situation of the party then upon a death bed, and cannot possibly extend to all the general declarations that persons make, who may have received injuries: the rule is a general one, and this prisoner, and all prisoners must be entitled to it; it is a rule founded on public justice.</p>

            . Was it always O daddy? - Yes, daddy, daddy, dear daddy, daddy! the father was as hoarse then, as he is now, that he could not hear him; the mother has been in the hospital sometime, she had been at home a fortnight and two days when the child died.</p>
               <p>You never heard of any complaint of any body else hurting him, but his daddy? - No, Sir; I never saw any blows, but have heard the report of blows several times; between the room that they lay in, and that I lay in, there was about a yard and an half; there were two partitions between, a bit of a wooden partition, I fancy it was originally all one house.</p>

               <p>I live in Shoreditch, I am a surgeon.</p>
               <p>You was sent for? - I was requested by Mr. Philips, the coroner, to attend the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060007"/> Jury; observing a confusion on the right side of the head, a little above the temple, I removed the scalp, which was detatched from the skull, which was parted from the skull underneath; I observed a fissure upon the bone, the difference between a fissure and a fracture, is much the same as between a flaw and a crack in a pane of glass, the one is partial, and the other impartially through; the fracture goes quite through, but the fissure is only partially through, the same as a flaw in a pane of glass; I then took off the upper part of the scull, and the vessels of the brain under the fissure were very turgid and inflamed, and the maladies of membrancs of the brain adhered to the skull, which is common where there are very great inflammations from concussions, or from colds, or other causes: the contents of the thorax and the abdomen were perfectly found.</p>

               <p>Go on and describe where the mortal violence was received? - That was all I could perceive on the head, some of the witnesses have mentioned the left side, but there was nothing on the left side any more than the scurf, which is common to children not taken care of; there were no marks of violence at all on the left side, the mischief seemed to be entirely on the right.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was there no scare on the left side? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there no scab, nor any appearance of any? - None at all.</p>

            . No appearance of there having been only lately? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Court. It would leave an appearance? - I should imagine so, it was on what we call the os bregnitis.</p>
               <p>Could you form any judgment what it was done by? - It must be by some obtuse instrument, some blunt instrument.</p>
               <p>Did you think, from the symptoms you observed, that it was the cause of the child's death? - There is every reason to conclude so, the child had that fallow bloated countenance, and that emaciated appearance of body, which children in poor habitations that have been badly clothed, and scantily sed have; but I should imagine from the wound that appeared on the head, that the death must be owing to that wound.</p>
               <p>You think it was certainly? - I have not the least doubt but it was.</p>
               <p>Jury. You did not see the child till after it was dead? - No, the general state of the child's health, I think had been in a very bad way, for some time before he died.</p>
               <p>Court. As a fissure is in a less degree than a fracture, I suppose it may happen by less force than a fracture? - Yes, my Lord, by a fall, for instance, in this case as there was such a violent contusion on the right side, I have no doubt but the fissure must come from the contusion on that side.</p>

            . Was there any thing in your observation, that could determine your opinion, whether it was done by a blunt instrument, or by a fall? - There was no appearance of the skin being cut, no crack at all in the skin externally, a blunt instrument and a fail undoubtedly would have the same effect.</p>
               <p>Suppose the child to have staggered, and fallen against a stone in the wall, it would have been exactly the same, as if he had been hit with a blunt instrument, the concussion produces the fissure? - Undoubtedly my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. You have heard an account of the blow being struck about a month before; suppose a blow had been given on that side of the head a month before, might it by degrees been growing for a month, so as to occasion the death? - It may be from seven to fourteen days before the wound would have the appearance, before the child's death.</p>
               <p>Court. It might be for some considerable time, then I suppose it might be longer? - Undoubtedly it will extend and inflame, according to the state of the child's body, but I should imagine, according to the state of the contusion, this had happened about seven or fourteen days before his death.</p>

            . Might it have happened a month before? - It is very difficult to say, I cannot speak to that with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060008"/> that degree of satisfaction to myself as I could wish.</p>
               <p>Am I to judge it could not? - I do imagine it might be from seven to fourteen, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Jury. I think the surgeon speaks to the child's being in a very bad habit of body? - In a general bad habit of body, his body was very much emaciated, he appeared in a state of poverty.</p>
               <p>Jury. My question is, whether he knew the child any time before the first blow was given? - No, I never saw the child before.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you account for the blood appearing, according to that woman's evidence, the very night before the death? - It is very easy to account for that; after the contusion I should suppose on the side of the head, the extravasated blood became putrid, and by that means the scalp was detached from the bone, and that occasioned the appearance; I believe that is the case of all wounds, by the removal of the scalp, where it is in a state of putrefaction, the blood may come down from that aperture; I should imagine the extravasation was from the vessels on the bone not externally, and then it slipped down and droped into the socket of the eye; the child's eye appeared very large, I attributed that to the extravasated blood.</p>
               <p>Have you met in your own practice many instances of this kind? - A good many.</p>
               <p>How soon after the accident may the symptoms come on? - In general from seven to fourteen days? I have known a fissure to be upon a patient five or six months before ever they have made any appearance, and then afterwards they have had complaints in the head, and when the scalp has been taken off, the fissure has appeared: I only speak in regard of the contusion, not of the fissure, because a very trifling blow will occasion a fissure, without having a contusion that would produce these effects upon the child, a contusion will follow immediately, but will not shew themselves immediately in that putrid state.</p>

            . Did you ever know an instance that a contusion did not immediately follow a blow? - Undoubtedly, but the extravasation is taken up by the absorbent vessels, and the fissure still remains, in all probability the absorbents could not take up the extravasated blood, and then when it slipped it extended itself.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner was very hoarse, and his defence was repeated by an officer of the Court.)</p>
               <p>As to the gentlewoman that sworn first, I was in the country at the same time, at Woolwich, at the time she swore the blow was given; I worked there three days, and I came home, and staid at home for a week; I sent the child out for a six-penny loaf, that was the week following the time I came home, and during that week I was at home, the child came home and told me that a woman had thrown him down, with the loaf in his hand; Sir, at that time he fractured his scull on the right side; he broke his head at that time on the right side; in the course of the week I went and worked three days in Nortonfalgate, and the week after I stopped at home three days longer; on Tuesday night I sent him out for a loaf again.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. How long was that before his death? - About four days before his death; I asked him whether he could go or not, two or three times, and he said yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you doubt then whether he was able to go? - Yes, because he had got very swelled legs; he went out and called at the White Swan public-house, he frequently called at different public houses to beg beer; and so I sent his mother after him, to see if he was coming home, and she could not find him, so she came home without him; and I desired her to go to many other houses besides, and she went to three or four houses, and he had been there and had bread and cheese at these different houses; when he came home he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060009"/> fallen down, and cut the right side of his temple with the fall; his mother was going as far as Drury-Lane, on an errand, and the child was gone to bed; and the left side of the boy's face was terribly swelled in the morning; and the next morning I told her to go to Doctor

            , and get him into the Dispensary; she went, and I went down to Woolwich to work; I worked there till Saturday night, I came home on Saturday night, and saw the boy very bad, and my wife said she had been at the Doctor's; and the Doctor said he would come on Sunday; I stopped there on the Sunday till eight o'clock, and sent to the Doctor's again: that is all I have to say about that; I have something to say in respect to abusing the child; I never struck the child with the poker; when my wife was in the hospital, I used to take a rod and beat him with; and she was in the hospital on the 2d of January, and she came out when she had been in three weeks; I do not know that ever I ill used the boy afterwards; and I suppose his death to be from a cold which slew out of his legs, being a disordered child; he always had a breaking out in his head and ancles. I do not think that these people that have been examined are sit to go upon life and death.</p>

             stands indicted, &amp;c. (Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence, and then added) This is the evidence on both sides; the crime that the prisoner stands charged with is such, as abstracted from murder, which is one of the most heinous offences that can be committed, stands aggravated by being committed by a parent on a child; but when I have said this, I will likewise say, that the more heinous, and the more unnatural the crime is, the stronger ought the evidence to be, and the most convincing, because as it is unnatural, and thank God a thing we seldom hear of, the greater is the presumption against a parent's being capable of committing such an act: and now, Gentlemen, though I dare say you want no instructions, let me advise you not to suffer the nature of the offence to prejudice you against the prisoner; but to consider this case coolly and calmly, as if you were trying a man that stands committed for the murder of an absolute stranger. It does not appear that there were any people in the house, except the man and his wife, and these two lodgers; there is no body appears to you to have been there, or to have done any act towards the child, but the child had been all this time in the power and under the controul of the father and mother: you have then had evidence of his behaviour towards the child; the striking the child with a poker has been proved by that woman; and though the prisoner has denied it, and said that he was in another place at that time, and remained there three days; yet it would seem, if that was true as he asserts, he might have a power of proving it, however he has called no witnesses to that purpose; therefore as to that fact, that woman stands totally uncontradicted; it is true, she says the violence is on the left side of his head; however, she might be mistaken, for there does not appear by the evidence of this Gentleman, who seems to be extremely well-skilled in his profession, that any thing can be attributed to any thing that was done at that time with the poker; he cannot connect the appearance after a month, as arising from that stroke of the poker. Then, Gentlemen you are to consider the general behaviour of this man towards the child; that this child has been treated in a cruel, and I am sorry to say, in an inhuman manner, seems to be proved by every one of the witnesses, and that the prisoner was the man that beat him, although to what degree does not strictly appear, but by every one of the witnesses the child exclaimed, O, dear daddy, daddy! it was his name, and his name only, that the child cried out upon, when he was beating; I am sorry, but my duty calls upon me to make an observation on the evidence of the last witness, who speaks in a very strong manner indeed; she says, the child cried out, O, daddy, daddy, as long as he could cry, and afterwards he would groan; this in the course of at least a month, or more, prior to the death of the child. There is no particular evidence whatever that shews you how this violence was committed; but however, Gentlemen, in point of law, I think it is to be left to your consideration; it is not necessary to prove the exact fact done, where the person who has<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060011"/> received the injury has been totally in the power, and I may say in the possession of the party; that has been proved, and it is certainly incumbent upon the prisoner to shew in some respect how this child came by the mortal wound; he has told you indeed, (but what he has said is to have no more weight with you than as you are satisfied with the truth of it) that the child had a very considerable time before his death received a fracture in his skull, and a cut on the side of the head; sorry I am to say, that if it had, we have never seen the least assistance called for, till the very day before the child died: his own account is, that he doubted whether he could send him out a second time, or whether he was able to go; yet till the Wednesday before he died, t here is no account whatever of any the least assistance being called for; this child, by the account of every body, and all the neighbours, was heard from the opposite side of the way, morning and night continually and repeatedly crying out, and they continually hearing blows, though they did not see them; this is a circumstance that is to be left to you; there is such a thing as the law has called a sort of violent presumption; if a man comes out of a room with a drawn sword bloody, and a man is left dead in that room, nobody saw the stroke, yet the presumption is almost necessary; I do not say it is so strong in this instance, but you see how much it was in the power of the man to have accounted for these acts of violence which the child has received; you hear what is actually proved, that he has done, and the dreadful consequences when the child could cry no more, ending in a groan: if you are satisfied in your minds and consciences from all that has been related by all these people, though the prisoner seems to tell you they ought not to be believed on their oaths in cases of life and death, yet you are to judge how far their testimony deserves credit, and you will give it that credit that you, as Gentlemen, think in point of conscience they ought to have; you must, as I told you before, lay aside all prejudice of every kind that would as it were inflame your passions, and think of this case coolly and indifferently, and then give that verdict which you in point of conscience ought to do: and that must be, if you are fully satisfied that the prisoner has been the death of this child you will find him guilty: if any doubt whatever remains in your minds, I am sure your own humanity will suggest to you, that you would not take away the life of a man if you was not fully justified and convinced in your consciences, that he deserves that punishment.</p>

            , you have been convicted, by a very merciful and attentive Jury, upon evidence which has left but little room for doubt of your being guilty of a crime the most aggravated that can disgrace the character of man. The crime of murder in itself, of wilfully and maliciously depriving a fellow creature of life, is an act from which nature shrinks back with horror, and a crime which the laws of God and of man have thought it necessary to punish in the severest manner; but when we consider that the unhappy object of your crime was your own child, that child too of tender years, living under your immediate protection, and that your guilt is not that of a single violent act, arising from sudden<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060012"/> provocation, or justified by any thing which could have vindicated even a moderate correction, your guilt is of too aggravated a nature to receive any palliation. Your duty to your child was to have brought him up with tenderness and care, to have been the guardian of his infant years, to have moderately corrected him for his faults, and have been indulgent to his failings; to have supplied his wants, protected him from the injury of others, rendered his existence as comfortable as your circumstances would permit, and done every thing in your power to make him a happy and useful member of society. Your conduct has appeared to be directly the reverse of this; Instead of that tenderness, care and indulgence, which we all hope for from our great Creator and Ruler, and which our children have a right to expect from us, the whole of your conduct towards this unhappy child appears to have been a series of the most unexampled barbarity, terminating at length in a violent death, occasioned by the author of his existence. The affection of parents to their children is one of the strongest and most deep-rooted in the human heart; it is wisely planted there by our Creator, to render us the protectors of our children in their infant years, when they are too weak in body, and too inexperienced in mind, to take care of their conduct themselves: these natural affections have been totally effaced from your mind, and in place of them the most unexampled and inhuman cruelty has induced you continually to wreak, from time to time, all your malignant passions upon that infant whom it was your duty to protect. Happy has the unfortunate child been, who has been released from the cruelty of such a parent: miserable and wretched is your case, to have put an end, by a violent death, to that life, which you have before done in all in your power to render wretched!</p>

               <p>Happy will it be for you in the end, if your own blood, together with the deepest remorse and repentance which the heart of man can feel, will be sufficient to relieve you from the load of that guilt which now hangs over your soul, and to procure you that pardon for your enormous and aggravated crimes, from your Creator and Judge hereafter, which the laws of your country must necessarily deny you here. It is therefore my duty to pronounce upon you that dreadful sentence, which your crimes have so justly deserved; which is, that you be taken from hence to the place from whence you came, and from thence to the place of execution, on Monday next; there to be <rs id="t17850406-1-punish5" type="punishmentDescription">

               <p>This day fortnight, I and my shop-mate went to see the balloon go off; I got into a crowd, and they shoved to hard I was glad to get out again, and I got upon a wall that was in Pancrass street, Tottenham-Court-Road; I turned my head, and I saw the prisoner at the bar and and several more; a tall man in a red coat who is at the door now, I saw him several times attempt to rob people of their watches; they served several so; I had no such thoughts, they looked like gentlemen, but several said their watches were gone; this red headed man which is at the door came plump up against the prosecutor; and I understood the prosecutor had lost his watch.</p>
               <p>Court. Describe in what manner they came up against him? - The same as I may come up against another willfully.</p>
               <p>Were they standing in the crowd? - Nobody could hardly stand there, but they certainly were in the crowd; the prosecutor came in and went in amongst them; and I saw this prisoner at the bar and the other that is outside the door come up from towards the fields, the lower part of Pancrass street; there was not any body near them for a foot or two; people might have stood very well if they had only been easy; I could discern so plain, that I saw the prisoner shove against the prosecutor, and other people where there was no occasion for it; I saw his hands round his waist; I did not see him take any thing; I jumped off the wall, and said to the prosecutor, are not you the man that is robbed? and he said yes; I said, come along with me and I will shew you the man that has robbed you, and then a man gave me a punch on the side of the lug; the other man was on the outside of the door when I came up I shewed him the red haired man first, and he was rescued away; then I shewed him this man, and he said, what me! and I said, aye you, directly.</p>
               <p>What time did you shew him the man that had taken the watch? - I shewed him first the red haired man, and then this man.</p>
               <p>Then you did not know at that time which of these men had taken the watch? - I did not, nor I cannot say now.</p>
               <p>You did not tell Mr. Tubb which had taken the watch? - I said, I thought the red haired man had it.</p>
               <p>Was any thing found upon him? - I was not present when he was searched.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow another of the Prisoner's Council. Now, Master Goodman, pray who may you be? - I am a sawyer.</p>
               <p>How long have you been a balloon hunter? - I saw the other, Mr. Lunardi's.</p>
               <p>It is not the temper of an English mob to stand very quiet, they like to hustle, they wave to and fro, do not they, that is the way, is not it? - It is too much the way.</p>
               <p>You was afraid? - I was not much afraid.</p>
               <p>You did not feel yourself much at your ease? - No.</p>
               <p>You was afraid they would take your watch perhaps? - No, I could not, I had no watch.</p>
               <p>Then it was for the fun of the thing that they hustled you? - It was foolish fun too.</p>
               <p>Why this wall was seven or eight feet high? - I was lifted up, they laid hold of my legs.</p>
               <p>That is a sort of a horse, you are more used to, I take it for granted, than a fourlegged one? - No, I took notice of them I suppose for about half an hour.</p>
               <p>I thought so? - You did not think any thing about it before.</p>

Sir, says I, I have not; says the other witness he is one of them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who all gave him a very good character.</p>

            , Esq; sworn.</p>
               <p>I lost my watch on the 26th of February last, about a quarter of an hour or twenty minues after five in the evening, in the passage that leads to the pit, going into Drury-lane Theatre, in that passage which you enter from Russel-Court, and some yards from that particular part of it where the money is received, which is some yards from the pit door.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060025"/>Be so good as to describe what happened to you there? - On the 26th of January last I went to Drury-lane Theatre, in company with another young Gentleman, in order to see Mrs Siddons, the play was Macbeth; we were under the necessity of stopping a few minutes till several persons that were before us had gained admittance; at this time there might be perhaps six, seven, or eight persons who each entered the pit passage, pretty near the same time that we did, or immediately after; I speak of them that were behind us; while we were waiting for those that were before us to gain admittance, I fancied I felt somebody at my breeches pocket, I immediately put my hand to my breeches pocket, and I found my watch was taken; on turning my head, the prisoner at the bar, whom the moment before I lost my watch, I had particularly taken notice of, as standing on the right side of me, rather a little behind me, not immediately in a line, was then standing with his back to me, endeavouring to make his way out through the persons that were collected together; I said nothing, but immediately followed him; as soon as we had cleared the persons who were behind us, excepting one person who stood by himself, and at about the distance of two or three yards from anybody else; I immediately laid hold of him, and said, Sir, you have got my watch; his answer was, have I, Sir, got your watch? I replied that he had; he immediately endeavoured to get away from me, at the same time holding out his hand as with an intention of offering something to that person who was at a very small distance from him, close by him almost at the time, but at the distance of two or three yards from any of the persons who were going into the pit; at this moment I heard something fall to the ground, and the breaking of glass; I immediately put my right hand to the ground, picked up my watch, and put it into my breeches pocket.</p>

               <p>Court. From what part of the ground did you pick up your watch? - Pretty nearly in a line perpendicularly with his body; not quite, but rather perpendicular with his arm, as it appeared to me to be held out; as soon as I had recovered my watch, a scuffle immediately commenced between the prisoner, the person to whom he held out his hand, as if with intention to offer the watch, and myself.</p>
               <p>What part did the other man take? - Barrington endeavoured to get from me, the other man pulled me back from him, the other man assisted Barrington, and took a more active part than Barrington himself; in the scuffle they threw me down to the ground; he was disengaged for a moment, I only tell on my side, and fortunately recovered myself instantaneously and followed him; he had not got above six or seven yards before the alarm was given, and some persons coming up he made no further resistance; I took him immediately to the public Office in Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, Prisoner's Council. I understand, Sir, you are very short sighted? - I have that misfortune.</p>
               <p>There were many people crowding? - There was no great crowd, there might be six, seven, or eight.</p>
               <p>You do not mean to be particular? - I am not.</p>
               <p>Who first told you the watch was there? - I was not told of it.</p>
               <p>No one person then said to you here is a watch, and gave you the watch? - No.</p>
               <p>You did not see it fall? - I did not see it fall, but I am positive it fell from the prisoner at the bar; and my reasons are, because the person who stood at three or four yards distance, whom I never saw before or since; the watch could not fall from him, because he did not leave the crowd at the time I followed the prisoner, and I followed him instantaneously as I found the watch was gone.</p>

               <p>I heard the watch fall to the ground; I was with Mr. Bagshaw, I was next to him when he lost his watch; I observed a little before he missed his watch, a man pushed me very much, I came close to Mr. Bagshaw, and told him I saw a man who was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060026"/> very much in a hurry to get in; the prisoner might be at the distance of three or four yards off.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect his posture at the time he seized him? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Was there anybody besides you that was near to him? - I did not observe anybody.</p>
               <p>What became of the prisoner and Mr. Bagshaw after he had seized him? - Mr. Bagshaw accused the prisoner with having his watch, upon which I heard it fall; they might be removed from the place where he originally seized him before; I heard the watch fall, it fell upon the ground, Mr. Bagshaw picked it up and put it in his breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Can you tell who it fell from? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Did you observe where it fell? - I did not, but I heard the breaking of glass upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Who were near you at the time that the watch fell? - I did not observe anybody near me at the time; I did not take notice.</p>
               <p>Where was Barrington at the time your watch fell? - With Mr. Bagshaw, he had him in his possession, the watch fell nearly under Barrington.</p>
               <p>Was there any other person near enough for it to have fallen from them? - I did not observe any near enough.</p>
               <p>How many yards from the place where you stood when Mr. Bagshaw missed his watch was it that the watch fell? - Three or four yards, I should imagine they had gone back so far.</p>
               <p>Was there no noise or disturbance about the watch before it fell? - There was a scuffle between Mr. Bagshaw and the prisoner, when he accused him of having his watch, he said, have I your watch, upon which I immediately heard the watch fall.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did not this alarm the attention of every body about; there was one person accusing another of taking a watch, did not they flock to see what it was about? - I think there were one or two people who instead of helping Mr. Bagshaw assisted the prisoner.</p>
               <p>What was you about? - I was rather confused.</p>
               <p>Then there might, but you did not observe them? - I do not believe there were any near enough to hear it.</p>
               <p>You know there were several people behind him? - I did not observe anybody at all; Mr. Bagshaw was thrown down somehow or other.</p>
               <p>That was before the watch fell? - No, after.</p>
               <p>Where the watch fell from, or how it fell, you do not know? - I know no more than what I have said.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see the watch upon the ground? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Which way did Mr. Bagshaw stand to pick it up? - I did not see.</p>
               <p>Did you see him stoop to take it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he stoop towards the place where the prisoner stood, or from him? - He stooped forwards, Barrington was close by his side at that time, he had hold of him.</p>
               <p>Did he stoop directly before him, or to the side were Barrington was, or to the other side? - Straight before him.</p>
               <p>How near was anybody to him at the time he stooped, besides Barrington? - I did not observe anybody at that time.</p>

            , you are now to make your defence; what have you to say to this charge? - Prisoner. My Lord, I humbly beg leave that Mr. Bagshaw may be asked one question.</p>
               <p>Court. What is it, Mr. Barrington? - Prisoner. He says that he saw my hand extended as if I was giving something to some person; did he see anything in my hand, or did he see me give anything? - I certainly saw nothing in the hand of the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I should be glad also to ask him whether he saw me give anything, or saw me drop any thing, or whether he had any reason to suppose either by speaking, talking, or confederating, in any other respect according to the idea which he has endeavoured to insinuate to the Court, that I had an accomplice, or that there were any grounds to suppose any such thing?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060027"/>Court. He has given, you observe, the reason for that; which was, that one person who was the nearest, but was at some distance, when you came to struggle, assisted you, and endeavoured to prevent him from taking you; he has given no other reasons for supposing you had accomplices but that; does any other question occur to you that may be material for your defence?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I should be glad Mr. Bagshaw may be asked, whether he recollects any person saying, here is the watch upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Court. He has answered that already; he says, no, that he himself heard the crash of glass, and stooped and picked it up, nobody said so to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bagshaw. I did not hear a syllable of the kind.</p>
               <p>Jury. What position was his hand in when he offered something, was it shut or open? - I cannot particularly answer that question, he had a great coat on, and held it in this kind of manner, at this distance, I cannot particularly say, but I think it seemed to be in this kind of manner, with the palm open downwards, I cannot positively answer that question.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship and you Gentlemen of the Jury.</p>
               <p>With humble submission I entreat your candid attention, and I trust the ears and hearts of all in this Honourable Court will be as open and ready to receive impressions in my favour, as they may be to admit those of a contrary nature. The evening in which this matter is stated to have happened I went to see the play, it was Macbeth, the house was filled early, and hearing it mentioned that there was no more room at that side, I was going to another part of the house, when I was accosted by the prosecutor, who said, Sir, you have got my watch. I told him I had not, and that he should be satisfied of it in any manner he chose. There were several persons present at the time. An altercation took place, during which a by-stander cried out, There is a watch on the ground. This was at some yards distance from him. The prosecutor ran, but whether he stooped himself, or it was given him by a by-stander, I cannot say; but he took it, and declared it to be his. It has been stated, that when he accused me, I extended my hand, as if I was offering something to some person; whether I did or not I cannot take upon me to say; but I trust that it will not be considered as an unnatural position for any person so accused, to extend his arm or hand. Perhaps it will be more reasonable to imagine, that an endeavour would be made to conceal them, if the accusation had been just; and I trust, Gentlemen of the Jury, that it will be worthy your most serious consideration, that while this circumstance is mentioned in order to criminate, the prosecutor has acknowledged, at the same time, that he saw nothing in my hand, saw me drop nothing, or give any thing to any person whatever. It has been stated, that during the altercation he received some violent treatment, and though he has acknowledged it did not proceed from me, yet an endeavour has been made to turn it to my disadvantage. I most humbly beg leave to observe, that in consequence of the alarm a croud came, and hearing such a charge made, and seeing two people disputing, both decently dressed, and much alike in heighth, and not immediately knowing which was the accused person, some, more violent than the rest, might have laid hold of him, as the others did of me, until they were satisfied which was the accuser. This I humbly conceive, and this alone, gave rise to the violence complained of; and though it has been laboured to impress the Court, with an idea that it proceeded from accomplices, yet I humbly hope, that, where there are no solid proofs to establish such an idea, it will not be received; and therefore that in this, as well as in every other circumstance of surmise or conjecture, it will be deemed as just and charitable to suppose for as to suppose against the prisoner; and I trust too, that the justice and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060028"/> humanity of this Honourable Court will not allow that a man, though he may be unfortunate enough to have a blemished character, shall be made responsible for offences which others have committed, or that a surmise or supposition will be suffered to supply the place of clear convincing proofs. Whether those that have appeared on this occasion are of that kind or not, would be presumption in me to say; I humbly hope they are not. But I must beg leave. Gentlemen of the Jury, with all humility, to call your attention for a moment to another subject, which, though it has not, and ought not to have, any connection with the evidence, may, without much care, have weight in deciding my fate. It has been my misfortune to have suffered much from ill-natured report, and from wanton invention, at a time too, when I can truly say, that I had been using my best endeavours to merit commendation instead of reproach; and I thought to have had it in my power to have given convincing proofs of this to the Court, from a gentleman in whose employment I have been for some time, but who is now absent on his affairs in Ireland. Desirous of having his testimony, which I knew must be favourable to me, I thought to have requested of the Court, to defer my till the following sessions; but being told that the absence of witnesses which was character, was not in general deemed sufficiently material to defer a trial, I have omitted troubling them with the application. And although, under these circumstances of imprisonment and an impending trial, yet they have not secured me from the effects of inconsiderate wantonness. Circumstances have been related of me which never happened, and others have been cruelly exaggerated. I do not say this in order to excite your compassion, but to allay inflammation. Gentlemen, prejudice sees through a glass, which makes things appear quite different from what they really are; you best know, Gentlemen, whether, in consequence of any thing of that kind, your minds may have contracted a biass unfavourable to me. If, upon reflection, you think that they have, I am sure you will carefully examine your breasts; and if upon a cool and impartial consideration of the evidence alone, you think or doubt, that it is not of that perfect and substantial nature, which should induce you to find a verdict against any other person, I am sure you will not against me, since you must be fully sensible, that in such a case it would be a conviction from prejudice, and not from evidence. But, Gentlemen, I have an implicit confidence in your goodness; and I trust you will not only lay aside all passion and prejudice yourselves, but that you will be pleased to make a candid allowance for the effects of it in others; and that you will proceed with that cautious and tender regard, which good men feel when the fate of a fellow-creature is depending, and which will insure satisfaction to your minds, when words cannot be recalled, and when the power of prejudice is no more."</p>

             summed up the evidence to the Jury, and then added:</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, this is evidence in its nature circumstantial; the circumstances that go to impute the charge of stealing this watch to the prisoner are, that according to Mr. Bagshaw, he was immediately next behind him, or rather at the moment he felt his watch, standing on his right side; that the prisoner's position was shifted the moment he found his watch gone, and the prisoner was making his way out; that he followed him beyond five or six persons that were nearest behind, and when he got out from them, and there was only one person standing near him, and he at two or three yards distance, after the prisoner had been seen holding out his hand, the watch did fall to the ground from somebody; nearly in a perpendicular line from the prisoner's arm, as it was stre tched out: these are circumstances that are of a nature first of all to render it probable, from the situation that the prisoner stood in at the time it was missed, that he might take the watch, and that render it somewhat more than probable from the situations, that the watch must have fallen from the prisoner, and could have fallen from nobody else; that is the nature<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060029"/> of the evidence, and if the circumstances are sufficient to satisfy you, that the watch could have fallen from nobody but the prisoner, then that is equal undoubtedly to direct proof that the watch did fall from the prisoner: the prisoner has made a defence, which nobody could hear without lamenting, that a man possessed of such talents, should have the misfortune to stand accused of a crime of this nature, or to have a character in any degree blemished, that should prevent such talents from being exerted to his own advantage, and the advantage of the public; for certainly those talents might have placed him in a very different situation indeed, from that in which he stands now, it might have intitled him to the respect and the regard of the public, instead of being a person accused of an offence of this nature: what impression that defence will make is quite another consideration; the ability is one thing, and the application of it, to answer this charge, another thing; the first point was to excuse his retiring after the watch was missed, which as he alledges, was, because he understood the pit was full, there is no evidence one way or the other about that; with respect to the rest of the defence, it goes to contradict the evidence that the watch did fall to the ground; now from Mr. Bagshaw's evidence, the watch did certainly fall to the ground immediately within his hearing, and almost close to him, which is the very point of the case; because if the watch had been found on the ground when they came out, and nobody could say that it had fallen from any body, it would stand quite an uncertain thing how it came there: and there would be nothing to impute to the prisoner respecting it; but if it did fall so as to make it most probable that it did fall from him, after he had been challenged with having the watch, and after he had held out his hand in that manner, which occasioned the observation you have heard, of that you will judge: as to the rest of the defence, it seems to be an application to your humanity; you will undoubtedly feel yourselves disposed to wish, that a man who could make such a speech to you, was innocent of this and every other crime; but with those wishes about you, you will still examine the evidence with a proper attention, and due investigation of the circumstances of this charge; the circumstances against him are, that he was near the prosecutor when the watch was missed, that he shifted his posture in a moment, that he was then retiring from the play-house, where his business was to have gone in, without establishing the fact to you that the pit was full, and after that, at that moment the watch falls from somebody; you will be to say whether these circumstances satisfy you that the watch fell from him, if they do, they certainly amount to a clear and convincing evidence that he is guilty of the fact; if, upon a due consideration of the case, it appears to you that it is not sufficiently authenticated that the watch was in his possession by falling from him, and that the circumstances of the case, though justifying a general suspicion against him, are not sufficient to convince you that he was the person concerned in stealing this watch, then you will acquit him; and if you do acquit him, I hope, that a man possessed of such talents as he is possessed of, and having, as he says, friends which may assist him, and by which those talents may be made of advantage; that he will turn them to that advantage, and will make a good use of them; and that this will be the last time that we shall see him in this place.</p>

               <p>I was coming along the Strand, going into the city; I saw four men about the door, and I informed Mr. Langston, and I desired him to cross the way, and I would go on the other side; as soon as he crossed the way the window smashed; but I did not see that; I helped him to secure the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you saw the prisoner at the window? - No, Sir, I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was examined at the Justice's, he said I was round the window.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Dermer. I found the rings at the door, directly after the alarm; the case was found by a woman stranger, in a line just by; she is not here; it was brought directly.</p>

               <p>Then you only judge from the circumstances that they must have been yours? - Yes; the buckle I can swear to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Langston. I forgot to mention to the Court that the man's hand bled when I brought him into the shop.</p>

               <p>I was going to my aunt's, in the Strand, and that gentleman came up, and there was a bustle, and he said I was one; I said, I will go in with you.</p>
               <p>How came your hand bleeding? - This button broke off my breeches, and there was a pin in it; but there was no cut in my hand, it was a scratch; here is my hand now.</p>
               <p>What way of life have you been in? - I am a shoemaker.</p>
               <p>How old are you? - Twenty three.</p>
               <p>Have you been working lately in your business? - My master died before I was out of my time; I work for myself translating; I have not a witness in the world; I have been a soldier in the Middlesex Militia three years.</p>
               <p>If you had behaved well in that capacity I am sure your officer would have appeared for you? - I did behave well indeed, Captain Taylor is my Captain, in the Westminster Middlesex Militia.</p>

               <p>I was sent to see what was the matter by the prosecutrix; I was setting in the parlour with the prosecutrix, we heard a noise in the adjoining house; I asked for a light and the key of the street door, which she gave me, and I went into the other house, and opened the door with the key, which was double locked; going into the parlour I saw two or three men; as soon as I went in they jumped out of the window; one out of the parlour window, and one out of the closet window, which they had broke open: I left the parlour, and caught the prisoner coming over the garden wall into the street.</p>
               <p>Should you have known he was one of the men that was in the house? - No, my Lord, I cannot swear that he was in the house: I know he is the man that was coming over the wall; I gave him a blow and I cut him in the arm with a knife, he made a great resistance, and we had a very hard struggle, and he tumbled down in the street, I secured him.</p>
               <p>Had he taken away any thing? - No, Sir, I secured him till the watchman came to my assistance, he was sent to the watch-house, and then I went into the house, and found several people in the house; and in the passage I found a closet window broke open; the plate of the shutter had been taken down, a pane of glass had been broke, which lets the hand into the screw; the screw was taken out, and the sash was thrown up, and so they got in; the lock of the closet door was forced open, which communicates to the parlour; we found the lock of the parlour door open, it was opened with an iron crow, I saw the marks after; we examined all the gardens; I said there is a neighbouring garden; and the watchman found the keys in the street and in the garden, and brought them to us, and the canister was found under the window in the garden, where they jumped out.</p>
               <p>Where did the canister stand before they came into the house? - In the closet.</p>

               <p>Was it an empty closet? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What part of the closet? - Close to the window, close to the frame, which I look upon, by jumping out of the window they dragged that with them.</p>

               <p>Had you ever seen Harding before? - Never before in my life.</p>

               <p>When you first saw him on the Wednesday, did you or did you not know the man? - Then he looked like the same man again.</p>

               <p>Then you can tell us one way or the other, whether he is the man or not? - He is in another alteration of dress.</p>

               <p>Have you got the plate here? - Yes, after I went to apprehend the prisoner, and in his house was this crow, and two center bits.</p>

               <p>Is that your master's crest? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any one of the pieces that has got a mark that you know? - I have never observed particularly, they were not used constantly, the candlestick and this spoon particularly.</p>

               <p>Is there any crest upon them? - Yes.</p>

Now this is the time for you to make your defence, you hear you are charged by the two people from Barrahs, with being one of the persons that brought the plate that morning, in company with Steward, and Steward was afterwards found in your house that same day.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was a victualler, a publican some years, I have let my house lately; this Steward about a week or a fortnight before I was apprehended, lodged at my house; about one o'clock this gentleman came to my house; this Steward was out all the night before, and part of Sunday morning, he came and went up to bed; I know nothing of the affair, nor of the Barrahs, and they cannot say with a safe conscience I am the person, but they do not care what they swear, the Court may plainly see that I never was at Barrah's in my life.</p>

               <p>Court to Mr. Garrow. Have you any witnesses for him? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Now had you lived as you ought to have done, you must have witnesses to your character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not think about that, I have witnesses plenty, that know I kept a public house some years, they talked of putting it off, on account of this Steward, the Court may see that I know no more of what is charged against me than a child.</p>
               <p>Court to Morant. What became of that Steward? - He was sent to Tothill-fields, and by some means or other he was let out, or got out, they say he got over a wall by a rope.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts in the house did you find the crow and the other things? - The centre bits were in a closet in the parlour, where I found the prisoner, the crow was in the kitchen in the chimney.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They were not my apartments.</p>
               <p>Where did Steward sleep? - In Harding's bed, where Harding's wife slept, the prisoner's clothes were there, and his shoes, and the prisoner's things were there, it was in the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that room the same parlour where the centre bit was found? - No, in the fore parlour the centre bit was found, where the prisoner and his wife were sitting by the fire.</p>

               <p>It is the property of Coulson and Co. there is a bar of it to be produced, part of the seventeen, and it is marked with white lead; it is a very particular order we had, and had a mark C. upon it, it was marked in my presence.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any notion where it was taken from? - I believe it to be taken from Union stairs, because the lighter was carried on board a ship off Union stairs, on the 27th of February, and on the next Monday morning we found the bars had been taken away; it was iron we had shipped off to go on board at Union stairs.</p>
               <p>Where did the ship lay that the iron was to go on board of? - Off Union stairs.</p>
               <p>And where was the lighter on the 27th in the evening? - It was on board the ship; I found seventeen bars missing, and I was obliged to send seventeen more, and I could not obtain a receipt to my satisfaction, because seventeen bars were wanting, till I sent the other seventeen bars.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Counsel. When did you miss it? - Not till Monday morning the 28th.</p>
               <p>Was the whole of the foreign order put on board that lighter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know the bar of iron from any other circumstance than that letter upon it? - Yes, it appeared to be part of a parcel which had been bought by the company a little while before, and it was pitched or tarred, as it was rather rusty.</p>
               <p>Is not it very usual for iron to be very rusty, and pitched too? - It is not very common, I have seen it once or twice.</p>
               <p>Why can you distinguish one parcel of iron from another by the degree of rust? - No, Sir, but from the marks I will.</p>
               <p>Is not it usual for other merchants and dealers to mark their iron and bars with devices as well as yours? - Yes.</p>
               <p>For ought you know other iron might be marked with the same letter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then the whole alphabet might be marked? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not draw that letter yourself? - No, but I saw it done.</p>
               <p>It is not like a hand writing, it is marked with a brush? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If you saw a C upon another bar of iron similar to that, could you distinguish that from another? - I think I could from the size of the letter, and the mode of making that letter.</p>
               <p>What part of the bar is the letter upon? - Not quite in the middle.</p>
               <p>It might be two or three inches lower or higher for ought you know to the contrary? - It might.</p>

               <p>I found this iron in the boat I was in, which was the ship's boat.</p>
               <p>Court to Franks. Is not it usual for watermen to borrow each others boats, to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060049"/> to take them when they are pressed without permission? - I never did it, I cannot tell what others would do.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness who gave him a very good character.</p>

I took up an old space, and I tried to strike at him, for fear of striking my wife, I struck at his hat, and something fell from his face, and I saw him as plain as I see these gentlemen now, and his eyes looked so monstrous fierce and savage at me, I did not know what to make of it; seeing some more behind me all disguised I turned myself round, and I cried out Harry! Harry! your mistress is murdered and cut to pieces! that is a journeyman of mine, who was at work for me; with that Harry jumped out of the back shop, he had a silver soap ladle in his hand, w hich weighed four ounces in the bowl, and nine ounces throughout, and he struck the man on the head with the ladle, hearing a noise in the street, I looked to the door, and saw it open, and I saw two or three men walk out, and the prisoner was left behind, he walked the length of the passage, and Harry kept hitting him on the head, and he went out of the house, and I saw no more of him; and they brought him back and declared he was the man, and the next morning, though they had even changed his clothes in the Compter, I declared that was the man.</p>
               <p>Did you see him again that night? - Yes, we took him directly, he was not out of sight, only whilst turning round three doors.</p>

               <p>You can tell whether you was an hour or five minutes? - I cannot say it was an hour, nor half an hour.</p>
               <p>Was it five minutes? - My fright was so great at the time, it was out of my power, or any body else in the agony I lay in.</p>

               <p>Does your street door open into your shop immediately? - No, Sir, into a passage, the compter joins with a passage.</p>
               <p>I want you to describe to the Jury, the situation of your shop and your passage, how are they separated from each other? - The street door comes in, and the compter runs down on one side the shop, with shutters up to it, that joins to the parlour partition, none can come into my shop without lifting up the flap of the compter, or breaking through that which was broke.</p>

               <p>Had this first man any thing over his face at that time? - I did not see any thing at all over his face at that time; when I saw that man disguising himself I was frightened, and called out Muffles, thinking of the people as I have heard tell of with things over their faces; then the first man that is now at the bar

               <p>How many did you see in all? - I saw in all the man that was disguising his face, and one or more behind him, I know there were more than one; I stood some space with the candle in my hand, looking full at him, expecting he would tell his business to me, he had a black thing round his neck, his face was uncovered as it may be now.</p>

               <p>I am a waterman, when the out-cry was upon the river, I had been doing some business at Gun Dock; my brother was in the boat, rowing me down to Stone Stairs; I heard a noise on the river, and I said there is some piece of work upon the river, as soon as ever the words were out of my mouth, I heard a pistol go off, and I heard murder cried; I said to Coleman who stood alongside of me, row over towards Execution Dock, and another boat rowed past me, about a quarter of a minute after, with five or six people in it, and it pointed towards Wapping New Stairs; I was going to the place where I heard the pistol fired, and this boat was coming from that place; this boat met me and passed me; I was about two hundred yards from the shore, I did not see the flash.</p>
               <p>Did the sound come from that way? - Yes, there were about five or six people in the boat.</p>
               <p>Was she pulling hard? - Yes, there were two boats besides her, she pulled pretty fast by me.</p>
               <p>Were they sitting down or standing up? - There were three standing up and two rowing.</p>
               <p>Was there any other boat near them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How near to them? - About thirty feet following them; I asked them in the boat whereabouts they were, accordingly they said they were just astern, and the man that was in pursuit of this boat, he says there they go, and we pulled our boat round and went after this boat, and pursued them.</p>
               <p>Court. Then upon the people saying, there they go, you pulled round and went after this boat that you had spoken to? - Yes, I went to jump into the boat, and whether any body knocked me down, or whether I fell, I do not know; there was a lug-boat laying at Mr. Curtis's back door, where the people jumped out of this wherry, this boat stopped on the long-side of the lug-boat, whether it was the same people that jumped out of the lug-boat on shore, I cannot say, but I saw the people that were in the wherry that passed me, jump into the lug-boat, I pursued them, and we took Wood.</p>
               <p>Was Wood one of them or no? - I cannot tell, they were all higgledy piggledy.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the other two? - To speak upon my oath, I think they were not in the boat.</p>
               <p>What makes you think so? - Because the other man that rowed was a tall thin young fellow, I should know them if I was to see them again, I have seen Romain before on the river, I cannot say I recollect the face of Key, I did not know Key before.</p>
               <p>Did you take notice of the people to be able to say that Romain was not there? - Yes, he was taken up upon suspicion, I went there, and said, he was not one.</p>

               <p>On the 19th of March, between seven<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060057"/> and eight, another young fellow was rowing Smith and me, sitting down at the sculls, we heard the report of the pistol going off, he bid me take hold of the scull, and we heard murder cried out.</p>
               <p>Which way did the cry come from? - From towards Ratcliffe Church.</p>
               <p>Was that to the southward of you? - Rather to the southward.</p>
               <p>How did Wapping New Stairs bear then? - We were almost opposite to the stairs, they were right northward, rowing by the craft; we saw a boat with five people in it, they called murder! stop thief! as well as we did; the men rowing said there are the people; we immediately turned round, pursued them, and rowed after them, and Smith went to jump into the boat, and whether he was knocked over board, or fell over board, I cannot tell, but he hung to their boat, I got him in; and the other Smith his brother, the boat was almost near the shore, he ran after and catched hold of one of the men.</p>

               <p>Did you see the men get out of the boat? - I saw three or four get out of the boat, but I saw one in particular.</p>
               <p>Where did they get out? - At Wapping New Stairs, and they ran towards the water side; they got out immediately into a lug boat; some went to the right, and some went right up from the stairs; the boat was left with nobody in it: I saw one of them apprehended, and stopped at the stairs head, that was Wood, I cannot say what became of the rest.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Wood. My Lord, Coleman and Smith sent to us yesterday, to know if they should go to our friends and get some money; this Coleman was taken up for the robbery.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was the man that came to you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. His name was Mich. Conklan.</p>
               <p>Smith My Lord, the man he mentions was taken up for the same robbery, and discharged, I never sent any person, it is a report of his own.</p>

               <p>On Saturday, the 19th of March, between the hours of seven and eight, I heard an alarm on the water, in Wapping, I went to see what was the matter, and I saw some boats rowing to Wapping New-stairs; I saw one of the prisoners at the bar run past me, that was Keys; they cried stop thief to him, I pursued him as fast as I could; I was at the corner of the stairs, at Mr. Curtis's brewhouse, that is fifty yards or more from the stairs, he was going as fast as he could, I dare say; and Mr. Curtis's clerk was pursuing him at the same time; the prisoner was the first man, and there were other people pursuing after him, crying, stop thief; we stopped him; I asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060058"/> him what he ran away for; he said he had done nothing, he knew nothing of it; says he, I ran after the thief; says I, there was nobody before you; he said, he knew nothing of it, and he would not tell where he lived; and I gave him in charge to the constable.</p>

               <p>On the 19th of March I was at Mr. Curtis's compting-house, I am his clerk, I heard a cry of murder and thieves; I thought it was only a parcel of drunken waterman; I was within two roods of the stairs, our brewhouse joins the stairs, and I saw a boat with five men come on shore, and saw the prisoner coming up the alley adjoining to the brewhouse, from the head of the alley to the water-side, I imagine to be between five and six rods.</p>
               <p>How many yards was it? - I do not know, seventeen feet and a half are in a rod.</p>
               <p>Has a person at the bottom of the stairs any way up into Wapping, but coming through that alley? - No, unless he came through our brewhouse; I saw him come out of the alley into the street, and pass me, I told him to stop, he did not stop, but ran past me; it is about as far through the compting-house to the street, as up the alley.</p>
               <p>Had anybody run past you before him? - Nobody, they took down a place called the orchard, I followed, and caught him the corner of New Market-street; I saw Keys come up the alley as soon as I could get out of our compting-house, and out of the brewhouse gates, and the prisoner was then coming out of the alley.</p>

               <p>On Wednesday, the 9th of March, I was standing in Drury lane, talking with an a quaintance, opposite White Hart-yard, between six and seven, and that gentleman came out running.</p>
               <p>Who do you mean by that gentleman? - The prisoner; he came out of Russel-court, and they cried out, stop thief; and the boy he came crying, and said, that man has got my bundle; I suppose there were twenty or thirty people after him; the boy was about twenty or thirty yards behind him; I followed him down White Hart-yard, and caught hold of him in Clare-court.</p>
               <p>What pace did he go? - He ran as hard as he could run; we took him to Mr. Young's, a tobacconist, and brought the boy to him, the boy had a penny in his hand; says the boy, take your penny, and give me my bundle; the prisoner said, he had not his bundle; says he, you have given it to one of the two men that was with you; no, says the boy, you took it from me. The prisoner said, at Sir Sampson Wright's, that the boy said he was going to fetch a penny-worth of butter for his mother; and the boy said, he did not say any such thing, for, he said, his mother lived at No. 20, in Swallow-street.</p>
               <p>Court. His mother? - He called her his mother at that time, but it is his aunt.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The boy was quite in a different story before, at Sir Sampson Wright's, they have had him this month, and been training him up; I am as innocent of it as a child unborn; I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you anybody to speak for you? - I had a person just now in the Bail-dock, and I have sent him for my master.</p>
               <p>What trade are you? - A coach-wheelwright; I work in Swallow-street, where the boy says he lives.</p>
               <p>Then you have nobody here? - Not a soul, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How came you to be running? - I was not running; that is not the gentleman that stopped me.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you examine the farthings with the dies? - No, I did not; round the press were a great quantity of farthings, and in the cutting press was a great quantity of cecil in blanks, here are some of the blanks: in the place was a hat hung up, which the prisoner Cheshire owned; the prisoners were very dirtily dressed, and their hands were very dirty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Brown, Prisoner's Council. Was not this a kind of double house? - It is all under one roof.</p>
               <p>Are they not two distinct habitations? - They communicate with each other, by a door which opens into the garden.</p>
               <p>- BOWYER sworn.</p>
               <p>I went into this house, I remained with the two prisoners, while the rest went into the other house; I was present when Cheshire owned the hat, which was in the place where the press was, he put it on his head: I was told a woman had been at the house, I went to a public house, and there found her, she had these farthings upon her.</p>
               <p>- TRING sworn.</p>
               <p>I searched the prisoner Leach, and in his breeches pocket, I found these two half-pence and farthings.</p>

               <p>I went to this house, there were two presses fixed, one with blanks and cecil, the other with a pair of dies; one was to cut the blanks, the other to give the impression: these farthings were taken out of Leach's pocket, that is all I know about that part of the house.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any body that can tell that these presses had been for a certain time worked.</p>
               <p>Carpmeal. There is no doubt, from the appearance of what lay round the presses, there was a candle hung under the man's hat, and there were droppings of candle grease under the hat; they had the appearance of just coming from dirty work.</p>
               <p>- DAVIS sworn.</p>
               <p>This house at Bayswater belonged to me, I was present there when the officers came, there are two houses which are separate one from the other; the small apartment consisting of six rooms; I let them to one tenant: on the 3d of February, I went into the house and not seeing any body there I went into the back apartment of the two rooms where the hole was dug, and I saw these presses then standing: the day the officers came, I heard thumping and noise, about half past eleven, then they left off: Cheshire had been there ever since before Christmas; Leach and the woman I never saw till the Saturday before they were taken.</p>
               <p>Mr. Franklyn, one of the moniers of the mint, proved the farthings to be counterfeits.</p>
               <p>Court to Cheshire. How came your hat in that hole? - I lent my hat to a man that was in the place, he said, he would bring it again in two minutes; I am a smith.</p>

               <p>Court. How has your business been in general these last three months? - Very dead; I had seven or eight men at a time, I have scarcely enough for two now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did you know Cheshire about Christmas? - I was in Worcestershire then.</p>
               <p>Have you heard where he was in December? - I have not, I do not know.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Cheshire called two witnesses to his character; one of whom said, he heard he was in trouble, on a suspicion of making half-pence.</p>

I found my drawers open and the bed and bed clothes in the front garret, rolled up in the middle of the floor; I came down, and the prisoner was in hold by my friend, I took him in doors and searched him, I found nothing on him: there was great appearance of his having got in at the window; he did not slip into the house, the street door was never open: there is a back door that goes into Saltpetre-bank, I cannot say, whether that was open or shut in the day time.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

Tell me exactly what he said? - He said to me, deliver the basket, that was all; I told him no, I would not part with my basket, it did not belong to me; with that the other prisoner, Ward, struck me down, and the other prisoner ran away with my basket; I screamed out murder! stop thief! I kept crying still the same, and I ran after Connor, and the prisoner Ward followed me, he swore a blasphemous oath, and said, you bitch, I will soon stop you from following him; he catched me by the throat, and attempted to throttle me; I got his hand from my throat, and then he gave me another knock, and knocked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060083"/> me down under a coach wheel, and then he left me; the other man was caught with the linen, and brought to me in five minutes after.</p>
               <p>Did you know these people before? - No.</p>
               <p>What opportunity had you to observe them; - They stopped several minutes, and I looked very hard at them; they stood within a yard of me, they stood close by me; I said nothing more than what I have told you; they stood the space of three minutes.</p>
               <p>What light had you to see them by? - The corner lamp.</p>
               <p>Can you swear you had an opportunity of observing them, so as to know them again? - Yes, I can swear it.</p>
               <p>Are you very sure of them both? - Yes, I am very sure of them both.</p>
               <p>When was Ward taken? - Not till the other was at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>How long after? - It might be the value of ten minutes.</p>

               <p>My brother lives at Lord Foley's, I had been to Seymour Mews, and I heard a woman crying out murder! stop thief! and I went up, and I saw the prisoner Ward in the light colour coat knock this woman down; and the other prisoner was running in the street with a basket of linen in his arms; I caught hold of the flap of his coat, and I fell down, and another young man that is here, came and caught him, and he flung down the basket of linen; and that young man, when he saw he was near being taken, he ran into Mary-le-bon lane, and another young man stopped him.</p>
               <p>Was he never out of your sight after he dropped the basket? - No, he was not, I was within a yard of him all the way he went; the other prisoner, Ward, came up, and said to the man that caught him, what are you going to do to him? and he called him a rascal, and said, why do not you take him to the Justice's, and he struck him; and Ward came up to the watch-house, and he was very busy there, and said, they had no business to use him so, and damned his eyes, and said why did not they carry him there; he stood at the door, saying a good deal to several people, and a man was saying to him, what business have you to busy yourself with it? and I came up and said, this is the man that I saw knock the woman down; so then he was taken.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner Ward's Counsel. At what time did the prisoner Ward come up? - As soon as ever we laid hold of him, it might be ten minutes.</p>
               <p>What did Ward say when he came up? - He damned him, and said he had no business to strike him.</p>

               <p>I am an officer, I remember an out-cry on Monday night, I was in Fleet-street, I am one of the City patrols, between nine and ten, coming down Fleet-street, I saw the prisoner at the bar go up to this young woman, and snatched a gold picture from off her neck, he made two or three pulls at it, and before he got it off, she cried out murder! There was another in company with him, and the same time I ran up and seized the prisoner, he opened his hand, and the prosecutrix took the picture out, and one of them struck her on the breast; as soon as I took the prisoner in custody, the other made his escape, I took the prisoner to the Compter, and desired the young lady to give me her address; she was scarce able to walk at the time, and two gentlemen assisted her; here is the picture, I saw him snatch it.</p>
               <p>(The locket shewn to the prosecutrix and deposed to)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to ask her, whether she is not a common street walker.</p>
               <p>Court. If she was you have no right to rob her.</p>
               <p>Court to Forsyth. Do you know the young woman? - I cannot say I do, I have seen her in the city or Norwich, but I have not seen her for three years.</p>
               <p>Is she a person of character or no? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was going down Fleet-street with a young man, I sell greens and potatoes with a jack-ass, as I was coming home walking down Fleet-street towards the market, this young woman immediately ran after me, she was talking to this gentleman, she immediately ran after me, says she, this is the person that robbed me; and this gentleman took me, I had a person here, but I do not see him now, his name is Badcock, a leather-cutter, the corner of Westmoreland-buildings; when I was in the Compter, a person came and said, that woman had served him so, and the constable had served him with a warrant, that he should not appear.</p>
               <p>Forsyth. His name is Simons, the warrant has been out against him this month, I do not know who he is, I imagine he was the same man that was with this prisoner.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of this woman having served him so? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This man promised to come and appear for me, she swore he

               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Do you know any thing of this? - It is a thing that does not concern me at all, it is a young man that gave this gentleman the warrant, it was some time ago he met this young man, whose name is

               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Did you ever charge that man with medling with your locket? No, my Lord, I never did, he went to Guildhall to speak for the prisoner, and he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>What was he to have said for this young man? - Whatever he thought proper I suppose.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did you ever charge that man with having taken your locket, or attempting to take your locket? - On my oath I never did attempt to charge him with it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a timber merchant, I lost some deals, there are marks on the edges to distinguish the Dram deals from other deals; Dram is a port in Norway; in consequence of an information from Marlow, I went to Chelsea, about the middle of December, they were lost about the latter end of October, I missed them before I went to the prisoner's, and I found such deals that I had not the least doubt they were my property; they were in a shed that the prisoner's wife told me belonged to the prisoner, I applied to the prisoner's house for such deals.</p>
               <p>Court. How many deals did you find? - I did not count them, but there were I suppose ten or a dozen, that was about the number I lost; I am sure there was not more than what I lost, they were two inch yellow deals, called Dram deals; I think they are the same deals from the freshness of the deals in the first place, I am confident they have not been piled; deals that have been piled across each others, contract a mark, they had the Dram mark on the edge, and they were yellow deals, which is another particular circumstance, and not only yellow deals, but of that quality of yellow deals which is very remarkable; there are what we term best deals and last deals, these appear to me to be last deals.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the specified difference between best and last? - The best has more of the heart of the wood, the last are more discoloured with the sap; I knew I had lost some deals, from a circumstance that we always make our observations upon, when a barge has lain at a wharf two or three days, the deals get a different complection, the top deals have a very different complection from those that immediately follow them, and the morning following the night the deals were taken out, there was the appearance of quite a difference in the barge, which shewed there must have been deals upon them the day preceding.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Were those that were missing, taken up from the whole face of the barge, or taken from the top? - Taken from the whole face.</p>
               <p>What was the value of those deals you found at the prisoner's? - I suppose a guinea.</p>
               <p>How much apiece? - I value them at eighteen pence each.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you the importer? - No, we buy of an agent, there are agents employed to sell to the yard keepers.</p>
               <p>What was the prisoner, a carpenter? - No, he cuts up the wood, and these were too good for that; the prisoner keeps a coal shed, and sells fire wood, and keeps a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060088"/> chandler's shop, he is an entire stranger to me, I never saw him till he appeared at Justice Hyde's.</p>
               <p>To a carpenter at his shop, laid into him, what would the worth of these deals be? - At least a guinea, towards two shillings apiece.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You are not the importer then of these deals? - I am not, they are imported from Dram.</p>
               <p>What quantity of deals are imported from Dram, you do not know? - That is impossible to say, without we were to look at the entries at the Custom-house.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is impossible for you to say what quantities come into this kingdom? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Most of your deals, I believe, do come from Norway? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They are not all assigned to you? - O dear! no.</p>
               <p>Upon these deals there was no mark of yours? - No, only the mark of Dram, I cannot tell what quantity of those deals were on the river at that time, those that I lost were on board a barge, I had the care of them, the ship's crew loaded them.</p>
               <p>When did you see the barge with deals upon it first? - Several times, it lay several days, I cannot tell when I first saw it, I remember the circumstance of losing the deals.</p>
               <p>Are those the deals that Gardner was convicted of stealing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Have you them here? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor an end of one? - No; what I saw, I left there, I did not attempt to remove them.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Gardener plead guilty? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. None were produced at Kingston? - No.</p>
               <p>There was a confession of Gardner's? - Yes.</p>

            , and myself, we rowed away with one of the waterman's boats from the Ferry at Chelsea about eleven at night, we rowed down to Mr. Waring's wharf, at Lambeth Marsh, I know it is his, because I have been there since, in company with Mr. Waring, we saw a barge loaded with deals, we went there and handed out eleven deals, we lifted them up to the boat, and rowed away to Mr. Holt's yard; we left them in the yard till next morning, and the next morning I saw the prisoner about seven in the morning in the shed, I asked him if he would have such a thing as some deals, he said, yes, he wanted some, so he asked me what they were apiece, says I, you know as well as I do, says he, here are several that I had for nine pence apiece, so then says I, I must have the same I suppose, so I went up with him to his house, and he looked out nine shillings, six shillings in silver, and three shillings in halfpence, and gave me them for the deals; sometime after this I told this story to Mr. Collinson, and he carried me to Mr. Waring, I went to Mr. Holt's afterwards, and saw some of the same deals that I carried from the wharf there, I am sure they were the same.</p>
               <p>Did any other conversation pass between you and the prisoner about deals? - No, Sir, I had no other conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. These deals were left in the prisoner's yard first, without his knowing any thing about the matter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then he asked you what these deals were worth? - He used to have them very often.</p>
               <p>Did not you live with Mr. Holt? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you work with him? - A little.</p>
               <p>How long? - I believe a week at times.</p>
               <p>How came you to part with him? - Because he had no more work for me to do.</p>
               <p>Did not he discharge you, having objections to something you had done? - No.</p>
               <p>Was not he obliged to take you up with a warrant, and carry you before a Magistrate? - That was afterwards.</p>
               <p>How did that affair end? - I served a warrant upon this gentleman here, Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060089"/> Holt, and he served one on me, and so we settled the matter.</p>
               <p>Who is this Mr. Collinson you have mentioned? - A gentleman that lives at Chelsea.</p>
               <p>How came you to apply to Mr. Collinson? - Because that there day, as Mr. Holt and I had a few words, it was mentioned concerning these deals; Collinson was at the sign of the flask, he is a master tradesman at Chelsea, a vinegar merchant I believe.</p>
               <p>How came you to apply to Mr. Waring? - I went with Mr. Collinson, because I was afraid that there would be some noise about the deals; I had left off thieving with them.</p>
               <p>How many thefts have you been concerned in with them? - I do not know rightly.</p>
               <p>You never was tried? - No.</p>
               <p>You gave evidence did not you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is Collinson to give you? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>Has not he promised you something? - No.</p>
               <p>Did Currie offer you anything? - Never.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with any other gentleman respecting this business? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ever tell Mr. Rose, or Mr. Gardner, or Mr. Faulkner, or Mr. Groves? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell them you should never have thought of this, if you had not been urged to it? - I never said so to either of these gentlemen in my life, nor anything leading towards it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. These persons I believe came to you in the gaol? - Yes.</p>
               <p>One of them is the brother of that Gardner that was convicted? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They were all examined at Kingston were not they? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Now Sir, do you leave your defence to your council, or do you desire to speak your self to the Jury.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my defence to my council and your Lordship.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester objected that the property was not produced.</p>
               <p>Court. Property is never necessary to be produced, it is always convenient by way of ascertaining the property, and means of ascertaining it very often is my producing it in open Court; there is no technical rule that requires the production, the question will be, whether the Jury are satisfied, that these deals were Mr. Wing's property; there is no technical necessity for the production of the property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. My Lord, it is incumben upon the prosecutor always to give the best evidence he can.</p>
               <p>Court. Certainly, but with respect to property, sometimes it is so dirty it cannot be produced.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It happens every day my Lord, for instance, a horse or a cow, they do not bring them into Court.</p>

               <p>Did you take that paper into your hand, or look at it at all? - No, I did not, it would be of no use, I cannot read; and the prisoner told his messmate to put it into his chest, it might be of service to him another time.</p>

               <p>What did you lodge together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had you lodged together? - She only lodged with me that one night; in the course of the night she was up three times; first of all she pretended to be after the pot, and as such I handed it to her, she went to bed again, and in about two or three hours after she pretended to have drank rather too much; I used some vile words, I wanted to know the reason of being out of bed, as such the person got into bed again, I went to sleep; in the morning when I awoke, I found my door open, and my bed-fellow gone; I did not think I was robbed, for I always told Mrs. Webb, where I lodged, that if she was straitened for beds, she might put a decent person into my bed: I got up in the morning as usual, between eight and nine, I went to the pump, as I usually do, and washed myself, I put my hand into my pocket to shift my money as was usual, and it was gone; I went to look for my money, I came to Mrs. Webb, says I, pray what gentleman was that you put into my bed last night; she said he seemed to be a very good kind of a gentleman; still it passed on or half an hour or more; I took my pocket-book out of my pocket, and I had some papers of value to me and none to nobody else, but they were gone; I cannot say which way she went out of the house; but I am informed she got out and left the door open; I am sure I had the money when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Court. Does this woman that keeps your house put women into bed to you? - She did so; I told her she might put any gentleman that was decent.</p>
               <p>This was not a gentleman, you know? That was not under my dissection, I did not know that.</p>
               <p>How was she dressed? - Being in bed, I only passed by her, I took no notice at all of her clothes, I saw it was a person that seemed to be smartly dressed.</p>
               <p>Was it the dress of a woman, or a man? - A man.</p>

               <p>Jury. Did she agree to lay till six? - She asked me whether she could get out at four, I said, I would call her at six; she asked me to shew her my door, and I did; she never knocked at my door.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Monkwell-street, on the 27th of February, my house was broke open, the house was secured in every part of it, the evening of the 26th; I make a practice of examining it myself; I went to bed about eleven, I am always last up, we have a light to the stair-case, and I saw through that window the next morning, that something was the matter; I then went into the kitchen, and my servant told me I had been robbed; in the kitchen we have a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060100"/> closet, which has a sink and cistern in it, I perceived the lead light of that closet was taken out; I then went to the kitchen window and looked through it, and saw a ladder, like a lamp-lighters ladder, was left standing on the dust bin, which reached up to a window; the kitchen is up one pair of stairs, it was a lamp-lighter's ladder, it had not been there before; in looking further out of the kitchen window, I saw upon a little ledge, under the kitchen window, the iron bar laying which the light had been tied to; I then saw we had been robbed of a great quantity of plate, some of the plate stood upon a shelf in this closet, in the kitchen, it was kept for common use; and out of the dining room, a great many articles were lost, and my servant told me there was a bit of candle and a glove left on the dresser in the kitchen; my maid gave me a glove, which, she said, was found in the kitchen the next morning after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Court. Was any of your plate recovered? - None at all.</p>
               <p>How did the suspicion fall on the prisoner? - From the circumstance of the robbery, it appeared that it must be done by some person well acquainted with the house; in the manner of getting into my next door neighbour's yard, as the readiest access to my yard; the prisoner was my apprentice, he served seven years with me, he had been gone from me, and last summer I took him into my house to work for me, he left my service about the 18th of December.</p>
               <p>Court. State more particularly, but confining yourself to what you know of your own knowledge, what led you to suspect the prisoner, and how the prisoner came to be taken up for the robbery? - I suspected him for several reasons, it appeared it must be done by somebody well acquainted with the house, for I had a very sharp dog, and it must be somebody that knew the dog, upon that suspicion I had him taken up.</p>
               <p>Was he searched then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was found upon him? - There was a right-hand glove found upon him in his pocket, which corresponded with the left hand glove that was found in my house; I saw the left hand glove in the kitchen, my maid servant gave it me.</p>
               <p>When did she give it you? - On Sunday.</p>
               <p>Was any thing else found upon him that led to a suspicion? - Nothing else.</p>
               <p>What did he say for himself on his examination? - He denied all knowledge of the matter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. How long after was he apprehended? - On the Tuesday fortnight following.</p>
               <p>In the intermediate space of time, had you caused any body else to be apprehended for this offence? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Do you know a man of the name of Dean? - Yes, he worked journeyman with me at the same time.</p>
               <p>Was Dean never taken up? - Not to my knowledge, I never heard it, nor of his being examined.</p>
               <p>Had you a journeyman of the name of Bird? - Yes, he is not with me now.</p>
               <p>What is become of Bird? - I really do not know, he is out of employ; I discharged him about that time.</p>
               <p>Did not you discharge him from some suspicion of his being concerned in this business? - No.</p>
               <p>Had he any hand in procuring the prisoner to be apprehended? - Oh yes! I told him, and another man, that if they would apprehend him, I would give them five guineas.</p>
               <p>Was you present when the glove was found? - Yes, I was at the office when it was found.</p>

               <p>How long was it before that, that you saw the prisoner? - I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner taking observation of Mr. Wallis's house, I live at No. 9, in Monkwell-street, it was on Friday the 11th of March.</p>
               <p>What did you see him do? - He put his head into the door, and went down to what they call Meeting-house-court, he came from Cripplegate way, and made a full stop at Mr. Wallis's; he looked into the passage, and went up Meeting-house-court; when he was up the court, he got up some steps, and pointed with his hand, over the back part of the vestry part, and smiled to two men that were with him; then when they saw me, they all made believe to make water: in a quarter of an hour he was gone out of sight, I went back immediately, I saw nobody come out, and on the Tuesday following he came in a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060103"/> hackney coach to Mr. Wallis's door, and I went down, and saw that was the same person that I saw; I reckon it to be about five or six o'clock in the evening, he got out of the coach, and went into Mr. Wallis's house, he was then taken up.</p>
               <p>Jury. Pray what time was it, that you saw him go up Meeting-house-court? - Between five and six.</p>

               <p>On the 15th of March last, I was sent for by the prosecutor, to take charge of the prisoner, and I took him up to Bow-street, and I searched him before the Magistrate, and I found in his right hand pocket a leather glove, and a letter which I was ordered to deliver to the Court, there was a pair of gloves, and a single glove, they have been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>(The glove handed to the Court and Jury.)</p>
               <p>Court. Is this glove the same that the maid delivered to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it entirely to my council.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you communicate your suspicions to Bird, amongst other people? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You offered a reward of money, if he apprehended the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it to be paid on p roducing the person of the prisoner? - I paid him the money immediately.</p>
               <p>Had there been any disagreement between Bird and the prisoner? - There might, for what I know.</p>
               <p>Have you any reason to believe that there was, or that there was not? - I did not believe that there was.</p>
               <p>Have you ever heard him speak of the prisoner, in terms of dislike or suspicion, I do not ask what he said, but generally? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>What sort of a man is Bird, as to his general character? - I looked upon him to be an honest sober man.</p>
               <p>What did you part with him for? - I had no suspicion of his dishonesty.</p>
               <p>What family has he? - I believe he is a single man.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who all gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Can you give me any account of this odd glove, that was found in your pocket? - I found that odd glove.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. How could they get to the wall of your yard? - By crossing one yard from the meeting house vestry, which is pretty high, he could get upon the vestry without a ladder.</p>
               <p>Merritt. I was in the closet the night before, there was no glove there the night before, that I am sure of.</p>

               <p>On Saturday the 5th of March, I went to the next house about six, all was safe then, then about a quarter before eight, I heard my own bell ring, and I saw the servant come into the house, I looked out at a neighbour's window, and presently after I saw the prisoner in my parlour, he then made a motion to the maid; there was a candle in the room, I saw him then get out of my parlour window into my yard, my neighbour's window looks into my yard, and the parlour windows look into the yard, and not into the street; I saw the maid take away the candle; he then went into the yard, and wrenched the flap of a cellar<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060104"/> window open, in which was the indigo that he stole; he was in the cellar for near three quarters of an hour, I saw him come out of the cellar afterwards, with a bundle in his hand; he went out of the yard into the parlour again, and went out of the street door; I heard him put the flap down, he stepped in at the parlour window, he was taken that night with the property upon him, he was taken in the street, in St. Mary Axe, immediately after; he had thirty-six pounds weight of indigo, and a bag, and a handkerchief, and his apron, and one thing or another; there is a drawing iron, which I found, and I saw the mark of the drawing iron, it is like a hammer at the end.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. So you went out to give this poor black fellow, an opportunity of coming in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You understood he was coming to commit felony? - No Sir, I did not understand any such thing.</p>
               <p>For what purpose did you understand he was to come? - I understood he was to come to fetch a bundle.</p>
               <p>Was not the bundle your property? - I could not tell, I was told by the maid servant, that it was a bundle, and it would not hurt me, nor any body about me.</p>
               <p>Why did you watch him? - Because I had lost several things.</p>
               <p>Was not the maid directed to let him in if he should come? - She was.</p>
               <p>In order that you might watch him, and that you might see him commit the felony, is that so Master Danvers, may out with it man? - Yes, Sir, so it was.</p>
               <p>So this poor black fellow was to take this bundle, and his master to look on for three quarters of an hour, is that what you mean to state to the Jury? - It is.</p>

               <p>Much to your honour Mr. Danvers! now, Mr. Danvers, how near is this window that you was looking out at? - As near as I am to Mr. Under-Sheriff.</p>
               <p>Did you call out to the man that you saw endangering his life? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you call and desire him to stop? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell him he would be hanged? - No.</p>
               <p>You looked on, is not that you conduct? Yes.</p>
               <p>How long has this Jezebel of yours lived with you? - I suppose she has lived with me six months.</p>
               <p>The man has nothing to do in the house of a night? - No Sir, nothing at all.</p>
               <p>If she had not let him in he could not have come there? - No.</p>
               <p>If she had not taken the light out of the parlour, and left him to his free will, he could not have done it? - Certainly not.</p>
               <p>And all that she did by your direction, before you went out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you went out to leave the coast clear? - I did.</p>
               <p>We may ask after this, whether we live in a Christian land! what are you? - A warehouse-keeper.</p>
               <p>Has this cellar any communication with your dwelling house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How? - You cannot go into the warehouse without you go into the dwelling house, unless it is in the day time; there is a gate in the day time.</p>
               <p>When you are in the dwelling house can you get into the cellar without going out into the yard? - No.</p>
               <p>Does anybody live in the cellar? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Then there is an end of the burglary.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the cellar under the same roof as your house? - Upon my word I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do you give that answer upon your oath? - It is, it is, I believe.</p>
               <p>Do you venture to swear it is? Yes, I think it is.</p>
               <p>Do you swear positively the cellar is under the same roof as the house?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now I intreat your lordship not to let him go out of court till I call witnesses to contradict him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I do not know what you mean by the same roof.</p>
               <p>Court. Why it is very intelligible; explain your difficulty why you do not understand what I mean, when every body,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060105"/> else understands? - I would not willingly my Lord, say any thing that is wrong.</p>
               <p>Court. I cannot tell that, we shall judge of that? - There is a wall runs between part of the house.</p>
               <p>I ask you once more, is your cellar under the same roof as your house? - Upon my word I do not know whether it is or not rightly.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived in the house? - Three years.</p>
               <p>Let me inform you of this, that a witness may commit a perjury in swearing they do not know that which they do and must know, as well as in swearing they do know what they do not, and may be convicted of that? - I do not know what to answer.</p>
               <p>Answer the truth, Sir? - I would wish to answer the truth.</p>
               <p>And the sooner you answer it the more it will be for your credit.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Stand up Mr. Danvers, let us see you, I insist upon it.</p>
               <p>Court. I ask you once more, whether this building in which your cellar is, is or is not under the same roof with your dwelling-house? - I believe it is not, I am not certain, because I do not know; the roof of the warehouses are higher than the roof of the house, they are not all one roof, the roof of one touches the wall of the yard.</p>
               <p>How came you positively to swear it was under the same roof? - Because I thought it was, before I recollected.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. He has said he has lived there three years, has not he lived there twenty years? - I was there with my father many years, but I have had the warehouse three years.</p>

               <p>The first time the prisoner said anything to me, he said, Mrs. Stockwell, do you think fifteen or sixteen shillings will hurt you; no, says I, nor a guinea neither, but what do you mean, then says he, keep a still tongue in your head, I will often put five or six shillings in your hand; he said something to that purpose, keep a still tongue in your head, or be private; he said no more to me till the 4th of March; then I went to the yard, on the 1st of March, and I told this conversation to my master; then the prisoner said to me on the 4th of March, where is your master? I told him in the warehouse; and he said he had a parcel down there, that he wanted to take away, and could not get it away; he said he would take it away in a minute; I desired him not to take it away then, as I expected my master in; I said James do not take it away, he said the people over the way could see him; the pot-boy came in, and ended all disputes; but I should have told you, he said he would give me half a guinea, if I would let him in as the morrow night, the 5th of March; he was not a yearly servant; he said, when all the family were gone to Bethnal-green, he would be sure to come, about eight; on the 5th of March he came to light a candle, and he said I will give you half a guinea, do you think they will be safe; most likely they will, says I, James; he put his hand into his pocket, and offered me the money, that was about the time the candles were lighted up, near to seven, he said about eight they would be safe; I told my master this: he held up his singer, and said, my dear, you do not deceive me, do you? I said no, James; he said, is he in the house? I said no; says he, I am affraid of nothing but these windows, and I went and held up the candle, and my master, and other witnesses saw him in the parlour; says he, go up stairs and stay till you hear the door bang, then come down and chain the door; he was in the yard near an hour, then he came up and called Nanny; I heard something drop, I took a bit of indigo, I picked it up and gave it to him, and he dropped it again, and I took it up again? I told my master of this, and he gave me orders to let him in.</p>
               <p>Did you or your master go down to the cellar to see what this bundle was? - I told my master, and he said it was impossible to find it, there were so many things.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060106"/>Mr. Garrow. So you gave this poor fellow reason to believe that you had no objection to his taking anything belonging to your master? - No I did not, I told him the family would be all out.</p>
               <p>Then when the poor fellow was just in and said now my dear, do not deceive me, you then coaxed him in? - No I did not.</p>
               <p>But you told him no James, and that I should think from a pretty white woman would operate as coaxing, to a black man? - I should think not.</p>
               <p>What was the prisoner to do? - Whatever he pleased.</p>
               <p>What did you think he was to do; - I thought he came upon dishonest terms.</p>
               <p>Then your master knew this? - He said it would not hurt my master, or anybody else.</p>
               <p>Did you suppose it was something of the poor fellow's own, or something of his master's? - I did not know what it was, there is other peoples property in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Did you suppose it was something intrusted to your master's care? - I did.</p>
               <p>So you represented to your master? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And your master's directions were to let him in, and he would watch him? - Yes, I held the candle up that he might see him, I did not see what he did, I went up stairs as he bid me.</p>
               <p>Is your master a single man? - No, Sir, he is father of many children.</p>
               <p>Court. The yard lays between your master's house and the cellar? - The warehouse joins to the cellar, there is a wall that parts the dwelling house.</p>
               <p>Is there any room from the dwelling house to the warehouse? - None that I know of the way into it is another way.</p>

               <p>I live in St. Mary-Axe, the next door but one, our windows look into the prosecutor's yard; on the 5th of March the prisoner came down the yard; he was so much loaded he was obliged to left his bundle on the fill of the window.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I have a few observations to offer, by when I trust to convince your Lordship that there has been no felony committed by this prisoner: as to the burglary; your Lordship has delivered me from that, and the crime must be therefore that of larceny. The books lay down this principle, that it must be a fraudulent or felonious taking and carrying away by any person of the goods of another; when they say that there shall be a fraudulent or felonious taking, it is to be observed, that all felony includes a trespass: if the party be guilty of no trespass in taking the goods, he cannot be guilty of a felony in carrying them away I take the liberty in order to apply the law to this case, shortly to state the law: this man does not against the will of the proprietor break into the premises, he does not commit any trespass whatever; but by the express direction and permission, and by the planning of the prosecutor,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060107"/> he has compleat dominion of the goods. I am disposed in this part of the case, to admit, without risk, that the Jury must find that he carried away the indigo; but, if I have laid down the principle of the law right, the felony cannot have been committed? has there been a trespass? how has that trespass been committed? this prosecutor planning in this manner with this woman, has acted a very strange part, to say no more of it: they watch him, they do not apprise him, they do not tell him he shall be hanged, but they suffer him to compleat the offence by carrying away the goods. There is a case, namely, that of Macdaniel and others, argued upon a special verdict by all the Judges, which is precisely this case: that Salmon one of the parties to the confederacy, went out upon the Deptford road, and it was contrived by these parties that Salmon should be robbed by one of the parties for the reward: Salmon was robbed by one of the parties the question was this, whether there could be a felony in taking from the person of Salmon his property, because it was manifest that it could not be against the will of Salmon that it was taken away, because he (though not as between him and the robber, but as between him and others) had previously agreed that he should be robbed of his property: the Judges held, and they held wisely, and they held soundly, that no felony could be committed against the property of a man in such circumstances, because it is ridiculous to common sense, to say that any thing is taken in violence: Now what in God's name, and the name of common sense, doth this differ from Mr. Danvers's case? I may take Mrs. Stockwell into the confederacy; for what purpose was this? not for the purpose of the reward to be sure, but for some other purpose these two parties have planned, that in a particular way, and by a particular mode, this man should be let into the possession of the property of Mr. Danvers, and he carries away: Can you say that there was a felonious taking against the will of the proprietor, he not only assenting to it, but ordering the man to be let in? as to the prisoner Salmon, there was a question there, whether he himself might not be guilty of the taking his own goods, and they were of opinion that that prisoner could not be guilty of that indictment, and on the other hand, if he did part with his money and goods in consequence of that agreement, it cannot be said that in legal construction he was robbed at all, since it is of the essence of a robbery and larceny; that the goods should be taken against the will of the owner: now my Lord, only permit me to conclude with saying, is your Lordship founded in this case to say, that the goods were taken against the will of the owner, Mr. Danvers?</p>

            . The prisoner did not inform you what it was he was to take away? - No, he did not, he said, it was something that would not hurt my master or any body else, that he wanted to take it away, and he had had it along while.</p>
               <p>You told your master exactly the conversation? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How did he get into the cellar? - I do not know, there was a piece of the flap broke off.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There was this drawing iron, the flap was fastened by two bolts, I believe one of the men fastened it when I stood by.</p>
               <p>Did you direct it to be any way differently fastened from what it was? - No, Sir, I did not know till then, that he could get in there, he put this iron in between the kirb and the flap, and so pushed it into the cellar, it was laid on the floor.</p>
               <p>When you heard that this man was to come for a bundle, why did not you look in the cellar to see if there was a bundle? - I did look in several of the warehouses, but I saw no bundle, but the warehouses are so large: I thought he might have secreted it in some hiding hole under the stairs, she did not tell me where the bundle was, I did not know it was down in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Garrow. I have looked at the case you mentioned: I shall in this case<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060108"/> leave it to the Jury, whether upon the evidence they are of opinion that this indigo was taken by the will of Mr. Danvers or not, directing them if they think it was by his will to acquit the prisoner: because it does not appear that Mr. Danvers had any distinct knowledge, what sort of fact was to be committed, but he waited to see the event what he should take; therefore, I think it remains in that degree of uncertainty; I think it is fit it should go to the Jury.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I am very willing the case should be left to any Jury, I have a great number of witnesses to this poor fellow's character.</p>

               <p>I was going up Fleet street, on the 1st of April, and I saw the prisoner doing something at Mr. Fielder's window, and he had got part of the ribbon out of the window, wound round his hand, the other part was in the window; he directly ran off as hard as he could, and the rest of it followed him through the window, I suppose as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060111"/> much as five or six yards; I said to him where are you going with the ribbon, says he, God bless me, master, a boy gave me the ribbon, you may have it, I do not want it; I took him back to the shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. Describe how this hole was? - There is a hole in the frame of the window, through which a screw goes every evening, and the ribbon was put against this hole, and there was some paper in every hole, to prevent any thing going through; the paper was pushed out, and the ribbons drawn through the hole.</p>
               <p>Is it your usual practice to put paper to prevent any thing being drawn through? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know if it was so filled that night, did you see it so filled? - I will not pretend to say for that night, but I in general put in the paper myself.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

               <p>I took charge of the prisoner, I saw him in the counter.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any body that saw him at large? - None here.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that was the man that was delivered to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>(The record of his former conviction read and examined by the Court.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I cannot disown the charge of being guilty, the reason of my making my escape, was the ill treatment I received after my first escape.</p>
               <p>Court. What ill usuage did you receive? - I was run over across my loins, I am lame, I was always struck without a cause, when I tried to do the utmost of my endeavour, and I hope the merciful Jury will take it into consideration, and send me to any other place: the allowance is but two pints of barley water, from three in the morning, till six in the afternoon, and there is half a brown loaf, and half an ox cheek for six hearty young men, and the ballast that I heaved up, weighs a ton weight, and is fit for a horse to do, and I am entirely a cripple now, and an object; I have twenty people to prove that there are a pair of irons for me to wear, and nobody else, and the expression came from Mr. Marshall's maid, that I should not live a month when I returned; if I had money I could send for the people.</p>
               <p>Court. If you had any complaint to make for being ill treated, there is a regular course for you to take, it is no excuse for escaping.</p>

               <p>Where was his hand? - His hand was very near to me, very near my fob, he had got my watch out; I immediately seized him by the collar, I gave the alarm of pick, pocket and thief; then the prisoner said, he is going to rob me, he is going to rob me, or something of that sort; and two or three people got between me and the prisoner, to wrench my hand away from his collar; I was struck upon the face and bit upon the left shoulder by somebody, I cannot say who; the mark was there for a fortnight afterwards; at that interval I lost my hat, and likewise my pocket handkerchief; I secured the prisoner, I never loosed him till he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you see enough of the chain and seals to be sure it was your watch? - I am sure of it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What are you? - I am clerk of the first fruits office; this is an indenture of apprenticeship; it was presented at the office, either by Mrs. Jones, or Mr. Palmer; they came together sometime the last day of June, or the beginning of July, I cannot tell the time of the day.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060115"/>Did you see them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did they apply to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was their business? - To present these indentures, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Did they present these indentures? - They did, I know nothing further, this is at the back of the indenture as I received it, I do not know whether they received the money.</p>
               <p>Do not you know who received it? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Do not you know what was done in consequence of that? - I do not know, I only know that they presented it; after they are paid. Mr. Bacon takes them and gives a draft on his banker.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether that was done in this case? - It certainly was done but I cannot say to whom.</p>

               <p>Do they leave it without the money? - Sometimes they do, and sometimes they do not.</p>
               <p>Court. Did they come together always? - They generally did, they came two or three times, I cannot say the day they came.</p>
               <p>Look at that draft, perhaps you can tell whether that draft was given, when that was brought? - No, I cannot, it is Mr. Bacon's hand writing.</p>
               <p>Court. What was their business at the office? - Mrs. Jones came first alone with a petition, she represented her case to Mr. Bacon in my hearing, to obtain one of the stewards signatures, for a certain sum of money for an apprentice, Mr. Bacon immediately from the recommendation of Dr. Hand, whose signature is on the petition, recommended her to Admiral Hood; I believe he wrote a note to the Admiral, for the purpose of obtaining the petition.</p>
               <p>Did she represent that she wanted it for a child of her own or any other child? - For a child of her own.</p>
               <p>How soon afterwards did you see Palmer? - He did not come till after the petition was signed, I believe they came together, and got a blank indenture.</p>
               <p>How long was it before they presented the indenture in the state it now is? - It was but a very little time, they have been together two or three times; I believe in consequence of Mr. Bacon's recommendation, there was a petition signed by Admiral Hood, but I cannot speak to his hand writing; the petition had the name of Admiral Hood to it.</p>
               <p>What was Mr. Bacon at that time? - He was Sub-treasurer to the Lord Mayor, Alderman Newnham, he is always secretary; these are the papers.</p>
               <p>Mr. SHEPHERD sworn.</p>
               <p>Is this Admiral Hood's hand writing? - It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Put in the indenture.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. No, not the indenture, as this is laid in the indictment to be a forged indenture, I submit to your Lordship, that they have no right to produce this indenture as evidence, till they have proved it to be a forged indenture.</p>
               <p>Court. They have intitled themselves to read it, as soon as they have proved that it was produced by the prisoners; as an act from the prisoners, it certainly is to be read in evidence against them, if it does not come out as one of the circumstances of the charge, it will go for nothing.</p>
               <p>(The indenture read and examined by the Court.)</p>
               <p>(Dated 23d of June, 1783.)</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. What do you know of this sum of money, which was to be received under this indenture which you witnessed? - I know nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>What connection had that story with this transaction? - None at all, only that I thought you asked me about Mr. Rowland's money.</p>

               <p>Then you of your own knowledge do not know, whether any thing was received upon that indenture or not? - No, Sir, indeed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. You are now talking of business that you suppose passed in 1783? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You say you suppose you signed this indenture about August or September? - I suppose so.</p>
               <p>The only reason you have to suppose that you signed this indenture or any indenture at this time, was that you see the date, now you have no other recollection of it? - No, only it must be at that time, I was at the house of the prisoner for two or three months.</p>
               <p>Did not you know a Mr. Morgan at that time? - No, not by the name of Morgan.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Palmer. What, not Mr. Morgan of Wales, a lusty man, recollect yourself? - O yes! there was a Mr. Morgan that used to come there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Where did you witness that indenture? - In your office.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - I think so.</p>
               <p>Think so! but are you sure of it? - Sure, no, I would not say, but to the best of my knowledge I witnessed it there.</p>
               <p>Court. What way of life have you been in? - I was a Captain in the Montgomery militia.</p>
               <p>What was you bred to? - To the law.</p>
               <p>Did you practise? - No, Sir, I only happened to be two or three years, I did not know enough of it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I went there occasionally in the counting-house, and he was behind the counter, he never saw me write, he has seen my writing in books.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles to Shrigley. You have heard the names of those gentlemen that are mentioned, as stewards of the feast of the Sons of the Clergy? - I have.</p>
               <p>Is any part of this money, part of their own fortune? - No.</p>
               <p>This money then I understand to be raised by voluntary contributions? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Under what circumstances are the officers authorised to distribute that money? - There is a secretary appointed, Mr. Bacon is the secretary, he divides the whole sum equally among the stewards, each steward has his portion, and I believe it is well known they have a right to give to whom they please, I always understood that it is a sufficient sanction for the payment of the money.</p>
               <p>You do not conceive that any of these gentlemen, who have a share of the sum collected, have a right to apply it to their own personal necessities or pleasures? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. My Lord, I conceive, admitting every fact on this case, that this amounts to no more than a fraud, and that it cannot reach that accumulation of guilt which we call forgery: to support this objection, my reasons are these: that the legislature has from time to time, found it necessary to guard the property of men from those tricks they cannot very well in common prudence foresee; but I believe from the language, that the legislature he shewn in the preamble to those acts, which they have given us as the rules of our conduct, it will always be understood, that this fraud is to be committed on some person in his own personal individual property, and not to be extended to that fraud which should induce him to part with the money of others; for which he was not in point of law to account: great is the difference to society, whether a charity is barely misapplied, or whether a person in possession of an ample fortune is to be totally deprived of that in an instant, by the wicked artifices of any man whatever: the extreme caution that government has taken to prevent frauds of this kind, certainly arises from the great facility with which these things are done, and the very ample mischief which they occasion; but surely my Lord, the mere misapplication of a charity is not that mischief; the very first statue of the 5th of Elizabeth, Chap. 14th which made the forging of a deed, upon second conviction, a capital offence, in the preamble, says,</p>
               <p>"it is to the great injury, wrong, hurt, disherison, and utter damage;" So that unless some statute is produced to me, that makes the legislature alter its language, I have a right to say that these prisoners are not the guilty persons, against whom the law meant to wreak its vengeance: another statute was made, which is the 2d of

             the Second, Chap 25. and there the preamble says, that</p>
               <p>"this evil ought to be checked by further punishment (namely, by making forgery capital in the first instance) because it conveys such infinite prejudice to trade and credit;" surely these are not words sufficiently explicit in an act by which men are to square their conduct; suresly the legislature did did not mean to hold out death, as the penalty of getting by trick, that money which was intended to be given to more worthy objects.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060119"/>Mr. Fielding. The legislature has guarded the property of corporations.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. My Lord, I think upon these grounds, and the observation of my learned friend, that the legislature has guarded the property of corporations, that if they chuse so to shelter themselves against such kind of frauds from all people, they may by applying to the legislature, receive that additional security, which if they are aggrieved, will make the punishment to be the lives of the offenders: but, certainly where these persons are not answerable over to those who have given them the money, as is the case here, no ruin, no prejudice can possibly accrue to them: for those reasons added to this, that it has been the interest of the wisest of all constitutions, and ought to be the interest of every one, that those acts of their's, which are to affect the lives and liberties of their subjects, should be as plain as possible; therefore, surely, this will not be extended to those who might have received further security, this will not be extended to those who have neglected receiving that further security, and are not in their own persons any ways damaged or prejudiced.</p>
               <p>Court. The objection has been very ingeniously put, but I do not think it proper to give so much countenance to it, as to call on the other side to answer it. God forbid that funds for public charities should not have the same security that every man's private purse has; they are the absolute owners of this money, it is their property, it is put into their hands upon a trust, as between the subscribers and them, and the subscribers might call upon them if they were to sink the money in their pockets, if it were possible they could act so mean a part; but, as against all the world except the subscribers, it is unquestionably their money, and there is no difference between this case and the case of a corporation, but that where there is a corporation, the money then becomes, the money of that corporation; where there is no corporation, it is the property of those individuals, which, if it had been incorporated would have composed that corporation: the statutes that have been quoted, recites the mischiefs that have arisen in some cases to their disherison, and that it has a tendency to prejudice trade and credit; but that was never meant to confine the operation of the offence to case where judgment of actual disherison was the consequence; or that it should be absolutely necessary, that it should be a case where trade is affected, or where general credit is affected; enough to satisfy the preamble is the definition of forgery; that is the thing we are to go by; and that is the false making an instrument which purports upon the face of it to be good and valid, for the purposes for which it was created, with a design to defraud any person; for it is not possible in this case, but there was a design to defraud these trustees, the individual trustee, the sub-treasurer, who if he paid it, would be answerable; this signature of

            , would be no sanction to Mr. Bacon to pay this money on a false deed; I am clearly certain in point of law he would be answerable: this is therefore plainly a case, in which this forgery has been made to defraud every person that are parties in the transaction, and I conclude as I began, God forbid, that the immense funds that are raised in such a country as this for public charities, should not in the hands of those that have the care of then, receive the same protection that the private purse of every individual has!</p>

               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you, gentlemen of the Jury, the indenture in question came to me signed with the name of Bulkeley; previous to that indenture being signed, I had seen the petition signed by very respectable characters, unquestionable characters; I could have no doubt that there was any thing amiss in the indenture, nor is it yet proved I presume, because that there was a man of the name of Bulkeley I well knew; I knew a gentleman of that name that came frequently to visit Mrs. Jones; I understood from him that he was to take her son apprentice; I remarked one day, that after the name Bulkeley was signed, that the indenture lacked the necessary appendages of witnesses; accordingly Mr. Lloyd one of the subscribing witnesses who knew the signature (as he said) being there, I did ask him to sign it; it is very usual, I appeal to the Jury, for bills to come frequently from the country without necessary indorsements; any indifferent clerk or other person may put an indorsement on that bill, yet though it is an absolute forgery, it is not with intent to defraud; and I did not think myself any ways culpable or criminal in asking a person to sign an indenture, who had acknowledged that he well knew the name of Buckley. As to having uttered the indenture, I deny that; I never did, and I am pretty positive that Mrs. Jones never did: I wish to ask Mr. Shrigley, whether at the distance of two years back he can identify my person, or that of Mrs. Jones's; or what particularly struck him that he should recollect our persons after two years.</p>

               <p>Court to Shrigley. The prisoners desire to know what reason you have to take notice of them? - There was a leading circumstance that led me to it, and which in fact led me to a discovery of the forgery: upon a subsequent forgery in the name of Rowland, there was a great deal of stir, and in seeking about it we found that Mr. Palmer was a principal mediator, and I recollected him to be the same man that came on that business.</p>

Do you withdraw yourself entirely from all concern with it; or was you yourself imposed on? - I say, I was myself imposed on; I will appeal to the gentlemen of the Jury, whether any of the gentlemen would not have done the same as I did: I did not utter that indenture.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you shew by witnesses in what manner, and by what way, that indenture was brought to you? - What I did was merely out of friendship and humanity to Mrs. Jones; at her desire I did assist her in going to Mr. Bacon's office, Mr. Bacon did send it back to Mr. Hood; it was recommended by Dr. Hand, of Cripplegate, and signed by the two church-wardens: I do acknowledge that I did fill up the indenture; and likewise, that I saw it with the name of Bulkeley to it, at Vauxhall; that was where Mr. Lloyd witnessed it.</p>
               <p>Court. You bring yourself a good way into it by acknowledging so much; do you give the Jury any account of who that Bulkeley was? - I only knew Mr. Bulkeley as I did Mr. Lloyd, though Mrs. Jones.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. My Lord, Mr. Palmer kept an office of Universal intelligence, and in procuring of servants, which was within that line.</p>

               <p>I was a servant with Mr. Palmer in 1780, at No. 5, White's-row, Vauxhall; there was a gentleman that often came there, and Mr. Palmer and Mrs. Jones called him Mr. Buckley, he often came there with handkerchiefs and pieces of waistcoats: there was a boy that had red hair, and I often heard Mrs. Jones say, she was going to bind him apprentice to this Mr. Buckley, that was her son. I did not know where this Mr. Buckley lived.</p>

               <p>Continuation of the Trial of J. H. Palmer and M. Jones.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any transactions between Mr. Buckley and any person at Mr. Palmer's house? - I know Mrs. Jones and Mr. Palmer were talking of putting their son apprentice, and I saw a young lad with red hair.</p>
               <p>What business was Palmer? - He lived in Broad-street, and kept an office; he then lived there retired from business, for the benefit of his creditors.</p>
               <p>What kind of office was this? - It was an office for all intelligence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. I suppose there were a great many people always at this office? - A great many.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you live with him at the office? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Where was this office? - In Broad-street he kept an office, and afterwards he went to live at White's-Row, Vauxhall.</p>
               <p>Of what did his family consist? - Only Mrs. Jones, himself, and a servant.</p>
               <p>Court. What did his family consist of in town? - Only me and himself; I lived as his servant in Broad-street.</p>
               <p>What was become of Mrs. Jones then? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>How long had he lived in White's-row? - About five or six months.</p>
               <p>He left the office for debt, and lived in White's-row about six months? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Palmer. Please to ask her whether she saw Mr. Buckley sign the Indenture? - I remember him coming there many times, but I do not remember him signing any paper.</p>
               <p>Court to 
               <persName id="t17850406-84-person938">

            . Now what have you to say for yourself? - I know no more but there was a man of the name of Buckley.</p>
               <p>Court. But you know you have taken upon yourself to produce an indenture, by which your son was bound to a man of the name of Bulkley, living at Poole, in Montgomeryshire? - He certainly was there at that time when he was bound.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. My Lord, I submit on the part of Mrs. Jones, that no witness through this whole evidence affects her, as having any concern with this instrument.</p>
               <p>Court. She uttered it, whether she knew it is another thing.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Jones. I understand this application for the apprentice fee was for your own son; you ought to have known<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060123"/> whether you had bound him apprentice to anybody, and whom? - I did not know he was obliged to reside constantly in Poole.</p>
               <p>Can you prove that the transaction was a real one, that there was a master for your son, and that your son was really intended to be bound apprentice, and that this is not all a fiction? - The woman has proved that there was such a man.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any witnesses for her? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>The Jury withdrew for a short time, and returned with a verdict.</p>

               <p>Did you ever see that person before? - No, I saw him standing there, I took no notice, I went on, he followed me.</p>
               <p>Did he offer you any money for your bundle? - No.</p>
               <p>Had not you a long conversation with him? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he ever offer you any money? - No, no conversation of that sort.</p>
               <p>A. Temple-bar you say you was stopped? - Sir, he met me by the pastry-cook's at Temple-bar, it was between seven and eight, at the pastry-cook's I viewed his face.</p>
               <p>Are you short-sighted? - I can see very clear, Sir, thank God.</p>
               <p>What conversation have you had with Sir Sampson's men? - None.</p>
               <p>Why did not you call out? - I did, as soon as I could; and the people went over, I did not call out at first, because I could not, and after they left me, I could not catch them.</p>
               <p>Were not their hands hollow over your mouth? - No, their hands were close to my mouth: I am sure it is the man, because he stopped me at the pastry-cook's so long a time, I viewed him there.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner desire the magistrate might have him examined in a different coat? - No, I did not hear him say such a thing.</p>
               <p>Was you asked before the Magistrate what coat he had on? - No.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner desire the Magistrate to ask you that? - Yes, but I said I would not swear to his clothes, only to his face; no money was offered of held out to me.</p>

               <p>I sent a parcel by the lad of thread and tapes. This is a memorandum of the several things, I set them down last Saturday, I took this memorandum from the invoice, I am very sure that all the things I put in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060124"/> there were in that parcel, they are the things mentioned in the indictment; I sent him about seven, it was near nine when he came home, he brought a man with him, I do not know the man, but he seeing the boy in great confusion, came to tell that he was robbed; the boy was very much frightened for fear his master should be angry.</p>
               <p>Had the boy ever lost any thing before? - No.</p>
               <p>How came he to be so much frightened? - I should think it was natural, he said he was followed by a man from Fleet Market, and robbed under Temple-bar; the prisoner was taken up about five weeks after, at the White Horse alehouse, the things were never got again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. How long have you known that boy? - Not quite three months.</p>
               <p>Was it his custom to loiter on the way, when he was sent of an errand? - Not to my knowledge, I never went with him.</p>
               <p>Would you trust him with a sum of money? - Yes.</p>

               <p>She did not send him any money in consequence? - No, he said, his master was not in the house at the time the man brought the plate there, he said, his mistress brought the bag upon the stairs and gave it to him, and he put it into a hole.</p>
               <p>I suppose you do not know what a plant is? - No, I have not seen the boy since.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the boy told you how this happened? - Yes, he told me his mistress<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060129"/> brought the bag on the stairs, and gave it to him, and he put it in the hole.</p>
               <p>Who did you first tell this conversation to? - To Mrs. Barrah, I went and told her.</p>

               <p>I brought the prisoner to the last witness on the 23d of March, as I was crossing through one of the rooms, where we lay down the teas for inspection among the brokers, I saw the prisoner take the tea out of a chest, and put it into his pocket in a small bag, he told me he was going to get some nails; his business was to go and fetch the nails and return without going up one of the allies where these chests were laid open for shew; I immediately told him he had been doing that which was very wrong, and insisted upon seeing what he had in his pocket, I found it was tea, and I took him down to Mr. Stockdale; I never heard the prisoner was guilty of any thing of the kind before; he has been in the warehouse about seven or eight months; I am credibly informed he is subject to fits, but my business lays in another part of the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What reward do the company give for the detection of these sort of pilferers? - I do not know, I never received any.</p>
               <p>Do not they give a guinea? - It is so stuck up on the stair-case.</p>
               <p>How long have you been in the warehouse? - Upwards of six years.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing remarkable that made you leave the keys? - No.</p>
               <p>You was a tobacco merchant? - No, Sir, I dealt in it in the retail way, I never hawked it about, I have a hundred customers now that deal with me.</p>

               <p>I do not know any thing about the bag, or putting tea into it, or whether he took it from me I cannot say, I was in a fit just at the time, and after that I cannot pretend to say that I remember five minutes that are past.</p>

               <p>Did the warehouse-keeper say any thing to him? - No farther than he turned the bag out, and he asked him if it was a bag for the purpose; and the prisoner told him no, it was a bag that he brought his bread and cheese in.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did there appear to be any crumbs in the bag, as if bread and cheese had been in it? - I did not observe.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the warehouse-keeper ask him how he came to take the tea? - He asked him what business he had in the warehouse? and he said he was going for nails; he gave his answer with a good deal of hesitation.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to you to know what he said? - Upon my word I really think he did.</p>
               <p>Jury. Turn it out in your hat, and see if there are any crumbs of bread and cheese in it? - If there were any they might be left behind on the paper, the tea has been weighed in a scale once or twice.</p>
               <p>(The tea was turned out, but there appeared no crumbs.)</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Councel for Prosecution. Look at the man, be extremely cautious? - I have not the least doubt, I could not rest till I had told it; my heart is quite easy that he is the man.</p>
               <p>To Prosecutor. How long had you an opportunity of seeing this man at the time you lost your load? - It was full ten minutes, the gentleman from the lottery-office did not come for some minutes after we stood there.</p>
               <p>Are the brickbats there? - No, Sir, they me to carry them, and I did not like to carry them any longer: the flannel I lost was my master's property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am come here with a resolution to speak the truth, and nothing but the truth; I am a man that is low in circumstances, nevertheless I have no manner of doubt but you, my Lord, and the gentlemen of the Jury will Yee equal justice done by me, as if I was a man of property; if I shall deny any question that shall be demanded of me, then, my Lord, and gentlemen look upon me in a had light.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Councel. You said you was gone for this beer and gin about five minutes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then upon the whole you was only in company for five minutes? - No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say much to you? - No; he was dressed in a brown great coat, and a white apron.</p>
               <p>When you saw the prisoner at the Poultery Compter, did not you say you was sorry for what you had done, and that you was convinced he was not the man? - No, I told him I believed he was the man that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Did not you say that now you saw him by day light, you was convinced he was not the person? - The prisoner said, how can you say such a thing, I was bad with a canker in my mouth, and he brought out a sheet of paper, and there was his name upon it.</p>
               <p>Did not you say at the time you stood with him at the Poultry Compter that now you saw him by day-light you was convinced he was not the person, or words to that purpose? - I told him I was sure he was the man.</p>
               <p>Was you examined upon oath by the Magistrate? - I was.</p>
               <p>You are quite clear of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you swear you did not recollect him? - I wished to have a little more recollection.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time during the examination say he was not the man? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you say before the Magistrate he was not the man? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself, my friend, come remember what you are about, and pay some more attention than you did to your master's goods? - Before Alderman Boydel I told him I did not believe he was rightly the man but I wished to have a little more consideration.</p>

               <p>I was called before the Alderman on Tuesday the 2d day of March, it was the 1st day of March he came into the lodge, and called for a pint of beer, and let some few words drop concerning me; about half an hour after five the same evening, the prosecutor and that gentleman came and sent for me to the lodge, then he asked me if I knew him, I told him to my knowledge I never saw him before; he told me, on the 4th of December he pitched a parcel there, and I was the man that took it; I told him he was mistaken; he told me the whole story, and said he would swear to it; I told him it was a very critical point where life was concerned; the next morning, about half an hour after nine, the prosecutor came to the place, and called me, and said he was sorry for what he said over night; but when he came to look at me again I was not the man; he said it was very hard upon him, for his master threatened to arrest him for the property lost; I told the Alderman that I was a very remarkable man, and if the man could swear to me he might; the Alderman said that was very fair, and asked him if he could swear to me; no such thing; I was discharged, but remanded till I got people to my character; I was ordered up on Saturday without a hearing, then on the Monday I got my friends to appear, then I was ordered into custody; then the prosecutor said he would swear I was the man that left the box there, but that he would not swear I was the man that took his bundle.</p>

            . for conveying in several things for an escape, it was not expressed in the warrant that it was for felony, and the Judges were all of opinion that it was not within the act of Parliament, and the prisoner was discharged; I took the objection myself, it was a woman that escaped out of the Poultry Compter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Counsel. I was first going to make the objection myself, when your Lordship spoke; I believe the case is very plain, if your Lordship will have the goodness to reverse the case, if the facts are sufficient against the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. The case that is reserved is, a man was conveying a man to gaol, and they got out a knife, and cut him across the face, and attempted to cut his throat, it was tried at Maidstone, and the man was convicted, but it struck Mr. Justice Gould, as it has your Lordship, and he reserved the case.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fenwick. My Lord, this rope and iron were found hanging down in the prison, I was within a yard of the person that found it: I saw that found on the side of the wall withinside of the prison, joining my apartment; I hastened by the back of the prison to seek for Stewart, thinking I should find the prisoner Stewart, I went to the field called Dr. Fordyce's field, at the back of the prison, and I found this end of the rope there, the boy that stood before me, said, I saw the man that goes about with bull dogs here about seven, and another said, that must be Gibbons; a handkerchief was found the next morning, the irons were found in the prison, cut off at top, and the other brought back by two people.</p>
               <p>Who found that iron in the prison? - My turnkey, he is not here; I saw the prisoner on the Wednesday afternoon, he came down with another man, the escape was on the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. You did not find those irons yourself? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor you did not see any person make use of that rope and stick? - No.</p>
               <p>Is that rope and stick in the same state in which it was found? - Yes, the prisoner was stopped by my turnkey; when we taxed the prisoner, he said, it was very unlikely he should be the person that should assist Stewart out, and then come down there afterwards.</p>

               <p>I keep a public house about ten yards from the gaol, I saw the prisoner on Tuesday the 8th of March, about half an hour after two go into the gaol, and come out about five.</p>
               <p>Who was in the gaol then? - I cannot tell, I heard about half after seven, Stewart escaped, I happened to be at that time at Dr. Fordyce's gardens with their people, I ran into the garden ground, the north-west part of the goal, and this part was hung down into the gaol, and the other part was hanging into the garden ground, this handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Is that a thoroughfare? - No, it is a private garden, this knife was found on the prisoner when he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fenwick. I saw the handkerchief picked up, and somebody said it was Stewart's.</p>

               <p>How near did you see him from the wall of the prison? - About a hundred yards from where the prisoner got out, there is no foot way there, I did not know what he was about; I am sure that was the man, I I am positive of it, I knew him two years ago, he goes out with bull-dogs.</p>

               <p>On the 8th of March, I went to see the prisoner's brother to drink a dish of tea; about six in the evening, he asked me to take a walk to see the house he was building, and when I came down there, he missed something, and he desired I would take<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060139"/> care of his house, I staid there about two hours, the prisoner came there to see for his brother, and they asked him to go to a chair club.</p>
               <p>What time did the prisoner come there? - About twilight, I believe, as near as I can guess it was between six and seven; the prisoner staid there three quarters of an hour, as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Where was this house? - In Margaret-street, down the back of High-street, Mary-le-bon; I suppose a mile and an half, or near two miles from Tothill-fields.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. How came you to recollect? - My brother informed me he was taken in custody, and desired I would speak what I knew.</p>
               <p>Did you attend before the Magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you examined? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him the same story? - Yes, before Sir Sampson, and before Mr. Addington.</p>
               <p>What makes you recollect the hour? - I cannot tell what makes me recollect the hour, but I am positive of it, it was twilight.</p>
               <p>Whether it was near six or seven you cannot tell? - It was half past five when we came to the prisoner's brother, and I suppose it might be three quarters of an hour after that I saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>How long did he stay there? - As near as I can tell three quarters of an hour; I had no watch nor clock, I only recollect the day from the circumstance I am called here upon.</p>
               <p>Was it the 5th or the 6th? - It was the 8th, I recollect by the ticket, I read it, as near as I can recollect it was,</p>
               <p>'desire the favour of your company to come and spend the evening at a public-house in Swallow-street,' I do not remember the sign.</p>
               <p>When were they to meet at this club? - The same evening, I believe.</p>
               <p>What, do not you know? - I am sure the same evening, I will not be positive to the sign, but it might be the crown.</p>
               <p>Court. The prisoner came to enquire whether his brother was at home; did the brother go with you to see the building? - Yes, and he went away directly; he desired I would look at the place, and see how far he had got.</p>
               <p>Then you staid very near two hours at the building? - He desired I would stay there till he came back.</p>
               <p>What time did the brother come back? - Not above a quarter of an hour after the prisoner went away.</p>
               <p>What time did the prisoner go away? - As near as I can recollect it was between seven and eight, he had been with me all that time.</p>
               <p>What could induce you to stay two hours there, when one hour of that must be quite dark? - There was a fire to sit by.</p>
               <p>There were none of the workmen there? - No, I was never long acquainted with the prisoner, his brother is something in the coach way.</p>
               <p>What was he building this house for himself? - Yes, I believe the prisoner is something in the same branch, but I do not know.</p>

               <p>Thompson. I paid Place two pounds six shillings the last payment, he made his mark.</p>
               <p>Mr. Turner. I called Mr. Rashleigh, and said I suspected it was a forgery.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys, Prisoner's Councel, to Mr. Thompson. Did you pay Place any money before? - He had been paid two or three times.</p>
               <p>Then you cannot say that he cannot write, all that you know is, that he made his mark? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I was called into the compting-house and informed that a person was present to receive prize-money; and they supposed there was a forgery; I went into the compting-house to see, and saw the prisoner, and shewed him this paper, and asked him how he came by it, as it was dated Plymouth; he told me he received it in a letter from Plymouth; I asked him where the letter was; he told me at his lodgings; I asked where his lodgings were; he told me at the White Lyon in St. Catherine's, I think that was the answer he gave; I then left him in the compting-House, and went for a constable, the constable came, and I charged him with the prisoner, on a suspicion of forgery, in uttering this note: I desired the constable to go with him to his lodgings; and if they found the letter there and the matter clear, I had no objection to the prisoner's being released, because I thought it would be a proof that he had come by it honestly; on the same day, and nearly at the same time I referred to some letters I had received from Mr. Nicholls, the Mayor of Plymouth, to compare it with the will.</p>

               <p>Mr. Keys. I believe you asked the prisoner how he came by this after that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he come back again after he had been to search? - He was carried to the Compter immediately.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with the prisoner after? - Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>I believe in that conversation you required him to tell the truth, how he came by this order to receive the money? - I did, and his account of it was that he received it from one

               <p>Mr. Keys. Did he say Eagan owed him any money? - No, the prisoner made this kind of declaration, with the view of turning King's evidence.</p>

               <p>I was one of the owners of the ship Elbe, I went to the prisoner's house; I had an information that Payne, who has since been convicted and executed, was concealed there; I went on the 31st of October, it was some time after the robbery; the prisoner's house is down an alley in Half-moon-alley, an obscure place; after rummaging every room in the house, he told me I was a day behind the fair, or a day too late, for he was gone one hundred miles out of town.</p>
               <p>What was the amount of the robbery? - Twenty-seven or twenty-eight hundred pounds, about two thousand five hundred pounds in dollars.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scott, one of the Prisoner's Council. Who was it that made the first application that you received respecting Mr. Barlow? - I believe it was Mr. Samuel, the proprietor of the watches; I went myself the first morning.</p>
               <p>Did you acquaint Mr. Barlow what your business was? - There was myself, Mr. Samuel and his son, and they had two or three constables; I went to find Payne, at the first sight I had no idea of Mr. Barlow having any of my property; I sent a message by my servant, and he came to me.</p>
               <p>When you sent your servant, did you send word what business you wanted him upon; - I believe I did not, but my man knew the business; Mr. Barlow came the same morning voluntarily; I asked him to refund the money, he said he had none; I went then to Sir Sampson's immediately; and I believe he was sent for to Sir Sampson's; I believe he came there voluntarily, there was no warrant.</p>
               <p>What was desired of him at Sir Sampson's? - He was questioned relative to the property, why he did not give up the property; he was required to give up eighty pounds.</p>
               <p>Was he told if he would admit having the money in his possession that he would be discharged? - He denied having it, as far as I recollect; I recollect the circumstance of the girl charging him with the delivery of the money, so much in cash, so much in bank notes, tied up in a particular manner; it was upon his examination before Sir Sampson; the girl's name is

               <p>Was that before Payne went off? - Yes, more than twenty times before Payne went off.</p>
               <p>Who was this spider? - I believe May Cooke.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding, another Council for the prisoner. You have known the man at the bar eighteen months? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Habits of intimacy all the time? - No, there has been some coolness between us since Payne's affair, I never was out with Payne but once.</p>
               <p>What robbery did you commit then? - You do not understand me so; I never was out with him but once to spend the afternoon.</p>
               <p>But you knew him for eighteen months, and always suspected him for a thief. - No, no, you run on too fast for me; I suspected him to be a thief a considerable time before this.</p>
               <p>How came it you did not inform some Magistrate that he was at this house of Barlow's? - I had something else to do, I have four children to work for.</p>
               <p>You made one of the party at oysters, now how came you to sup with him? - I supped with Mr. Barlow.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you became acquainted with Mr. Taylor? - Last Friday.</p>
               <p>How came he to find you out? - Ask him, you shall not have it from me, I do not know.</p>
               <p>How did he find you out? - Ask him, I will not tell you, for I do not know, I was informed he sent a man to enquire for me.</p>
               <p>What did Mr. Taylor say to you when he first met you? - I positively cannot tell you the words, he asked me my name, and I have had a subpoena served upon me if it was nothing but what I expected, when I heard that the man had robbed the man of eighty, and stripped him in gaol, what could I expect.</p>
               <p>What are you, and where do you live? - By my hands.</p>
               <p>To what use do you apply these hands to? - To making chairs, and mending them; I live in Long-alley, Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Have you been at work yesterday, for the day before? - No.</p>
               <p>What have you had from Mr. Taylor? - I have not seen the colour of Mr. Taylor's money yet.</p>
               <p>You say you saw Payne at Barlow's house through the window? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What passed between Payne and you? - I took the paper and shewed it to him, and he read it, he took very little notice to me about it, the prisoner advised me to take an empty room, or a ready furnished room, and he directed me to Butler's-alley, and I could not get one, we continued at Mr. Barlow's while I was seeking for a lodging; I think he was there three days, he was there in the back room, and locked up; sometimes they put him in the necessary, when any of Barlow's girls were coming, he was put in a place of concealment; there was one girl he was affraid of, for Barlow said, she was a bad sort of a body, and had lived in a bad place; on the Thursday following this robbery, Payne brought me four guineas, and three ten and one twenty-pound note, on the Thursday night following, and on the Friday night following he brought me forty guineas, and six tens and one twenty more, and he bid me take care of them, and not let Barlow know any thing of them, and he bid me good night; he went away, I saw no more of him till Thursday, then he staid at Barlow's till the last of his going off; I laid with him, therefore I know he was there; Payne was to come to dinner, but he did not, and Barlow's sister came in about one o'clock, and she said, Poll, Ned is taken, she said to me, you will be surely hanged or transported for life; I went to my room and fetched these guineas and notes away, and I came to Barlow's and said, what shall I do! says I, what shall I do! says he, suppose we put the notes into the tea kettle, no, says I, that will spoil them; this was the Sunday evening, and he put the guineas in the drawer, and said, gold cannot be sworn to; on the Monday morning I gave him these eleven notes, and I went to Edmonton, and his sister came down, and said, Ned is not taken; and I came to Barlow's house, says I, come Jack, give me my money and my papers, and I will go home, so he gave me the money in a stocking, says I, where are my papers, he said you must stay for them till eight o'clock, and then he gave me four notes instead of eleven, and I came back immediately; he said hold your tongue, I will go and seek for them, and he came back, and said, he could not get them till five in the morning; says I, Payne will be here in the morning, and he will murder me; the next morning Payne came to this man's house, and Barlow came to me, and said, I have got Ned.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. How long from that time was it before Payne went to Lynn, in Yorkshire? - Upon my word I cannot justly say.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoner. Do you understand what was read to you, Cousins?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. I will tell you in a few words what it is, you are charged with being the person, against whom information was laid before Mr. Compton, a Justice of the peace, by six persons, by the name of George, otherwise Teapot, for being present, aiding, and assisting, in the rescue of unaccustomed goods, and that information was afterwards certified to the secretary of state, and was by him laid before his Majesty in Council, and thereupon an order of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060110"/> Council was made and duly published, and proclamation had, requiring you, by the name of George, otherwise Teapot, labourer, to surrender yourself within a certain time, in order that you might be tried for that offence, and you have not surrendered yourself accordingly; and that therefore you stand attainted of felony: therefore the question is, whether you do or do not admit, that you are the person described in that information, and in that order of council, and whether you do or do not controvert the truth, of there having been such an information made, and that information having been certified, and such an order of Council obtained against you, and whether you can shew that you have surrendered.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am the person they take me to be, but I was not there, I have not surrendered.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shelton. Do you deny the several facts stated in the suggestion?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Take notice that you are to be tried next session.</p>
               <p>Court. That you may not be deceived, I think it right to apprize you, that when you come to be tried on this suggestion, the question will not be whether you was there, but the only question will be, whether you are the person known by the name of George, otherwise Teapot, labourer, and whether they did inform against you, and make such order against you in the Privy Council; therefore you must not go away with a notion, that you are to be tried on this suggestion, or for having been there at the time, for that is not the question.</p>
               <p>The prisoner then withdrew.</p>
