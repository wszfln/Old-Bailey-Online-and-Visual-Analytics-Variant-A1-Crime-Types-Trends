             keeps the house, and lets it out in lodgings - he lives there himself. In the early part of March the prisoner came to lodge there, and occupied part of my bed; when he came I had a box in my bed-room, containing my wearing-apparel - I had lost the key, and it was unlocked: I used to keep another box on it; I had looked into the box on Thursday, the 12th of March, and saw my articles safe; the prisoner had slept there every night till Saturday, the 14th - on going to my box on Sunday, the 15th, I missed three coats, a pair of trousers, two waistcoats, a handkerchief, and a snuff-box, all of which were my property. I did not see the prisoner again till Saturday, the 21st; I had been looking for him all the week, and saw him by the King's-mews, Pimlico; when he saw me he ran away - I pursued, and took him to Hatton-garden; he had then got my trousers and waistcoat on - the waistcoat was taken off in my presence, by Hall; (looking at them) these are the trousers I lost - I know them by the make and button at the bottom; I have no doubt of them, but the waistcoat I cannot positively swear to; it is the sort of waistcoat I lost - exactly the same work, and I believe it to be one of those I lost.</p>

             re-examined. One of my coats was quite new; I had only worn it twice, and I gave four guineas for it; another of the coats I gave four guineas for, and had not worn it half a dozen times - the other coat cost six guineas; they were certainly worth 10l. - the trousers cost 30s., and the two waistcoats are worth 1l.: the prisoner stated himself to be a gentleman's servant out of place - I never saw him with any thing but what he had on, and he said he had been in great distress.</p>

I searched the prisoner's house on the 27th of January, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning; I knew he lived there - he was at home; I found about 16lbs. of pickled pork there, in a clothes chest - I did not examine it then, as I was not looking for pork; it was in a covered pan in the chest - it seemed to be dry; after hearing Mrs. Roberts' house was broken open, I went to the house again with her, about three o'clock in the afternoon, and found only part of the pork in the same chest, rolled up in some clothes - there were only four pieces then; there were several pieces before - they were taken out of the pan and wrapped in some clothes in the same chest; the prisoner was not there then - I took it away; the piece produced is part of what I found there and produced before the Magistrate - I delivered it to the prosecutrix after the last Session; I kept it till then: before I went to the house with her, she said she should know it by a mark, and I found the mark she had described - it was a notch; Castle saw the four pieces before the Justice.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen the knife before he got outside the door? A. Yes, my Lord - when I saw the knife coming I drew back, and it only scratched me down the cheek; when I drew back, the knife fell again outside the door -I put my hand to the left side of my face, and found a great quantity of blood flowing from the side of my face; he then instantly picked up the knife, and ran away down Great George-street - our house is at the Park end of Great George-street; when the knife fell outside the door I retreated back two or three yards, and said to my mistress, "I am stabbed" - while I was saying that, he was in the act of picking up the knife; mistress said, "Go and call the watchman" - I instantly went out, and he had got round the corner by Princes-court; he had turned short to the right from Prince-court into Princes-street - the back door which he had gone out of is in Princes-court; I first saw him crossing the road in George-street - that was within a minute of the time I had lost sight of him; he was walking very deliberately - I had to pass Allen, the watchman; I caught hold of him by the arm, and said, "That man has stabbed me," and pointed him out to Allen - his box is against Storey's-gate; I said, "That is the man, come along with me" - I ran on, and Allen followed me, springing his rattle all the way; I pursued him till he got to the corner of Little George-street, and there he slipped down over some orange peel, or something - I then told the watchman to make haste; he took him into custody - I said, "Take care, he has got a knife - mind he don't stab you;" the watchman took him to the watch-house: some gentlemen told me to come and have my wounds dressed before I went to the warehouse, which I did - I then went to St. Margaret's watch-house, and found him; my wounds have been healed only two days ago - I was not attended by a surgeon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you stabbed before you took hold of him to do any thing? A.

In 1823 I was in command of part of the Constitutional Army, near Spain; the prisoner was in the first regiment - I have seen him several times in this country: I knew him in Spain - he was then of sound mind; the officer of his regiment wrote to me, giving him a good character; I saw him a few months after in England, and then thought his mind very much altered - about a month ago he called on me to offer his services as a shoemaker; I concluded from his manner and way of speaking that he was a very different man to what I had known him before, from his actions and general manner, and the impression on my mind at the time was that he was not sound in mind, as such I did not employ him</p>

            . I am a Spanish refugee. I have known the prisoner in this country since 1824 - in my judgment he was of sound mind when I first knew him, which was at Gibraltar, but his mind as been very different since; I believe sometimes he does not know right from wrong -I have known him sleep in the fields for more than fifty nights, when I have offered him my own lodging, but he refused it; I have ordered him to make me a pair of boots, and on going to him I have not got an answer for ten or fourteen weeks - he has got into a violent passion on my going for them, and told me to leave his room in a violent manner and said all the Spaniards wanted to murder him -I have procured him work, and found him the materials; he has afterwards returned both the materials and money, saying he would not work - he bore the character of a mild humane man.</p>

               <p>V. NOGUES. I have known the prisoner since he arrived in this country, in 1825. In my judgment he has not been of sound mind for about the last year; my landlord has invited him to dine and sleep at his house - instead of that he has gone and slept in the fields; I know that myself, and six or seven months ago he hired a lodging and did not sleep at it for two nights - I saw him almost every day; he has come to dine with me and my landlord, and before dinner was over he has left the room, gone out, and not returned - he has done this frequently; the last time was three or four days before he was taken into custody: I believe he was not of sound mind then, for he left in an abrupt manner, when we were eating - two days before that my landlord offered him a shirt and a handkerchief - after looking at them he went away without them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. These were acts of kindness to him? A. Yes, on account of his poverty; no offence was given to him - he left without any cause.</p>

            . I live in Phoenix-street. The prisoner lodged with me for twelve months four or five years ago - I believe at times he was not of sound mind; after he had been at our house two or three months, he brought down his pot of shoemakers' paste, and said to my wife,"I imagine, Madam, this has offended you;" she asked him why, he said he did not know in what manner, and immediately threw it over the house; my wife had said nothing to him about it - I have got many people to order shoes of him; he has bought the leather, kept it a week, then took it back to the person not touched, though he has paid for the leather out of his own pocket - a person lent him 30s. for the materials to make a pair of boots - he kept the money a fortnight, then brought it to me, and told me the Spaniards would not allow him to make boots for the English - at other times he has appeared rational; he then appeared humane and gentle.</p>

            . I am a Spaniard, and a merchant of this City. I have seen the prisoner at my house at times - I know he has been much distressed in circumstances lately; I have not known him long, but think occasionally he was not of sound mind - he has begged of me in a manner, which no one in his senses would have done; this impression was made on my mind long before this charge.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on the 13th of March. in West-square, Gravesend, at a public-house; I said, "Well, young gentleman, what do you think of yourself;" he said he had nothing to say - I asked what he had done with the money - he said he had lost six sovereigns out of his pocket, and the rest he had spent: I asked if there was any money at this public-house, as I understood he had given the publican two sovereigns and a half, to take care of; but I found only half a sovereign in the publican's care.</p>

            . I am street-keeper of St. Andrew's, Holborn. I heard the prosecutor say he had been robbed - the prisoner was pointed out; I crossed, and laid hold of him about the end of Leather-lane - he was then alone; he said he was innocent: I searched him, but found nothing on him. The City bounds are about two houses on this side of Gray's Inn-lane - this was done in Middlesex.</p>

I was coming from a friend's house in Gray's Inn-lane, into Holborn, and seeing a young man I knew, I spoke to him, and walked by the side of him to Brooke-street: a gentleman came and said he had got a handkerchief - I walked on, and by Leather-lane the beadle took me.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On returning from work, with the other three men, one of them proposed going to this shop to buy tobacco; they lodge in the same house with me, and I went with them; when we came out this gentleman seized me, and said I had taken a snuff-box - the boy said he could swear to me because I wore a smock-frock.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was any one else in the shop? A. No; he put the twist into his pocket, took it out again, and threw it towards the drawer; he could not run away, for I went round and bolted the door; the twist was in his possession about a minute and a half while I was matching it; he shut the door when he came in - he stopped till my master came; he had an opportunity of running away after I accused him, but did not attempt it; I called my master - he told me to detain him, and I then bolted the door; my master was not up - he came into the shop with nothing on but his trousers; he went out of the shop to get his clothes - I stood at the door with the door bolted.</p>

               <p>"I have got a thief - he has got a ball of twist;" I got out of bed, and came into the shop: I said to the prisoner" You are the man we have been looking for for some time, as I have lost a great many balls of twist;" I sent for Avis, but he was in bed - I then told him if he would go quietly with me to the office it would be some proof of his honesty; he first said he was a tailor, and then a pencil-maker - he went very quietly part of the way to the office - then said "I know where you are going to take me, but if you will go to my father's I will give you 10s.;" I then said "I must handle you;" he then offered me 1l., and when we got into the office he offered me 30s.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say, "If you will give me 30s. I will pardon you?" A. No, certainly not - the offer came from him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know him before? A. I have frequently seen him at the shop; I should not have taken the 30s. of him - I never did of any one - I did not of Prince's father - that I swear; I had not to leave the shop to get my clothes - they were brought to me; the prisoner had got down a short street before I took hold of him - I had told him I would take him to a friend of mine; he heard me send for an officer - he stopped, hesitated, and wanted to wheel off, but did not attempt to run.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had this ball in my hand, and said "Do you think this colour will do?" he said "No- I think black would do;" before I had time to put it down, he said "You are going to steal that;" I said "I am not:" he took the drawers away - I put down the ball, and he called his master; the prosecutor said if I would give him 30s. he would let me go; the officer said it must not be.</p>

I was acquainted with Mr. Mayes for about twelve months: I then introduced him to my brother and Mr. Power - my brother gave him orders for a coat and trousers, which he delivered to him; my brother had a letter coming from lreland with some money in it - I called on the landlady on Monday, and the prosecutor said,"Your brother has taken away my clothes;" I said," I know nothing about it."</p>

On the morning of the 5th of March the prisoner was in the shop - I saw her unpin a gown; she waited a few minutes and left the shop; I missed the gown, and followed her down Robert-street; I accused her of having stolen a gown - she said she had not; I held her child while she turned up her cloak - it was not there; I said she was the person, but as she had not got it I must let her go; I then turned to go back, and saw it hanging over an area close to where she had been - no one else could possibly have put it there; I then ran and overtook her in South Molton-street; I mentioned many things which we had lost - she said she had not taken them, and ran into a public-house; I sent for the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many persons were there in the shop? A. Perhaps about twelve; I must have passed this gown in the area, but my eyes were intent on her; she had only gone one door past the area-other persons left the shop while she was there, but I was induced to watch her; I cannot tell whether I was serving any body, I might, and yet looking at her; I did not see her take the gown, but I saw her unpin it; nobody but her left after she did unpin it,</p>

            . I am a watchman of Paddington. On the 25th of February, about five minutes before seven o'clock at night, I was in Spring-place, near the Grand Junction-canal, about a hundred yards from Mr. Wade's; I saw the prisoners together - Baylin was carrying this lead- they went sharp round the corner, and up Conduit-place; I went up to them, took hold of the box, and said,"What have you here?" Baylin said lead, which he brought from Bayswater tea-gardens; the others heard him say that: I said, "Let me look at it:" he put it down, and turned it out - I said, "That will do - you must go to the watch-house;" he said very well, that he had the lead to sell for his brother; another watchman came up, and took them all to the watch-house.</p>

On the Saturday morning I placed myself in a hackney-coach, and between six and seven o'clock I saw a little nephew of the prosecutor's go out with a jug, for some coffee - directly afterwards I saw Oakely come out and beckon for some one to go to the shop; I directly saw Erridge go to the shop: I distinctly saw he had nothing in his hand when he went in - he was in the shop from three to five minutes, and then came out with a basket, which appeared to be loaded; I followed down Holywell-street, and asked what he had got there - he said some meat, which was his own; I asked where he got it from - he then said it was his master's - I asked who his master was; he said that was his business: I told him I was a Bow-street officer, and my business was to inquire where he got it from; he then said a butcher who was going to Newgate-market, asked him to carry it for him; I told him I suspected he had stolen it, and put him into St. Clement's watch-house - the basket contained two legs of mutton and a piece of beef: he was near Temple-bar when I took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Could you see the shop when Erridge went in? A. I could not; I was between fifty and sixty yards off, but it was impossible for any one to go in or come out without my seeing them - I did not see Oakley in the shop at the time Erridge went in; I did not go in till after Oakley was taken.</p>

            . I was informed there was something going on wrong, and was set to watch. On the 21st of March I was in the church, and saw Oakley come out of the shop, just after the little boy came out with the jug; he looked towards Holywell-street - I saw him beckon, and in about a minute I saw Erridge walk up to the shop and go in; Oakley then took down a leg of mutton from the door, and walked into the shop - I afterwards saw Erridge come out with a basket, very heavily loaded; I went out, and followed him with the meat, but seeing the other officer I went back, and took Oakley; I said I wanted him concerning robbing his master of the meat - he said he knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not Oakley tell you he went down stairs to look for his cap, and what happened while he was down he could not tell? A. I do not recollect it- to my best belief he did not; the church is not above eight yards from the shop: I found no money on Oakley, but there was 1l. 7s. found in his box.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met him about half-past eight o'clock in the evening; he had a comrade with him, and a young woman asked his comrade to give her something to drink; we went into three public-houses, and had some gin; the young man then went into the barracks, and the young woman and myself staid with the prosecutor: he wished to go home with me: I said he had better go to the barracks, but he followed us - I was intoxicated, and asked the young woman to see me up to bed, and what passed afterwards I cannot tell.</p>

            . I am a decorative painter - I live in Great Tichfield-street. I went to Rowney and Forster's, on the 17th of February; I purchased some articles of the prisoner, which came to 10s. 3d;. I paid for them, and took them away; he gave me this small memorandum, which I saw him write; it was in the middle of the afternoon, but I cannot say what time.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were there any other young men in the shop? - A. I did not see any - I was not acquainted with him before; I was not long in the shop; there is no date to this bill of parcel; I know it was the 17th of February; I took particular notice of the day - Mr. Rowney passed through the shop at the time: I have no doubt the prisoner is the person.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Do you remember the 17th of February? - A. Yes, perfectly well. I was not at home when Mr. Newton came; I looked at the till about half-past two or three o'clock that day; I found some money in it; the till-book and the contents of the till agreed; I looked again in three-quarters of an hour or an hour, and found the money precisely as before, or within sixpeace, and still agreeing with the book: this paper is the prisoner's writing; the till-book is here, and it was his duty to enter in that till-book all he received: here is no amount of 10s. 3d. that day - the entries in the prisoner's hand-writing that day are only two - "Colour 1s., and L. B. d., which means London Board, 7d."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it usual for your shopmen to give a memorandum of this kind when no receipt is required? - A. If it is asked for. We have twelve men in our employ, but only two men regularly attend in the shop; Mr. Rowney and myself attend when we are<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090018"/>there; there was only a young man of the name of Phipps and the prisoner that attended in the shop at that time; the others do not know the prices of the articles; Mrs. Rowney balances the till, because I do not reside on the premises, and Mr. Rowney was at that time on a journey: letters, lamp oil, and a variety of other things are paid for out of the till; they should be put down in the book, and frequently they are. Mrs. Rowney balances the till every day when she is there in almost every instance; she has omitted it; the money is taken out of the till every Monday morning, and those little things are deducted. If there is no mistake; expenses may be paid out of the till without being put down - money has occasionally been borrowed from the till for the house, and a memorandum was then put into the till; such a thing as an omission may have been made - it has occurred that there has been more money in the till than was entered in the till-book; we sometimes take money in the shop, and do not put it down; I cannot account for more money being in the till than was put down, except from the confusion attending the establishment.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How did you pay the prisoner? A. We paid him 100l. a-year, quarterly - the till is balanced every morning, ninety-nine times out of a hundred; it was his duty to put down the money he took - we are not in a very large way of business.</p>

               <p>MRS. ROWNEY. It is my habit to compare the contents of the till with the till-book every morning - I did so on the morning after the 17th of February; I found it correct - if there had been 10s. 3d. more in the till than in the book I should have found it out, most assuredly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you do that every morning regularly? A. when I am in town; I never omit it except I am ill - Mr. Forster then does it; it has happened that there has been more money in the till than appeared in the book - perhaps once a month; I will swear it has not happened once a week - I do not think it has; money may have been taken for letters and other things, and not be entered in the book - it has not been customary to take money for household expences out of the till; it may have been done without my knowledge.</p>
               <p>MR. PAYNE. Q. Are there any expences entered that day? A. Yes; it is the prisoner's duty to put all the money be received into the till.</p>

            . I was porter to the prosecutor at the time the prisoner lived there - he was in the habit of giving me goods to take out; he sent me on the 18th of February to Mr. Egles, in Newman-street - I delivered the goods, and received 14s. 6d., which I delivered to the prisoner; I cannot say what it was for - the parcel I carried was about the size of a portfolio.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you give a receipt? A. Yes; the prisoner gave me the receipt - this is the receipt and bill of parcel; I particularly remember the day - I took nothing home for the use of the shop that day, I am quite sure; I was sometimes in the habit of fetching oil for the shop, but that was in the morning, before I went to the City - I never had, or scarcely ever had, to lay out money; on that day I did not - when I have deposited my master's goods I have never paid for articles out of the money.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you have gone out and received money, have you spent any part of that money for the benefit of the shop? A. No - when I was ordered to bring things home they used to give me the money to bring them: I never paid for them out of that money.</p>

               <p>MR. PAYNE. Q. Have you a distinct recollection of paying the 14s. 6d. to the prisoner? A. Yes; I have occasionally bought oil for the shop, and they have given me the money.</p>

             re-examined. Q. On the 18th of February do you find any entries of folios in the prisoner's hand-writing? A. Yes, "folios 11s. 6d."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is this the original book, or is there a waste-book? A. There is no waste-book previous to this, in which we enter money taken at the counter; if the porter goes out with goods, and returns with money, it is entered in this book, and very frequently no memorandum is taken of it - there is no book in which this entry ought to appear before it appears here; as the goods were sent out they ought to have been entered on a memorandum paper - the paper ought to lay on the counter; those entries on the 18th of February are some of them my writing, some the prisoners, and some another young man's, and the entries on the 17th are in three different hands - as this was a ready money transaction there is no other book in which it should be entered; we have a waste-book in which we enter things we do not expect to be paid for - the waste-book is not here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When there is credit given. you enter it in the waste-book? A. Yes, but it does not contain an account of all the sums received or credited, only credit accounts; except a party pays money, whom we do not expect to pay it, then it is entered in the waste-book.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that the deficiency must have arisen by his having omitted to enter cash for articles paid for on the house account.</p>

            ; the prisoner was in our employ. I was in the shop on the 9th of February, when some lithographic books were purchased by a lady: when she was gone I asked him if she had bought many books - they were to be sent home, but I did not hear distinctly where they were to be sent to; the prisoner said, "They have taken one of Harley's, and one of Diton's," or some such answer, but I could not tell to what amount - I cannot swear positively to what he said; I cannot speak positively as to when the porter was sent with the things - here is the till-book, and here is the entry in the prisoner's hand-writing, "Litho. books, 7s. 6d.;" and I hold a note in my hand in his hand-writing for those very books for 9s. 6d.; this entry was made that evening.</p>
               <p>MR. PAYNE. Q. Have you any means of knowing whether that entry applies to the books the lady had? A. There is no other entry of lithographic books that day; on the 11th of February there is 1s. entered to Miss Bacon, and there is no entry of colours by the prisoner on that day, nor any other entry with Miss Bacon's name; here is an entry of 3s. 6d. on the 12th of February, but no name - I know this alludes to Mrs. Wallduck, because I was in the shop at the time; she bought the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090019"/>colours, and I looked into the book to see what the prisoner put down, and it was 3s. 6d. - here is an entry of 1s., but I am not certain whether that was after she had paid or not; the money paid for oil, letters, shavings, &amp;c. has been put down in the book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is Miss Wynne here? A. No, not to my knowledge; at the expiration of a few years I should have quitted the partnership - I am not aware that the prisoner was likely to become a partner; we highly respected him, and he was likely to get a considerable advance of salary.</p>

            . I know the prosecutor's house. On Saturday morning, the 28th of March, I was a goodish bit from the house, about ten minutes or a quarter before six o'clock, and saw the prisoner coming from the house towards his own, with a wheelbarrow, and something tied up in a sack - the sack appeared bulky.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to my employ at Acton, and as I crossed the cross-road to Acton, I saw a sack laying down in a bye lane between a dunghill and a ditch - I went to it and found the bacon in the sack; I looked round, but could see nobody - Immediately took my barrow, put the sack into it, wheeled it home, and put it into the cupboard; the constable came - I said if that was his they were welcome to it; I left my house at half-past five o'clock in the morning; the tools are mine - I am a bricklayer; I have been a watchman some years ago, and that lantern my father-in-law gave me; the matches a young man brought to me at the cage to light my pipe with; I have had the chisel twenty years: I believe I have a witness who brought the tinder and steel to me: there has been a little revenge between the constable and me about a cart and horse; he said if he could catch me he would serve me out for it.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

No, my Lord, I did not; I told Miss Neale I thought it impossible for us to get him up stairs, and it was of no use trying - I thought it better to bring down some bed clothes; she immediately went up stairs and brought down two pillows - one pillow was placed under Mr. Neale's head, by me and Miss Neale.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he manifest by any signs, that he understood what was doing? A. No; he seemed inclined to sleep -Miss Neale put the other pillow on the side table in the parlour, for the prisoner; I then told the prisoner - he saw it was impossible for master to be got up stairs, and asked if he would be satisfied by sleeping in the parlour; he made no reply, but afterwards said he could not think of leaving Mr. Neale, he must stay with him all night, and Mr. Neale must write a note to his master in the morning, to account for his absence - he did not make use of any name then; he said, "Your master must write a letter to my master;" I then went up stairs, and fetched down two blankets, a counterpane, and a sheet; I removed the pillow off the table, put it on the ground and doubled one blanket for the prisoner to lie upon; I laid the rest of the clothes for the prisoner to cover himself; the prisoner appeared at that time to be in liquor - he appeared quite sober when he first came to the house; I insisted on the prisoner lying down before I left the room - he laid down, but said he must undress himself and take off his stockings, for he had got a very bad heel - I left the room, and as I was going out of the room he asked me "At what hour;" I thought he meant what time I should get up, and I said I would come up about seven o'clock in the morning, or a little later; he thanked me, and wished me a good night - it was then between two and three o'clock; I had a clock down in the kitchen - I went into the kitchen, and remained there all night; I continued awake till about half-past five, and then laid down - the kitchen is directly under the parlour, where I had left them; before I laid down I heard a noise like the sound of footsteps, or a person raising himself; I thought it was the prisoner turning himself; Miss Neale staid with me in the kitchen all night, and another servant, who had not been up stairs at all; that servant usually slept there - she is the family servant: there was no man in the house except Dr. Dennis, the lodger. I awoke a little before seven o'clock, and went up stairs: I observed the street door was unbarred, before I went into the parlour - I am sure it was barred the over-night; it was not open: the parlour door was standing open - I had left it shut; I went in - the prisoner was gone and master was lying in the middle of the parlour, not in the place where I had left him; he had one blanket and one counterpane over him; part of his face was covered, and he was quite dead - I did not feel his body to see whether it was cold; I put my hand outside the clothes, to feel if he had any breath, but I could not - the pillow under his head was not the one I had placed there, but the one I had given the prisoner; I observed the other pillow where I had placed it myself - it was rather pushed on the side; there appeared a stain of snuff on it from a former night;(he used to take snuff) and likewise there was the stain of some liquor having run out of his mouth; his body had been moved about a yard and a half from the place I had left it - his head was under a small sideboard; I removed the clothes a little off his face, looked at him, and noticed that his nose was bent a little on one side - his lips were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090022"/>very black, and his face very much disfigured; I at first hardly knew whether it was him - there were black marks about his face, like wounds, but it seemed as if the blood was discoloured within; his face appeared to have been convulsed - his coat, waistcoat, and stock were gone; they had been taken off, and I found that his hat was gone- I did not observe any thing else; I gave an alarm; Miss Neale would not come up - she was too frightened; my fellow servant came up and opened the shutters; I had no candle - there is a work room behind the parlour, which shows a light; I could see all over the parlour - it had a very large sky-light, which lights through the parlour; my fellow servant went up stairs, and called Miss Scarborough, Mrs. Neale's sister; she did not come down before the body was moved, but Dr. Dennis did, and saw it in the state in which it was found; I went into the kitchen, and did not observe whether Miss Scarborough came down. (Looking at the coat, waistcoat, and other articles) these are what master had on when I left him; the gloves I know - I saw them on the morning he went out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did your master dine at home that day? A. Yes, and had mutton for dinner; he had no toasted cheese - he took no cheese that day; I am quite certain the wine was port; when the prisoner said he was to stay all night, master seemed to understand what he said, and seemed agreeable to it; I had never seen them together before - I thought the soldier seemed to know Mr. Neale very well.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why, he called him by a wrong name? A. Yes, but I did not notice that at 
first.</p>


               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. He offered his assistance to get Mr. Neale to bed? A. Yes; I cannot say what quantity of wine had been drank; when it was proposed to get Mr. Neale to bed, the prisoner said Yes; and on his attempting to assist, they both fell - they appeared unable to stand from intoxication; when I heard the noise, I thought my master was too much intoxicated to rise, and that it might be the prisoner rising or turning himself; when I went into the room in the morning, the door of the wine-closet was open, and a chair, which Miss Neale had placed against it, moved, and a quantity of arrow-root spilled on the carpet; when I came down from fetching the key, I do not think there was any wine upon the table, except what was decantered - there were four bottles of port wine in the cupboard; I heard the noise between three and four o'clock; I do not know that Mr. Neale was in the habit of snoring, but the other servant heard a snoring, and Miss Neale said he was in the habit of snoring.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. There were four bottles of wine in the cupboard overnight? A. Yes; there was none in the morning - two had been decantered, and two bottles were gone quite away.</p>

            . I am the deceased's cousin. I saw him and the prisoner soon after they came in; my cousin appeared to be quite intoxicated - the cupboard had been broken open then, and wine decantered; the cold meat had been taken up before I saw them - the prisoner appeared quite sober; I asked my cousin if I should light him to bed; the prisoner asked me to drink some wine -I refused twice; my cousin said, "Yes, Jane, drink;" those were his words - I drank part of a glass of wine, and gave the remainder to Ann, the servant; it was the first time I went into the parlour; when I asked my cousin if I should light him to bed, he made no answer, but shook his head; the prisoner replied, "Yes, I must take part of your bed;" I asked my cousin where he had been to; he replied, "I have been to see my Old True Britons;" I had never heard him speak of any thing of that kind before - the prisoner called my cousin Dr. Dennis; I asked him where he met with Mr. Neale: he said he picked him up at Hammersmith, and he would have been dead if he had not met with him; he said Dr. Dennis knew his master perfectly well; that his master was a doctor in the army.</p>

               <p>Q. Did it appear to you, from the manner the prisoner spoke to your master, and of him, that he supposed him to be Dr. Dennis? A. Yes, my Lord; and he said he must stay all night, and Mr. Neale must write a note for him in the morning - he had then heard me call my cousin Mr. Neale; I left the room, came in again, and proposed that my cousin should go to bed - Mr. Neale sat in his chair, rather shaking himself about; I tried to place him right in the chair, and the prisoner said, "Come, Dennis;" he appeared rather tipsy, and being sleepy, he could scarcely sit in the chair - I placed him right in his chair, and then the prisoner said, "Come, Dennis, this is quite perplexing:" he spoke very spitefully indeed, and the servant endeavoured to lift him from the chair, to take him to bed - we lifted him off his chair very easily indeed; he could walk across the room with assistance, I should think: when I had lifted him from the chair, the prisoner asked me to allow him to take Mr. Neale's arm - he did so, and they both fell on the floor together; the prisoner at that time appeared to become intoxicated - my cousin was not raised from the ground; he fell with his head partly under the sideboard - I never heard him utter a word after they fell, nor saw him make any sign; I went up stairs, brought down two pillows, and laid one under Mr. Neale's head, the other I put on the table for the prisoner to lay his head on; before I left the room, I put the decanter, which was about half full of wine, into the closet, closed the door, and put a chair against it - I do not know whether one or two bottles had been decantered then; in the morning the decanter was found empty - these clothes are what my cousin wore that night; here is a memorandum-book, which I believe belonged to him, but I cannot swear to it - I cannot swear to his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you first saw them you thought the prisoner quite sober? A. Yes; he got intoxicated afterwards - my cousin fell under the sideboard, and was close to the cupboard; it is only a slab where we put bonnets; his head did not touch any thing - he fell rather on his side; there was nothing to impede his fall - they both fell together, unable to assist each other; I did not examine his features after he fell.</p>

I heard of Mr. Neale's death on Wednesday night; that morning, about half-past twelve o'clock, I had seen a soldier and another person coming along Oxford-street; the prisoner was the soldier: they were coming from Mary-le-bone-lane way, eastward, between Mary-le-bone-lane and Vere-street; the person in company with the soldier was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090023"/>very much in liquor: the prisoner, when he came up, asked me where he could get any thing to drink - I said he could get nothing, the houses were all shut up; he then said he wanted to get something to drink for his brother, for he had come all the way from Hammersmith with him, in that way: I said the person with him wanted nothing more to drink, and he had better go on with him, which he immediately did; they were between Duke-street and Castle-street, Regent-street.</p>

            . I lodged at Mr. Neale's house- I was called to see him on the Wednesday morning; I found him dead, lying on the floor, with a counterpane and blanket over him; I examined him as he lay there, and saw that he was a corpse, there was a good deal of distortion on his nose, and his counternance rather swollen: I requested the family to send for their own medical attendant, and went down to arrange for removing my family from the house; his body was perfectly cold - he might probably have been dead two or three hours or longer - this was about twenty minutes past seven o'clock; he might have been dead five hours; his left nostril was much flattened on one side, and the point of the nose considerably compressed.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not pressing on the point of the nose, tend to throw the nostrils outward? A. The right nostril was considerably dilated: I made a more perfect examination an hour and a half, or an hour after; Mr. Kirton, the apothecary was present - there was a pillow lying by his side, snuff on the pillow, and a small quantity of liquor, as the other witness has stated; the body was dissected on the following morning, by Mr. Brooks, in the presence of myself and Mr. Kirton; the head was first dissected - there was no appearance of external violence, except on the nose; between the coverings of the brain there was a little secretion, coagulated, and in the brain were two small tumors; they appeared to have been some time forming, probably not sufficient to cause immediate death, but probably, by extraordinary excitement, they might have produced pressure on the brain, which would cause apoplexy; there was no further disease in the brain, except that the vessels were very full of blood, which they generally are in a state of apoplexy, but that does not always follow - they are more full than usual in apoplexy; the lungs were very much congested with blood: the right side of the heart, and its vessels, were very full of dark blood, particularly on the right side, and in a perfectly liquid state - this was at least twenty-four hours after death; we opened the abdomen, and examined the stomach, the lower part of which appeared to be a little inflamed, but not sufficient to cause death, I should think.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your whole view of the body, what, in your opinion, was the cause of his death? - A. From the external appearance of the nose I should consider that violence had been used; from the appearance of the brain I should give with great diffidence my opinion as to its being caused by violence or apoplexy; looking at that alone, I could not come to the belief that he had positively died by violence.</p>
               <p>Q. But taking the whole together, external and internal appearances, what in your opinion was the cause of death? - A. The pressure on the external part - suffocation. It is from those external appearances chiefly that I form my opinion; by external pressure on the nose and mouth I conceive, not on any other part of the head.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said the blood about the heart appeared in a fluid state? - A. Yes, the blood generally was so. In cases of natural death some of it would be a little coagulated generally; but there are instances to the contrary, even in cases of natural death from disease: my own experience does not enable me to decide whether, in a case of death by violence or suffocation, the blood is generally fluid. I never opened a person who had been hung, but in violent and sudden deaths it is generally found in a fluid state. I speak from having read books of science; my experience does not enable me to decide.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you had considerable experience in medical practice? - A. I have been in the profession sixteen or seventeen years; the blood of a person dying suddenly, whether from violence or otherwise, would he expected to be found in a fluid state even at that distance of time; persons dying from apoplexy are not generally cut off so suddenly; there is probably a few hours interval - my experience does not enable me to speak of persons dying immediately; death from apoplexy would follow in an hour or two, and I should not be surprised to find the blood in a fluid state - from the external appearances, and the internal examination, my belief is that violence had been used; I cannot say that death ensued in consequence of it; the violence to which I allude is suffocation, but I speak with great diffidence, taking the whole together: from the inspection of the brain alone I should probably have concluded there was enough to produce death from immediate excitement, without violence: there was a very slight extravasation of blood on the face of the brain, which is a very powerful indicative of apoplexy - apoplexy may be caused by suffocation; the nose was distorted: I did not see any particular discoloration; the other nostril was considerably dilated - death could not certainly be produced by compression on one nostril while the other was pervious.</p>


               <p>Q. You have spoken of the secretion of a coagulated lymph between the brain; was not that likely to be produced by the excitement of a considerable portion of drink? - A. Not immediately; I should think the secretion very different to the tumors; they might have been of long standing, but the secretion could not - tumors would certainly be likely to cause a pressure of the brain: finding the tumors there, I should consider the subject predisposed to apoplexy under any excitement - extravasated blood would produce the same effect; intoxication is very likely to be a fatal excitement to apoplexy; and a fall might produce fatal consequences when immediate assistance was not at hand - he had a double truss on.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that very likely to have increased the fatal consequences of a fall to such a subject, having tumors on the brain? - A. No, I think not; there was no undue pressure there: it did not strike me as at all likely - trusses are not made to act against nature, but to act against undue pressure. I cannot see that his being left on the floor in a state of intoxication had any thing to do with the consequences.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other apparent violence on the person to justify the conclusion that death had been the consequence of it, but when added to the appearance of the brain? - A. Certainly not: I must unite the two together.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090024"/>I should not think a fall, and his lying on the ground some hours, likely to produce apoplexy without the pressure of the nose.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Assuming that he had fallen between two and three o'clock in the morning, and after that fall never spoke, nor indicated by sign or motion that he knew what was going on, a pillow having been put under his head, what should you conceive his state to be at that moment? - A. That would be the consequence of the fall - apoplexy had then began, very probably, produced by the fall, reckoning the state of excitement he was then under from drink: I mean to say, in that state of excitement apoplexy might have been produced, which would have ended in death by seven o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Both nostrils must have been closed for death to have been caused by suffocation? - A. No; but it must have been rendered impervious by some means, but whether it had been so I cannot say; it might have been done so with a hand or pillow, or any thing, but in the state I saw it one nostril was pervious.</p>

            . I am a professor of anatomy. I have not at present an anatomical school: I have been much acquainted with the dissection of the human body. I first saw the body of the deceased on Thursday morning, about eleven o'clock, immediately before the dissection began, and thirty hours or more after death: I remarked a compression of the left nostril; the point of the nose was a little compressed, and a trifling degree of contusion about the middle of the nose; the lips were rather firmer than they are usually found - I noticed a double padded truss, worn for a double bernia; the pressure of that could not have been attended with any consequences whatever; when the head was opened, on detaching the scalp from the skull, a great quantity of blood issued; and after sawing through the skull, between the under surface and the dura mater, was a considerable effusion of blood; we then divided the dura mater, and there was a small quantity of coagulated lymph secreted on the surface on half of the brain: after a minute dissection of the interior of the brain, I turned my attention to the basis, and in two large cavities called ventricles, was a small quantity of transparent fluid in each of them; there was a tumor on each side, about the size of a small marble; on the posterior part of the basis of the brain a slight extravasation of blood - these were all the observations I made on the brain; on opening the chest. I found the lungs much conjested with blood, and about two ounces of fluid on each side of the thorax; I laid open the membrane which contains the heart, and in that was about an ounce and a half of fluid - I observed the heart to be in a very flaxed state: I laid open the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery, which issues from it, and found a considerable quantity of fluid blood in each, of a dark colour, more than I have usually found: I then opened the left ventricle, where there was also a quantity of fluid blood, but not so considerable; there was nothing important in the abdomen except a morbid degree of inflammation, which might arise from various causes.</p>

               <p>Q. Considering the state of the body, both external and internal, to what do you attribute the death, taking the whole together? - A. If his death was not from suffocation, it must have been from apoplexy; there is no positive certainty with regard to the fluidity of the blood; no inference can be drawn from finding the blood in a fluid state: I say this as the result of several experiments; with individuals destroyed by lightning, drowning, or otherwise, the blood does not coagulate, and in natural death it does; but I believe it is not to be depended upon - it is fallacious. I am more inclined to think this death must have been produced by apoplexy.</p>
               <p>Q. If in addition to the appearances, you should be informed that the deceased, being in a high state of intoxication, fell on the floor, and after the fall, never uttered a word, or made a sign or motion by which he appeared aware of what was passing, though a pillow was put under his head, would that strengthen your opinion? - A. No doubt it would; but these symptoms are all trifling and uncertain.</p>

            . I am a cabinet-maker, and live in Green-street, Leicester-square. In February last I was overseer of St. Martin's parish, in consequence of which I went to Platt-terrace to see the children the parish had apprenticed; my first visit was on the 12th of February; I did not see Colpit that day - I first saw the daughter, and asked her if I might see the children who had been bound from our parish, and without any hesitation she brought five of them; they went into the parlour with me - some of them appeared very ill, and emaciated extremely; I expressed a desire to both the mother and daughter to take them away - there was some objection on the part of both of them, and I said I would call the next day; I called the next day, the 13th, accompanied by Mr. Wright, a surgeon - when I got to the house I think the little girl name Harford opened the door; I saw both the Hibners, and requested to see the children. and went up into the room in which they were working; Mr. Wright, at my request, asked the children several questions, having first requested the prisoners to leave the room - several of the children appeared very ill indeed, and we both particularly requested the mother and daughter to allow us to take them away with us; they objected to it very much indeed, but one that was then ill they would have allowed us to have taken - she was not in the room but in the back parlour; they objected to our removing any of those who were brought into the room - Colpit was not brought into the room; in consequence of what one of the children said we went into the back parlour; Mrs. Hibner accompanied us there - we found Colpit lying on a mattress, without any proper covering; there was apparently a dirty shawl or part of a blanket over her - she had a night gown and cap on; she said nothing to my knowledge in Hibner's hearing - Mrs. Hibner told us she had been in the habit of wetting her bed very much indeed, and to convince us of the truth of her assertion she took the bed up, folding it up with the child in it, and showed us the stains which had come through being wetted; being annoyed at she manner in which the mattress was folded, I remarked that I thought she would hurt the child; of that she seemed to take very little notice whatever - we removed six of the children that day, but not at this time; we went afterwards and removed them - Colpit was among them: we took her to St. Pancras Infirmary, for Mr. Wright considered her in too dangerous a state to be removed further - she appeared very ill, particularly thin; she appeared merely skin and bone, her lips were contracted a great deal, the teeth much exposed, a redness about the eyes, on one eye I observed a cut, and I think there was a bruise on the forehead, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you any duty at St. Martin's workhouse? A. Yes, I had general duty as an overseer - six children were apprenticed to Mrs. Hibner; I never saw them on Sundays at the workhouse - it is the duty of the master of the house to know who comes; I was admitted readily to the prisoner's house - they were willing at the second visit for us to take away the one who was ill; I did not accompany the person who fetched it away - I did not notice whether the child bad wetted the bed, or not, for my mind was in a state of agitation to get the mattress put down again, considering the child would be hurt; I could not tell whether it was a shawl or blanket on the bed - it was certainly not a whole blanket - it was a woollen covering.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Do you recollect the state of the weather about that time? A. I think it was wet - it was cold.</p>

            . I was apprenticed to the elder prisoner - I went to live with her in November twelve months. Colpit came to live there either last Easter or Whitsuntide, I cannot tell which - we had eight apprentices at that time; Colpit was taken away by the officers about ten weeks ago; she was called up to work between three and four o'clock, and continued to work till between ten and eleven at night, from Michaelmas till the time she went away - she used to have a slice of dry bread, and a cup of milk and water at breakfast time; she had nothing else in the course of the day, and no other meal till the next morning - she had her breakfast at half-past eight o'clock, and was allowed five minutes to eat it in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it ever happen that she had no breakfast? A. Yes, sometimes they used to say she had not earned her breakfast, and should not have it, and then they would give her potatoes at one o'clock; there were 9lbs. between us all when we had any, including the prisoners - there were twelve in all; when she had potatoes for dinner she had nothing else all day - we went to bed between ten and eleven o'clock; we slept on the floor up stairs, in the workroom - the mother and daughter had a bed, blanket, counterpane, and sheet; Colpit laid along with us, eight of us, apprentices - we laid together on the floor; we had one blanket under, and one over us, and our clothes on - Colpit's grandmother brought her a frock and petticoat, and she had a green baize of her own; she had no stockings - that was the only accommodation we had during the whole winter, from Michaelmas till we were taken away; but we did not lay so before Michaelmas - once a fortnight, on Sundays, we had meat, and on some Sundays we were down stairs in the kitchen locked in; on other Sundays, when we had meat, we were up stairs in the work-room - our mistress was at home during those Sundays; the shutters to the kitchen window were shut on the Sundays when we were down there, and the door locked; Colpit was never allowed to go out - she was in good health when she came to live with us, and continued so till the food was changed, and then she got ill; I first perceived her unwell about a week after the victuals had been taken off - <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090026"/>they made her keep to the frame after the victuals had been taken off.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she ever found fault with for not doing her work? A. Yes, she used to be ill, which prevented her doing it - she was beat for not doing it; they all beat her in turns, and sometimes the forewoman beat her - I have seen them beat her; the other prisoner was the forewoman, her name is Robinson; they sometimes beat her with a rod, a cane, or a slipper - the daughter has taken her out of the frame, and knocked her on the floor, taken her up and knocked her down again; I never saw her punish her in any other way.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever recollect seeing a pail of water in the place? A. Yes - it was brought into the back room to wash the stairs with, and the daughter took her up by the heels, and dipped her head in twice, and then Robinson said, "Take her up, dip her in again, and finish her;" that only happened once - she used to cry, and ask mistress for food. but she did not get it; mistress used to say it was no use for her to cry, for the more she cried the longer she should be without it - mistress kept a dog, and the food for it was brought from Gray's Inn-lane; the son had some pigs; the man who misled them used to have the wash from the tavern, and when that has been brought for the dog I have seen Colpit, Foster and Howse take and eat it- there used to be sometimes bits of fish and bits of mutton chops in it, and they used to take it out and eat it; they took Colpit and Proctor to Judd-street one day to a doctor - I never saw a doctor come to the house to them at all.</p>

               <p>Q. How often were you washed or cleaned? A. We used to sluice our faces in the morning - our linen was changed sometimes once a fortnight or three weeks;

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where have you been since you left the prisoners' house? A. At Cripplegate; I have not talked this over much there - Mr. Metcalf, the churchwarden, asked me about it, and I spoke to the mistress of the school about it, but not to any body else; the mistress only asked how I laid, and what victuals I had - I did not tell her or the churchwarden the whole story; I told the rest at Hicks'-hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not stated a great many more things of consequence at Hicks'-hall, than you told the churchwarden? A. Not a great many more; I went to church once when I first went to the prisoners, and only once - when I first went there I went on a great many errands; I went to the City for cotton - none of the other girls went; sometimes the mistress went herself; we have not had tea since the victuals was taken off - I do not know what month that was in; we have never had tea since that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been treated with some kindness yourself by the daughter? A. When I first went there they said I should be forewoman over the girls; she did not buy fruit for me: I have had fruit given me by my friends, who have come to see us - nobody came to see me for six months, till a fortnight before I left, when my two sisters came; they are grown up: Colpit's grandmother came to see her - none of the others have got friends, except Howse, who has a sister; nobody has called for a long time, except Colpit's grand-mother, to my knowledge - three of the children have no friends at all; there were eight: four of them came a month after I got there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the same number at the time you were moved, as before? A. No, one was dead; Harris has got a father and mother, and she went to her friends.</p>
               <p>Q. Some of the little girls were dirty in their habits, were not they? A. Proctor used to wet her clothes, because they would only let her go down in the yard at meal hours.</p>
               <p>Q. She could have avoided that, though not allowed to go down? A. Yes.</p>

            .

Yes, sometimes she let us go to bed, and sometimes she kept us up all night - she did so for two nights running; we had breakfast sometimes - I do not know particularly at what time; it was a bit of dry bread, and sometimes a drop of milk and water: if we had not done breakfast in ten minutes she would say she would take it away; when we had no breakfast we sometimes had potatoes, and sometimes we had none at all: once we had nothing to eat all day, from the time we got up till we went to bed- when we had breakfast we had no potatoes given us: we sometimes had meat once a fortnight; this short food began about three weeks after we were bound; we had been on liking first, and were fed very well then; I remember Colpit coming - she was in very good health when she first came; she afterwards became sick and ill- that was about five weeks after she first came; she complained of a pain in her side, and sometimes of the head-ache; she used to tell the prisoners so, and Mrs. Hibner used to say, "Never mind, you must do your work" - she did not wear stockings; I knew of her feet being had, and I told mistress of it - they were had a good while before I told mistress of it; she first told me they were bad in the winter: I told mistress of it - she said, "Never mind, you must wait a bit, for I have not got time to go down to her" - I complained to her again the same afternoon, and she said, "Never mind, she must lay there;" she was lying in the back room then, and confined to her bed, and had been so about a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to your mistress after that about her feet? A. Yes, and then she gave me a cup of bread and milk poultice to put to them; she had been unable to do her work for a good while.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember at any time while she was so ill, her being told to clean the stairs? A. Yes, the daughter told her (there was a pail of water there - Colpit did her tambour-work wrong), and she did them, but could not quite finish them; she fell down on the stairs, and said she felt so weak she could not do them - she was taken up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090027"/>stairs, flogged well, and sent down again to do them; the daughter took her up stairs - I went up stairs, for I had to fetch her up; I saw the daughter flog her with a cane and a rod: she beat her a good bit - she took her clothes up to beat her: she sent her down to finish the stairs, and she made water on the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What made her do it there? A. Because she was not strong enough to go down stairs; she had her nose rubbed in it - the daughter did it: I have seen her taken by her clothes and dipped into a pail of water, a good many times; that was on the day the stairs were cleaned; the daughter dipped her in - it was after the flogging: Robinson was there, but mistress had gone out; her head was dipped into the pail five times - Robinson said,"Dip her in again, and that will finish her;" this was about seven weeks before she was taken away - it was since Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you, since October last, seen any body beat Colpit? A. Yes, the forewoman did, and sometimes the mother; she was beat very often - they beat her with a slipper: I have seen a slipper, a rod, and a cane used to beat her, because she did not do her work right, as she complained of a pain in her inside; they beat her sometimes at night, and sometimes in the middle of the day: she was working all day - I sat near her at the frame; she was in the middle of us; there were four girls between me and her at the frame - she could not do her work, she was too ill. We all slept on the floor, sometimes in the work room and sometimes in the back room; when we slept in the work room we had nothing but a blanket under us, and one over us; it was very thin, and we were very cold - Colpit was covered the same way as we were.</p>
               <p>Q. Your mistress kept a dog; were you the little girl that used to fetch the errands? A. Yes; I fetched the victuals for the dog from where Hibner's brother kept pigs, in Gray's Inn-lane; I used to bring it in a little wooden sieve - it was hog-wash, and came out of the tub the hogs feed in; at times there were little bits of fish and bones in it - I used at times to eat it myself, and so did Colpit - we all used to eat it, because we were so hungry; I was the cook, and used to boil the potatoes -I used to get 6lbs., and sometimes 3 1/2lbs.; eight of us and the forewoman eat of them; we had nothing but potatoes; the forewoman used to have a red-herring sometimes - mistress and her daughter dined by themselves.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The forewoman lived as you did? A. Sometimes. I now live at Cripplegate workhouse, and am now very well - all the girls are there now, except those who are dead; they are all pretty well now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did people frequently come to the house since October? A. Not very often: a man came with milk - nobody else brought food to the house: I used to fetch the coals: I used to be put up stairs with the others, when the prisoners went out; sometimes when they were out some of us went out, but we dare not go far, for fear they should come back - I knew my way to the workhouse: we never went there while we lived at the prisoners - we never went to church.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of the children's friends did you see there? A. Colpit's grandmother and sometimes Ellis' mother and father came - that was about five weeks ago- the prisoners were there then, and the girls at home; we used to eat the dog's victuals every day - it used to be put in two large tubs, but it was brought to our house in a sieve.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. What became of you on Sundays? A. They used to send us down to bed; we were locked in the room, and could not come out -

             - I lived at the prisoners about a twelvemonth; since Michaelmas last we sometimes used to have one meal a day - sometimes we used to get up at three o'clock, and go to work directly; sometimes we used to work till one o'clock, and sometimes till twelve - we used to have half a slice of dry bread, and sometimes we used to have milk and water, and sometimes none; when we had breakfast we did not have dinner on the same day; when we had dinner we sometimes used to have potatoes - Colpit was fed in the same way; she used to say she could eat a bit more: she did not get it; when she first came she had good health - she began to get ill after the alteration of our food.</p>
               <p>Q. After she became ill was she required to get up and work in the same way as before? A. Sometimes she used, and sometimes she used not, because she was not well; when she did not do her work she was beat, sometimes by Robinson, sometimes by mistress, and sometimes by the daughter; she was beat with a rod and a cane - I remember her being desired to wash the stairs - she was ill at that time, and was so weak she could not wash them; she was dipped into the pail of water by the daughter - Robinson was in the room, and said, "Take her up again and finish her." On Sunday we were down in the kitchen, locked up; we sometimes at night laid on the floor of the work room, with a blanket under and a blanket on the top of us - we all eight laid together - we laid in that way all the cold weather.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined Q. What do you mean by saying sometimes you had only one meal a day, then sometimes you had more? - A. Yes; when we entered we did, but not very often - we sometimes, since October, had more than one meal when we earned it; the second meal was potatoes; we had no tea; we had milk and water in the morning, that was all; we only had milk and water of an evening three times while we were there - the daughter gave me an orange when I was coming to my mother - that was a good while before I was taken away; it was a little after I was bound; I, Colpit, and Proctor had gin and water sometimes, because we were weak; that was not long ago - Robinson took me to the doctor's in Judd-street, and the daughter took me once - Colpit went with me; it was about three months ago; we had no oranges then - they gave us physic - we were left in the house about five o'clock one evening, when the prisoners were out; it was not long ago - Robinson's mother was then in care of the house; I do not recollect it being left without her - I do not recollect any of the girls going out while the prisoners were out - I did not know my way to the workhouse; I do not recollect anybody but the milkman calling at the house - I have a mother - I went to see her twice after I was bound.</p>

             in bed in the back parlour, No. 13, Platt-terrace, St. Pancras-road: I found her in a very emaciated state indeed, with sores on her toes, which were in a state of mortification: I then requested she might be removed to the St. Pancras Infirmary, which was done; when we got her there, I examined her minutely - I found the body extremely attenuated, with a slight cough, the toes mortified, some of them about separating at the time; all the toes on the left foot, except one, partook of mortification, and the right foot was in the same state, but was the worst. I attended her till Sunday, the 15th of March, when she died, in St. Pancras infirmary: after her death I examined her body, with two other medical gentlemen; there were abscesses on the lungs, with tubercles covering the lungs, a slight inflammation of some of the abdominal viscera and stone in the left kidney: her death arose from abscess on the lungs - that was the approximate cause, in conjunction with the mortification of the toes - I have heard two of the children examined - and have no doubt these tubercles might be produced by the treatment described, and want of food. I attribute the mortification of the feet to the want of food and necessary exercise - cold and wet would be an exciting cause - the disease might have been in the lungs a long time; the tubercles had been going on a long time I have no doubt; she had a bruise on the right eye, and some bruises on the right arm particularly - I should not think them produced by very violent blows.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you surgeon to the parish officers? - A. I am surgeon to the Directors of the parish. The mortification of the feet was not an exciting cause of the disease in the chest - I should hardly expect that had caused death: it might eventually have done so, but it might have been removed: many causes produce abscesses in the lungs, but these could not have been formed for any length of time, or there must have been puerile expectoration, which there was not; the inflammation might have been going on for a great length of time; the prisoner consented to her being moved to the Infirmary directly I requested it.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. When did you first observe expectoration of matter from the chest? A. In about ten days.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Oxenden-street. I saw this child twice while alive - it was in a dreadfully emaciated state; I examined the body after death; there was extensive disease on the chest, a vast number of tubercles; on the abdomen several patches of inflammation, in the kidneys a stone, and the toes mortified- the death was caused by abscesses of the lungs, together with mortification of the feet; tubercles were formed in the lungs; ill treatment, and the want of food, are very likely to produce those consequences - if tubercles had been formed in the lungs, the treatment described would produce such excitement as to accelerate death, as it would bring them into action.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are a member of the College of Surgeons? A. I am; I cannot give any date to the commencement of the disease in the lungs, or say how long the ulceration or tubercles had been formed; the mortification of the toes alone, in the state I saw them, could not have produced death - subjects dying from diseased lungs generally die in a state of great emaciation; exposure to cold is the most general cause of the disease, and most likely was so in this case.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Has it happened that persons in the lowest condition of life, who have been all their lives in workhouses, have been much under your care? A. Very much; they are very often the children of diseased and weak parents, and more liable to consumption than any other complaint - commencing at times in early life, but generally at an advanced period; every thing which occurs to them has doubtless a tendency to increase these symptoms. I think dipping her head two or three times into a pail of water very likely to bring the tubercles into action, and form abscesses.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Brewer-street, St. Pancras. I was called in to see the deceased after she was in the Infirmary - I found her in a very emaciated state, and her feet mortified: I examined her after death, and she had abscesses on the lungs, calculus in the kidney, and a slight inflammation in the abdomen.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing inflammation to have taken place in the lungs, and tubercles to have been there, what, in your opinion, would have been the result of dipping her head into cold water as described? A. It would aggravate the disease and produce ulceration; my opinion is, that she died from abscesses in the lungs, which would have been aggravated by the treatment she received, and by dipping in water; the want of food and proper clothing would accelerate it.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Chettle. On Wednesday morning I took the meat from my master's to Mr. Wood's, and as I went I met Brown at the corner of Shoe-lane - I never saw him before; he asked me for a situation - he was dressed as a butcher; and as we went along he asked me if Mr. Chettle wanted a man - he continued with me till he got to Wood's, and wished me good morning; he saw me go in there with the meat.</p>

            . I am landlord of the King's Head public-house, Newington. I know Brown - he came on Wednesday, the 11th of March, and brought a tray with some beef and mutton in it; two of them came in and asked me to buy it, at four o'clock in the afternoon - I said I did not want it; I bought a piece of beef and mutton of him - it was part of a rump of beef and saddle of mutton- I sent him next door to Mr. Scott's to weigh it; it was claimed on Sunday morning by Myers, the officer - it was delivered to him on Sunday about two o'clock; I did not know Brown before - I saw him at Bow-street on the Monday - I believe him to be the man; I am certain of him.</p>

I had been after a situation, and as I came back I met the man with the tray, and asked if he knew of a situation; he said his master wanted a man -I left him in Fleet-street, and thought I would go back to Mr. Chettle's, but met another butcher, who told me of the same situation, but advised me not to go for it, as Mr. Chettle was always changing; he went into a public-house and sent me after the meat - I accompanied him over to Houghton's, where some of it was sold.</p>

On the 11th of February I saw the prisoner on one side of the bridge - I was on the other; that is not far from Stapleton and Minnett's houses - I saw him kill one duck; he knocked it down backwards - it quacked three times, and then died; it was in the water; he went in and took it out - it was a white duck; I do not know whether it was Stapleton's or Minnett's: there were seven ducks in all - they killed three, but I only saw him kill one; he looked under the arch, saw me, and then ran away - he was taken on the Saturday week afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What did you know me by? A. By your coming to my aunt's; I never spoke to you, but I saw your face plainly.</p>

               <p>Q. This was in open day-light? A. Yes - it is a public place; there are not many men employed there on Sundays - I live opposite, and go in so often that I cannot tell what I went for.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Is there a place for the public to go through? A. No - it is not a public passage - the window looks into the yard.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. On the 20th of March, at a quarter-past six o'clock in the morning, I was going to work, and met the prisoner, in company with two others, coming down Lisson-grove; the prisoner had a scraper in his hand - I followed him to Portland-green; he went into the carcase of a house, and the other two stood outside; I went and asked the prisoner what he had got; he said a scraper, which he got from his father's, in Portland-town; an officer then came up, and took him; I looked, and found the scraper concealed; when I first saw him he was about a hundred yards from the prosecutrix's.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 1st of March, I went into the lost, and observed one of our sacks with some corn in it, concealed under some chaff in the chaff-room; there was about a bushel or a bushel and a half of corn in it - it was of the same sample as ours, and of a very good quality indeed; we keep our corn in the counting-house, and a proper quantity for use is taken out every day - I took two pieces of Spanish liquorice out of my pocket, put them into the sack among the corn, and left it there; I went the next morning, and saw the sack in the same place, but did not then examine it - on the Monday evening I spoke to the officer; about nine o'clock that evening he went into the premises - I showed him the sack and the corn; he marked the sack so that he should know it again - on the Tuesday morning he came to my premises early, to watch; about eight o'clock, when White was gone to breakfast, I went into the lost, and found the sack as I left it, under the chaff; about nine o'clock Hart came with a cart, from Forder Mellish, at Edmonton, and began loading some dung in it - he was in the habit of fetching dung from our premises; when he went out of our yard, and crossed the road, I observed a sack, containing something similar to corn in it, behind the cart; I went into my lost - the corn was gone, and the sack thrown carelessly over a partition in the chaff-room - I went to the King's Head public-house, in Kingsland-road, and there the cart had stopped; the sack which I had seen behind it was gone - I said to the officer, "No doubt it is gone down the yard;" we went down, and saw Hart standing against Woodham's stabledoor - the officer said to Hart, "What have you done with the corn which you brought?" I went down the stable,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090033"/>and at the bottom there is a little dark room, where Woodham was; I found the corn, but no sack of mine on the premises: I told Woodham they did not sell such good corn as that, and if it was mine, there were two pieces of Spanish liquorice in it - I found one piece of Spanish liquorice in it, and said to the officer, "Take this;" Woodham replied, "Yes, it is very easy for you to say that - you might have put it in," or something like that; the money for the dung belongs to my two carmen, but White takes it for them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. Was it not a return cart? A. I do not know; I believe it had brought potatoes to town - they generally come in sacks; when the sacks are emptied they are generally put into one sack, and placed on the copse, not on the tail of the cart; White was not to keep the money for the dung - my sack was left in the chaff-room; I found no sack of mine where the corn was found at last.</p>

On the 2d of March, about nine o'clock in the morning, I went into the lost, and saw this sack of corn, which I marked; on Tuesday morning I was placed in a room near the stable - Hart and another man came in, and loaded the dung close to the stable; as soon as they had arranged some bags, White went into the lost - he was there eight or ten minutes; and then came down again; Hart and the other man were then loading the dung, and when they had loaded and trimmed the cart, they got down, and I saw Hart bring a sack from the stable door, with something in it - he went to the tail of the cart, and immediately I saw White and Hart leave the tail of the cart; Hart then drove the cart off; White went into the lost again, and staid, three or four minutes - he then went out of the yard after the cart; I sent for a young man to watch the cart - we went on to Pitfield-street, but the cart was gone; we went on to Kingsland-road, and saw the cart and Hart with it; Mr. Smith, who had got there before me, said, "The corn is gone;" we went into the stable, and found Hart just within the stable door - I said, "Where is the corn and sack you brought in here?" Hart said, "I brought none;" we took him down to the bottom of the stable, and there found Woodham - I said, "Where is the corn and sack this man brought in?" he said he brought none; the room was dark, but Mr. Smith stepped aside, and opened the door, which put us all in the light directly; we saw some corn in a bin - Mr. Smith said, "This is mine, and I will swear to it - you have not such corn in your place: if it is mine there are two pieces of Spanish juice in it;" he turned the corn up, and one piece came up; Woodham said, "I dare say you put it there;" I said, "How dare you speak so to a respectable tradesman?" Mr. Smith said"Never mind, Vann, there is another piece in it;" I looked and found it - I asked Mr. Smith whose stable it was; he said, "It belongs to Mr. Milledge, who keeps the King's Head" - this is the corn.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say you lost sight of the cart? A. Yes, I did; I did not see the other man again who had been with it.</p>

            . I am a stone sawyer, and work for Mr. Smith. The cart was backed down to the dung-heap; the old man; who was helping Hart, got up, and threw out some sacks from the cart - he threw one bundle of sacks near the stable-door; I then went into the stable and saw White emptying something out of a sieve, but what it was I could not see; I went to my work, and when the cart was loaded, I saw Hart and another man drag a sack out of the stable; he put it up behind the cart, and then another sack, with something in it, which appeared to me to be empty sacks - I saw the sacks at the back of the cart; it went away, and I saw no more.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then it is true that the boy was let go twice? - A. He was; I did not know these other boys - it was so dark, that unless there was something very white about a person, you could not see them - if the bundle had not been white, I do not think I should have seen it; I believe the witness went to the watch-house, but I am not positive - she was certainly present when the boy was liberated once; it was so dark, that I should not be surprised at a person not knowing any one they had not seen before - I did not see the bundle dropped; the other boys passed in the same direction.</p>

            . I am the watch-house-keeper of Paddington, and live just opposite the watch-house. I heard of this robbery about half-past seven o'clock, and then saw the prisoners passing very hastily by with each a bundle, which appeared to me to be linen; Williams resembled a young man against whom I had a warrant, and pri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090037"/>I sent two officers after them, but they were not taken; on the following evening, a few minutes before twelve o'clock, I took up Sturdy; when they passed, Williams had a blue frock-coat on, and Sturdy a drab frock-coat - and there was left on the fence of Mr. Hogg's garden this piece of a coat, which I produce; it is exactly similar to the one Sturdy had on - but when I took him he had a dark coloured coat on; I took off Sturdy's shoes, and said,"Are these the shoes you had on when you were there?" or something to that effect; he said they must be, for he had no others; I went to the place where some persons had got over the wall, and these shoes exactly fitted several footmarks that were there; there appeared to be the footsteps of two other persons or more - but these I traced across some tulip beds, and other soft ground, to where the persons had got over; a piece of the paling was broken down in getting over; I went with Stowell to apprehend Williams - Stowell ordered him to pull off his shoes - we went and fitted them to a number of marks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined Q. Are they right and left shoes? A. No; this one has been worn on the left foot - it is a common size; Sturdy kept out of the way till the second day; I think there had been no rain at that time; the shoes were quite dry;

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it a shawl? A. It was like a blue pocket-handkerchief; they were small bundles; I was not taken out of the Police-office to be spoken to by any one; I had often seen the prisoners about the door - their bundles were about the size that one person could carry; it was rather a dull morning; I do not believe there was any rain on that or the next day.</p>

            . I am an officer of Mary-le-bone. I went and saw the ground; I went to the back of Williams' house, took these shoes off his feet and matched them with the marks on the ground - here are three or four nails on this side which were marked exactly; there is a mark where his toe slipped on the rails, and a mark where these nails scraped the mud in jumping over the wall; Williams said he might as well he transported for this as for any other offence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say he might as well be transported for any other offence as this? A. I think his words were, "I may as well be transported for this as for any other offence;" I will not swear it; his house is not far from the prosecutor's - the two gardens go towards each other; he might have gone towards his own house, and I think he did; there was a poor woman there who went into fits, and said something which I do not think right to repeat here; I searched his house and Sturdy's, but did not find any property belonging to the prosecutor.</p>

I took the prisoner on the 31st of March, in the afternoon; he told me he lived at No. 22, Cecil-street, but when I inquired there they said he was to have gone there the next day - I searched his box, and found this little bottle of scent, this box, and this powder; he went with me, and gave me the key of it - he told me, in English, that it was a young man who went with him, and before Mr. Halls he said that the young man gave them to him on the Sunday.</p>

               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you tell your father and mother the prisoner gave you these things, before the trousers were found on you? A. No; I only told Casey - I afterwards told Mr. and Mrs. Davis.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was waiting at the corner of Liquorpond-street to cry the hour of nine -I heard something called; I went up slowly to the place, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor scuffling - I went up to them, and the prosecutor gave him into my charge; on the way to the watch-house the prisoner said that two boys took the handkerchief from the gentleman's pocket, and made off.</p>

            . I am beadle of Mile-end Old-town. -In consequence of information, on the 26th of March, I went to the prisoner's house; (before that the after-birth of a child had been produced to me) - she was lying on the bed- I asked her if she had not had a child; she denied having been in the family way at all; I questioned her for nearly half an hour - she still denied it; I said I was sure a child had been born - she then admitted having been in the family way, and said she had taken a quantity of savin for the purpose of causing abortion: I told her I was confident it was a full grown child - she still denied having had a child. I made a search, but found nothing; I went on the next morning, Friday, and found Mr. Carruthers there, and made a further search - I searched some garden-pots on the ledge of the window, and in the mould I found a portion of a child's skull in one, and another portion of a skull in another; I searched the fire-place, and found a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090041"/>number of bones, which were materially burnt - Mr. Carruthers was present: I saw the prisoner again next day - I neither threatened nor promised her any thing; I sat down by the side of the bed, and asked her how she could be guilty of so enormous a crime - she said in order that no one should have a knowledge of it; I asked her if she had cut the child into pieces - she seemed to shudder at the idea of that, and said No, she had cut the child's head off and the body was burnt - I could not tell whether it was born alive, nor did I ask her; she mentioned who was the father of the child; I then asked if he had influenced her in any way to make away with the child - she said No, no one had any knowledge of her being in the family-way, exclusive of herself. On Monday evening she was removed to the poor-house.</p>

            . I am a surgeon of Mile-end-road. On the 26th or 27th of March I was in the prisoner's presence with Stone; she was in a very weak state - I asked her if she had not been recently delivered; her reply was she had not; I gave her to understand that I was a medical man, and pressed her not to conceal it from me: she continued to deny it - I saw the after-birth, and her still denying it led me to apply my hand on the abdomen, and the uterus had not contracted, which satisfied me there had been a recent delivery; she persisted in not having had a child, and I left her - I went again; I had not entered the room two minutes before Stone, the beadle, came: I saw him find in the flower-pots something, which I washed - it was the greater portion of the head of a child - it had the appearance of having been burnt; Stone afterwards searched the fire-place; I took the bones from him - there was one human infant rib: a portion of the bones of an infant thigh, and some small bones which I could not distinguish - I am positive those were the bones of an infant; she no longer denied having a child, and I asked her if the child cried - she said that it did not,and that it fell from her; she then said she had laid the child in a box, and it remained there till the Wednesday night(she was delivered on the Tuesday morning), when she took it out of the box, and burnt it; she said no person knew of her being in the family-way but herself; it is impossible, from what I saw, to state whether it was born alive or not.</p>

            ; he dined at home, and went out; he returned, and went out again; he returned home about half-past one o'clock in the morning - I do not know the day of the month, it was the morning on which he was found dead - he was accompanied by the prisoner; my master was not in a state of considerable intoxication - he and the prisoner afterwards took some port wine in the parlour; I brought some cold meat for the prisoner to eat; after some time it was proposed that he should go to bed - an attempt was made to get him up: the prisoner assisted to lead him; he and the prisoner fell down, and it was arranged that he should sleep on the floor of the room - I brought down some bed clothes, put a pillow under his head, and made preparations for the prisoner to sleep on the floor also; I left the parlour between two and three o'clock - there was no male person in the house except Dr. Dennis; I and the rest of the family went down into the kitchen - we determined to remain up all night; while I was leaving the room the prisoner asked me "At what hour;" I understood him to mean at what time I would call him, and it was agreed that I should call him at seven o'clock or a little after: while we were in the kitchen I heard a noise, as if a person had raised himself, or was going to get up - I went into the parlour at seven o'clock in the morning, and observed that the street door was unbarred; I know it was barred the night before, and the lodgers were in bed - I went to the parlour, and found that wide open; my master was lying in the middle of the floor, on his back, about a yard and a half farther into the middle of the room than I had left him, and he was not on the same pillow on which I had left him - he took snuff, and the pillow I had put his head on the night before was stained with snuff, from the former nights, and the one I found him on was not so - he had laid down in his clothes, but on uncovering him I found his clothes were taken from him, and carried away; his coat, waistcoat, hat, and stock had been taken away - I found him dead; I saw the prisoner next morning, and have no doubt of his being the man.</p>

            . I am waiter at the Cock and Lion public-house, Wigmore-street. I know the prisoner- I saw him at our house on the 25th of March, at half-past seven o'clock in the morning; he came in, and had a coat on his arm, and a hat doubled up in his grenadier's cap; he produced two bottles out of his pocket, one full of wine and the other half full; he sat down, and called for half a gill of vinegar, which he drank - he then got up, pulled his regimentals off, put on the coat, hat, and stock, and left his regimentals in my care, promising me that he would be back by ten o'clock for them; he went out at half-past eight, and did not come back - I found him next morning in custody; I took his regimentals to the watch-house, and gave them to the officer.</p>

I have a coat, waistcoat, stock, hat, a pair of gloves, and a handkerchief, which I took off the prisoner, on the Wednesday night, when I found him in the Birdcagewalk barracks; I went to apprehend him in consequence of Mr. Neale's death - he was confined in the guard-house- I called him by name, and began to pull these clothes off; he asked what I was going to do - I said to take him back to the barracks; he was a little in liquor, and resisted the clothes being taken off; one of the serjeants said he was in the civil power, and must submit: he then said,"Then I am a lost ruined young man;" I said, "Young<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090042"/>man, do you recollect going home with a gentleman last night?" he hesitated, and said, "No. I went home with no gentleman;" he said he was with three girls in Oxford-street: when I got him to the office I said I took him for the murder of a Mr. Neale last night - he said, "Good God, I murdered no gentleman last night - I can prove where I was;" in the morning he asked me if the gentleman was dead - I said he was; he asked if the Inquest had sat - I said it had not, and told him he had better say nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time did you take him? A. About nine o'clock in the morning - he was not sober.</p>

I said I did not know; he said, "If you take my advice you will never go back again - you will get severely punished - I will give you these clothes; make the best of your way out of the country, and never come back again."

On the morning of the 23d the prisoner went out about ten o'clock, and asked me for the key, which he took with him, and went away; he returned between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, and called me down to make a fire in the counting-house; there had not been a fire there for about five or six weeks before - I made it myself; there had been no fire there after that; the prisoner put the chips on. I fetched the coals, and be put a lighted candle to it to light it - he then went out, and said "Joe, I am going out for half an hour, mind the fire, and get some coals up," which I did; while he was gone Mr. Phillips came and inquired for him - I said he would be back in half an hour; Phillips came up into the counting-house and wrote a letter for him, which he gave me - master came home, and I gave him the letter; he looked at it, and went out again - he returned about half-past ten or twenty minutes to eleven o'clock; I was sitting by the fire, and as he was so late, about half-past ten o'clock, I put it out, by pulling the ashes from under the grate with my hands; I hollowed the fire out - from the grate. and I put it under, put the ashes over it, and my wife threw water on it, to take care that it was out; I went down in a quarter of an hour afterwards to see if it was all safe, and it was, there was not a spark; we had a fire in our own room that day, but I put it out directly I put his out - I make it a rule every night to put my fire out; my wife went to bed, and I sat up with a lighted candle in my bed-room till master came home; I took the candle away down to the counting-house when he came home - no part of my fire was in then; there was only one lighted candle in the building, and that was the one I had - there was no fire lighted any where in the warehouse that day, except the place I have mentioned; master let himself in - I came down stairs and went into the warehouse with a light for him; he then asked me to go to his brother-in-law Hart, in Holywell-street - before I went out the prisoner lighted his candle, and I put mine out by wetting my fingers - I know nothing of there being a light in the house then, except the candle Jacobs had; it is my firm opinion that there was no other light; I started for Holywell-street about twenty minutes or a quarter to eleven o'clock; when I was going the prisoner brought the candle in his hand to the warehouse door, and asked me if I could see my way down stairs; I told him I could, and said if he would he so kind as to give me the key I would let myself in when I came back; he said,"I shall he here when you come back" - he had nothing to do in the warehouse that night to my knowledge; he never slept in the warehouse - I went to Holywell-street and delivered a letter; I returned from there to the warehouse - I was gone about half or three-quarters of an hour; when I returned, I found the warehouse and factory all in flames, through the first-floor window, the counting-house window, which was under my bed-room; I saw no flames in my bed-room then - on the Sunday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090043"/>before the fire the prisoner sent me to Mr. Norton's, his solicitor; the fire was on Monday - he sent me about a fortnight before the fire happened for three pints of turpentine and a pint of linseed oil; I had it in a stone bottle; the oil was in a different vessel - turpentine is not used in the manufactory of glass, nor is oil - he did not say what he wanted it for; when I got it he put it on a board in the warehouse, next to the counting-house - on the Friday before the fire, I perceived a smell of turpentine; Jacobs was there, and he said, "I have been a d - d fool. I have been throwing the turpentine about the room like water;" I had said before that."Hey, hey, what is this?" and on the Saturday he said,"Fetch another quart of turpentine;" I fetched it in the same bottle, and put it in the same place as the other - whether it remained there I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. When you smelt it, could you discover whether any thing was sprinkled over the floor? A. I could not tell; it was not usual to sprinkle the floor with any thing - there had been no work going on at the factory for more than a month, but I cannot state the exact time: on the Sunday before the fire, I remember some cut-glass tumblers, decanters, and other things, being removed from the warehouse to the dwelling-house in a large basket - only one basket full was taken out that day; we took two or three out a fortnight or three weeks before - he took them into the private house, over the bridge, into the dining-room; there is no shop - people come on business to the warehouse door and see the goods in the warehouse; I cannot say what was done with the goods in the dwelling-house - some casks of potash were taken away, we use that in the manufactory; were removed about a week before the fire; there were six whole casks, and one three-parts full - they were sent to Mr. Whitehouse's wharf; there had been none sent before that time - I suppose each cask weighed 4 1/2 cwt., or 1/4 each - nine casks of cullet were sent away to the same place,(that is broken glass) each cask would contain 6 or 7 cwt., according to the size of the cask; I do not know what the value of that was - I have pawned goods for my master three or four months before the fire, and I redeemed part of them.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. How long is it since your master came to live in the house? A. I suppose six months, or three-quarters of a year; I have lived with him three or four years - the brick-wall of the house was run up before I came to him - he had to do the inside, and paint and plaster: the paint and some of the woodwork had not been finished - he was about completing that: turpentine and oil are used to make paint - he employed a painter and found the materials; I did not state at the office that there had not been a fire in the countinghouse for six months, nor that only ten casks were removed; they were moved in a cart without concealment; I believe he was going to move to Birmingham, but cannot say that: the pot-ash was good, and would not spoil the glass; there is no communication from the warehouse to the dwelling-house except across the draw-bridge, which crossed a yard - it was made of wood, and led from a door of the warehouse to a door of the house; I did not apply to Messrs. Pellatt and Green to buy the pot-ash - I applied to them about pots; my wife had a cough; she very seldom had a fire in the bed-room, for we had no coal nor money to buy any; my bed was about a yard from the fire-place; I am quite sure I put the fire out - I took the cinders quite out of the grate in the counting-house, put it clean out, and put water on it - I am positive I put both fires quite out; and I raked the ashes out of the fire-place in my own room, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>MR. PLATT. Q. What pots went to Pellatt and Green's? A. That was before Christmas; they had been used in business; they were made of clay - there were twenty-one of them: I believe my master sent me to ask if they wanted any, as they had such bad luck with theirs; they agreed to buy them - he was to have five guineas each for them; he was to have glass for the money - they are used for melting glass; there was no painting in the warehouse except the counting-house. that had been done some time before the fire, when they did the dwelling-house, and was quite finished two months before; I cannot say whether the house was finished; I had not seen the painters there for a good while before the fire.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you seen any about the time you bought the first turpentine? A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>MR. PLATT. Q. Do you remember the name of the man who painted the premises? A. No; I had lived in Phoenix-street three or four years, ever since it had been built - it then belonged to the prisoner's father; I was in his service at first - he left in about a twelvemonth; they were going to lay the floors of the warehouse when I first went; the shell of the dwelling-house was then building - it was not finished when the father left; the work then stood still for about a year and a quarter, or rather more - then the prisoner and old Isaac Jacobs carried on the business together - they were not related; I believe they began on the 1st of November, 1828, and in about a month Isaac left; the business has not gone on since, but I remained there till this happened; I sometimes had 15s. a week, sometimes only 6s. or 7s., but for the last two months I believe I had 10s.; I went on errands, and cleaned the pipes.</p>
               <p>Q. On Monday, the 23d. what goods were in the warehouse? A. None at all; on the Sunday before, what little were left were taken out of the yard, and put into the little room which looks into Hobson's-yard, and he ordered me to bring a door down from the next room to mine, and put it up against the window of that room which prevented people from seeing in - the goods there might he worth about 50l.; they were common things - I cannot say what was in the middle room, for it was locked up.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Are you positive there were no goods in the warehouse on the Monday? A. Yes; for we put them all into the little room, which is on the same floor as the warehouse: the door was not put up in consequence of glass being broken, there was not a square broken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did that window look into any opposite house? A. No; only into the yard; a person in the yard could not see into the room unless they went up a flight of steps.</p>

            . I live in Crown-street, St.Giles; the window of my room looks on the back-door of the prisoner's factory; I can only see part of the bridge from my window - I can see the door of the factory perfectly. On the night of the fire I was in bed, about a quarter to eleven o'clock; I heard a person go over the bridge rather<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090044"/>quick, to the factory door; he knocked very rapid at the door, and said, "Mrs. Davis, get up.' I thought it was the prisoner's voice, I have frequently heard him speak; but in my fright I cannot be certain it was his voice; the knocking and calling was repeated a second time - I got out of bed, threw the window open, and just saw the prisoner go from the door across the bridge; as far as I could see; I saw a man on the bridge - I said, "Good God! what is the matter?" he made no answer, but looked up towards me, and was gone; he came from the factory, and went into the dwelling-house - I am certain he heard my voice - I saw no smoke at that time, but smelt something all in a minute, as if it was turpentine or new paint; the place being newly painted, I thought it might he that -I called out Fire! two or three times as loud as I could; I called up my husband, went to the window again with him, and then the smoke was coming from the back part of the premises, whether it was from a window or not, I cannot tell - I saw the smoke not five minutes after I saw the man; I went to call my next door neighbour up, and when I came into the room I saw the flames, which came apparently from the back of the factory. on my side, not in Hobson's yard - I did not stop to look at it. the smell was so very powerful, and the room being full of smoke I was obliged to shut the window, and go into the next room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You could not distinguish the face of the man? A. No; he only spoke twice - it was like the prisoner's voice.</p>

            . On the night of the fire I lived opposite the prisoner's factory. I was going to bed about a quarter to eleven o'clock, and heard a female cry Murder! loudly - I opened the door as fast as I could, and saw Mrs. Davis in the second floor window, lying over the window; she was in something very light, or white, seeming like bed-linen - I heard her cry before and after I saw her; I saw no smoke in that room - I observed at that time, in the counting-house, under Mrs. Davis's room, a great flame and smoke; I could see into the counting-house, but not through it; at the same time I saw Mr. Jacobs' female servant standing in the street, with his two children in her arms; they were dressed in some light clothes - I cannot tell whether she had her clothes on - I gave an alarm, as no alarm had been given; there was nobody in the street, except the servant -Mrs. Davis was calling out of the window - the watch man came, and went for the turncock - I saw the prisoner about an hour or better after that; he asked if I had seen Mrs. Davis, or if Mrs. Davis was with me; I answered, "No, Sir; she is burnt, and you know she is burnt;" he said nothing to that - I saw the fire coming out of the counting-house window, and after that I saw smoke coming out of Mrs. Davis' room window; the floor of her room was burning; I saw it fall afterwards; I could not see what became of her - I heard her crying after I ceased to see her. On Friday night, the 20th of February, between seven and nine o'clock, I saw some barrels removed from the cellar of the factory; it was two hours being done - they were put into a waggon with a crane, and appeared heavy; I had seen a few goods removed before that, but did not take notice of it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You did not think it an extraordinary time to move goods? A. No, because I had frequently seen it done as late, when they were at work; Jacobs' servant was standing in the coach road, with the children - I did not see flames in Davis' room for a quarter or half an hour after I saw her at the window. I know Rose, the fireman of the Phoenix, he was not there till he was sent for - I was the person, who alarmed the watchman; a little hand engine came first - this was about a quarter of an hour after I saw the fire; I saw no ladder at Mrs. Davis'; window - I staid at my door till she left the window; a ladder was placed there, a good while after I got to my door, but where it came from, or went to, I cannot say; I saw it, and that was all - it was ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after I saw the fire in the counting-house; Mrs. Davis was gone from the window before I saw the ladder. but I could hear a faint voice - there was no engine there then, unless it was a little hand-engine; the fire had burst out of the counting-house window before any engine came, except the hand-engine - I heard the counting-house window break - whether the ladder or the fire broke it I cannot say; I did not see the prisoner at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear, that at the time you saw flames coming from the counting-house window, they were not at the same time coming from the window of Davis's room? A. That I swear; I see Mrs. Bailey every day, and may have talked to her about the fire.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. When you saw the fire, was there a good deal of smoke? A. Yes. a great deal of dark smoke, so that I could not see the window, except the flames.</p>

            . I live at No.3, Phoenix-street, and am a smith. I was alarmed on the night of the fire, about a quarter or ten minutes to eleven o'clock; I was dressed; I came out of the house, went to the warehouse-door, and saw a fire in the counting-house - there was no light at that time in the room above, Mrs. Davis was at the window of the room above, which was open, and a little smoke coming out, but no such great deal - I heard her shriek in distress, but what she said I cannot say; I tried to force the warehouse-door; two other persons assisted me, but we could not succeed - I helped several other persons to force the gates of Hobson's yard open afterwards, and succeeded in getting them open; they are under the counting-house window; and when we got them open, I observed something combustible flying from the counting-house floor, or the roof of the gateway, but what it was I could not see - there were cracks, and some holes in the boards; one hole was burning; and one hole enabled me to see through the floor into the counting-house; I observed fire, like rags, as if they had been lying there some time, simmering away; they were not in a flame, but red; I went through the gateway into the yard, and stopped on the ground, just looked round, and saw the prisoner; he came running in from the street - I said,"Mr. Jacobs, have you got the old people out?" meanin Davis and his wife; he said, "If the old people are out, I do not care any thing about the premises;" I returned, and went to the staircase of Mr. Hobson's workshops; I went about half way up the stairs, looked straight forward, and saw part of the three rooms and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090045"/>counting-house, and they appeared in one whole sheet of flames; I saw flames running along in different parts of the room; it was different colours, but what it consisted of I do not know - there were no flames in the second floor at that time; I am sure if there had been I could not have failed seeing them. from the situation I was in - I afterwards came down, went under the gateway, and there was still more of that stuff flying from the roof of the gateway; it appeared of some combustible material; it was on fire; it fell in drops, rebounded, and scattered - it did not appear like wood in flames; I passed through into the street; on arriving in the street, Davis' room was falling in - the roof was all falling in; this was in an hour and a half or two hours after I had been on Hobson's stairs - I had assisted to raise a ladder to the window before I went into the yard; it was not raised to Davis' window, but to the counting-house window first, and then nearly to the centre of the brick work, between her window and the counting-house, but was not long enough to reach her window; when the ladder was put there, Mrs. Davis fell back; several assisted me in putting the ladder there - I do not know who they were; I saw smoke coming from the house - it seemed a black smoke.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. At what time did you go to Hobson's stairs? - A. I cannot say exactly; I assisted in raising the ladder before that - I do not know whether the prisoner brought it out; I cannot say where it came from; a person went up the ladder, and came down.</p>
               <p>Q. On what part of Hobson's steps were you when you saw the fire all along the floor? - A. Near the centre; I do not speak of seeing the counting-house floor while I was there; I said the rooms appeared in a whole sheet of fire, but not that I saw the floor; Hobson's steps are covered over, but I could see from them; the covering is not all over them; I could see the window, and see whether the room was on fire or not; there was no fire on the second floor; I say the flames were all along the room, from the; counting-house - I saw no fire in Mrs. Davis' room then; I could not see the floor of the counting-house or warehouse from the steps; I saw it underneath.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was there a plastered ceiling to the gateway? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Point out the exact spot at which you saw the fire running? A. I stood under the gateway; Hobson's stairs are not in this model; the fire ran along the ceiling of the counting-house floor; the combustible matter fell under the gateway like a shower of hail - I cannot say whether it was glass melting; I never saw melted glass; the place I saw the fire running along was underneath this flooring - it looked like a train of gunpowder; it is only the floor and joists - when I say it ran along the floor, I mean underneath as well as the top; it was under the boards, which are the flooring; when I say boards, I mean flooring-boards; the flame ran under the boards, among the joists.</p>
               <p>Q. Now on your oath could you see underneath the boards from Hobson's staircase? A. I could see it where I was; I do not mean to say I was exactly on the centre step - I had, before that, seen flames from the counting-house window; it was broken with the ladder, and they burst out; I did not see the prisoner with the ladder-when I saw him in the yard he looked rather flurried, but not much; I did not see him do any thing to quench the flames; I was there within two minutes of the alarm - I stated before the Magistrate that I thought I heard a hissing; I could not tell exactly where it was, or when; I could not tell whether it was the hissing from the stuff that fell from the flames under the gateway - I was under the gateway when I heard it; I cannot say whether the second floor had been separated into two rooms; Davis' room is in front; Hobson's stairs are behind - I could see the flames from the counting-house and, warehouse, when in the yard; I could see right through: the partitions might have been burnt then.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are the side of the steps covered over? -A. No; they have a sort of hood.</p>

            . I am an oilman, and live in Great White Lion-street, about three or four streets from Phoenix-street. The neighbourhood was alarmed, and I went to Phoenix-street - I got there about eleven o'clock, and saw a great smoke; I opened the small door in the great gateway, and with the assistance of others we forced open the great gates; I saw all over my head a round hole, which appeared like a ball of fire like a star - I was cautioned to take care of the stuff which was falling through, but I did not observe it; there was a great light in the yard - I did not go through the gateway, only just within the gate; I then went to break open the warehouse door next to the gateway, and got it open with assistance - I saw the staircase on fire, burning upwards; that was the staircase opposite, at the extremity of the house; as I entered the door, the back part of it was burning - that was the farthest part from me; I saw no other part of the house on fire then; I came out again in about ten minutes, and saw it break out in the counting-house window (the stairs are at the back of the house) - there was no connexion whatever between the two fires; when I came out of the passage, some boys ran in - some persons swore at them, and told them to come out, and somebody shut the street door; I do not know who it was - I do not know the prisoner: I do not recollect seeing him there; when the flames broke from the first floor window, I observed that they gave a round turn, and went up to the two pair - before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090046"/>that I had seen no fire on the second floor; the smoke was apparently black smoke, and there was a very unpleasant smell; my opinion at that time was, that it proceeded from turpentine, as if there had been turpentine thrown over the building - it struck me so by the blackness of the smoke, and by the smell; I staid there for an hour I suppose.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What distance do you suppose there was between the two fires, the one on the staircase, and the other in the counting-house? A. Full six yards of clear space.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any flames from the bed-room window, over the counting-house, at all? A. I saw no light there whatever, nothing but smoke; I saw the ladder raised, and saw a person go up the ladder - it was not the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a fireman to the Phoenix-fire-office. I was at the fire on the night in question: I got there about a quarter or ten minutes before eleven o'clock; mine was the first engine there - I live within two hundred yards of the place; I was employed with other people in getting my engine ready, which took ten minutes or a quarter of an hour - when I first got there, there was no fire to be seen at all, but a great quantity of smoke issuing across the street; I had a very bad cold, and did not smell any thing - I observed the flames break out from the first floor, over the gateway first, and immediately after that from the second; I was just screwing my branch on as the flames came from the window - I worked the engine; I saw the prisoner there as soon as I got into Phoenix-street, before I got my engine ready; he asked me to render all possible assistance; I told him I would - he wished me to bring the branch through the passage of the dwelling-house, to save that from getting on fire - I did so, and threw the water into the side of the door-way of the warehouse to the wooden bridge; the dwelling-house was not the least injured; he came to me a second time in about twenty minutes, and assisted to take the house through the passage; I have examined the premises since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ALLEY. Q. He did every thing he could to assist you to put the fire out? A. I considered so; mine is a small engine - it arrived before the flames burst out; I thought the dwelling-house in danger: my engine and another were at work on it for an hour.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. When you got there was there smoke? A. Yes, a great quantity, issuing from the premises; I did not get to the back till my engine was ready- I saw fire dropping through the flooring under the gateway.</p>

            . I am a Sheriff's follower. I was put in possession at Jacobs'; on the night of the fire I went in near eight o'clock - I went into the back parlour of the dwelling-house, and some time after I had been there I saw the bridge which leads from the dwelling-house to the factory; I saw the prisoner that night between ten and eleven o'clock - he called his son out, and the door was shut; I think that was about half-past ten-his son is about twelve or thirteen years old; after he had spoken to his son he left the room I was in, and his son went with him; I heard footsteps on the bridge - the prisoner came to me in the back parlour, and said the premises were on fire - that might be four or five minutes after I heard the footsteps on the bridge; I assisted in getting a ladder out of the Back yard of the prisoner's premises - I did not assist to put it up; I went out at the front, and saw the ladder was up, and a person on it, who I thought was the prisoner, but could not be certain: my execution was for 90l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was not the prisoner's wife at this time confined to a sick bed? A. I heard so, but never saw her; the ladder was brought out to save a woman, who they said was in the house - he appeared anxious to save her, and, I believe, used all the means he could to save her, and to get the fire out; he sawed part of the bridge to prevent its coming to the dwelling-house: I think I saw the hose of the engine in his hand - I had seen no flames when he was getting the ladder out, but my business was to take care of the goods, and I did not leave the premises or go out of the street door; I stood on the step, and looked out - if there had been flames when the ladder was raised, I think I must have seen it.</p>

            . I am a publican, and live in Crown-street. I assisted in breaking open the great gates of Hobson's yard, and observed in the roof of the gateway a liquid flowing from the ceiling - it was about a yard and a half from the ceiling, and there was a hole in the ceiling, through which was a great illumination: I had not then seen any flames in the front of the building - I did not help to raise the ladder; I saw people raising it - that was before I went under the gateway - I saw a person on it; I assisted in breaking open the warehouse door, after I had been under the gateway; I looked up the passage of the warehouse, and observed the staircase on fire - I saw that when I was in the street, and in the passage; I did not perceive any flames in the front part of the building at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You merely say you did not see any fire in front? A. No; there was smoke from the second floor - it came from the first floor, but covered the window of the second, so that it could not be told which it came from; I have seen similar lights drop from a lamplighters'link.</p>

            . I have been a fireman thirty-seven years; I have seen the premises since they have been burnt, and have seen them compared with this model; the stairs on the ground floor are gone - they lead from the ground floor to the first floor; some of the stairs, leading down to the cellar are left - the upper ones are more burnt than the lower ones; there is a door on the top of the stairs, leading from the cellar to the ground floor, that door was burnt on both sides, and the door standing open; there were marks of the fire on the floor of the passage by the stairs, and a great many marks of fire near the top of the stairs, and the passage leading from the street to the manufactory - there was a door, leading into the re-weighing-room, which was very much burnt on the street side, but the inside of the door was not burnt; (looking at the model) here is the counting-house there are boards now remaining in front of the fire-place in the counting-house, there are nine feet; the fire-place before the holes are burnt through; the surface of the boards near the fire-place are burnt but very little; the floor of the room, looking into Hobson's yard, is all burnt except the joints - several holes are burnt in the floor of the room, between that and the counting-house; there is a brick wall from the ground, forming one side of the gateway - the fire on the under part of the floor, by the staircase, has burnt holes through; the greater part of the fire seems to have been below it.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the front ware-room, over the stairs? A. Yes; there are several other marks of fire on the first floor, and in other places - they are scorched, but in many parts they are burnt through; I have preserved two hundred and thirty-five feet of the floor of the second flooring, which is not burnt through - the under sides are burnt, but not the upper; the fire must have been below on the first floor and not on the second; I took the boards off the joists myself, and have had the care of them ever since - here is one of them (producing it) - I observed the grate in the counting-house; the cinders were most of them under the grate, and the others in it - I did not notice Davis' bedroom grate; none of the second floor remained except the joists.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You say the fire must have happened on the first floor, because the upper side is not burnt? A. Yes; it must have commenced in the lower room - the boards forming the second floor remained on the joists; I broke them off two or three days after - two hundred and thirty-five running feet of flooring boards were left, eight inches wide. I was present at the fire; I did not see the second floor fall - I saw only half of it down - the other half remained: we were prevented from taking it down till the bricklayers had lowered the wall: I remained in care of the premises till the 12th of March - I did not observe the grate of the second floor; I noticed the first, as I heard reports that the fire originated in the counting-house, and it was said the man did not rake the fire out. The remains of the deceased woman were found over the gateway; the spot was pointed out to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Must she not then have fallen through from the second floor? A. She might have rolled off, as every thing on the second floor must, as the joists gave way, and the floor laid slant; the part that fell was all burnt, more or less - part of the boards are here, but they were burnt enough to let the body fall; I did not see the whole joists, and cannot say whether they were burnt more by the bed than else where - I believe it was, but that part was moved in my absence; I did not go there to survey.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Are all the boards you have brought of the second floor burnt underneath, like the one produced? A. They are, and not burnt above.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you see any part of the bedstead found? A. No, I saw the screws of it - when I took away the second flooring, it was slanting: if they had fallen on the embers of the fire on the first floor, they would have been in the same condition.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Are the joists of the second floor burnt more underneath? A. Yes; the greatest weight on the second floor was on that part of the joists where the bed was, and had given way - there were a quantity of iron tools there.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Court of Requests. I had some warrants to execute against the prisoner the beginning of this year; I remember the night of the fire -I had been on the premises the Saturday before; I went into the warehouse, and every part of the warehouse except a room which was looked - I could discover no sort of property of any kind in the warehouse; I went to the premises again on the Monday of the fire - I went into the warehouse and counting-house also; there was a little room behind the counting-house, I could not get into that; there were two doors to it, one from the counting-house and one from the landing - they were both locked, and a square of glass was broken in the door leading to the counting-house, and a pasteboard against it; I removed that, and there was a quantity of baskets in the little middle room -I could only distinguish one to move it, that was empty; they were a sort of package hampers; I moved one to have a clear view inside the room - it partly afforded me a clear view into the room, but I could see no other property but the baskets; I went into the weighing-room on the left hand - I did not notice the rooms on the second floor; I saw in the inner room on the second floor some implements used in blowing glass made of iron; I saw no stock of any description on the premises; I have the warrants here, they are signed by the 
register.</p>


               <p>Q. When you moved the baskets, could you observe whether there was a window on the other side of the room? A. Not from there, but I went round the other side: on the landing, there was a square of glass broken in the door - I looked through, and discovered some boards against the window of the middle room, which was between that room and the one looking into Hobson's yard.</p>
               <p>The warrants being read, were to levy for the sums of 1l. 2s. 10d. and 1l. 9s. 10d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. There was a window broken? A. Yes; the boards were against the inner window; my warrant was not to seize the goods - but on a general view, the place appeared to me empty; there was a quantity of old harness, and a quantity of made-up glass in this room on the Thursday; I swear the warehouse appeared quite cleared out, and there were no goods in the counting-house; the warrants were for disputed wages between the prisoner and his partner; the middle room appeared full of baskets, about breast high; I cannot tell whether they were full or empty except one.</p>

               <p>"Mr. Jacobs, if I were in your place I would not go away;" he said, "I am not going, I am going to speak to my friend;" and stepped on one side - they turned round the corner, up Vinegar-yard, and walked about half way up together; I did not follow, but I could see them, as there was a gas light - and when they got about half way up, Jacobs ran away from Genese as hard as he could; I immediately went up through Bowl-yard into Broad-street, and saw Jacobs coming out of Lascelles-place at a very quick pace - I ran up as hard as I could - he crossed over by the coach-stand, and I lost sight of him; I went as far as Museum-street, but could see nothing of him; I went immediately turned back, and in returning I saw two cabriolets coming along at a great pace- I called to the first one to stop, it stopped; I looked into it, a gentleman was in it, but it was not the prisoner - and immediately after another came up at full gallop - I stooped it, and Jacobs was in it; I got on the step, and said,"Mr. Jacobs, I want to speak to you;" he begged of me not to stop him, as he was going off to his solicitor, he wanted him to see the Coroner before he went away; I said, "I want to take you to see the Coroner, the Corner wants to see you;" I took him out of the cabriolet; I had got hold of his arm as I was going along, and he begged of me to let him go, but I kept hold of his arm; nothing passed till we got to the house, and just as I went in at the door with him, we found Genese was sitting down in the bar - the Jury and Coroner were coming out; I told Mr. Stirling, in the prisoner's presence, the manner he went away, and he advised me to take him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did he tell you who his attorney was? A. Mr. Norton, of Jewin-street, he was going that way; I did not hear any reporter come out and advise him to go for his attorney; the verdict had been delivered.</p>
               <p>MR. THESSINGER. Q. Was the prisoner present during part of the Inquest? A. I believe so.</p>
               <p>HERBERT SPRING. I am a clerk to Whitehouse and Son, Wharfingers, of the City-road. On the Wednesday previous to this fire, the prisoner came and inquired the rate of carriage for cullet to Birmingham; he said he wanted us to take about five ton; I could not inform him then - he called again, and we were to fetch the goods next day; he was afterwards to call to see them weighed and direct them; he said, that when he was at Birmingham he was going to barter them for a large quantity of glass, which we should bring back; we sent for the goods next day, and sixteen casks came; it was on Thursday or Friday before they had all arrived; one of the carmen brought me this note (producing it); since the fire an order has been delivered to us for the goods, but we have kept them; they remain without direction.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you been in the habit of carrying for him? A. Eight or nine years, I believe; I have only been there four years; we have carried goods for him, on and off, during that nine, and have carried casks; he desired the goods should he fetched on Thursday, but whether we sent on Thursday or Friday I cannot tell; I did not go to his premimes myself; there was no concealment about it - our measure on our waggons; he particularly wished them fetched next morning, but they were not fetched till the afternoon; we received them all before dark.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. You do not know from what part of his premises they came? - A. No; our days for sending goods is Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.</p>

            . I am clerk to the Sun Fire-office. The prisoner first insured there on the 11th of December, 18th, and till Christmas, 1819; he commenced again on the 15th of March, 1820, which went to Lady-day, 1827; that was for premises in Charles-street, Soho - for furniture and stock, not premises; he effected an insurance on the 19th of March, 1827, which went up to March, 1828, for furniture in Hampstead-road; he insured, the premises in Phoenix-street while they were building, from Christmas 1825 to 1826 that was 700l. on the warehouse and manufactory, No., 18 Phoenix-street, and 300l. on the dwelling house No. 19: on the 10th of October, 1828, he proposed another insurance; here is a memorandum, which I believe is in his hand-writing - we granted him a policy for the ware-house and manufactory 1,000l. stock and utensils there in and goods in trust, 250l.; dwelling-house, 350l.,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090050"/>being 1,600l. together; he had proposed to insure, according to his own writing, for the warehouse and manufactory 2,000l., and the dwelling-house 500l.; he paid a premium, at the time of proposing, at 3 per cent.; Capon, the inspector, afterwards looked at the premises, to ascertain the risk - that was the condition of the deposit; it turned out, on inspection, to be at the rate of 7s. 6d. per cent., and he said he would have the amount reduced; it was effected at 1,600l.; on the 27th of January, 1829, he came to the office, and desired the following increase to his insurance; for fixtures and fittings in the warehouse and manufactory: 50l. stocks, utensils, and goods in trust; 550l. in lien of 250l., and we made the alteration; there had been no insurance before for fixtures and fittings - he made no addition to the amount of goods in the dwelling-house; the had insured 500l. on household goods and furniture, 50l. on jewels, and 50l. on glass, on the 10th of October, as being in Charles-street; and on the 6th of December we granted him a new policy for that amount as for the same goods in Phoenix-street, he having removed there; the whole amount insured was 2,550l., the old policy of the 10th of October was cancelled; all existing policies respecting premises were cancelled, and he received the usual note of the premium, having been paid; two new policies were prepared, according to the last proposal.</p>

            . I delivered him the note mentioned in this notice - I have the margin of it here, the entry on which was made in his presence; he paid for the building 1l. 8s. 8d. - 3l. 7s. being allowed on the old policy, making 4l. 15s. 8d., which was the full premium for the building, the amount being 1,350l. on the furniture and stock; he paid 3l. 6s. - 2s. 2d. being allowed, this is exclusive of the duty; both premium and duty were paid - the new policies were not executed till after the fire.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. In October, 1828, he proposed to insure for 2,500l., but your inspector, found them more hazardous than described? A. Yes - if he would have paid a larger premium I should not have objected to grant the policy, but he prefered reducing the amount; the removal of the goods to Phoenix-street is endorsed on the policy, dated December 6th - no additional premium was required, the risk not applying to the dwelling-house; the addition made in January was 350l. on stock and utensils - the old policies were cancelled, and new ones promised; I do not recollect that any mistake was made - he altered his mind while there, and made the stock 350l., and at first I think it was to be 450l. - he was well known to us in business.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did your surveyor report that the premises were worth 2,000l.? A. We did not survey as to value, but as to risk.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are these the tickets or notes you delivered out on that occasion? A. They are; the building is in the name of Moses Jacobs and others - we should expect him and others to prove their interest in the premises - no mistake was made: there was no dispute about the rate of insurance - we never had a 6s. premium.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON? Q. Do you know whether any body went from the office to ascertain the value of the premises? A. I do not - I believe he made a deposit at the rate of about 6s. per cent.; when I afterwards told him it was to be 7s. 6d. he desired me to insure for a less sum, which what he had paid would cover- he said he would not pay more for it, as there had been a dispute between him and his partner, that he had robbed him of a considerable sum, and he would not advance any more; I told him he could insure for 1.600l.; the difference would not he more than 40s.; I have no recollection of recommending him to pay the difference - there was 1s. 6d. in his favour, which was returned him.</p>

I acted as agent for the prisoner in effecting this mortgage for 1,500l. - the prisoner was desirous it should be completed; the negociation continued till the day of the fire - there was no backwardness on his part, quite the contrary; he was eager to effect it- nothing remained to be done but an inspection by the surveyor; the 1,000l. was to be paid to Mr. Hume - there is an under lease from the prisoner to Mr. Hume- it is a mortgage by demise; the mortgage would have been complete in two or three days, but the fire put an end to it.</p>
               <p>MR. PLATT. Q. This related to the building, not the stock? A. Certainly.</p>

            . I am a surveyor and auctioneer, and live in the Old Jewry. I surveyed the prisoner's dwelling-house and factory in June last - the dwelling-house was not then complete, but was more than a carcase; the value affixed to both was in anticipation of their being complete - the factory was finished, and about 150l. wanted laying out on the house; I valued them for a loan, and estimated them at 2,000l. as the value of the lease, and considered them well worth that; I valued them for the gentleman making the advance - I should think they would cost near 4,000l. building.</p>
               <p>MR. THESSINGER. Q. Of course you calculated the furnace? A. Yes - that is an extensive part; I looked at it as a whole - the furnace is fire proof.</p>

            . I live in Castle-street, Holborn, and am a surveyor. I went to the premises after the fire- the value of the stock in trade and utensils left there on the 23d of March I estimated at 384l. 1s. 9d; these were articles saved, and were on the premises; according to the appearance of the first floor, the fire I should think had originated about the staircase - the best part of the counting-house floor is left at this moment in a perfect state - all the flooring near the staircase is burnt; the floor leading from the counting-house to the bridge is nearly perfect - a person on the stairs in Hobson's yard could not see into the first floor; I went to the top of them on purpose to see - perhaps up the first three steps they could, but not on the fourth.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If there was an immense illumination on the first floor, he could see that? A. Just at the window; there is a sloping covering to the stairs.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Could he not take a straight view to the building? A. By no means, unless he could see through the slates; the bottom of the steps is about twenty feet from the end of the gateway - the covering on the steps prevents his seeing; he must stoop two feet -I do not mean to swear he could not see when up two or three steps; I went half-way up, and could not see then- I dare say the ceiling of the room could be seen in the yard; I valued the moulds, utensils, and working implements.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. There is a covering to the stairs? A. Yes - it is an inclined plain directly opposite the window; it is impossible to see the flooring or roof from the stairs.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was there to prevent his seeing the ceiling of the room was illuminated? A. Yes, in the yard, but not on the steps.</p>

            . I am a surveyor. I went to the premises on the 2d of March; I went on the first floor, and found some embers laying on the floor, and on those embers was what appeared to me to be the second floor; all the second floor appeared to me to have been burnt away - I looked at the grate on the second floor; there were a good many cinders in it - I mean the second floor room, where the deceased slept; I saw the great of the counting-house, but did not observe any cinders there -I went up the steps of Hobson's yard yesterday: they have a slant covering, which comes down exactly in the same direction as the steps - there may be a dozen steps; I could see the window from the top of the steps, by leaning over the side railing, but not without; it is impossible.</p>
               <p>MR. PLATT. Q. How many feet do you consider the steps from the back of the building? A. About fifteen-feet; the covering is about seven feet high.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Supposing it was a dark night, and there was a great light in the building, it would illuminate all the yard? A. I should think so - he could see a light coming from the window.</p>

            . I am a builder, and live in Upper Cleaveland-street Fitzroy-square: I was on the prisoner's premises before the fire - Mr. Jacobs asked me what I thought the fittings up worth; I said I would not fit them up for 100l. - the dwelling-house is not finished yet.</p>
               <p>MR. THESSINGER. Q. You did not fit up the factory? A. No; I was on the premises off and on for six months, I saw the fittings up; I speak of the counters, the fittings up of the counting-house, lockers, shelves, &amp;c. in the warehouse and weighing-room below, and the two rooms above.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is this paper signed by you? A. Yes - it is a specification for finishing the private-house; it is dated the 26th of June, 1828 - I was to do it for 187l.; I did 150l. worth - this amount does not include the painting.</p>

            . I am a painter. I entered into an engagement to paint the prisoner's house about the middle of February, within a fortnight of the fire - he was to find paint, turpentine, and oil; I saw him twice about it, and saw paint brushes and pots on the premises on the day I made the agreement - I was to do the work at 5s. 6d. a day and have two pints of beer; I went again on the following week, and he was at Birmingham as I heard; I ordered some turpentine to be sent to his house for me to work with - I believe it was got in Greek-street, but I did not order it myself; there was to be a quart of oil and three pints of turpentine - I called about the middle of the following week: he was from home - I was informed Mrs. Jacobs was ill, and that reason was given why I should not begin.</p>

            . I am a solicitor, and have acted as attorney for the prisoner for several years. I know he has lost a great deal of money by persons taking the benefit of the Insolvent Act - I put an execution into the prisoner's house on the very day of the fire, as I heard he had received the 500l. on the mortgage, and was going to Birmingham; he owed me 60l. odd - I had a warrant of attorney, which had been over due some time; I remember an extent being on the premises two or three months before - I acted for his partner on that occasion; to the best of my judgment his debts at this time were about 180l. - from my knowledge of his affairs, and considering his premises, I should think he had more than five times enough to pay his debts; he had leasehold property in Charles-street, and I prepared the lease of some premises at Hampstead, but have not acted for him for some months, as we had quarrelled - about ten o'clock on the night of the fire he and Mr. Genese came down to me and talked about the execution I had put in; a man was then in possession at my suit - they were with me a very short time; I delivered them a letter directed to Mr. Phillips, my officer, whose man was in possession - when I acted for his partner I received a statement of the property on the premises: that was during the extent, and I have been on the premises when on terms of intimacy with him - the house was then at work, and a great quantity of goods in both the warehouses; a misunderstanding between him and his partner caused a stoppage of the works.</p>
               <p>MR. PLATT. Q. Have you been concerned for the prisoner, as his solicitor, since October? A. No; his partner and himself delivered me a list of their debts, and I know some of their creditors - he did not owe more than 180l. beyond the mortgage, according to the list delivered to me; the extent was issued about three months ago - I have not been on the premises since that; my execution was paid on the 25th of March.</p>

            . I am an auctioneer and general dealer.

               <p>Q. Do you remember nudging the prisoner, and saying"Go?" A. No; I solemnly declare I did no such thing- I separated from him about twenty doors from the house; he certainly did not run.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there not an immense crowd of people? A. No - I suppose round the steps there were not fifty; in the circumference of this Court there might be one hundred people; I saw a military man on a horse, with a drawn sword. I am a <rs id="t18290409-86-viclabel504" type="occupation">watch-maker</rs>

The prisoner was bailed, and has surrendered.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you came out of the church was there a considerable pressure about you? A. No; the females were adjusting their dress - there was nothing to confine me; I was on the steps when I was knocked down- I got up the first time, and a gentleman said, "That fellow is waylaying you;" he then came up and made the assault - I struck at him, or attempted it, with my umbrella, when I saw him coming to me.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I knew the prisoner before this; there were three or four more persons with him; I had remonstrated with them several times before the people came out of church - when the prosecutor and the ladies came out, a person said,"They are going it there nicely;" six or seven of them pushed up and knocked them down; Mr. Byard got up, and the prisoner rushed up to him - he put up his umbrella, but did not strike the prisoner: I think the prisoner and his party intended to knock Mr. Byard down.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were they well known to you? A. I have seen them about with dog-fighters and others, at three o'clock in the morning; this was about twenty minutes before five o'clock; I had observed the prisoner for about half an hour before - there were no horse-guards there then; they had moved on to St. James' about ten minutes before - there might be forty or fifty persons round the steps; the crowd had gone off.</p>

            . I was at St. Martin's church; I observed Mr. Byard and two or three ladies on the steps, and all at once they were pushed down; Mr. Byard got up - the prisoner went up to him, and I saw the umbrella up; I got Mr. Byard up, and wiped the blood from his face; there were several other bad characters about.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going down the Strand, and saw a crowd at the church; the Welch children were going to walk, and I staid to look at them - after they came out the gentlefolks came out; the horse soldier rode on the pavement, and I suppose a hundred people fell down; I fell on the top of Mr. Byard and his wife - he got up, and said, "You rascal, what did you do that for?" I said I could not help it; I got up, and went to ask what he meant by it - he struck at me several times; the officer came and pulled me off him - he struck me several times, and some persons said, "Hit him, Hit him!" several times- the officer came and took me to Bow-street.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live at No. 8, Church-lane, St. Martin's. I was near the steps - after the children went on, the people came out; there were two gentlemen on horseback, clearing the people; one of them brought his horse on the bottom step, which caused a rush of the people backwards - I turned, and saw an arm let fly at the prisoner's head two or three times, and the last stroke that was made at him was warded off by an officer; I went up to the prisoner, and said, "Was that a constable struck you?" he said, "No, it was that gentleman;" he went to him, and said, "What did you strike me for?" the gentleman said, "Go along; you scoundrel; you want to pick my pocket;" he said, "You poor looking object, I have more money than you;" a female attempted to strike him, and then the gentleman struck him with an umbrella; the officer came and took him - I cannot say whether the prisoner was hit in the face or not; I suppose there were two or three hundred people about the steps; the constables and patrols were clearing them away- I went to the watch-house, and the gate was slapped in my face.</p>

On the 3d of February I gave a box with some money in it to the prisoner, about eleven o'clock in the day - he was to go to Mr. Livingston's to deliver the money, and the box was to be filled with goods; there was a 5s. piece and four half-crowns sealed up in a letter in the box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. How was the box packed up? A. The money was put into an order and sealed up, rolled in a canvas bag and tied up, it was then put into the box which was eorded; I am quite sure I gave it to the prisoner; I never said I gave it to his brother, nor that I did not know to whom I gave it; the prisoner's father is the carrier - I never sent goods or money by them before; the prisoner was in the cart, and his brother by the side - I know the father very well.</p>

             - we have no other partners. The prisoner was in our employ on the 27th of February; all our young men are allowed to purchase goods at cost price - they are entered in a book by Mr. Macfarlane and Mr. Cuffley; it is their duty to enter the whole of the goods which the young men buy - they are never to be entered by the young men who buy them; those who buy them are suffered to select goods themselves, but it is generally referred to a young man, who is appointed for that purpose, who at that time was Mr. Williams. On the 27th of February, about one or two o'clock, the boxes of all our young men were searched, and the prisoners among the rest; Mr. Cuffley and the constable were present; in the prisoner's box this dozen of French kid gloves were found - they were new, and tied up as they would be for sale; I said to him, "Of course these are entered?" - he said, "Oh, yes, Sir;" I went away, and returned in about a quarter of an hour - the prisoner was then below; he accosted me and said, "Sir, I should like to shew you the entry of these gloves" - this was about twenty or twenty-five minutes after I had seen them in his box; he shewed me this book, and this entry - I observed that it was scarcely dry, and the ink perfectly pale, though it purported to be made on the 25th of February - the heading of this page is the 24th of February, and there were several pages following written on; we have about forty young men in our warehouse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What character had you with him? A. He was recommended very highly by a particular friend and customer; I was at the office at the second examination with my solicitor - Mr. Humphries attended as the prisoner's attorney, and Mr. Phillips as his counsel; I understood Mr. Phillips was retained - I did not direct my solicitor to retain him for me, to my knowledge, I am so much engaged in business - I went to Newgate to see Mr. Wontner, whom I knew, and saw the prisoner at that time, but I did not expect to see him; Mr. Scorr, my attorney, was with me - he went as my friend - our object in going was not to see the prisoner; I had received an anonymous letter, which apparently came from Newgate, and went there in consequence - I did not ask to see the prisoner, nor did Mr. Scorr ask, to my knowledge; I had Mr. Cuffley with me as my confidential assistant - the prisoner was brought to me; Mr. Scorr questioned him relative to the letter, but not respecting this charge - no advertisement was inserted in the newspaper by my authority; no offers of favour were made to the prisoner by my authority - there was a wardsman present at the conversation, or some such person; he was not asked if he had heard the prisoner say any thing, in my presence - the prisoner was not questioned on any subject except the letter.</p>

            . I am an attorney to the prosecutors. I went with Mr. Wagner to Newgate, in cousequence of this letter, which I had received the Saturday night before; we took this letter, and went to consult Mr. Wontner about it - Mr. Wontner sent for the prisoner, and the letter was shown him; Mr. Wontner asked him if he knew any thing of that letter - he said he did not; Mr. Wontner said, "Now, Smith, if you know any thing, will you tell us what it is?" and Mr. Wontner cautioned me to hold out no hopes to the prisoner - the prisoner observed that he was sure Mr. Wagner would prosecute him to the utmost extremity of the law; I said he was wrong, Mr. Wagner did not wish to prosecute him at all; Mr. Wontner said a good deal to him on the subject of the letter, and the prisoner at last said he would think of it - we left the place.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you been an attorney? A. Ever since 1809; I went to the Police-office to prosecute the prisoner - Mr. Humphries and Mr. Phillips were there.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Mr. Phillips appear now to prosecute him at the desire of Mr. Wagner? A. No - it was solely by my choice: I consider that the manner I retained him was by no means indecent - After the business was over I said to Mr. Phillips, "If there is nothing indelicate in it I should like to retain you," and he said, "I don't see that there is;" this is the second prosecution I have had, and Mr. Phillips is the only gentleman I have employed - I went to Newgate in consequence of this letter in my hand; it was not particularly to see the prisoner - there were two persons in Newgate, and I did not know which of them it came from; the prisoner denied all knowledge of it, there was no question asked him with reference to the charge.</p>
               <p>(The letter was here put in and read.)</p>
               <p>"Wagner and Co., Greek-street, soho.</p>
               <p>If you will not prosecute, a disclosure will be made, by which you may save from 3 to 500l.; twenty-four hours to think of it, after that too late. Newgate."</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090058"/>Cross-examined. Q. Had Mr. Wagner any other person in Newgate at that time? A. Yes - a woman, whose case stands next to this; the prisoner denied all knowledge of the letter: Mr. Wontner asked him some questions - I do not think I asked him two; Mr. Wontner asked the turnkey if he had heard the prisoner say any thing about the letter, and he said No.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did the prisoner enter into any defence whatever, at the Police-office? A. No - I would not have given you orders, could I have imagined there was any indelicacy in it; it was after reading the letter, the prisoner said he would turn it in his mind.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he not from first to last deny all knowledge of it? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am an assistant to Messrs. Wagner and Chapman. I was present when the prisoner's box was searched, and this dozen of gloves were found; I said "Smith, I never entered these gloves;" the prisoner replied "Williams did:" I am certain he told me that - I went down into the shop, and got the day-book, and began to search it; the prisoner came to me, and asked for the book - I said he should not have it; the gloves were not then entered - I am certain that I looked back as far as to about the 9th of February; I am sure I looked at this page, which is headed the 24th; I searched the book back wards and forwards - I had occasion on the morning of the 25th of February, about eleven o'clock, to enter these returned silks in the book; I am quite sure that at that time, this page which has got the 24th at the top of it, was not filled up - the reason I am so certain is, that Mr. Cairns, our silk-mercer, called in to enter these silks, and I said to him,"How many are there?" he said, "A great many;" I said "Then I shall begin another page," but I am certain that the bottom part of this page, 211, was then vacant - this entry of the gloves to Mr. Smith, which appears at the bottom of the page, is the prisoner's own hand-writing; it is against the rule for a young man to enter in the book, goods he himself boys - I do not know an instance in which it has been done; the cost price of these gloves is 20s. - I took them in myself, but the price here entered is 18s.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How were they to find out what was the cost price? A. By referring to us, the cost price being on every article.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did the prisoner say when he made that entry? A. Yes; he said he looked them out on the morning of the 24th, and entered them the same evening, but I am quite confident they were not entered on the 25th.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You say there is a rule that a person shall not enter the goods he purchases himself? A. Yes; I will swear there has not been twenty such instances in the last fortnight, nor ten, or one - there has not been such an instance since I have been there, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been to any newspaper-offices on the subject of this charge? A. I did go to one; I did not pay any thing, nor supply any report, or give any information: I went on business for the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go on business relative to the prisoner? A. I went to see whether the information would be in or not; I did not go for the express purpose of having it put in exactly - I went to have it headed in a particular way; I wanted it headed "Robbery by a young man from the Messrs. Wagner and Chapman's," Mr. Wagner gave me no authority, but Mr. Phillips, who draws our advertisements did, and I thought it might give notoriety to the shop.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it done by yourself? A. No, nor by Mr. Wagner's order, to the best of my knowledge -I did not tell him of it.</p>

            . This entry, in page 211 in this book, I saw on the 27th, soon after the prisoner was taken, and it appeared to me to have been just made; these rules are made known to each of the young men - every one when he comes is told to read them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know of the prisoner's reading them? A. No; here is a rule - (reads) "Any gentleman purchasing goods must refer them to Mr. Macfarlane, who will enter them according to the costmark."</p>
               <p>MR. WAGNER re-examined. Q. Is there any entry in this book made by the proper person, of a purchase by the prisoner? A. Yes, by Mr. Macfarlane and Cuffley; MR. Macfarlane is at home - the prisoner has been in our service since June last.</p>
               <p>MR. CUFFLEY. Here is an entry of goods bought by the prisoner, and entered by me; Williams brought them to me to enter, and here is an entry made by Mr. Macfarlane.</p>
               <p>MR. WILLIAMS. I remember looking at these articles, and having that entry made by Mr. Cuffley; on the 24th of February I was in the glove department, and I should have looked out any gloves that he wanted.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, denying that he was aware of the rule in question, and stating that the pressure of business caused so much confusion in the concern as to cause it to be conducted very irregularly, and the shopmen were constantly in the habit of purchasing goods and paying for them, without the knowledge of others.</p>
               <p>COURT to MR. WAGNER. Q. How did you know the prisoner's box? A. He gave the key of it to the officer - he was not taken into custody for an hour or an hour and a half after.</p>
               <p>MR. WILLIAMS re-examined. Q. Did you see the prisoner with the book in his hand after the officer had been there?. A. I saw him with the book; I do not know whether he had a pen in his hand or not; I was not aware the officer was there.</p>

I sent for an officer on the 26th of February, and this pair of silk stockings was found in a box, which she acknowledged to be hers; I asked her where she got them - she said she purchased them at a shop in Oxford-street; I said, "That will not do for me, are the initials of your predecessors on them?" she then said she bought them of a young man in the shop.</p>

I was present, and saw the stockings and other things found in the prisoner's box - she first said she bought them in Oxford-street, and then she said she gave 8s. 6d. for them to a young man in the shop; I remarked, that if she had bought them in the shop, she would have got them for 6s., for that was the price marked upon them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought two pairs of stockings of a young man in the shop, one Saturday evening, and paid 13s. for them; I was not present at the time my box was searched - my things were all out upon the bed when I first saw them.</p>

            . On the 9th of March I had a warrant to search the prisoner's house at Enfield-highway. I found a tub of butter buried in the garden, with this head on it - I asked him where he got it; he said it was immaterial to me; there was about 20 lbs. of butter in it - no one lives in the cottage but him and his wife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What are you? A. A constable of Enfield; this was full five weeks after the tub had been lost.</p>

I stopped him, and found two pairs of shoes - he called out to Smith, "I am stopped, come back;" he came back, and I found one pair on him - I took them to the office; they said they had bought them of a man in the street for 6d. a pair - I asked them what part of the road they bought them; they said they did not know, and if they did they should not tell me.</p>

I met the prisoner, on the 6th of April, in Petticoat-lane, with another man, a little before twelve o'clock - the prisoner had this box under his arm: the other man was walking by his side; I asked the prisoner what he had got - (the other man got off;) the prisoner said it was his own property - I said he must satisfy me that it was so; when I took him to the watch-house he said it was of no use to deceive me, he had stolen it, and told me where - I went to look for the place, but could not find it; I went back and told him, and he said he would shew me where, which he did.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and work for Mr. Wood. I was in Wentworth-street on the 1st of April, at four o'clock; I was stopping for our beer time; I saw the prosecutor, but he is not now in the dress he was then; I saw two young women, one of them was arm-in-arm with him - he was quite tipsy; I saw him robbed; the prisoner was not one of the party at all; I told the foreman to go and take away the man's coat, as he was so much in liquor he would be robbed of it.</p>

Yes; because I know the woman by sight, but not by name; I have seen the prisoner twenty times, but never exchanged a word with her: I know the woman who did rob him in the same way - one woman held him fast and another took his watch, then three or four more came and took hold of his pocket; I had a paper and 1s. to come here, and they told me I should have 3s. 6d.; I saw the woman who robbed him yesterday, and said it was a pity but she should be taken up.</p>

            . I am a constable, and live at Ball's-pond, Islington. I took the prisoner Shaw into custody on Tuesday, the 24th of March, at Ball's-pond; when I went into the house I told him I wanted him for a robbery in Essex; he said I must be mistaken, he was not the man -I took him to a public-house close by, and then told him I wanted him for a robbery at Hillingdon, near Uxbridge; after I handcuffed him he told me, provided he had been in the country, two like me should not have taken him: I took him to Islington watch-house, and on searching him found two letters in his hat, which I produce - I was going to take him to Queen-square; he said as we went along, that I should be very sorry that I took him; I said, "Why?" he said, "Because I am sure to be hung, and my wife will be transported."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure, that before this, you had not said any thing to him to induce him to state any thing? A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You told him at first you wanted him for a robbery in Essex? A. Yes, that was true; he made this statement next day, going to Queen-square; I had told him I wanted him for a robbery at Hillingdon - I was going along the Strand when he said this; I did not tell him not to say anything.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you state this to the Magistrate? A. No, but I stated it to two Queen-square officers immediately I got there; my only evidence was that I had brought him to the office; I produced both the letters at the office - the Magistrate told me to take care of them, and produce them here; I took him on the 24th, and was before the Magistrate on the Thursday week after that: none of the conversation appears in my deposition, that I know of; I mentioned it to the clerk.(The letters being read were as follows:)</p>

               <p>TUTTON'S Defence. Baker says I had the bundles at the time I was at Brentford - does it stand to reason. if I was guilty of robbery I should go there to fight a man, having the stolen property exposed? On the Monday morning I went to ask a man named Weedon for work, his wife said he was gone to Islington - I called on the man whom I was going to work with, went into a public-house with him, and had something to drink: I was with him all Monday, Tuesday, and part of Wednesday - I came home over the bridge to the Six Bells public-house -I and Baker did fight, but I had no property about me, nor was I in company with any other man.</p>

On Saturday night, the 21st of February, I received a 10l. note from Mr. Wilson, who I had sold some goods to; I did not observe the date or number - I had it in my right-hand pocket, and was returning home, down Holborn; the prisoner accosted me at the bottom of Holborn, and asked me if I would give her something to drink; I told her No, I was going home, and had got no money for drink; she pressed me much - I said I had no money; she said if I would take a glass, she would pay for it; we went into a wine-vaults at the bottom of Holborn; I think it was the first house in Fleet-market - we had a quartern of rum between the two; I drank one glass, and she the other; she paid for that - I did not like the rum, and chose to have a glass of warm wine; she had another - I put my hand into my right-hand breeches pocket, took out the 10l. note, and put it into my left-hand pocket; I returned my hand to my pocket again, and took out 6d. and 2 1/2d., which was all I had - I paid for the wine, and went away; I went out; she followed me - I took the nearest road home, which was through a place leading to Saffron-hill; and when I got to the bottom of Saffron-hill. just through the passage, she said she lived there, and asked me to go in with her, and took me by the arm - I went in, and stopped about two or three minutes; I never sat down; I came away, and walked up the middle of Saffron-hill with my hands in my pockets, as I am accustomed, as they feel chilled, being used to work with warm iron: I turned down <placeName id="t18290409-130-crimeloc743">Peter-street</placeName>

In Michaelmas term I attended the Accountant-General's office to receive 1000l., but, in consequence of the legacy-duty not having been paid, I could not receive it - I was obliged to pay it, it amounted to 8l. 18s. 8d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had the prisoner other payments to make? A. Various - but not at that particular time, as we had come to the end of Trinity term - but for three months previous he might have paid 200l. altogether; the day-book will tell what payments were made - I am not aware of his having any specific sum to pay that day.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. If he had had more than 10l. to pay, and asked you for the money, would you have given it to him? A. The regular course was for the cashier to apply, he would give him what money he wanted: this cheque was given for the express purpose of paying the legacy-duty.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You gave it him on account of law cash? A. Yes; I did not know what the amount of the duty would be; I asked what he wanted it for, because we had previously found what we considered to be errors.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is there any entry in your books of his having paid that sum? A. No; they do not give vouchers for it; the receipt given is lodged in the Accountant-General's office.</p>

            . I am a clerk to the prosecutors, and have the books relating to the office disbursements in June, 1828; the book at that time was kept by me; it was the prisoner's duty to state to me what cash he had received and disbursed, that I might enter it in the book; he should have done that strictly every day; there is no entry on the 11th of June, nor about that time, either of this cheque being received, or of the legacy-duty having been paid.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then he did not direct you to enter in the book that he had paid the duty? A. No; I had no knowledge of the transaction; he had to transact the usual business, which at times is heavy; there is not 2l. entered on that day; Mr. Bischoff usually gives me a cheque for the disbursements - I received no money from the prisoner that day; I never did; I used to pay to him; the items I enter by his order relate to Chancery business; the disbursements made by him that day amount to 24s. 2d.; I paid those sums to him.</p>
               <p>MR. BISCHOFF re-examined. The legacy duty in this case was 1 per cent. on the sterling money - the parties were father and daughter; I had more to pay in November than would have done in July.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had he not other disbursements to make that day? A. His own day-book will show that.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is this day-book kept in his own hand-writing. A. It is the clerk's day-book, in which each enters his own disbursements - his duty at that time was confined to the Equity business; here are entries of his on the 11th of June, amounting to 1l. 0s. 6d.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had he not disbursements to make every day? A. Here are several entries on the 12th - it is my rule to give money only to Sawkins, the cash clerk, if he is in the office; I take his signature on the back of the cheque - but I gave the prisoner the cheque on that occasion, Mr. Sawkins not being in the office, and he should account to Sawkins for that cheque; whatever payments are made the books will show - there are always payments to be made, but the cash clerk can best speak to what payments were made; the prisoner has not entered any sum as paid for legacy-duty.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He received 10l. for the express purpose of paying that duty? A. He did; we have never had any satisfaction for that sum.</p>

            . When the prisoner states he had made payments, I hand him the cash and enter the items; he never told me he had received this cheque of 10l. - he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090073"/>has not brought it to account either as having been received or paid.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS Q. Has the prisoner had advances made at any time? A. Yes, and perhaps it has gone three or four days before he accounts to me for it; he has given me an"I.O.U." for 5l., but it was always entered as so much in hand for law cash, and he has accounted for it by payments; I cannot say how soon after the 11th of June we had a settlement.</p>
               <p>Q. Might he not have accounted to you for 8l. 19s. 6d.? A. I should think not - but the law cash is 10l. deficient; I paid him myself the items composing the 1l. 0s. 6d. out of cash I had in hand the next time we settled - there was always some money in hand.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Are you particular in making the entries on the day payments are made? A. They are entered in the day-book every night; I take them from the day-book to the cash-book, and hand the money over to the clerk making the payment; we do not settle every day, perhaps in three or four days; the prisoner should have entered this cheque as received, and charge the sum as paid for legacy-duty - but I never knew he had received it.</p>
               <p>MR. BISCHOFF. I never asked the prisoner what he had done with this cheque, as I was not aware of the fact till November, having been out of town in the long vacation; I asked him, when he was in custody on a civil suit, if this legacy-duty had been paid - he said it had; I had not at that time told him if he stated truly all the transactions he should not be prosecuted; he subsequently admitted that it was not paid; we were inclined to assist him as much as we could.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not say he had applied it for your use, though not in that particular way? A. As far as my recollection goes, certainly nothing of the kind.</p>

            . Q. Look at this entry; is not the identical cheque, which I am now charged with stealing, entered to the 21st of June? A. Here is an entry on the "21st of June, ditto 11th of June 10l.;" that is the 10l. I had not an account of.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then this draft is entered? A. Yes; I took that entry from examining the cheque-book, which states that a cheque was drawn on that day; I entered it in order to have it accounted for, being accountable for cheques drawn to law cash; I did not enter it at any suggestion of the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. On the 21st of June did I not settle an account with you, and did you not then say to me, "You have received a cheque of 10l. from Mr. Bischoff, have not you?" A. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I not, on settling the account, give you a fresh"I.O.U." for the balance? A. That would be the usual course; I believe there was a conversation about a cheque at a subsequent period, about, August; I remember keeping a little blue book of advances made to you, but not of this date - it began the latter part of June or beginning of July - it might last till August; I do not know what has become of it - I have not destroyed it; it is merely a private memorandum; I commenced keeping it after some little inaccuracy - I before kept them on slips of paper, which got lost.</p>

On the 15th of March my cash-box contained a cheque for 15l., two 5l. Bank notes, a 30l. Bank note, and about 9l. in sovereigns and half-sovereigns; a bill of exchange for 69l. 17s. 6d., five gold rings, a silk purse, and a canvas bag; I had seen my cash-box safe on the evening of the 14th, locked up in an iron safe, and I had the key in my pocket; I left home about nine o'clock on Sunday morning, the 15th, leaving the key of the iron safe in my coat pocket, and the coat was in the bed-room - the prisoner slept in the house, on the floor above my bed-room; at the time I left my house every thing appeared as safe as it did the night before; I returned about a quarter-past nine o'clock in the evening; when I rang the bell the servant maid and the prisoner opened the door to me - the servant said Mr. Jackson, a neighbour, had been and said some glass had been broken; I went and looked over the house, and found the sky-light at the back part of the shop broken - the opening was not large enough to admit the body of a man or boy; I am quite certain no person could have got through there - I immediately looked at the iron safe, and found the door of it open, and immediately missed the cash-box; I am certain the door was locked the night before, and I had not unlocked it - I had not seen it on Sunday morning; there was no key in it - I looked at the desk, which was safe overnight, and that was broken open; I had a key of the safe in the desk, and another in my pocket - I found the one in my pocket, and the other was in the desk, where I had left it; if it had been used to the safe it had been put back again - no violence was used to the safe; it must have been opened by a false key, or the key from the desk - neither the prisoner nor the servant<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090074"/>appeared to know any thing about it; on the Thursday following one of the 5l. notes was returned to me (which I had taken of Mrs. Cundy) - it was brought to me by one of Whitbread's men; I knew it to be one of the notes in my cash-box - I had put Cundy's name on it when I took it; it was in my own writing; I made further inquiry that same day (Thursday, the 19th,) and charged the prisoner with this offence about two o'clock; I found the remainder of my property in Union-street, in Mrs. Holland's house; the prisoner gave me a written order to Union-street - the order was sent by Mr. Glanville, who brought the property back; I saw the prisoner write the order - Glanville brought back to me the greatest part of the property, a pair of ear-rings, three gold rings, a bill of exchange for 69l. 17s. 6d., a cheque for 15l., a 30l. Bank note, and some gold and silver, but none of the 5l. notes; I know all the property to be the same as was safe in the cash-box on the Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. RICHARDSON. Q. How long had he lived with you? A. Nearly six months; he came with as good a character as I ever wish to have, and he had been in my service before - I put great confidence in him; I charged him with the offence on the 19th, but the officer had taken him before the Magistrate on the Tuesday before, as he suspected him; but he was not charged with it till the Thursday; I had written the name on the note myself - I do not know on what day I received it.</p>

            . I live at No. 4, Union-street, East-lane, Walworth. I have known the prisoner eighteen months; he used to lodge with me when he was not in a situation - he brought a parcel to my house on Sunday, the 15th of March. between six and seven o'clock in the evening: I did not know the contents - he left it with me - he put the parcel carelessly on the table; I moved it on to a chest of drawers; I parted with it on the Thursday afterwards to Mr. Glanville, who brought a note from Gill for it; my mother gave Martin the note, but not in my presence - (looking at it) this is the note; I believed it came from the prisoner - my mother gave up the parcel to Glanville in my presence: it contained a Bank note I believe, and some rings and papers; when he came to me on the Sunday he asked me if I could get him change for a 5l. note, and he gave me one; I went out, but could not get change; I returned it to him, and he took it away with him - he left our house that evening, and did not come again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you quite certain it was the same parcel as he left on Sunday? A.

In consequence of information from the daughter, I went to the prisoner's house; I saw them both, and said, "Where is the cheese Mr. Harwood's daughter brought here on Tuesday?" Spratt said, "She brought no cheese here," and I was welcome to search - his wife then came into the shop, and said I might search; I followed her quickly into the backroom, and saw the blankets of the bed move; she ran to a closet - I said, "The cheese must be some where about here;" I got a candle, and down inside the lining of the wainscot, in the closet, I found this half of a cheese; I said, "Here is the very thing I want: this is Harwood's cheese;" the man said, "Yes, that is Harwood's cheese;" I asked how he came to take it in - he said the daughter complained of being very hungry, as her father would not allow her enough to eat, and the cheese was brought there that she might have a bit whenever she went over to their house -I asked when she brought it; he said, "About a fortnight ago;" his wife said, "No, my dear, as it has come to this. tell the truth - it was brought in last Tuesday;" I asked him again when it was brought in; he said, "About a fortnight ago;" his wife again said it was on the Tuesday; I desired her to hold her tongue, as I did not want to take her - I then took the man to the office, went back to their house, and asked if there was any tea there; a boy, who was there, said "Yes, an ounce;" I looked, and found this paper of tea and canister of tea, a caddy full of sugar, and some other sugar; I searched further, and found this ginger and blue; the female prisoner came in, and I asked if she had any tea - she said she bought two ounces of a person who called; she afterwards acknowledged that the girl brought the tea, sugar, and blue, and said she gave her a cup of coffee now and then, and some tea, when she wanted it.</p>

I have known the prisoner about six months, as frequenting my house - I have been told that he had been living, for the last twenty years, upon his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090078"/>property; he used to have refreshment in a private room - he generally came about dinner-time, sometimes at tea-time - I have missed money occasionally out of my cash-box, which stood in the window ledge of the little parlour; it was locked, but the key was always in it - I marked my money on the 13th of March; there were four half-crowns and five shillings on the Thursday evening; when I went to bed I took it into my bed-room, and put it under my pillow, which I do every night: I brought it down on the following morning, about ten o'clock, and put it into the little parlour on the window ledge, its usual place - the prisoner came there that day about half-past twelve; the cash-box at that time contained 1l. 15s. 6d. in silver - none of the marked money had been taken out of it - I have a wife and a sister, but I had not gone out of the room all day, from the time I had my breakfast till the prisoner came; I had counted the money the evening before; my wife and sister go to the cash-box when they want it, but I swear that neither of them had been at it that day; the prisoner had two glasses of gin and water and two pipes of tobacco - he staid till about two o'clock; my wife was up stairs, my sister was out of the room - I was called to serve a customer at the bar, and heard the cash-box open and shut; no one but the prisoner was in the room; I can up stairs and told my wife of it - in the course of half an hour we sat down to dinner, and Mr. Fairfax said, "I will go into the tap-room and smoke my pipe while you have your dinner;" before I sat down to dinner I counted the cash in the cash-box, and found 6s. 6d. short - as soon as we had done dinner the prisoner came into the little parlour again, and bad another glass of gin and water; he then paid his reckoning, which came to 1s. 7 1/2d. and gave me two shillings, neither of which were marked; I put them into the till, and when he had quitted my house I sent a young man for an officer, who took him in the street - I had not spoken to any officer about this business before - there were 8s. found on him in silver and 9d. in copper, and among the silver there was one shilling and one half-crown marked, which I can swear to; I have not stated any thing more than I told the Magistrate - I do not know that I have; I will swear that I told the Magistrate that whilst I was serving a customer I heard the cash-box open - the money in the cash-box was not all marked; all the marked money remained in the box excepting one shilling and one half-crown, but I missed 6s. 6d. in all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You say you understand this gentleman lives on his property? A. I have heard so; he has come to my house for five or six months, two or three times a week - I never saw any thing like childishness about him; he always appeared very friendly - he did not appear intoxicated after he drank the three glasses of gin and water: I have never said, in reference to this prosecution; that I would not make it up unless I had something very handsome, nor any thing of that kind - I have never said I would not settle it unless I was well paid for it, nor any thing of that kind; I know a person named Pettit; upon my oath, I never said in his presence that I would not settle this business unless I was well paid for it, nor nothing like it - I was never present when my sister said, "My brother will not settle this under 200l.;" I never heard any thing of that kind - it never occurred to me to put the box in a safe place; I marked the money in order to detect some one; they were marked with a kind of round

            - I counted it the night before, but did not count it that morning; no one comes into my bed-room in the morning - I brought it down in the morning, and the key was in it; I did not say any thing to the prisoner about it, but went up stairs to my wife - the prisoner might certainly have gone away at that time; he was taken into custody about ten minutes after he had left; when he left the room, and I went to count the money, the box was locked - I had left it unlocked. The prisoner has played a game at cards with me and my wife in the little room - he has betted a penny on the games as we have been playing; I never passed any marked money to my customers till after the prisoner was taken, and then Mr. Richardson, who keeps the Prince of Wales public-house, came in and had change for a sovereign; losing the money had made us very uncomfortable in the house, but I never accused my sister of it.</p>

Mr. Cox sent for me, and I took the prisoner in Hermitage-street: I said the publican told me he had been robbing the box in which he kept his money - I took him into a public-house, and searched him: while I was taking the silver from his pocket, which I think was about 8s., and 9d. in copper, Cox pointed out this half-crown and this shilling - the prisoner said nothing about it; I think his money was all in one pocket; I think there was some copper among the silver.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's sister. On Thursday, the 4th of March, he marked four half-crowns and five shillings; he put them on the chimney-piece, and in the evening he put them into the cash-box with the other silver; he took it up to bed with him, and came down the next morning between nine and ten o'clock - the prisoner was in the parlour alone, where the cash-box was kept; there was no change given to any one, as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the mark made on the money? A. Yes - they were not all marked exactly alike; the shillings are marked with a kind of O, and the half-crowns with an X - there are two of them; I was in the tap-room at the time they were taken - I am confident there had been no change taken, for I was in an out of the room; I have never said that my brother would not make this up for less than 200l.; I never said so to Pettit, nor to any body in his presence; I have had no conversation with Pettit at all about it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have no recollection of touching his money; I did not find that I had a shilling more than I could account for - how the money came there I do not know, but it does appear that I had it.</p>

            . Q. Do you remember whether on the day before, you had given the prisoner any change? A. No, nor any person in my house - I believe he came and had a pint of ale in my house; I served him with it - he did not have change for a 5s. piece; I think it was a shilling or a sixpence - he paid me.</p>

            . I am a master block-maker, and live in St. George's East. I have seen the prosecutor on this subject frequently; last Tuesday evening, when I was in his tap-room. a young man who was there said to Cox, "How do you get on?" he answered the bill was filed; the young man said, "You have not made it up;" Cox replied, "No. I will not make it up unless I am well paid for it;" last Tuesday week I was there when a gentleman came in, and his sister Betsey said her brother was determined not to make it up under 200l.; I received one marked shilling from the prosecutor on the 14th of March- this is it.</p>

            . I am a constable of the London-docks. I have known the prisoner about twelve years - he is about seventy-one or seventy-two years of age- he lived eight years in my house: I have observed that within this last year or two there has been a great difference in his behaviour and conversation, but his character has been perfectly honest, and he has been well respected.</p>
               <p>MR. RICHARDSON. I keep the Prince of Wales public-house, in Hermitage-street. On the 13th of March I had change for a sovereign of the prosecutor; I have 14s. of the money, and it was all marked - this is it; I am certain this is the money I received from him, as I had no other money in my pocket; here are nine shillings and two half-crowns all marked.</p>

             re-examined. I only marked four half-crowns and five shillings, but when the prisoner had left my room, I marked the whole of the silver, thinking if he came in again he would take some more; I had never marked any money before.</p>

            . I am constable of the night. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house, about half-past twelve o'clock; the prosecutor seemed to have all his senses about him, and told his story correctly and well -I desired him to feel in all his pockets, if he had lost any thing else - he did so; I said, "Are you confident you have not lost any thing else?" he felt all his pockets, and found this bag, with a sovereign and some silver in it, all safe; there were a great number of people in the watch-house, and some outside.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never saw that he had a watch; on the following morning he told the watchman that a friend of his had been drinking with him, and had taken care of his watch for him: how could I possibly put a watch into his pocket without his knowing it; that man or woman would not have come up, only he broke all the ornaments on the mantel-piece.</p>

On the 7th of March, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner brought a pair of new cord trousers and a new waistcoat to pawn - I asked his name and residence; he said he lived in Peter-street, Spitalfields - I knew there was no such street; I then asked him whose the property was - he said it was his mother's, and then that it was his own; I told my principal - he sent for an officer, who found a pair of fustain trousers in his hat; I had seen the prisoner on the 23d of January, when he pawned a pair of trousers and a waistcoat - these are the articles he brought first, and these are what he brought last.</p>

I received the prisoner in charge with these trousers - I went to a house in Plummer's-row, where I knew he lived, and found these linings; I found a woman there - she came to the office afterwards, and begged of me to let her see her husband; when she saw him, she said, "William, what have you been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090084"/>doing, and what is this all about?" he said, "I don't know what could possess me, but it all belonged to my master; I am sorry for what I have done, he has been a good master to me."</p>

On the Monday after he was taken I went to see him at Clerkenwell - I asked how he could rob his master, who had been so kind to him; he asked if Mr. Jackson held out any promise to him - I said I had no authority to say so; I asked how he got the things out of the house - he said on his person; the trousers under his own trousers, and the waistcoats in his pocket; that he took the things home, and put them into the cupboard: his wife knew nothing about them - and when he went to his meals he took and pawned them at different times; I asked him where - he denied taking them to any other shop but Mr. Attenborough's, and said he had burnt the duplicates.</p>

            . I remember the prisoner coming to the prosecutor's, about half-past four o'clock on the 19th of January; Mrs. Ralph was out - the prisoner staid three-quarters of an hour; I then desired her to go out of my house before I went out - she said, "I am going out," but whether she went out or not I do not know, but that night the robbery took place; I missed a great many things, but I cannot say what - the house was all in a muddle.</p>
               <p>MRS. RALPH re-examined. Q. Was it on the 19th of January? A. Yes, it was; my box was broken open by force, with a large carving-fork; these articles are all mine, and a great many more were taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you ever been in the habit of sending the prisoner to pawn any thing? A. No.</p>

C.," I know was on the note at the time I put my initials.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you pay the note away? - A. I do not exactly recollect; I believe I paid it to Mr. Hedley, but cannot swear that; I knew the prisoner's name when he paid it, and observed the initials on the note at that time - I do not know his hand-writing; I believe these to be his initials.</p>
               <p>Q. A. man wrongfully passing off a note could not have led to his discovery sooner than by putting his own initials on it? A. I had no suspicion, and should not have hesitated at changing a 100l. note for him - he bore a good character ever since I have known him; I did not know where he lived at the time.</p>

            . I am City-marshal. In consequence of information from Mackay and Breakwell, I accompanied Breakwell and Forrester to No. 6, Bartholomew-place, and saw the prisoner come out of the house; I was following him, and Breakwell pointed him out; I stopped him just as he came to his own door, and then followed him into the house; I produced to him this 20l. note, No. 17,669 - I asked him if he would be kind enough to tell me who he took it of; he said nothing about Breakwell - he said he had taken it of a young man who was on board an East India ship in the docks; that he lived in Canton-place, Commercial-road; and he believed, indeed he knew, that he went to the East Indies about the middle of November - he said he did not know the name of the ship, but he knew the captain's name -(that it was Captain Sadler,) and the person who he had it from; I wrote down in a book at the time - (looking at it) - it was Charles Wilson, and that he took it from him in the early part of October; I only took that down at the time; the beginning of my memorandum says, "Last October," which refers to his having taken it early in October; I repeated the question to him, and asked him if he had taken any other notes of this

             - he said he had not; I then asked if he had paid any others away; he said No, he could not have paid any others away - nothing further passed; I took him to the Mansion-house - his lodgings were searched by Forrester, in his presence, and in my presence; we were in the parlour, on the ground floor, which he occupied with the back bed-room; he said the parlour and the back bed-room were his; there was a chest of drawers in the parlour; I requested Forrester to search the drawers - the prisoner put on a great coat, which he had taken out of the back bed-room; Forrester found in the drawers a cheque-book of Curtis and Co. - (looking at it) - this is it; it has my name and hand-writing on it - there were other papers produced from the drawers; I went on Tuesday, the 17th of March, about eleven o'clock in the day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you told him the charge you took him on, before you asked him any questions? A. No: the first question I asked him was, who he took the note of: he told me

            . I am the superintendent of the Jerusalem coffee-house, which is the place of resort for the captains of East India ships. I am well acquainted with nearly the whole of the captains of East India ships; I knew none named Sadler in October, November, or at any other time; if there had been such a captain it is not likely that I should not have known him, because I keep a regular register of every ship that goes to India, not only from England, but from every port.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is the superintendent of a coffee-house? A. I act as clerk, keep an account of every body who comes there, and attend the captains; Arthur and Bell are the proprietors - I cannot swear there is no captain of that name, but it is very unlikely, because I generally know all the ships that go; I have not my books with me - there are about five hundred East India ships every season; captains die continually, and the first mates succeed them.</p>
               <p>Q. And the first thing he does. I suppose, is to come to the superintendent of this coffee-house, and give his name? A. Generally; I have not brought the list, because my memory is quite sufficent; it is considered pretty accurate, but no memory is infallible - I looked over the lists this morning; there are no other coffee-house to which East India captains resort - they go to Lloyd's, but it is neccessary to come to our house to get passengers; it is generally their custom to come - it is not compulsory; I print a list every month of ships going to India, from information from the captains and documents and letters which I receive.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Is it your business to keep a list of captains who arrive from and go to India? A. It is, I keep it as correct as possibly I can from my information - I also observe the captains frequenting the house; I never heard this name, either as a captain or otherwise.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do the captains of all the ships going to the East Indies come to your house, or only these of the East India Company? A. Not only the commanders, but also the three trading Companies - the captains of the free-traders come generally; there may be one or two exceptions, but there are very little more.</p>

            . I engrave the cheques for Sir William Curtis and Co. - (comparing the cheques with a margin in the book produced) I have seen this before; this cheque appears to me exactly to correspond with the line in the counterpart in the cheque-book - there is a cypher which we call the cheque; the cheque is cut nearly down the centre; the different parts of the cypher exactly tally - the two lines tally exactly; nothing can be more perfect - none of the remaining counterparts in this book will fit it - the cheque is exactly the same size as the book, and most decidedly that cheque was taken from the counterpart in this book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you first make the comparison? A. About a fortnight ago; I have engraved for the house these twenty-five years - there have been alterations in the firm during that time, and the cheques have not been always the same exactly - the size of the cheque would be the same if it came from any cheque book of theirs: I swear this came from this margin, by the cypher; they unite exactly, and no other in the book will - I have compared it with no other book; I think it has been cut with a knife; a knife or scissors are equally common to cut cheques - it is usual to cut them down the cypher; this fits excellently.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say it will not fit fifty other books? A. No - this is a little worn on the edge, but is quite fresh.</p>

               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. When you examined it a fortnight ago, did the edges correspond? A. Exactly; I do not cut the books - that is done by the binder; whether they are of the same size depends on their being equally cut - I speak to the plate from the comparison I have made; I believe it to have come from this book.</p>

            . I bind cheques for the house of Curtis and Co, they are made five abreast folio, and are cut down; five books would be nearly the same size, but there must be a trifling difference, we cut as nearly the same as we can - I bound this cheque book, and have every reason to believe this cheque came from that book, and from the very part that has been pointed out; though we cut them as near as we can, they differ a triflle: we are obliged to vary a trifle, to prevent cutting through the impression - I am perfectly convinced this cheque came out of that book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you first compare it? A. Last Saturday week - I have not compared it with any other books; I have here a thicker book of theirs - you will find there are no two cheques alike exactly, that is not the same distance from the edge.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath is not this one (pointing one out) the same size? A. There is about one-sixteenth of an inch difference in the width of the margin - there is not so much difference at this end, but there is a trifle which is visible most certainly; I could not cut any cheque from this book promiscuously to make the margin fit - I must case it up and down a little - the books may be cut very nearly of a size, but not exactly the same: they may be exactly alike sometimes, but, generally speaking, there is a little variation - we cut them with a rule and knife.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Do you cut only one book at a time? A. Only one - they are cut round the edges with a plough, and then with a knife, to separate them into five; it is very seldom that two books are exactly of the same size - we cut four or five sheets at a time with the plough, but only one at a time when cutting them into slips.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Your finding no cheque in this book agreeing with it, satisfies your mind that it did not come from any other margin? A. Yes; I undertake to say that cheque will not fit any other part of the book, and that it came from the one which is marked; it is possible for two books to be cut the same size, and it may be probable.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. If three or four books were put into the plough, they would be of the same size - but the middle cut is rather higher? A. Yes, if it should fit in length it would vary in width, as we must case it up and down; and if two pieces of paper, cut out of different books,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090090"/>were possibly of the same size, yet the cypher would vary.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Though originally the folio sheet was cut in a plough the five divisions are separately cut? A. Yes; the engraving remains the same, but it occupies a different position in the different books, being eased up and down in one or the other: this cheque exactly fits this book, and belongs to that margin, and that alone.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. The book you have brought is one-sixteenth of an inch deeper than the one produced? A. Yes; I did not select it because it was larger, I took it promiscuously from a parcel of fifty or sixty; I brought it merely to explain that one cheque would not fit another margin; I brought it, not because it was larger, but because it was thicker, and offered more specimens - I do not mean wider, but containing more cheques - not because it was a different size in the length or breadth - it is one-sixteenth larger - but I did not select for that - I had no opportunity of comparing them - some may vary a quarter of an inch; I have not examined my stock to see if there are any of exactly the same size as the original book.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Can you say when this cheque-book was bound? A. About a week ago - I have no idea when the other was bound; they have had these thin books perhaps ten or twelve years.</p>
               <p>MR. ROE Alterations have been made in engravings - I should think the engraving of this book was done about the beginning of 1828, from the style of engraving - I should think it was printed at that time; five cheques are engraved at a time; the cyphers cannot vary much - we rub them down on the same copper from the pattern - they cannot vary at all.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. That book was not in existence in 1822? A. Certainly not.(The cheque was here read.)</p>
               <p>MR. BLAKESLEY. These crosses were not on the cheque at the time it was uttered - they are my cancelling.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. What did you do with it when you paid it? A. I put it on a file, and referred to it again next day; Mr. Gates has had it since.</p>
               <p>MR. GATES. I received the cheque from Blakesley, and produce it to-day - it has been in my possession ever since the 4th of November.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) - My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - Overwhelmed, as I naturally must be, at this awful period of my existence, with feelings which language is too weak, too powerless to describe, it would be superfluous in me to enter into any other details than those connected with the case before you. I stand before you, Gentlemen, charged with having committed an offence which a just God knows I am innocent of; and I sincerely trust that before the light of Heaven shall close upon you this day you will be fully convinced how unjust and cruel is my persecutions, and how soon an innocent man may be considered guilty, and thus subject to all the melancholy horrors of a prison and a trial: firm, however, and undaunted I meet the charge, for"The brave man ne'er despairs,"But lives when cowards die."</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, you will find, by the evidence adduced against me this day, that part of the money paid for the forgery, in question, passed through my hands; you will hear that I have said I received a note from a person named Wilson, a mate on board an Indiaman, now sailed, whose captain's name was Hadler, or Sadler; such, Gentlemen, I solemnly declare, is to the best of my recollection, the name I received; but, Gentlemen, you are doubtless most of you men of business, and know that notes may frequently come into your possession without being able to recollect from whom you took them. Besides, if a man choose to give me a feigned name, is it justice, Gentlemen, is it humanity, because such is the case, to cast me at once as a guilty man? For by the Sacred God of Heaven! who knows the secrets of our hearts, I stand before you a melancholy spectacle of unjust persecution. You will next find adduced in evidence against me a cheque-book found in my possession; but this, Gentlemen, thank Almighty God, I can account to you how innocently it came into my possession; I will then leave you to judge whether it, in any way, tends to prove my guilt: I have been in the habit of receiving from Mr. Barclay, at various times, different sums of money, as I may have had occasion to ask for it, which money I always (with a few exceptions) received by cheques upon Curtis' house; it was on one of these occasions, when I applied to him for the loan of a sum of money, which was one day when I saw him at Guildhall; he said, if I would meet him the next day he would give it me, as he had not then a blank cheque in his pocket-book; I saw him the next day, and received the amount I asked for; it was to me, however, a great disappointment to wait till next day - and that such an accident might not again happen, I obtained a blank cheque-book, and always kept in my possession one or two, to avoid a like occurrence; thus, Gentlemen, I have accounted to you how innocently this book came into my possession; let me, therefore, deeply impress upon your minds the evidence adduced against me this day, and judge, Gentlemen, whether any conduct of mine has been like that of guilt; Good God! had I been a guilty man, would I have changed the notes in my own immediate neighbourhood, within a stone's throw of my own house, and that to a man who knew me well. Did I not give my real name and place of abode? - Did I offer to conceal it? - No: Does this, Gentlemen, look like guilt? had I been a guilty man, would I have retained in my possession that book, when I had so many opportunities to have destroyed it - months have passed, and years would have passed, e'er I should have destroyed it, for an innocent heart can see no fear. It is but natural I should enjoy the pleasing hope; I may yet be restored to the bosom of my family, and the society of my friends; but it is still more natural to except that to the remotest period of my existence, hours of reflection must cross my mind, and deep-felt anguish remind me of the unjustness of my persecution. Does not this day, Gentlemen, prove to you a melancholy instance - an instance which must ever remain deeply engraven both on your minds and hearts? that however high may stand your characters, let it he pure as the unsullied snow, or innocent as the light of Heaven, still dark suspicion will find its way to both. Lord Erskine quotes, with much truth and judgment, "That it is far better that nine hundred and ninety-nine guilty men should escape, than one innocent man should suffer."Thus deeply impressing on the mind the value which he sets upon innocence; what reparation, Gentlemen, can man make to man, when the last awful act has taken place upon the unhappy victim of innocence? The least he could do then would be to hide himself for ever from the world, and shudder at his own acts of cruelty and oppression. No tongue can tell, Gentlemen; no language, however eloquent, can convey even a faint idea of the anguish of my heart this day - fondly hoping, yet painfully doubting: picture to yourselves, Gentlemen, what must be my state of feelings; it is your verdict alone that can restore me to my once happy home, or doom me to be an unhappy sufferer of an ignominious death. But, Gentlemen, as just and enlightened men, you will<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090091"/>act with truth and judgment - the life of an unhappy fellow-creature, who deserves the deepest pity and regret, is now at your hands. I now, Gentlemen, conclude my defence - one that is brief, innocent, and true; I have, therefore, nothing left me now to do, but to lay my hand upon my heart, and with a clear and guiltless conscience, humbly and most respectfully await the verdict of a just and upright Jury of my country.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time you saw three on the counter, you did not feel certain whether he had taken up the two? A. I did not, but from what passed afterwards I was convinced he must have taken up two; if I had been certain of it before, I should not have given him another.</p>

            , a grocer of John's-row. Dickins is proprietor of the shop, we assist him; I cannot swear to the prisoner but believe him to be the man who came; he was taken into custody in the shop in my presence; he came on the 16th of March, for half a pound of 7d. sugar, and paid me a good half-crown- I gave him two shillings out of my pocket and 2d in copper; I believe the shillings I gave him were good; he refused one of them, saying it was not a good one; I said I did not give him that shilling, because it appeared to me to be a very had one, and I did not remember having a had shilling in my possession; Coulson then came in and took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What silver had you in the till? A. None at all; I took it from my pocket from a great many more shillings - I never had a bad shilling to equal that in appearance; I venture to swear I had not a bad one in my pocket, the shilling he gave me was never in my hand; it is not impossible that I might have a bad one.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Was the shilling he offered you ever in your pocket? A. Not to my knowledge; I had very little sight of it.</p>

On Sunday afternoon, the 8th of March, about four o'clock, I was in St. Martin's-lane, and saw the prisoner there: I followed her to Bailey's house in Vine-street - I waited till she came out, and then went in and saw Mrs. Bailey, who delivered me a crown-piece; I marked it - and gave it up to Mr. Woods, at Bow-street.

On Tuesday, the 10th of March, about ten o'clock at night, I was in my father's house - the prisoner lodged there - my father had been drinking a little porter, but was sober; the prisoner and I were in another lodger's room down stairs - the prisoner's mother came in, and went up stairs grumbling; she cohabited with my father - she went up stairs muttering; I said to the prisoner, "Your mother has gone up stairs, grumbling as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090094"/>usual" - my father came in shortly after, and went up stairs to his own room; he had not been up stairs long before I heard some China break - I said I would go up to see what was the matter; the prisoner followed me into the room - I saw water scattered all about the room, and the stove pulled out of its place; my father and the prisoner's mother were in the room, with a little boy, eleven years old: I said, "What is all this about?" Mrs. Hales said, "Ask my -;" I said, "Father, will you put up with this usage?" he said, No. he would not; the prisoner said, "Come up stairs with me, mother, and let her and her b - g old father be together" - he and his mother went up stairs; my father followed them up, and said neither him nor his mother should remain in the house, for he would not be so annoyed, and they both should go to the watch-house - he sent the little boy for the watchman, who came and said, "Be peaceable and comfortable together, and have no more words;" my father promised he would not, and while my father was lighting the watchman down, the prisoner caught me by my hair and threw me down on the ground - I screamed out; I had had no quarrel with him before - my father came up with an open razor in his hand - he had not been shaving; he said the disturbance was more than he could bear - the razor was down one pair of stairs before; he said the disturbance was more than he could bear, and he would cut his own throat - I said, "Father, for God's sake don't think of such a thing, and give me the razor;" he gave it me - I shut it up, and put it in my bosom;" the prisoner then picked up a piece of wood which was on the floor in the front of the room, and said, "You old b-r, you are going to cut my throat, are you" - he had seen the razor in his hand, while he was looking for the piece of wood, or something; my father said, "What are you looking for, Jem? what are you going to do? are you going to kill me, I am only an old man?" the prisoner had got the wood in his hand - he said, "You old b-r, I am;" he then took the wood in his hand - it was a thick piece of wood, with a sharp edge; he struck him on the side of his head, and made his head bleed - he fell directly from the blow, and the prisoner went down stairs; he did not strike him a second time -I am quite sure the prisoner picked up the wood after I had put the razor in my bosom: I am sure he must have seen me put it in my bosom - his mother was in the room at the time; he was sober enough to hear me ask my father for the razor - I went down after him, and said,"You wretch, you have knocked my father down, why don't you pick him up;" I did not stop to pick him up, but ran down is a passion after the prisoner - he said it served him right. he had no business to come up with a razor; I staid below about five minutes, and when I got up my father had walked down stairs, and laid on the bed on the first floor - this happened on the second; the prisoner's mother was sitting by his side on the bed, with an oil bottle, which she put to his head - the prisoner went and looked at my father's head; I said, "Is his head hurt" - he pushed me away, and said No, and told me not to frighten myself, he was not hurt; his mother said it was only grazed - I asked if oil was good to put to it; she said Yes, it was good for a graze; I left her with my father, and we all went to bed, and next morning, between eight and nine o'clock, the little boy was sent to tell me Mrs. Hale could not awake my father - I went into his room; he seemed as if he was asleep - this was Wednesday; he died the next day, but never opened either his eyes or mouth - he never spoke after Tuesday night; I fetched two doctors, and he was taken to the hospital, where he died.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Your father was quite sober? A. Yes, and so was I; the prisoner was not quite sober - he and his mother had been out drinking since the morning; I had been to the King and Queen public-house, Norton-falgate, and the Fleur-de-lis public-house, Magpie-alley, with the prisoner, his mother and my father - we went to the King and Queen about one or two o'clock, and staid till between six and seven; we drank gin and beer, but very little, for there was very little money - several of us were drinking together; the prisoner and my father went out to pledge some tools of my father's - he wanted 1s. to get some victuals with; we then all went to the Fleur-de-lis, and had a pot of beer and a quartern of gin - my father left his flute at the King and Queen for a quartern and a half of gin; I cohabited with the prisoner, and my father with his mother- I drank nothing after I got home; the prisoner fetched some gin for my father after he had the blow - he and his mother drank it. I did not tell the doctor my father bad fallen against the fire-place, and cut his head - I said he had been struck with a piece of wood.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said, that at the time the prisoner gave the blow your father had the open razor in his hand, and was going to cut his mother's throat? A. No; I know Boston - he is the prisoner's brother-in-law; I never told him so, nor did I tell him to tell the prisoner not to come home to sleep for fear of a row - my father did not put the razor to his mother's throat; it was the noise and vaxation that made my father talk of cutting his throat - he was a quiet man; I was sober - I did take half a glass of gin.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's mother. In the morning, while I was out, they were out drinking - I was not with them, but between two and three o'clock, when I came home, Harris fetched me himself, and took me to the King and Queen, where they were merry-making: we went from there to the Fleur-de-lis - after a deal of dancing and singing, (the deceased went with us.) he persuaded me to go with him back to the King and Queen between six and seven o'clock - we went from there to the corner of Primrose-street, to the wine-vaults, and then got home between nine and ten; we came home with the deceased - the prisoner had been with us, and also Maria; both of them had been to the King and Queen and the Fleur-de-lis, but I am not certain whether they had been to the wine-vaults - Harris and I came home; the prisoner and Maria came home soon after -I went and lighted the fire in the first floor room, in which the deceased lived; Harris made tea himself, and after tea asked me about some money I promised to lend him - I said I could not get it, and not being able to get him the money, as he had an execution come in, I told him I was quite dissatisfied, and would leave the place and get a room for myself: he asked me if I was determined to do that - I said I was, and he struck me and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090095"/>knocked me down: I cannot say whether any body was present when he did it, or no - neither my son nor Maria were present; there was a noise in the room in consequence of that; I went up stairs - the deceased came up in a very short time with the razor in his hand; my son was in the room before that, going to make his bed to comfort me, because I had been knocked down - the deceased followed me up instantly, with the razor in his hand, and said he would put an end to us all; he ran at me with the razor, and said he would cut my bl-y throat - my son hallooed Murder! I rushed over the arm of the chair, and twisted round to get away from him; when I turned round he was struck over the head - the daughter called out."Oh, father, give me the razor!" and took it out of his hand: I did not see the blow, for he was struck, I suppose as I turned round - he had got his hand to his head, and was walking away; his daughter Maria shut the razor, and put it in her bosom; the deceased went down stairs - he walked down stairs; my son staid in his own room - he was not out of it; the deceased did not fall down at all while he was in the room - they asked me to go down into the deceased's room, as his head was cut, and I went; it was about ten minutes before I got into his room, I observed his head was cut, and he put his hand to it; I saw it was hurt, but it did not bleed much - he was standing up; his daughter was there, and did not know what to put to it - I had a little bottle of oil, which had cured me of a broken arm, and I put some to it; he went to bed, and arose up as the watchman called three o'clock - he appeared ill; he said his head ached very bad - it was bound with his handkerchief; there was no assistance till the afternoon, when I came home - he appeared in the morning to be in a sound sleep, and in the afternoon I went with his daughter to Spital-square; I waited while she went in - she came out, and said the gentleman told her he might never awake again, and advised his being taken to the hospital; he was taken there.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he rushed towards you with the razor in his hand? A. Yes, and said he would do for us all; I never saw any body in such a vehement passion in my life.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Maria share in the drink at the King and Queen? A. Yes, she drank porter and gin, and was dancing and singing; she was there twice, and drank each time - she had beer and gin at the Fleur-de-lis.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When the deceased came up with the razor in his hand, who was nearest to him? A. I was, for I was by the door - it is a smallish room.</p>

My sister lived in Rose-court, I believe, but I did not go to see her till she was in the hospital; I visited her four days there, and saw her the day she died - she was perfectly insensible - the last time I saw her when sensible was on Sunday, the 23d; she had been there about a week; I know she expected she should die - she said so, and begged of me to come and see her, as she was sure she should never come out alive; I asked how it had happened - she said she had lost her shawl, and she was going after it - that a woman named Seddon had got it, and the woman struck her - that she went up the ladder after the woman, and the woman struck her when she was on the ladder, she then fell, and could say nothing more; I asked her if she was drunk before - her answer was, "No, I was perfectly sober."</p>

A young man in light hair came in, and asked for a night's lodging: he sat down, and talked with me about the house, and asked what time they shut up; he said he would go and have a pint of beer, and asked me to go with him; I asked this prisoner to go with us - we went to the Coopers' Arms; I went out, and left all the company there; I went to Smithfield, and then to my lodgings, and just as I got inside the door I was taken - if I had put the property there, it is not likely I should have gone there to sleep - the mistress of the Coopers' Arms said a young man, with light hair, had come in without a hat, and gone out with one on.</p>

On the last Saturday night in February Cole left a small parcel with me, and asked me to take care of it - there were some silver spoons and other things; I cannot swear that these are the spoons - I did not look at the marks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have not hackney-coachmen four days to leave at the office any thing they find? A. Yes, four clear days - that is what I have been given to understand; I have deposited things there myself.</p>
               <p>NEWMAN's Defence. The lady came to me about seven o'clock, and asked the man, who stood first, to be at Little Coram-street at seven; I went, and told Cole to go; he said, "I will," and I said I would go and put the luggage in - there was a large box which he could not get in himself, and I rode with him to get it out; when we took the luggage out, we asked the prosecutrix if it was all right - she said Yes; I asked her to give me 6d., and the coachman stood murmuring for 6d. more, but the door was shut in our faces - I did not know this was in the coach.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Jeffery Smith. I remember forty-eight sacks of potatoes being put into the prisoner's waggon - I helped to load them; the prisoner was not near at the time, but I saw him drive the waggon away, after it had stood there about three hours.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is Mr. Smith's name? A. Jeffery; I have seen his name on the waggon - I was not at the wharf all the time; after the waggon was loaded I was backwards and forwards - there were a great many people in the wharf, perhaps a hundred, doing their work; I recollect the prisoner having two hundred and five cheeses booked to him, and he delivered two hundred and fourteen- I cannot say whether there were forty-eight sacks in the waggon when it went away.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Palmer. On the night in question the prisoner brought the potatoes to my master's; I assisted to unload them - when I had got eight or ten sacks out of the waggon, the prisoner said "I have an empty sack and I will put it into the mouth of your sack, to make all right," I said, I should not do any such thing - I carried in that sack of potatoes, came back, and the empty sack was in the mouth of the next whole sack I was to carry in; he said "You must do it now - you can do it if you like; I will give you a drop of gin to make it all right," I said I should do no such thing, but he must take the sack out, put it in the bottom of the waggon, and I should see if the full number were delivered, when the sacks were counted; as the sacks were emptied they were placed against the counter in the shop; I carried one or two more sacks in - the prisoner again said, "You must do it," and there was the empty sack in the month of another; I said, I should do no such thing - he took the sack out with his left hand, and threw it down into the bottom of the waggon; when the sacks were all taken out, I did not go back to the waggon - there were only forty-seven sacks carried in and emptied.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Whether any person might have emptied a sack of potatoes on the wharf you cannot tell? A. No.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you there when the waggon was loading? A. Yes; that was between one and two o'clock; the waggon left about five - I did not stay by it, I went away; I did not see the prisoner come to it, nor see it go away; I believe there was a tarpauling over it when it stood in the yard in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How were the sacks placed? A. Four rows of nine in each, and twelve laid at the top of them; they were not tied on the top.</p>

            . I was to have had twenty-eight sacks of potatoes brought by the prisoner's cart from Tooley-street, on the 6th of March - I did not see them in the cart so as to notice the number; when the prisoner came to my door there were but twenty-seven sacks in the cart- I said, "You have been making away with one sack;" he said he knew nothing about it, but he supposed if he had lost one, he should have to make it good; I ordered my man to get my horse - I went over the water, and brought the salesman and his clerk; when I returned there were twenty-eight sacks in the cart, but I had taken away the empty sack before I went.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see the cart loaded? A. No; I saw it when it was loaded, but did not count the sacks - he brought a book with the potatoes; I cannot tell who loaded it - I was in the ship at the time it was loaded; I saw the prisoner starting with the cart full - twenty-four is the usual number for a cart to carry; it was overloaded - I think the sacks were not fastened with any ropes; I should think one could not have fallen off, for they can load thirty-two sacks in a cart: I suppose the distance is a mile and a half over the stones.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner in James-street, Covent-garden, and found these gloves on her; she appeared very drunk, but she makes herself so sometimes, and you cannot tell whether she is or is not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went in there the evening before, and purchased a pair of gloves; to the best of my recollection I paid 1s. 4d. for them, and he told me any time I wanted a pair, I was welcome to them - I do not know what made me do it; I am not in the habit of going in there - I have no recollection of being in the office till I was before the Magistrate.</p>

            . I shall be thirteen years of age next September - I am errand-boy to Mr. Hughes. In the afternoon of the 7th of March I received this watch to take to Mr. Walker; I got as far as Smithfield - I asked a person in the street for Greenhill's-rents, where I had to deliver a parcel: he said, "Who do you want?" - I said Mr. Willis, and somehow I mentioned my master's name, but I cannot tell why; that person then went away - a boy came up to me soon after, and said, "I have been to Mr. Hughes, and I came from Mr. Willis, I want the work;" he said he would take it to Mr. Willis, and I might go on my errands - he said, "What is for Mr. Willis?" he took the watch out of my pocket, and said,"I know this is for him" - I said, "I know it is not, if you don't give it to me I will cry thieves;" he gave me sixpence to give it to him - I threw it at him, and said, "If you know where Mr. Willis lives, tell me;" he directed me, but it was wrong - an old woman told me where it was, and I went; Mr. Willis told me to make haste home, and just as I got out of Greenhill's-rents again, I saw the boy - I said, "You thief. you only wanted to steal the things from me;" he said, "Hark at that young thief!" and then the prisoner came up and took my part - he said, "What is the matter, my little boy?" I related the circumstance to him; he said, "Come along with me, and I will see that you are not robbed" - we went on together, and then he stopped; I saw the boy come up and speak to him, and the man who had first spoken to me: they all three seemed to be talking together - the prisoner then beckoned me up to him, and said, "Is not this he?" I said Yes; he said to him, "If you don't go along I will box your ears" - the boy then went away, then the prisoner, the man and I went on a little way together; then the man went away - the prisoner and I were alone, and I asked the way to Red Lion-street, as I was going to Mr. Walker's; he went with me as far as the White Bear public-house, and he said, "Come in here, a friend of mine keeps it - the thieves will think you live here, and they will go away;" he called for a glass of gin and water, and three times he asked me to drink some - I refused, and said I was not accustomed to drink it; he asked me a fourth time, and I took it, but did not drink more than a tea-spoonful; he said, "Drink hearty" - I said I was not in the habit of it; I said, "Where is that other gentleman that you spoke to?" he said, "I expect him here presently" - he then related the circumstance to another man, who was there, and the prisoner said to me, "Let me look at the watch, won't you?" I hesitated, and he said, "Do, in your own hand" - then the other man took it, and said it was very pretty; he tried to open it, and gave it to the prisoner - the prisoner kept trying to open it, and said, "Go, and fetch your hat;" I said, "Give me the watch, if you please" - he said, "Go for your hat;" I said, "I will not go till I get the watch" - then the prisoner said he had given it me; he got up and went out, and the other man held my arm; I bit him over the knuckles, and got out - I cried Stop thief! and a gentleman ran after him; he ran up <placeName id="t18290409-198-crimeloc1128">Crown-street</placeName>

I was with the prosecutor when we fell in with these two girls, and treated them; he was quite sober - we all went into the room together; the prisoner's friend and I went into the next room - I did not see the prisoner run out, but I heard him charge her in the street with having robbed him; we found her at the shop - she said she had left the watch there for 10s.; the woman said she had not: I heard her say at the watch-house, that if the prosecutor would not appear, the watch should be returned.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You said, "If you return me the watch, my friend will not appear," and I said, "How can I give you the watch when I have not got it?" A. No, she said she had left it for 10s.</p>

Yes, five or six doors - that was after Mr. Howle had seen him and I had fetched Forest; he went about twenty-five yards or thereabouts - he did not attempt to run; it was not possible that the handkerchief could have dropped on the ground, and the other take it up.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . On the 10th of August I employed the prisoner to take a horse to Galley-quay, to go to Sunderland; he had two sovereigns to pay the expences - he did not put the horse on board, but put it at livery, and I had the bill to pay for it: I did not see him again till the 21st of March; I put my hand on his shoulder, and said,"Halloo, my friend!" he looked up and said, "Will you have any gin" - I said, "I will gin you to the watchman;" he said he had spent some of the money, and the rest he had lost; I found the horse at livery the day after he took it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not send me to No. 11, Catherine-court, Trinity-square, to ascertain where the vessel laid? A. No such thing; I told you to go and put the horse on board, and I would give you half a sovereign when you had done.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He gave me this horse, and told me to go to the place and inquire; I saw two gentlemen, who said the vessel was not to sail for three days, but I had better wait to see if the gentleman belonging to it would come there; I walked the horse about for an hour, and then the gentlemen came and said, "You had better put that horse up," which I did; I met a shopmate, and got rather too much - I do not know what became of the money, nor myself either hardly; I have since then broken my arm, and have been three months in the hospital - I have not had an opportunity of returning the money; if I had meant to have made a theft of it I should not have left the saddle and bridle in the ostler's hands.</p>

I lost six hanks of iron wire on the 24th of February; I saw Cotterell take it - and while he took it, McCarthy came to the door and said, "Now then, come along, come along;" McCarthy took it on his shoulder; I went and took him with it; Cotterell came for some wire, and remained for it - but I am positive he gave this wire to McCarthy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Had not Cotterell been bargaining for some wire? A. Yes; he had been asking for some; I had seen him over the way at my other premises, and my lad had gone over with him; I think it impossible that McCarthy could hear him ask for it - it was while my lad was gone for some wire that Cotterell gave McCarthy this; there were three candles in the shop, two in the window and one on the counter; I had been lying in wait for them - I ran out of my private door, and collared McCarthy; they could not see me.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mr. Hawkins. On the 24th of February, Cotterell came in the evening and asked me for a quarter of a pound of 16 or 17, meaning some wire - I said, "It is not here, you had better come over the way;" I went with him, and my master followed us - he went with me round to the private door, and I went into the shop; my master went and looked through a crack in the door - I went to serve Cotterell; he took the gauge, and said, "There is none here will do, you had better go and get some;" I went up into the kitchen, and presently I heard a scuffle and came down - I saw my master had got both the prisoners; the wire was on the shop floor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were in the shop when you gave the gange to Cotterell? A. Yes; a person going by might see the bargain we made - he appeared like a customer.</p>

             re-examined. Q. What time was this? A. Between seven and eight o'clock in the evening; McCarthy did not run - he made no resistance; I said, "Now, you villain, I have got you at last;" he said the lad in the shop asked him to take the wire for him, but he did not say where to.</p>

I have known the prisoner about three years and a half; he lived with me on the 31st of March; this money was in a drawer behind the till, in a bag - it contained 5l. 10s., all in silver - but what coins I cannot say; I counted it just before I put it into the drawer; at half-past three o'clock, or a quarter to four, in the afternoon of the 31st of March, which was the last time I saw it; the prisoner was not in the house then, but came home in the evening, between six and seven, and about eleven I missed the money; the prisoner had been out - he had been at home from six to ten o'clock; I think he was at home when I missed my money - he was in a little parlour; I went into the parlour, my wife was there with him - I asked her, in his presence, if she had been to the till, and taken out the silver? she said, No; I said,"Then I am robbed;" my wife came out of the parlour into the shop; the prisoner said he was very sorry to hear it: he stopped about five minutes, and then went to bed; I went up that night to him in bed, and asked him if he had been and taken my money? he said No, and then said, "Why do you think I took it?" I said, "My suspicions are on you, Mr. Godwin;" he asked why I suspected him - I said, I considered he was the person, because there was nobody in the shop but him and my maid; he said he was innocent: after that my wife went up to him - I was not present; he dressed himself, and came down stairs; I then got the watchman to take him to the watch-house; he dressed himself of his own accord; he kept on saying he was innocent of it - he came back again; he was not searched at the watch-house; he stopped in the house a little while, and then I took him and the servant to the watch-house again; he kept denying it; I brought them both back, and then he went to bed - he got up about eight o'clock next morning; the officer came and saw him in the parlour; I saw the officer search him in the dining-room, and find 9s. 5 3/4d. in his pocket - then he took off his trousers and found three sovereigns in one pocket - I said my money was all in silver: he then said he had changed the silver he took from me into gold - we continued to search, and found 20s. in silver in one of his trousers pockets, and 21s. 6d. in the other; he said it was mine, and begged for mercy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Before he said any thing about the money, had you not said it would be better for him to confess, and you would give him a sovereign into the bargain? A. I did; he could have concealed the money if he liked; he bore an honest, industrious character.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was it you said he had better confess? A. The evening that I missed the money; not a word was said to him in the morning.</p>

I saw Quinly with four or five sovereigns, and I saw him hold up two notes - he told me they were sailor's notes; my mother said she thought notes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090112"/>would not go; he said, "Oh, yes, I can get rid of them" -I looked over his shoulder, and saw one with "10" marked on it, and the other with "50;" he took two or three sovereigns out of a small bag - I believe it was all gold; I could not tell how much was in it: they went to another shop, and bought a bed and bedding.</p>

There was a stand of umbrellas in the hall; on the morning of the 3d of March, between seven and eight o'clock, I passed through the hall, and the umbrellas were safe; there was a silk and a cotton one - the dustmen were there, taking away the dust as I went out; I came back about a quarter before eight, and the two umbrellas were gone - I have not seen them since.</p>

            . On the morning of the 3d of March I was in Fenchurch-street, about a quarter before eight, o'clock; I have seen the prisoners about the street before that; I know them by sight - on the 3d of March I saw them near Mr. Teesdale's door at a quarter before eight; they were looking at the houses, as if looking for a number- the dust-cart was before the door; they were talking together - Goodwin went into Mr. Teesdale's house; Cocklin looked all about, and then whistled; Goodwin then came out with two umbrellas under his arm - they walked down London-street; I turned back and told the dustman - I saw nothing more of them; London-street would take them to Crutched-friars - I am quite sure they are the two men; I afterwards went up to George-yard, Wentworth-street, to the George public-house, to show the officers where I thought they would be - I saw them there; I did not go in; I saw them standing at the door - I told the officers, who went in and took them - but they were obstinate, and would not go with them; I am quite sure the prisoners are the persons; the officers were obliged to let go of them - a young woman was there, and they sent out a man to call in assistance; I saw them again next day in George-yard, and knew them to be the men - they said nothing to me; they were taken before the Justice about a fortnight afterwards, and I was certain of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How old are you? A. Thirteen years; the officers could not take them- they forced through the house; I was never taken up for any thing - I gave information; they were followed immediately to their lodgings - no umbrellas were found; I lost sight of them, because I turned round to tell the dustman; one went down London-street, and the other down Mark-lane; that took about five minutes - the public-house is a quarter of a mile off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the officers who the men were? A. I told them where I thought they would be, because I had often seen them about George-yard; I live in George-street - I work for Mr. Smith - I was going over to my grandmother's, in the Borough; I did not follow down London-street: I was never in custody myself.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What is your father? A. A labourer at St Katharine's Docks. I get work where I can- it was three quarters of an hour after that I saw them in George-yard.</p>

            . I am a cellar-man to Lee and Bradshaw, of Mineing-lane. On the 3d of March, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning. I was passing by Mr. Teesdale's door, and saw the two prisoners talking together at the door; I watched them - on my looking at them, Goodwin walked round Mark-lane, and pretended to look at a door opposite for a number; he then came back, spoke to the other, walked into the passage, and came out - I only saw the top of one umbrella; he spoke to Cocklin, and walked round London-street - I went after him with a permit-writer, and near the steps leading to Crutched-friars, I called out "Stop him with the umbrella;" he then began to run, and turned down the steps into Crutched-friars - I ran into the middle of the road, calling out Stop him! I saw Devey running after him; I then left them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see Hewitt? A. No; I was on the other side of the way - I was about twelve yards from the door, when Goodwin went in; there might be another person on the other side of the cart without my seeing him; Goodwin went by the back of the cart, I followed on the opposite; I saw no boy about, but I was noticing the prisoners; I knew Goodwin before - I saw him afterwards at Lambeth-street; I said he was the person - I saw but one umbrella in his hand; when I followed him, he put it down, and held it down - he might have had two.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You saw him near the house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090113"/>then went across the way, so that the cart was between you? A. Yes; he spoke to the other, and immediately walked into the passage - a whistle could have been given without my hearing it; he walked quietly till I called Stop him! and then ran.</p>

            . I am street-keeper of Aldgate. On the morning of the 3d of March I was on duty in Crutched-friars, and pursued Goodwin, whom Drury pointed out - he was running with two umbrellas under his arm, one green and the other a dark colour; he turned through Northumberland-alley, ran across Fenchurch-street into Leadenhall-street, and at last got away; I went back afterwards and gave information - I afterwards went to Mr. Teesdale's house and saw Long; I went with him to George-yard - both the prisoners were drinking at the bar; I went and seized Goodwin by the collar, and told him he had committed the robbery; the patrol seized Cocklin - a dreadful struggle ensued: they called for assistance from a person, I think, named White - there were four or five at the bar; I pulled Goodwin out of the house, the patrol had got Cocklin inside, and they were all upon him - I went to his assistance, and they all retreated out of the back door - I went to Lambeth-street Office and gave information.</p>

            . I am inspector of the watch. I accompanied Devey to the George, George-yard - Long said, "There they are;" Devey took hold of Goodwin and I of Cocklin - he screamed out that I was going to grab him, which means to take him; a woman came to his assistance, and threw herself between us; he broke from me, and ran through the back door of the house - I followed him - three people came to his assistance and rescued him from me a second time; I lost him, and did not see him again till the 17th of March; I knew him again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You seized him without saying a word? A. I had my staff in my hand, and said, "I wanted him;" he called out that I was going to grab him; that could be heard outside the house; I did not know Long before, and never knew any thing against him.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. On the 11th of March I went to a lodging-house in Wentworth-street, and found the two prisoners in the same room; I told them I came to apprehend them for a crack down the road - that means housebreaking; Cocklin said, "If that I the case we will go with you quietly; but if it is for the City job we are sure to be lugged;" which means transported - they went quietly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. A crack means breaking open a house, not going into an open door? A. No; it means a regular burglary: I did not take them at their regular lodgings, they were out of the way; I knew their lodgings, and searched them, but found nothing.</p>
               <p>JURY to LONG. Q. Did you know any thing of the prisoners before to induce you to watch them? A. No; I watched them because I thought they were after no good; I had seen them about; they had been pointed out to me; I knew they lived in Cage-street, Wentworth-street.</p>

               <p>MRS. MUIRHEAD. This is one of my seals; this slide, key, and ring were all attached to my watch - I know them by the pattern; I went after the prisoner's character, and was satisfied with it.</p>

I said,"You had better use better words and pay me for my coals;" for she owed me 8d. - she said, "I will have your life before I will pay you;" as I was sitting against the window they put some flour all over my clothes, and threw some in my eyes, then threw me backwards, throttled, and robbed me of a sovereign and a sixpence - the prisoner was kneeling on my breast, and was choking me; I felt her hand in my pocket - I could not call out, because she strangled me; there were a good many persons there in the same line - she keeps a bad house; there were two or three men there - they went and told my wife, who came, caught hold of her, and broke her hold: I did not go to tell any officer - next morning my eyes were so bad that I could not get up; before I got better she went and got a warrant for me, and when I told my tale they committed her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many people were in the room when she choked and robbed you? A. Five, six or seven - there was not a single man besides myself; two men went and told my wife, but they did not see any part of the row - after they went out of the house I did not knock the prisoner down, I am sure; I could not go that night to an officer or a Magistrate - I could not see out of my eyes; I did keep a house, but I had left it that day - I have had two lodgers, but I never took in lodgers by the hour, nor by the day; I have by the week, never by the night - I have been six or seven months in the potatoe business; I cannot tell whether I called for a glass of gin in the house - I never drank one; if I had asked for ten glasses of gin I could have had them - I have understood the prisoner's husband has died since this happened.</p>

Yes; I did not state the prisoner asked us to give him change for a sovereign; he wanted a sovereign for silver; he spoke English very imperfectly - we had some difficulty in understanding what he wanted; he pointed to the drawer, that he wanted 10s. for a half-sovereign; I saw the two half-crowns and the crown in his hand, and some more silver; I swear I saw shillings and sixpences in his hand - there were, I suppose, 5l., 6l., or 7l. in the till - it was not so very large; a female was on the same side of the counter as he was - he could see her if he looked round; she is not here, she has left her lodgings; the prisoner made great resistance; Mr. Hows jumped over the counter and seized him, and they were scuffling when I left; he put his hand across to show what sort of silver he wanted - the counter is about four feet high, and about two feet and a half wide - and the till was opposite him.</p>

            . I was sent for, and found the prisoner and Mr. Hows scuffling together; I took the prisoner into the back parlour, and from his left-hand waistcoat pocket I took 2l. 13s. in silver - there was one crownpiece, six half-crowns, and shillings and sixpences; I began to feel at his trousers pocket, and from his left-hand, trousers pocket he drew a purse which contained money -I took it to Marlborough street, where Mr. Plank opened it - it contained thirty-six sovereigns and a half; I do not know why the woman is not here; I went to her lodgings several times, and last Saturday the landlady told me that a Jewess had been there and given her money.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had not the prisoner a pack of goods near him? A. Yes, he had: I did not search his coat pockets till we got to Marlborough-street.</p>

Hayter came and took my lodging on the 25th of March - she asked if I would let her husband look at it; Rawlins stood opposite: she beckoned him up - he said, "My dear, do you like the room?" she said, "Yes - it is 4s. 6d. if I find sheets and 5s. if I don't;" they came in the same night, and were there all the week; they went in and out several times -Hayter came on the Saturday evening, about six o'clock, and said, "Is my husband here?" I said No; she said,"What a lucky house your's is - my husband has met with a person who paid him half a sovereign, and I am to have another presently, and will pay you;" the articles stated were my property, and are all lost.</p>

On the 16th of March I was standing at my own house; the prisoner ran by with this till, and the money rattling in it; it was just after four o'clock; he was about four hundred yards from the prosecutor's - I pursued him down a mews; he threw the till into an area, at the corner of Euston-square and Drummond-street, and most of the money went into another area; I took him about one hundred yards further, without losing sight of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was never inside the shop, and know nothing of it; I was going to a gentleman of the name of Clarkson, second mate of the Repulse; a man came behind me, and threw this till into the area - there was a cry of Stop thief! I ran after the man, and this gentleman took me.</p>

On Saturday, between two and three o'clock, the prisoner brought this pot, and asked me if I would buy it - I told her to untie it, and asked what she wanted for it; she said 7s. - I said it was too much, which it was - it weighed about 14 lbs., with the iron; I gave her 5s. 6d. for it, and sold it for 6s.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.

The officer has it; I had a communication with Hillman before I saw Payson, but not before I sent to him - I did tell Hillman that if he would confess the extent to which he had been robbing us, I would not prosecute him; and he said, what Hargrave had was all he had robbed us of.</p>

            . I deal in earthenware, and live in Sandy-street, Bishopsgate. I have seen the prisoners, but not in company - I dealt with Payson once only, which was on the 26th of March; I bought twelve dozen of plates, five dozen of egg-cups, and four dozen and half of salts; I paid 1s. 3d. a dozen for the plates - it was no very great bargain - I could buy them at Mr. Mansfield's for 1s. 4d.; I have the articles now at home - I have sold about a dozen egg-cups; Mr. Mansfield saw me going along, and told me they were his; Payson told me he had bought them at Mr. Bullen's sale.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. RYLAND. Q. Where does Mr. Mansfield live? A. In Barbican; I bought them between eleven and twelve o'clock, and he met me about one - I had seen Payson the day before in Petticoat-lane, where I stand every afternoon to sell goods; he asked me if I would buy some blue muffin-plates, and told me he lived at No. 3, Three Tun-court, Redcross-street - I offered him a 5l. note; there was some difficulty about changing it, and I went to Mr. Mansfield for change as I deal there - I told him I should go there; he made no objection - I returned in about two hours, and he was still there.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. RYLAND. Q. Did Payson tell you where he lodged? A. Yes; I did not know him before - it is a small room; the things were mostly under a bedstead - there were a number of basons in a closet, some earthenware in other parts of the room, and images on the mantel-piece; the other articles were on a sofa under a coat.</p>

            . I am a marshalman. I watched the premises on the 24th of March - I took the prisoner on the opposite side of the way, and took him into his master's house; I saw him put his hat on a chair on his left hand - I said he should not put any thing down; I stopped down, and when I got up I saw this packet of pencils in the chair on his left hand - I did not see it come out of his hat; there were no persons present but Mr. Sewell and the prisoner - I searched the prisoner's house in Castle-street, Finsbury. to which he directed me, where I found these other articles; here is a metal tea-pot, a tea-tray, combs, brushes, phosphorus-boxes, and other things, and a gold ring.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. RYLAND. Q. Have they been claimed? A. Yes, by Mr. Sewell; I believe there were two or three plated spoons which Mr. Sewell said he could not swear to, and I did not take them - I took the prisoner, into the back parlour at his master's, Mr. Sewell went up with us, but he got into the room before me; the room had been empty - I cannot tell how the parcel came on the chair.</p>
               <p>MR. SEWELL re-examined. Q. What does the parcel contain? A. Pencils; there is a mark on the paper; most of the other things had a private mark on them; I believe them to be ours:; the prisoner sent two letters the next day - one to my mother, and one to myself; I have seen him write, and believe they are his writing - this is the one to my mother - ( reads.)</p>
               <p>HONOURED MADAM, - On account of my unfortunate wife and children, I hope you will not press this charge against me; particularly when I assure you I intended to replace the articles, or to have given you the value for them. I hope you will take my unfortunate case into your consideration, and treat me with that lenity I know your feeling heart would wish; and, as in duty bound, I shall ever pray, Your's, J. HILL.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. RYLAND. Q. Was there a relative of your's who lodged in the prisoner's house? A. Not that I know of; I have been in the country a good deal lately; I did not know till the other day that my mother used to visit a person at the prisoner's.</p>

            . I am a porter. I was going into the King's Head public-house, to light my pipe - I met Tom Shields, who asked me to take a drop of beer; I came out, and he said, this box was to go to No. 112, Newgate-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090125"/>street, and if I would take it he would give me 1s.; I took it - the prisoner said nothing to me about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner afterwards? A. Why, I did see him - but Shields is the man who employed me; the prisoner never mentioned a sentence to me concerning the box whatever; Shields was the man who employed me and paid me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean you never talked to the prisoner about it afterwards? A. I did not speak a word to him about it nor he to me; I met him on the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you nod to each other, or say "How do you do?" A. It might be the case, for all that I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he mention about the oranges or the box? A. No; not who employed me - nor any thing about it: I did meet him on my journey from Pudding-lane to Newgate-street - I had the box on my knot; I cannot tell which side of the way he was; I cannot tell which way he was going - I knew where I was going myself; I rather think he might be about Cheapside.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pitch at all? A. Why I got rather tired, and the prisoner took it on his head, as I was rather tired - he carried it from Cheapside to where I was ordered to take it - to assist me, I rather thought, from where I pitched it.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you tell me that you did not know that you had spoken to each other? A. I did not mention that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know you are bound by your oath to speak the whole truth, as well as nothing but the truth - then the prisoner, when you pitched, and were heavy loaded and fatigued, carried it to this place, did he? A. Yes, he did take it on his knot, in Cheapside, to where I had been ordered to take it, to No. 112, Newgate-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is Shields here? A. I understand not; he employed me to carry this box, and said it belonged to a countryman, who was rather drunk, and could not carry it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner near Shields at that time? A. No; Shields was the person who said he would pay me, and did pay me - it is customary for us porters to give one another a lift, all in good-nature; I cannot say what it contained; I dare say oranges - I did not look into it -Shields agreed to give me one shilling, and he gave me half a crown.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner never gave you a farthing? A. No; he has often given me a lift when I have been tired - I have known him three years; he never did assist me before, nor I him; I only meant to say that us porters are in the habit of doing it - Shields paid me when I came back; we did not speak a word to one another going back; it was not Shields who helped me; I never saw him till I got back and he paid me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner, directly or indirectly, employ you to carry that box? A. He never did: I was examined before the Lord Mayor; I told there every word that I have to-night - I said Shields agreed for 1s., and gave me 2s. 6d., and that the prisoner gave a lift on the road.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

On Sunday night, or Monday morning, the 30th of March, between one and two o'clock, I was going home, and O'Donnell spoke to me, at the end of Fleet-street; he asked me where I was going - I never saw him before; I am certain he is the man; I told him I was going home; he said he would give me half-a-crown if I would take a walk along with him - I said I knew no place on this side the water, and he said he did; I turned, and went with him; he took me to <placeName id="t18290409-286-crimeloc1621">Lion and Lamb-court, Golden-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. Are you sure of O'Donnell doing what you have mentioned? - A. Yes; there were two besides him - I could not swear to either of them; I cannot say which of them pulled my things off: they were holding me on the ground while my things were being pulled off - O'Donnell held me on the ground while my things were pulled off; they were all three nearly together; while I was on the ground, O'Donnell struck me several times on my head, while I was being thrown down, and while I was down, and he put his hand over my mouth and nose - the other two men seemed to be in the place opposite when they began to pull me: I had a shilling and sixpence tied up in the corner of the handkerchief, which they took from me- I should not know either of the other two men: they all went into No. 8; the watchman came up - I was then on my hands and knees, trying to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090127"/>get up; I told him what had happened; he looked about for my things, but nothing was to be found; I also looked about for them - the watchman had a lantern, and there was a gas-light in the middle of the court; the watchman then went into No. 8, and I saw the prisoner Daley standing at the window of the first-floor, with his coat off - the house is only one story high; O'Donnell was lying in bed, with all the clothes covered over him; the watchman pulled the clothes down, but he could not make any sense of O'Donnell; he pretended to be very much intoxicated - I said, directly I saw him, that he was the man; they took Daley to the watch-house, and me also; they went back, and brought O'Donnell -Cooper, the officer, the watchman, the patrol, and Finch, were there; they all went into the house; Wood was also in the house. I believe, when Daley and I came down stairs with the watchman, my things laid opposite the door - I saw my bonnet, handkerchief, shawl, and pattens there.</p>


               <p>Cross-examained by MR. BARRY. Q. With whom do you live? A. With my brother and sister - they lodge there; they lived at first in Brunswick-street: I had moved with them from there to this house, a week before -I board and lodge with them: I am an unfortunate girl; I have lived at St. Luke's workhouse since this; the Magistrate thought proper to send me there - my brother and sister know where I am; I had left home about eight o' clock that evening, or between eight and nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you asked at the office at what time you left home, and said, at twelve at night? A. No, I was never asked at what time I left home; there was a second hearing; I was not then asked at what time I left home -I do not recollect your asking me the question; twelve o' clock is generally the time I return - I had the shilling and sixpence in my handkerchief; I had not received that out of doors that night - I dined and had tea at home: I had been in company with a person before, on the other side of the water; I had only been in company with one; it was a young man; I cannot say what time I spent with him - I did not drink with him at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know how many hours you were in his company? A. I was not "hours" at all, nor yet an hour; I cannot say how long I was with him - O'Donnell was a perfect stranger to me; I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the man who spoke to you in Fleet-street, a person named Burke? A. No, O'Donnell is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. When the patrol spoke to you, what was the reason you went away without waiting for your half-crown? A. The patrol said I had better go home, and I took his advice - I had not got the half-crown; I turned away, and the patrol saw me below the brewhouse; when O'Donnell followed me, I refused to return at first, and then went, as he said he would give me another shilling - I did not at first object to go for the half-crown; that I recollect - I will say nothing but the truth; I do not know that I objected at first to have half a crown; there is one gas-light in the court; I do not know whether there is more - I had never been there before; I spoke to no woman on the road; O'Donnell spoke to no woman but myself - O'Donnell put his hand on my shoulder, and tried to push me into a place; I was not pushed in, as I put my hand to the side of the door, and hindered them from getting me in - it is a public privy; I saw nobody about till I felt two men pulling me - I cannot swear to those men; Daley is as near the height of one of them as possible - he is a common-sized man.</p>
               <p>Q. Are we to understand you were pushed by one, and pulled by two inside, and yet they could not get you in? A. I am not certain the two were inside: they did not get me in, for O'Donnell knocked me down in the court - I called out, when I found there was more than one - that was before a hand was put before my mouth, and O'Donnell after that cried out, "Stop the b-y b-cb's mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not understand that was to stop your calling? A. I thought it might be so, till he put his hand over my mouth and nose; I heard nothing about a lark - no liberties had been taken with my person that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the Magistrate the persons you could not identify were pulling your legs and shoulders while you were on the ground? A. Yes, I did; the watchman and others searched for my things before I went into the house, and when we came out, they were found on the ground; the patten laid at a little distance, but the other things were thrown in a heap together, not tied up.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people had assembled at that time? A. I did not see any; I did not notice a woman looking out of her window; I think there are houses only on one side of the court; when I went into the house, I said I thought Daley looked like one of the men; I did not say Sheridan, the landlord, was one - I spoke to nobody but O'Dounell; I said Daley looked like one, but I could not swear to him; when O'Donnell came into the watch-house I said I knew his voice, and he was the man; I did not say I knew Daley's voice; I did not speak to one Kenney.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 30th of March, at a quarter before two o'clock in the morning, I was coming down Playhouse-yard: I heard some foot-steps at the end of Lion and Lamb-court, which is in St. Luke's,and in Middlesex; I called the wathchman to bring his light - he came with his light, and three or four men and one woman were in the entry; I asked the woman what she was doing there, she said she was brought there by one of the men; I told her she had better go home, and she walked away; I immediately asked the men if they lived there - they said they did live in that court; I told them it was time they should be at home and when I came down to the end of the yard, the girl was standing by a post, and asked me to direct her to Blackfriars-road; I knew three of the men - that was Daley, O'Donnell, and Burke; I knew them by seeing them come out of their place to go to work of a morning; I went a little way down the lane, with the prosecutrix, pointed to the bottom of the lane, and directed her home; I crossed over to the other side of the way, and while standing there I saw O'Donnell come out of Playhouse-yard, and go in the same direction as the girl had gone, and in two or three minutes I saw her and him returning up the lane again - walking arm-in arm; they came up to Playhouse-yard, and turned the corner again; and after turning the corner, there were three or four of the same party standing talking to the watchman on the opposite side of the way; and in the course of half a minute, they left him and proceeded up the court after the man and woman; I im<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090128"/>mediately proceeded over to another watchman, who was coming down the lane; I and two watchman went from the other side of the way to the corner of the yard, and heard a person screaming; we ran up Lion and Lamb-court, and saw the prosecutrix rising from the ground, apparently very much dejected, her hair very much disordered, and all over mud and wet, she told me something, and made her complaint to me; we went to search if we could find any of the property she had lost but found none - she pointed to a house, we went in, and while looking below (there was a man and his wife in bed) we heard a window pulled up, and footsteps up stairs; we immediately went up stairs and met Daley coming from towards the window - the prosecutrix then came up stairs and said that was one of them, that was Daley, and on looking round there were some more men asleep in a bed; she did not point out any of them, but on the third bed, on coming towards the door, we saw a heap on the bed, and on pulling the coverlid down we found O'Donnell underneath, with his clothes on; we tried to awake him, to get sense into him, but he appeared quite speechless, we could not get a word from him - the man and woman who were below came up stairs, and said he had not been out of bed since nine o'clock that morning; on taking hold of his hand to look at it, the sleeve of his jacket was all over wet mud - we took Daley into custody, and brought him out at the door, and on coming out of the door of the house the watchman pointed to the things that laid in the court; (there were three beds in the room, the prosecutrix did not recognise any body on the second bed); the watchman picked the things up and took them to the watch-house with Daley, and as we turned to come on I saw a handkerchief lying down, which I picked up, and told the girl to tie it round her neck, which was quite bare; and when we came just to the bottom of the court I met Cooper, the inspector; I delivered the girl to him, and remained close in sight of the premises till he returned again with the watchman - they went into the house and brought O'Donnell down, and took him to the watch-house - I remained behind; I know nothing more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you tell the prosecutrix she had better go home? A. I did; she stood with O'Donnell close at the corner; the others were at a distance from them, at the turn of the court - she said one of the men had brought her there.</p>
               <p>Q. Then of course she gave you to understand there were other men there? A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What were her words? A She said she had been brought there by one of the men: those were her words; that was not the first time, but when we went to her assistance - when I first went to her she said nothing about any men.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. She pointed out O'Donnell in bed? A. We turned the clothes down, and she said she could swear that was one of the men; we could not make him understand, speak, or move - she said Daley was one of the men, that was before we saw O'Donnell - the man and woman who came up were both undressed; there were seven inmates altogether - I do not know their names; I knew Sheridan by sight, as I had his brother in custody a little while ago; I did not know him by name till then - I have ascertained that he keeps the house; I have been a patrol these five years - I believe there are twelve houses in the court, several of them had their windows up and people looking out; I saw none of the inhabitants of the court down below except the people of that house; a window next door but one to the house was open, and a person looking out at No. 10 - the next house to that is empty; there is a small gutter in the court - I found the handkerchief close to the end of the gutter, it was a pocket handkerchief - I found one patten lying by the side of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. She pointed out Daley as one of the men? A. Yes; he was coming from the window, with his coat off - he was the first we saw on going into the room.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the morning of the 30th of March, about a quarter before two o'clock, the patrol called me for a light - I was opposite Playhouse-yard; I went up to Lion and Lamb-court with him, and saw O'Donnell, Daley and Burke, all three standing there together - I knew Burke before, but not the other two; I am certain of the prisoners - the patrol told the prosecutrix to go home; she went away -O'Donnell went after her in a few minutes, and I saw him come back with her; Burke came down Playhouse-yard over to me, and spoke to me - then Daley and two or three more, who were standing there, went up Playhouse-yard; I had spoken to them before that - I heard a scream of Watch! called out; I went up Lion and Lamb-court, where the scream came from, and the prosecutrix was just getting up; she pointed to No. 8 - I went in there with the patrol and another watchman; I saw Daley, who had just got his coat off, going to bed - several more were in bed there; I saw O'Donnell in bed with the clothes covered all over him - Coombs said Daley was one of them; we took him to the watch-house with her; as we went along Daley said it was not him, and said, "Here is a shilling for you to drink, it was not me, and I nudged you when you were there; it was O'Donnell;" O'Donnell was in bed covered with the clothes, and appeared to be very much in liquor; Coombs said at the watch-house that she could swear to him by his voice - she had pointed him out when he was in bed; when we came down, Finch picked up a shawl, bonnet, pair of pattens, and a handkerchief, and gave it to me to take to the watch-house - they were all rolled up together.</p>

I went to Lion and Lamb-court on Monday morning, the 30th of March, about ten minutes before two o'clock; the patrol came to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090129"/>me - I went into No. 8, and saw Daley standing by the window with his coat off; the girl gave charge of him, and I took him to the watch-house - I pulled the bedclothes down, and saw O'Donnell there dressed; I tried to rouse him - he pretended to be so intoxicated, no sense could be beat into him; the girl saw me pull the clothes down; I felt wet mud on his nose - the girl charged Daley first; I came back after taking him, and took O'Donnell to the watch-house; the girl pointed him out in the bed, but he seemed so drunk we could do nothing with him till after I took the other to the watch-house; I picked up the shawl in the court, and gave it to the patrol; I saw the bonnet lying in the gutter, but nothing else; I did not see the handkerchief - they were right opposite the door of No. 8.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far is the gutter from the house? A. A very little distance - the court is very narrow; I found the shawl very near the gutter, the bonnet lying in the gutter, and a patten was found in the gutter, but I did not see it - I went to the watch-house; Coombs said nothing in my presence of knowing any body's voice.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the watch. On the morning of the 30th of March, about two o'clock, I was in Playhouse-yard, and met Daley in the custody of Finch and Woods: I took the girl to the watch-house - I afterwards went to No. 8, Lion and Lamb-court, and saw O'Donnell in bed, with all his clothes on except his flannel jacket, and covered over with the bed clothes; I shook him, and told him it was of no use to play tricks, and if he did not come out of bed I would pull him out; he got out of bed, and put his flannel jacket on - he then put one of his boots on up stairs, and the other down; I took him to the watch-house - the minute he entered the watch-house he began to speak; the prosecutrix said,"That is one of them, I can swear to him by his voice" - she had not seen his face then; one of the arms of his jacket was wet, and the other was wet round the cuff; the prosecutrix's things were delivered to me at the watch-house- the bonnet and shawl were delivered to me by Brown, the watch-house keeper; the handkerchief was given to me by the prosecutrix - she had it round her neck when I took her to the watch-house; Brown is not here; I received them in the watch-house - the patrol gave me one patten in Playhouse-yard, and Brown the other; I have had them ever since - I found no money in the handkerchief; there was no knot in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there the slightest appearance of there having been a knot in it? A. It was as she gave it to me in the morning when she was going away to the office, just before eleven o'clock; Brown was not bound over to come here.</p>

            . I live at No. 20, Playhouse-yard, which is five houses from Lion and Lamb-court - I know No. 8 there. On the morning of the 30th of March, after two o'clock, I saw the prosecutrix going into No. 8 with the watchman, and as soon as she entered the lower room I saw the one pair of stairs window open, and saw a bundle chucked out of the window, but what was in it I cannot tell - Daley chucked it out; I knew him before - I have often seen him in the court, and at the door; there was a candle on the window-ledge, so that I could see him; I am certain it was him - he had no coat on; it was a small sized bundle; I cannot say how large, because I only saw it by the light of the candle - I could not see where it fell, because there is a privy between my window and the house, so that I could not see the bottom of the court - I had to look sideways; my house is on the opposite side, four or five yards from No. 8; No. 7 is directly opposite to me - only one side of the court is called Playhouse-yard, and the other Lion and Lamb-court; I have not to turn a corner to go to the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you first give an account of this? A. On Tuesday I went to Cooper's house; I did not call out that a bundle was thrown out, because I did not know the girl had been robbed - I heard a scream; there was a stir in the court - I am a shoe-binder, and single; I have lived there nearly four years - I was in bed, but heard screams, and got up; I am an English woman - a great many Irish live in the court; I saw the prosecutrix in the watehman's hands, and could have called over to them if I had liked; they were not above five yards from me.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. When you saw the bundle thrown out, was the patrol outside or inside? A. Inside; I remained at the window till he and the prosecutrix came out - I spoke of this on Monday; but did not tell Cooper till Tuesday.</p>

               <p>DALEY'S Defence.

               <p>COURT. Q. How long have you known him? A. Nineteen years - he has been in my employ; he kept my books for the last twelve months - I had frequent occasion to see him write; I suppose the whole of the order to be his hand-writing - it is a good deal like his writing - I have trusted the prisoner to receive and pay money, 40l. or 50l. at a time; he always did it faithfully - he behaved honestly; he had been very much reduced till he came to my house - I used to employ him as well as I could.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 4th of March, in Osborne-street, St. James', at Mr. Salter's house; I searched him after I got to the office, and found this paper, among a number of others; this induced me to go to Mr. Beswick's - I told him, both before I found the paper, and after, that he was charged with forging certain orders; he wished me to allow him to put that paper into the fire; I told him he had had plenty of time to destroy any thing he chose before I took him - I then placed him in the back office, among a number of other prisoners: I observed him watching me very closely - I had occasion to go into the Magistrates' room, and after returning from the Magistrates' room, I found he was gone from where I had placed him: the place he had been in was not locked; I immediately ran out of the office door, and observed him turning the corner into Blenheim-street, about fifty yards from the office - I followed, and overtook him; I have known him twenty years - he bore an excellent character.</p>
               <p>The order was here read, as set out in the indictment; the paper found on the prisoner was verbatim the same, except not being headed "St. Ann's Society."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am unprepared with Counsel, having had so little time; I never knew a word of this charge till I had a note from the solicitor on Saturday - the keeper of Clerkenwell prison did not know I was to be tried here; I understood it was for a fraud.</p>

I was asked about the indorsements; there is no stamp to it - my father did accept a bill, of which this is a verbatim copy, but without a stamp - the original has never been presented for payment, but we have bad a letter about it; this is the original bill (looking at one produced by the prisoner); my mother is nearly blind, and did not know but she was paying the original bill - I have a letter stating that the bill was not paid, and we must look to it; we received that the next evening.</p>

               <p>Q. Well, it was not paid in full? A. All but 3s.; the original bill was given to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Have there not been continual quarrels between your family and the prisoner, about law bills? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the letter written before the bill became due? A. After; the post-mark is the 22d of November, but the letter is not dated - one came the same morning from the holder of the bill; I and my brother William paid the original bill to the prisoner - he would not take it without my indorsement; there is a receipt for 7l. on the copy.</p>

No, he laid it on the table; I doubled it up, and put it away; but next morning, I found it was not the right bill - we have had a letter from one Rogers, demanding payment of the original bill; the prisoner came twice before, I paid it; he never sent for the 3s.; we sent to the King's Bench to get the bill, but he would not give it up.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He could have avoided all proceedings by handing you back the original bill? A. Yes, I told him so; Pettit and him have not been at law - he was employed by a married sister of Pettit's - I live in Drummond-street, Euston-square; sometime after the warrant was lodged, he shewed me the original bill; he said he had got it back, and would send a person to meet Pettit about it, which he did.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long did he stay in the warehouse that night? A. Two or three minutes; he has staid as long as that before; I did not suspect any harm of him; I locked the front and back door - the servant could go down a flight of stairs and go out without coming to the warehouse; it is a large house - there are four rooms and a shop.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know the prisoner's business? A. Yes; he is a silk-weaver, and has manufactured his own work; I have known him manufacture hatters' hands - that is never called ribbon; Towers had heard I had the goods to sell - he did not suspect me.</p>

I live at No. 45, Phoenix-street, with my father and mother - I know the prisoner, but not before the robbery; I live next door to Mr. Towers - I am not sure he is the man I saw; Towers' house was broken open on the Saturday night, and on that night I saw this young man come from up the court; I am not sure he is the man - he came from up the court and went across the street (Towers' back door opens into that court) - it was a little after eight o'clock; he had a bundle under his arm; I saw a man with a long brown great coat come up the court about two or three minutes after - he came from the same court as the person whom I took to be the prisoner - it was the first one who had the bundle; I saw a man with a red coat and a shiny hat walking up and down by the prosecutor's street-door; that man went towards Brick-lane, the other two went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090134"/>up Farthing-street - I did not follow either of them; I was cleaning the threshold of the door - I saw Towers and his son that night, and told them what I had seen; I told Towers how the man with the bundle was dressed - which was in a blue coat, but that I was not sure that I should know him again; I saw the prisoner at Worship-street, and told the gentlemen that I was not sure it was him - and that I did not think it was him.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Is the court a thoroughfare? A. No; there are about eight houses - the doors of which open to the court.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer of Worship-street. On the 17th of March I took the prisoner at his own house in Princes-court, Gibraltar-walk, Bethnal-green; I asked him if he had sold any ribbon or hat-hands to Appleby - he said he had; I asked him where he got it - he said he found it about a fortnight ago on Farthing-hill; I shewed him one of them; I told him I should take him on suspicion of the robbery - Towers was with me; he denied the charge - I went up stairs to the room which he said he lived in, and found a quantity of cotton and a small quantity of silk, some in skeins and some on bobbins; he said they were all his own, and he had bought them; I told him he had better produce the bill of parcel before the Magistrate; the prosecutor said he had lost things of the quality, but would not swear to them; he identified the pieces of hands before the Magistrate - I got one of them from Hicks, and the other from the prosecutor himself.</p>

            . These hat-bands were manufactured by a person I employed; I know the make, because it is one colour on the edge, and another on the body of the work; it was returned to my hands by Appleby's brother a month before the robbery - it was damaged, which was the reason I had them laying by me; I am certain they were in my own possession before the house was broken open - the person who manufactured them is not here; I had seen it that day in a large drawer, with thirty-two pieces, which were taken at the same time (looking at the hat-band); the drawer they were in was about half way open, and the lock hanging on one screw; it was in its proper state when I left the house - the prisoner's father was taken into custody, and discharged; he had never worked for me - some things were found in a room in the father's house, but the prisoner said he rented it of his father.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. How many locks of drawers had been forced open? A. Only one; it had been done without much noise, for they had laid mats on the floor, to prevent their being heard - a noise would not be heard on the top story; we had a suspicion of the very man who manufactured these, but did not have him taken up; he had an opportunity of knowing the premises - he did not work for me at the time, and did not come above once a week - it is two years since he worked for me; he then worked in my shop - what I speak to this by is the difference in colour; it was a mistake of mine in putting two colours in - I never saw such before, nor has any other man I should think; I heard the noise about eight o'clock- I only heard one noise.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Had you sold them to Appleby's brother? A. He ordered it of me, and returned it on my bands on account of the badness of colour; and after the robbery they were taken to his brother for sale; he knew it, and gave me information.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Is that the band you received from the prisoner, and offered to your brother, which he rejected? A. This is one of them - I did not take them to my brother, but sent them to him; he did not choose to have them; I could tell they were not well manufactured the instant I saw them; I shewed them to several hatters, who rejected them, as being badly made.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is that the first badly manufactured article you ever saw? A. No, nor the last.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you ever see any with the same defect in it? A. Never exactly, but very similar; it would be foolish to manufacture as this is - the body of the work is good, but the edges are another colour, thick, and clumsy; it is possible to make the same mistake.</p>

               <p>Q. At what time did you see him? A. My husband had just come home from work; it had just gone eight o'clock when he came and knocked at our door, and remained there with my piece, while I went to market, and stopped with me, when I came back, till twenty minutes past nine; I then went with him to his mother's, to lend her my cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did you go out to market? A. Just as the bell had done ringing eight - he came in as I went out: my house is about two hundred yards from the Half Moon; the bell generally rings a quarter of an hour - I left him in the house, and found him there when I returned.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. On what day was this? A. Saturday, about a month before he was taken up; I was at Worship-street when he was examined - but was not called in; I recollect it was Saturday, the 14th, because my niece's birth-day was the next day - I do not recollect that Saturday by any particular name; he frequently visited us, being a neighbour's child - he came two or three times a week; I had nothing particular to induce me to recollect the day more than I have said.</p>
               <p>Q. If he was in the habit of calling on other days, why do you recollect that day? A. Yes; but that night he did not wish me good night, as I had to go to his mother's to take her a cloak; I do not keep my niece's birth day - I did not invite any friends.</p>
               <p>Q. What then makes you recollect it was the Saturday before her birth-day? A. I heard of this robbery being done on the following week - I did not hear he was suspected for a month after; I have no particular reason for recollecting his calling that night - he called on other Saturdays; his mother came that day to ask me to lend her a cloak, to go to their uncle's next morning - that was about six o'clock in the evening - she had never borrowed it before.</p>
               <p>Q. What enables you to say it was that particular Saturday? A. I have no particular reason; she returned it on Monday the 16th; I do not generally know the date of the month - I did not invite the prisoner or his mother to come on my niece's birth-day.</p>
               <p>Q. Then is there any thing particular to lead you to remember the day, besides it being the day before your niece's birth-day? A. No - only she named to me that it was that day; the prisoner's mother told me it was Saturday the 14th; I have no reason for believing it was then, except from what she told me; the prisoner was taken up on a Tuesday, and after that his mother told me it was the day she borrowed the cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not have recollected it unless the mother told you? A. No - I should not.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. When was your birth-day? A. On Sunday, the 15th; the prisoner often visited me - he was paying his addresses to me; he generally came on Saturdays more than on other days - but not at my aunt's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where then did you meet him? A. Not particularly on Saturday - I was not always at my aunt's; I lived there - I do not recollect his visiting me any where else; he sometimes met me at the corner of the street - not always at my aunt's; I recollect this day, because it was Valentine's-day, and my birth-day was the 15th - he did not come the next Saturday, not that I recollect; he did not come every Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss him on any Saturday? A. Yes, but not on any particular Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you remember this Saturday? A. Because next day a neighbour's daughter told me Towers had been robbed overnight - she lives next door to Towers: I did not tell any body the prisoner was with me that night, because nothing was said about him - I heard of his being taken up on the day he was taken, and said he was with me from a few minutes past eight o'clock till nine; I told a good many people so - I told my aunt; I did not see him on the Sunday, as I went on the Sunday morning with a neighbour's daughter to Woolwich; I did not come home till Tuesday night, and then heard he was taken - I went to Worship-street, and saw him getting into the van: I told my mother and a great many more that he was with me on the night of the robbery - I did not tell any body at the office so; I did not know any one - I went to Clerkenwell on the Friday, the day after he was examined; I knew when he was to be examined again, but did not go to the office - my aunt went, and I staid at home; I did not think it would be of any use for me to go - I stopped at home to do the cleaning; my aunt went - she was not called - she knew I was in his company from eight o'clock to nine.</p>

On the 8th of April Seeton and Wells came to our shop to pawn a dressing-case, which I would not take in - this gown was hanging up in the shop, but I did not observe them go near it; they came to the counter - the gown was near the counter; when they were gone I missed it; my suspicion fell on the two women - I went out, and found Berry about seven doors off with the gown under her shawl, at the corner of Berners-street; she had not been to the house - I said she must come with me to the shop; she said she was to have 6d. for carrying it, and pointed us to two women, but I did not observe them - I did not hear her say the word"Women;" I said before the Magistrate that she said two women had given her 6d. to carry it - she did say so; I brought her back to the shop; the officer took the other woman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Berry mentioned that two women had given it her? A. I did not observe them - I did not see her point; she told me she pointed - there were two other persons in the shop, but they remained till I got back.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is it a long counter? A. Yes; it might have been taken by one without the other knowing it - I could not see who took it.</p>

            . I took Berry in charge with this gown; she said, "I did not steal it; Wells gave it to my sister Tamer, and she gave it me." I then went to Seeton's mother, and found Seeton there; I told her I wanted her and Mrs. Wells - she began to cry, and said "You have got Bet at the office for stealing a gown; but I am the thief, and she shall not suffer innocently - I took the gown from Laws, and they know it;" there was no promise or threat made to her - I had not been in the house a moment.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to say she told you this story without your saying any thing to induce her? A. Yes; I knew her before, and she knew I was an officer - I believe she has three or four children.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you live with either of them? A. I live close by- we have drank together; nothing was said about a sixpence - it rained very hard.</p>

            . I know the poor-house. On the 16th of March, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw Elizabeth Charles, Stokes, and Purdy, on the top of the premises - Hill was at the bottom, throwing up the bundles to Purdy; the matron was out of the way at the time; the prisoners left the house the same evening.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>CORDWELL's Defence. We were washing on Monday afternoon; after tea, Stokes asked us to go away, and said she would get us work, and keep us till we got it; Charles then went into the yard, and got the linen - they were put in bundles, and at night we got over the wall: we went to Putney, and there they pawned two sheets; we then went to Wandsworth - we slept at the King's Arms; on the Monday morning they pawned one sheet at Mr. Butcher's, and two flannel petticoats, one shirt, and three hankerchiefs; Charles pawned the handkerchiefs in her own name, and Stokes the rest: we went to Chelsea next day, and then Stokes took two old sheets, and sold them, but I do not know to whom: on the Tuesday they ran away, and I never saw them till Thursday, when I saw Stokes, and asked what she had done with the duplicates; she he had said, burnt them; I was away a fortnight, and then I thought I had better give myself up, and suffer a little, and give up the company I was in.</p>
               <p>PURDY's Defence. Stokes asked if I would run away? I said, I had such a bad jacket; she said, "I will buy you a jacket in Chelsea;" Stokes tied up the bundles; I saw them take three pieces of soap, which they sold in Jew's-row; they then went to the Rose and Crown public-house, and took the shirts - I was going away, but they would not let me.</p>
               <p>HILL's Defence. I was down in the garden while the other prisoners were getting over; I asked where they were going? they did not answer; I never went away.</p>

            . I am the prisoners' father; they lodge at my house. On the night of Friday last I went home at half-past eight o'clock, and inquired if Benjamin had come in - my wife said he had: while I was eating my supper John came in, had his supper, and went to bed - when I got up the next morning, at six o'clock, they were both in bed: my house is a mile from the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>- TAYLOR. I am the prisoners' sister. My brother Benjamin was at home when my father came in; John then came in, and sat down - when they went to bed I locked the door, and took the key out; when I got up in the morning they were in bed - the key had laid on a chair in my bed room.</p>

               <p>JOHN CARLILE re-examined. Q. Did he say this at the time? A. No; he threw down his box, and so did the other - the prisoner was very violent indeed; he kicked, tore, and fought me.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I not intoxicated? A. She was rather tipsy - this was between two and three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

On the 27th of February he came again, and had one piece of light ground chintz, and said as there was not sufficient of the tea ground chintz, the light ground might he used instead; I put in that parcel a tremnant of forty-nine yards and a half - the bill was 9l. 17s. 2d.</p>

My house was safe on the night of the 29th of March, and the cellars quite secure - the next morning, which was Sunday, I went to draw some ale - I saw the cellar broken open; the boards had been broken exactly where the bolts were, and they had put their arm in and drawn the bolts back; I can swear that I missed about ten gallons from different casks, of cloves, peppermint, shrub, rum, and gin - some ale, onions, casks, and stone bottles - one bottle had a little shrub in it, one a little ale, and one was empty; I sent off to Barnet for an officer, and we both examined the premises; a person called on me, and I went with my ostler, cooper, to the field, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon; I found five men drinking in the field, four of whom I knew - the prisoners were three of them; they were drinking ale out of a stonebottle - they all drank in their turns - it was such a bottle as I had lost; Franklin was sitting on one of the casks which I knew - I ordered my ostler to take three of the casks up, and Gray said, "Master took it out;" I said they were my casks - they said if they were mine I might take them; Franklin said they found them in the hedge - I got on the coach to go to Barnet, leaving them with one bottle, pouring ale out; Cooper took the casks to my house - I got two officers, went to South Mims, and found Gray in a chandler's-shop; we went to a cottage near where they had been drinking and found Franklin - my ostler and I then got on a coach, and took Hemmings about a mile on this side of St. Alban's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This breaking open of your cellar took place on the night of the 29th of March? A. Yes; or early on the following morning; I went to bed about eleven o'clock, and was the last person up - the cellar is in the garden - it is not under the same roof as the house - there is a side door from the kitchen into it; it was open day-light when these men were sitting drinking - Gray asked me to pour some out for them - they were all pretty far gone; two or three of them seemed as if they were able to understand me; I believe the prisoners<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090143"/>were so tipsy that they did not know what they were about; there is a footpath near the place where they were, but they are bye fields - I went back to the spot where they had been, and brought away the other bottle; there was nothing to prevent our taking them - but I did not know I might without an officer.</p>

On the 3d of April I was at home, and in consequence of information I saw Pettet about half-past one o'clock in the passage of My house; he demanded 120l. for six years' back rent - I told him I did not owe any such money; I asked him to walk up stairs - he followed me up, accompanied by two more men, who I cannot identify; Pettet pulled out a paper, and read it - I do not know what it was; he then demanded the rent in the name of

             - I should not know the paper again, for I did not have it; I never heard of William Chapman in my life - Pettet said his own name was John Smith; he asked me to open my lodger's door, whose name is Bennett - I told him I could not, for my lodger was out; his door was fastened with a padlock outside - I was very much alarmed; he told me not to flurry myself, for I should have five days to replevie if he was in the wrong - when I said I could not open Bennett's door, he said he could not wait a minute; I said, "I have another way backwards, if you will wait while I go round and see if that is open;" he said he should not wait a minute - he rushed by me, and wrenched the padlock off before my face; he went into the room, and the two men with him - I did not go into the room; I went down-stairs, and went out to look for my brother - I was absent nearly a quarter of an hour; when I came back there was a van at the door loaded with goods - I thought I saw a table on it which was mine; I did not notice any thing else - when I got into the house it was nearly empty, and the house was so full of people in the passage I could hardly get in; I found Mr. Butler there, who is the rent-gatherer for Mr. Ray - he has been so about ten or eleven years; I never knew any other rent - gather during that time - I had some conversation with Butler, and then fetched Hawthorne, the officer: he came back with me - Pettet was then standing at the post of the parloar-door, and I gave a charge of him - the constable asked him by what authority he took the goods; he refused to show his authority; he said he was not going; to have it turn up - two tables were taken out of the house, four chair, two brass candlesticks, one pair of cotton stockings, and some crockery; the house was nearly empty - I had never received any notice not to pay the rent to Butler.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Since you have been tenant of these premises has any person demanded rent from you, except Mr. Ray and Butler? A. Not since Mr. Ray has had the house; before that Mr. Barker did - I have not paid any rent for four years, because I have a little property which I cannot get at, and Mr. Ray is so kind as to wait for it; I am confident Pettet did not say he had come as an agent of Smith or by his authority - he said his own name was Smith; I was very much alarmed, but I am certain of that; he demanded the rent in the name of Chapman, and said his own name was Smith: he did not represent that he was acting for Smith; I first saw him in the passage; I think the door was shut when I saw him; the passage was full of people, when he refused to show his authority for fear it should be torn up - he did not say I should have a list of the articles taken away; he was asked for the inventory, and said he had got it, but would not show it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When it was discovered to be an improper seizure - a good many things were put back into the house? A. Yes; I was not present then - I did not know Martin before; he was not taken into custody - he went to Worship street of his own accord, and attended twice.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Do you know Petit? A. Yes; I had not seen him before; a little boy let him in at the street door - he told Butler he had shewn his authority to so many, he was afraid it would he torn up; I think the whole of the things were not put into the van at the time he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make the least resistance? A. Yes; he would not go to the office for some time; he did not say he had shown his authority to the proper person, and they had no right to take him.</p>

            . I am a fishing-tackle maker, and lodge at Miss Howorth's, on the ground-floor. About half-past one o'clock on this day I was in Miss Howorth's room, and heard somebody call out Miss Howorth - I opened her room door, and saw Pettet and White, and a man in top boots, standing in the passage; I said, "Miss Howorth, you are wanted," and she went out - in about five minutes I went into Gardner's room; I found nobody there but Gardner and his brother - Pettet came into the room; I asked him who authorised him to come and make a seizure in that room; he told me to mind my own business, or else he would charge a constable with me, and said he was acting under the King - he said he wanted 120l. for six years' back-rent; I said, "This young man don't owe any rent, he has got three or four weeks good yet" - he told me again to mind my own business, or else he would charge a constable with me; I said, "You won't be so hard - this poor young man has got but one hand, let him have a thing or two that he gets his living by." I asked him for his nets, his fishing canns, and gun; he said, be quick, for directly the van came he should clear the house immediately - I went up stairs into Miss Howorth's bed-room, and got two or three small things out, and when I came down the van was at the door, partly loaded - Martin was in the van; I saw Hillick bringing a trunk down stairs; he took it to the van - Pettet at that time was giving the men directions to be quick; and I saw Pettet with a table in the passage just before Butler came - it had been taken from Miss Howorth's room; after this Pettet was taken into custody - I afterwards assisted in unloading the van; Watts, the street-keeper, was there - I was in the van; Martin asked who authorised me to move the goods from the van - Watts showed his staff and said, "I authorised him." Martin said,"Where am I to get my money from?" I said, "You must look to those who employed you." Martin assisted me in moving the heaviest things directly Watts showed, his staff.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He was the owner of the van? A. I believe so; he gave assistance when he found things were not right, and so did all the prisoners except Petit, but he was not there - Hillick<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090145"/>said he was glad it had turned out as it did, and that the things had not been taken away, when he found it was an illegal seizure, and so did White; they all appeared to be acting under Pettet's order.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Was Petit given into custody - before or after the seizure was completed? A. The van was very nearly loaded when he was taken; whether any thing was put into it after he was taken I cannot say - it was never wholly filled; Pettet said he had proper authority, and if I interrupted him, he should give me into custody - I saw nothing put into the van after he was taken.</p>

I live at No. 92, Mary-street, Hampstead-road; I am employed by Mr. Ray to collect his rents, and have been employed so about ten years - among others I collected from Miss Howorth; I abstained, by direction of Mr. Ray, from pressing her for rent - she owed between four and five years' rent; on Friday, the 3d of April, I went to her house, and saw a great number of persons at the door, and also a van partly laden with household furniture, as it appeared to me - I went into the house, and saw Pettet and Hillick nearly at the bottom of the stairs; Hillick was carrying a table, and Pettet behind him - I insisted on their not taking it out of the house -I stopped it, as the passage was narrow, and desired them not to remove any thing out of the house; Hillick stopped directly, and Pettet said, if any body interrupted him in what he was doing, he would send for a constable and give them in charge - I asked him to show me his authority for making the distress; he told me he should not show it me at all - I insisted on seeing it, and then we went into a back room; he produced a paper, which he held with both his hands, leaving only a part of it to be seen - I read part of it, and asked him who put in the distress, and he said William Chapman, whose name was on the paper; I asked him his name, and he said it was

Freshfield, who are Mr. Ray's solicitors - I saw White and Martin at the house; White was just at the entrance of the garden door - I did not see him do any thing; he said he was employed by Smith - mentioning the name of Smith; a constable was sent for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. He held the authority in both hands, did you get it into your hands? A. Never. I have collected the rent about ten years; I believe a claim has been set up to the premises by a person of the name of Young; nobody else that I know of- there is, I believe, an action in the Court of King's Bench which is not yet decided.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. The action is by Mr. Young? A. Yes. I never heard the name of Chapman or Pettet; I have received the rent for all these houses ever since I have collected for Mr. Ray.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q. Would you necessarily be in possession of the circumstance if any claim was set up? A. It might have been without my knowledge. White and Hillick came to the office twice voluntarily.</p>

            . I kept an eating-house in Crown-court, Temple-bar. Mr. Archibald discounted a bill for 21l. 13s. 9d. for me on the 14th of March; I was to take two dozen of sherry wine, at 40s. a dozen, in part of the cash: it was to have been delivered when I sent for it - I knew the prisoner for nine or ten weeks; I never authorized him to apply for the wine: I knew nothing of this till the 1st of April, when I sent to Archibald the billbroker for the wine (looking at the order); I never signed this, nor authorized any body to put my name to it.</p>

             re-examined. Mr. Whitaker was to send the wine to my house, and I found it there; I do not know where it came from - he ordered a person in London to send it; it stood in my hall in bottles, not in a hamper.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090147"/>Prisoner. Q. When the 16l. was paid to Mrs. Fifield, did not you say you would give the balance, 5l. 13s. 9d. in wine, equal to that at 40s. a dozen from any winemerchant in London? A. No; I said the gentleman proposed to give two dozens at 40s.; I have no doubt it was worth that - I undertook that it should he; I have no doubt it was so from the respectability of my client - Mrs. Fifield endorsed the bill in my drawing-room; the bill is not in my possession; I do not know where it is.</p>
               <p>MRS. FIFIELD. The prisoner introduced me to Archibald - his brother is a baker, and had lived in Temple-street; I owed him 17s. 6d. and he called for it - the prisoner was with him, and this is the way I first knew him; he offered to sell me whiskey and different spirits; I owed a quarter's rent, and had a man in possession - the prisoner said if I had a good bill he could get it discounted, and introduced me to Archibald.</p>
               <p>Prisoner, Q. Did you endorse the bill in Archibald's presence? A. I endorsed it, but not in his presence - I did it at my brother's, in Red Lion-street, Holborn: Archibald was not there - my brother drew the bill by my authority, but I endorsed it; my brother is the acceptor - he was in my debt.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prisoner apply to you about the wine? A. Never; I intended to dispose of it, and had a friend who would have taken it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in his Defence, entered in'o a long account of his first acquaintance with the prosecutrix, and stated that she had desired him to dispose of the wine, and promised to give him 3l. for his trouble in introducing her to Archibald. That after she had received the money they went to a public-house in the Strand, where he wrote the order in question which the prosecutrix did not sign, (not being able to write.)</p>

            , the prisoner after that had goods regularly from Harris; I was in the country, but on some complaint from Mr. Harris, I came to town in January last; the prisoner came to my inn several times, but nothing particular passed relative to this bill of 20l. - he promised to arrange his account; I do not recollect his saying any thing to me about this bill - there were several other bills.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You are a nail-manufacturer? A. Yes; I used to send goods to the prisoner's orders; you may say he was my agent if you like - he was at that time; when I was in town he came to my inn two or three times, but he never went with me to the place where the bill was made payable, to see if Mr. Busby was to be found; I went with Mr. Harris to No. 35, King-street, Goswell-street, to make inquiries - the prisoner went with us part of the way, but did not go there; he went within a street of the place: the endorsement on the back of this bill is my hand-writing - it has passed through my hands.</p>
               <p>This was a bill for 25l. 7s. 6d., dated the 27th of May, 1828, at three months date; drawn by R. H. Green, on Mr. Busby, and endorsed, "Received Spooner and Co."</p>

            . I was appointed agent to Mr. Hipkiss, in November, 1827. The prisoner still continued to sell nails for Mr. Hipkiss - he was still a commissioned salesman for Mr. Hipkiss, but I had the bills in my hands, and the list of the stock was left in my hands, with orders to the persons at the wharf not to deliver any nails but to my order - this bill for 20l., and another for 18l. 5s. 6d., I received from the prisoner at the same time; I am not quite positive when; but I am satisfied in my own mind it was on the 5th of September, the day the bills were drawn, or just thereabout; it was for the purpose of paying for nails -I remitted them with three others in a paper parcel to Mr. Hipkiss; when the first became due, which was no the 8th or 9th of December, it was returned - Mr. Hipkiss received notice of it; I heard of it soon afterwards; I wrote to Mr. Hipkiss, and requested him to come to town, and he came very early in January - I saw the prisoner soon after I heard of the bill being dishonoured, and he told me it would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090148"/>be paid in a very few days; I took no steps, but waited for Mr. Hipkiss to come.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then the prisoner still continued to be agent for the sale of these nails? A. He still continued to sell nails for Mr. Hipkiss - he did not cease to sell after November, 1827; I saw him very frequently - I have seen him with a person, whom I supposed to be his brothere, but he never told me it was his brother; I met him with him two or three times - I do not know that he was in the habit of assisting him in business; I have never seen him when I have gone on business - I think he used to go out to solicit orders for his brother; I fear he did - I never knew he had a brother till Mr. Hipkiss told me; he had a brother, who was a very indifferent character, and he was fearful of any nails going to him; his name was John; I do not know that he has absconded.</p>

             re-examined. That is the bill I received in September - it is one of those which I received from the prisoner; I inquired for Mr. Busby at No. 35, King-street, Goswell-street, but I found no such person living there - the bill for 18l. 5s. 6d. was due a month later.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you make this inquiry? A. Some time after the bill was due; I saw a female - I did not know at that time who lived in the house, but I find the name is Williams; I do not know who lodges in the house - bills are frequently made payable where parties do not live; I inquired if there had been any nails delivered there, and they said No.</p>

            . I am a tailor. I lived for four years and a half at No. 35, King-street, Goswell-street; I left there on the 25th of March last - I never knew of a person of the name of Busby living there at any time; I believe there was a bill presented there five or six months ago - I cannot say exactly when.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written) My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, - I beg leave to assure you that I am entirely innocent of the charge imputed to me by this indictment. The prosecutor, Mr. Hipkiss, and myself, have been long acquainted, and in the habit of doing business together, for a long period. He is an iron-merchant in considerable trade, at Dudley, in Worcestershire, and I am an agent for the sale of ironmongery goods in London, selling for the country manufactures on commission. With regard to the transaction in question, I have only to state that my brother, John Green, Jun. who has been in the habit of obtaining orders for me, and transacting a great part of my business, told me. about the month of July last, that he had received an order for a quantity of nails to the amount of about 38l., from one James Busby, whom he represented was living in King-street, Goswell-street; and having had a similar transaction shortly prior, to the amount of 25l, with the same person, through my brother John, I felt no hesitation in executing this order, and accordingly I proceeded to Mr. Harris, the town agent of the prosecutor, and obtained orders for the delivery of the goods from Snell's and Whitehouse's wharfs, in the City-road, which I delivered over to my brother John, together with two bills of exchange for the amount, which I had drawn at two and three months. according to agreement, and directed him to get them accepted by Mr.

            ;" and having no suspicion whatever of the genuineness of the signatures, I paid them over to Mr. Harris on account of the prosecutor, Mr, Hipkiss, for the goods in question. On the first of these bills becoming due, I accompanied the prosecutor and Mr. Harris to where it was made payable, and waited outside whilst they proceeded to the house; on coming away from which they said no such person as Busby lived there. Gentlemen, I am sorry to add, that, at this period, my brother John, upon whom I had entirely relied, not only in this transaction, but in others in which he has also deceived me in a similar manner, had absconded, and has been out of the way ever since, so that I could obtain no information of Busby, although I have devoted days and nights in endeavouring to do so, a fact both the prosecutor and Mr. Harris are, I apprehend, fully aware of. On the second bill becoming due, that also was, from the same cause, dishonoured: and not being able to take them up, I was, after the expiration of a considerable period, taken into custody, and committed for trial Had I been conscious of having committed any crime affecting my life, it is manifest that I had ample opportunity to escape if I had thought proper to do so.</p>

When Mr. Hipkiss came to London, I saw him frequently on the subject of these bills; I went with Mr. Hipkiss to present this bill for payment - it was refused; I am not quite sure whether we saw the prisoner on the road, or whether he went with us, but I had a bag with some tea in it, which I gave the prisoner to hold, and he waited in Compton-street while I took the bill - when I came out I told him that they knew nothing of any such parties; he said he knew not how that could be, because there had been a bill paid there; I think I left him then, but I saw him several times afterwards - I believe he frequently came to Mr. Hipkiss' inn. and he once or twice called on me; I said to him,"These bills stand in a very awkward state;" he said he would pay them this time and that time, but he never did.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The moment Mr. Hipkiss waited on me I went with him, and had I had the least suspicion of these bills being forged. it is not likely that I should have gone there; my reason for saying I would pay these bills, was, that I considered myself in some way responsible for the loss occasioned by my brother's conduct.</p>

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. This conversation took place after the bill had been brought? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Had you any previous notice that a bill would be brought? A. No; he came and asked me if there had not been a bill brought - I am quite sure there has not been a person of the name of Lane lodging there these four years, since I have been in the house; I was in the habit of taking him letters, and several bills came from the bankers, and I gave answer he was not there, or something of that kind.</p>

I occupy the two shops and two attics, in which I have two persons put in to take care of the house; it is a corner house - I let the house to different lodgers; I let one kitchen to a Mr. Ewer, the other kitchen I keep for the accommodation of the lodgers - the cellar may be about ten yards from the kitchen-door - I leave my shop every night for my residence at Holloway; I left it on Tuesday evening, the 17th of March, as near half-past nine o'clock as I can recollect - before I left it, I took down my cash-box into my cellar, in which was enclosed three 20l. notes, I can swear, but I believe there were four, upwards of 50 sovereigns, from 5l. to 7l. in silver, and amongst the silver was a bad crown-piece, with a piece cut out of the edge of it nearly the eighth of an inch, and two bills of exchange - I locked my cash-box, put it into an iron chest in the cellar; I locked the chest and the cellar-door - my shop was shutting up at this time; I waited till I saw the shop-doors closed, and then set off for Holloway - the next morning I received some information, a little after nine o'clock, and went down into the cellar with a light; I found the cellar-door broken open, and the iron chest gone, and a chisel was lying on the ledge where the iron-chest had been placed - the chisel is in the possession of the constable; I should know it again- I found my iron-chest the same morning at the house of a chimney-sweeper, named Brown, in Feather's-court, Fox-court - I have no doubt it was my chest; the prisoner Hawkins came to live with me, I think in December, 1826, and left me last September; he must have seen me going down stairs to deposit my cash-box in the cellar, as as it has been my custom for the last six months - the kitchen is at the corner of Charles-street.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many servants were in the house altogether at that time? A.

No; I suppose bell to be a wicked place - that person told me if I told lies I should go to that wicked place - I believe that now; I have heard about religion before that - I do not know the Commandments -I do not know my duty to God - I have lived in that public-house three years; I have known Hawkins, as living in the service of Mr. Carr - if the other young man had been Hawkins I should have known him; but I am sure it was not; when they crossed the road they went towards Brooke-street.</p>

On Tuesday night, the 17th of March, a little after ten o'clock, it might be a quarter past, I heard something fall down in the passage very heavy - it gave an alarm; I took the candle, and went out - I saw two persons; John Ballard was one - I have no doubt of him; he was sitting on a chest, and the other was standing on the step of the door with his back towards me; I said, "What is all this noise about?" Ballard told me to call his mother, and said he wanted no light - the noise I heard shook the partition: I asked Ballard who his mother was, and he said Ballard - I opened the back door, called Mrs. Ballard, and then I went into my room; the next morning I opened my door to get some water, and Mrs. Ballard said to me, "Come up stairs, and I will shew you the box that was let down last night" - she said it was let down by her son; I went up stairs, and saw a wooden box with some mouldings in it for cielings, such as plasterers use - I did not go near enough to see whether the mouldings were broken, or not; I cannot say whether it was the box which I had seen the night before - I did not examine it at all.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You would not know what sort of a noise it would make? A. No; it is not a private passage - there are a good many persons come into it: I knew John Ballard before, but I did not know him that night till he spoke, and ordered me to call his mother; I believe they have three sons and one daughter, but

             there in the afternoon; I knew them perfectly-these are the persons; when I went in, Ballard was playing at bagatelle - there was young man there whom I knew, named Williams; Ballard lost two pots of ale - he paid the landlord for three pints, and said he would pay the other next day; the landlord said he ought not to play without he had money - he then went away; Hawkins then played for half a pound of beaf steaks, and lost - he went out to fetch them, but did not return; I went home to tea about five o'clock, and re turned about seven - Hawkins came in and sat down by the side of Hawkins - they spoke to each other, but I did not hear what they said; Ballard rose up, pulled a chisel out of his breast, and showed it to Hawkins - Hawkins turned round side ways, and said, "It is just the thing;" my attention was drawn to it; I thought there was something going on wrong, and I observed it particularly, so that if I saw it again I should know it - I have seen it since in the possession of the beadle; I did not take hold of it till I was at Hatton-garden - I was sure it was the same that I had seen: they said about an hour longer at the public-house, and then went away together - this was about a quarter past eight, I believe, but the clock did not go right; they returned about a quarter past ten, and called out a young man named Riley, who had been asleep there for four or five hours they touched him, and he followed them out; they paid something - I remained there till a quarter before twelve; I am quite sure this is the chisel- it is made out of an old file.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR.PHILLIPS. Q. This chisel they were showing openly? A. No.; I had an opportunity of seeing it for about a couple of seconds - I knew it instantly when I saw it the next day; there were some of Ballard's relations in the public-house, playing at bagatelle, and one young man that beat him out of the steaks- I have been here before for my own property; I was tried for a game cock, as they called,it, but I was honourably acquitted - I was not up above a minute and a half, and you were my counsel; there were one or two witnesses examined, but it did not last above a minute and a half - I never heard of any body saying they could swear a spot off a tea-kettle; I never said that unless I got a pound, I would swear a spout off a tea-kettle - I never said, in the presence of Badland and another person, that I knew nothing about this robbery; they offered me 10l., but I did not see why I should not be in it as well as other people; they tried to buy me to keep out of the way - I was never accused of any thing beside the game cock, unless it was fighting now and then; there never was a young woman who lost any clothes, and brought a charge against me - it was in October Session I was tried about the game cuck; I know Badland perfectly well - he is the landlord of that public-house, and I know

On Tuesday, the 17th of March, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, Hawkings and John Ballard came to my house; I have no doubt they are the persons - I knew Hawkins before; he said he had come to pay me what he owed me, as he had been up to the neighbourhood of Clare-market, and had won 25s. at cards; he gave me a crown-piece, which was not a good one, and I told him it would not do - he said to Ballard, "John, you must lend me 5s.;" Ballard put down two half - crowns, and a penny, and I took it up - they then went into the tap-room, and had half a gallon of ale.</p>

            . I keep the George public - house, in Brooke-street. On the 17th of March, about a quarter before twelve o'clock at night, Hawkins, John Ballard, and another person, whose name I have heard is Riley, came into my house; they called for three glasses of wine, and one of them, which I believe was Hawkins, put down a crown-piece, which I refused, as I was convinced it was not a good one, and they gave me a shilling - the crown-piece had rather a deep cut on the edge, rather wider than a piece would be cut, to ascertain whether it was good or bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You will not swear who it was? A. I think it was Hawkins; I have a good deal of bad money offered me - some people do cut the edge of money, to ascertain whether it is good, but that. is not my way; this was very bad - it was white metal; I looked at it for some time because I happened to have one before.</p>
