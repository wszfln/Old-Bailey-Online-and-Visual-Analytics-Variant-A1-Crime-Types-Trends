                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I sincerely regret that I suffered my feelings, deeply wounded thought they were, so far to overcome me as to be induced to chas<lb/>tise this undutiful and cruelly bad boy so severely; but I most positively deny using the thick end of the stick, and respectfully beg you will allow me to state the circumstances which occasioned me so to act. He is in the habit of running away, and stopping two or three days and nights, robbing me of what money he can lay his hand on, or taking such small articles as he can easily convert into money, with him. I have adopted reproof hitherto, and have talked to him earnestly and repeatedly on the probable result of such a wicked course of conduct, in the hope of keeping him from the place were (through him) I now stand, but to no purpose. I cannot send him out to fetch anything in, for fear he should steal something; for, not content with being a little villain himself, he tell the people I send him out to steal. He was sent for some wood a short time since; he spent the money, and stole some wood, and said he was sent on purpose; a mob came round the door, and we were shamefully abused. Such tricks does he frequently play me. On this last occasion, when he ran away from home, he was taken in by some most esteemed friends of mine, who keep a coffee-shop. He told them the most diabolical falsehoods; that I had impugned the character of all the females of their family; and told a shop full of customer that his mother had six man in bed with her at once, and such-like vile slander, merely to make the men laugh, and to get money. Through this, I have found out that for months past he has been in the habit of telling the most abominable false<lb/>hoods to my lodger; that I gave her the worst of characters, searched her chamber, beat her baby, and indeed, lies beyond all endurance; and when asked by her (the lodger) why he did so, he said, because he wished me to be thought as bad as himself. Under these circumstances, I trust that my previous unblemished character for honesty, industry, and general good con<lb/>duct; the deep disgrace he has brought upon me, the loss of my situation, my long confinement in prison (nearly three weeks,) and the destitute condition of my wife and three little children at home, may be considered ample atone<lb/>ment for my intemperate or inconsiderate conduct.</p>

I left the vessel off Deal—I merely boarded her for a few minutes and then left her—she arrived in London somewhere about the 23rd of Jan.—on the 25th of Jan. I left London with Forrester, the officer, to go to Dover—I subsequently accompanied him to Boulogne, in search of prisoner—we went to Montreuil, which is about thirty miles from Boulogne, I think—we went to an hotel there—we did not find the prisoner there, but we waited for him, and he came there—when he came in said, "Oh, are you there, Mr. Macmillan?"—we were in the commercial or dining room—Forrester sug<lb/>gested that we should go into my room—we did so, with the prisoner—For<lb/>rester then asked the prisoner what he had done with the property, or words to that effect—the prisoner produced a bag out of his pocket, containing gold, and said, "That is all I have got, I have been robbed of the rest"—it contained eighty-for sovereigns, I think—he said he imagined he had been robbed coming down in the railway carriage to Folkestone from London, that a gentleman had been in the carriage with him, who went out at Ashford station, he himself went out there to get some refreshment, and immediately missed his train-ticket and money, and he supposed this person might have taken it—he was searched by Forrester in a slight manner, but not particularly—we afterwands dined—I asked him to take his dinner and make</p>

               <p>himself comfortable—I said, "you must have been very unhappy for a long time, do endeavour to be comfortable to-night, and take your dinner"—he expressed great regret—he said, "If the other owners had been as kind to me as you have been, this would not have taken place," and he cried—after that he said, "Mr. Macmillan, I want to speak to you"—I said, "Very well, you had better retire again to my private room"—he and I went there alone—when we got there he sat down, and said, 'Will you assist me off with my boot?"—I said, "Yes"—I did so—he put his hand into his boot, produced a roll of notes, and said, "take you that"—I said, "How much have you got there, Capt. Kerr?"—he said, "200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I counted the notes in his presence, and found it to be so—after that, in expressing his contrition, he said, "I sup<lb/>pose I shall be transported fro this"—we then went down stairs and finished our dinner—I found forrester there, and handed the notes to him the first opportunity—I do not think Forrester said anything to the prisoner about the money after that—I rather think he declined treating on the subject at all—he wanted to conciliate and smooth him down, I think—the prisoner told me he had gone to a public-house called the Albion, at Wapping, where he had been in the habit of going some time previous, that he had not found the same party there that had been there formerly, that the same landlord that he had known was not there then; he said he had been taking a little grog and went to bed, that in the morning he was getting his coat brushed, and that, in order to have it properly brushed, he was obliged to take certain parcels out of his pocket, that he laid two parcels on the table, and that either Mr. Foreman or Mr. Hoare, (he did not know which,) said, "What have you got there, Capt. Kerr?" and that he said, "These are diamond;" and he remarked, "Can you sell the smaller parcel of the two for me?"—that the party replied they had no doubt they could, but if he added the larger parcel, they could more readily effect a sale by combining both parcels, and that re authorized the sale of both parcels; which I believe was effected—that was his narrative to me on the passage—he did me that a lady put about 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Bank of England notes into his pocket at the public-house—I understood him to refer to Mr. Foreman, the landlady—I think he said he had got about 1100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—after our dinner at Montreuil, he said to me that he had slept at a coffee-house opposite the railway station, and that in the morning he discovered that his money was gone—that was in the steam-packet coming from Boulogne, I think—I think it was on our return from Montreuil—it was on our journey from France, I cannot say wheter it was on the steam-pocket or in the tarin—on the Tues<lb/>day morning we went on board the steamer at Boulogne—when he told me he had been robbed he said a person of the name of Foreman was with him constantly—he said he told Mr. foreman he had been robbed, that Mr. Fore<lb/>man replied, "That is very unfortunate; you my suspect I am the person because I have been in your company, and I am very sorry that I have been in your company"—he asked me, "Are Mr. Foreman and Mr. Hoare in custody?"—I said I believed they were not, at which he appeared very much sur<lb/>prised—he afterwards said a Deal boat had boarded the ship off Folkestone, I think, fifteen miles or mid channel, and they had informed him that two gen<lb/>tlemen had been waiting for him at Deal for a week or more, that he asked the boatmen to describe the parties, the boatmen did so, and he said, "These are my owners, "and that he then entered into an agreement with the boatmen to land him at Folkestone, for a certain sum of money—he said the mate remon<lb/>strated, and said it was very improper for him to leave the ship in charge of a Deal boatman, who was tipsy at the time; notwithstanding that, he left the vessel and landed—he gave ad his reason that he would rather meet his owners</p>

               <p>on shore than shipboard—that was the reason he gave to the Deal boatmen—he stated that being so sensible of his bad conduct during the voyage, and having heard his owners were waiting for him, had the vessel been going through the water quickly he should have thrown himself over<lb/>board—he did not say what he took with him when he went away—I do not remember that he stated anything more about Foreman and Hoare—nothing was said about what the diamonds had been bought for—nothing was said about his clothes.</p>

Did not appear in the ship's manifest—no other articles were omitted from the manifest that I am aware of—we found the prisoner at Montreuil on Sun<lb/>day evening, I think, about six or seven o'clock—we got to London on the afternoon of the Tuesday following—I think I took my meals with the prisoner during the whole of that time—I endeavoured to make him as happy as I could, I felt pity for him, I rather avoided speaking to him on the sub<lb/>ject of the robbery—I spoke on other matters altogether—the conversation at that I have stated was all at one period—there was one conversation at Montreuil, and another on the passage home—that was not a very long one—we were shut up in the steam-boat—as far as I can recollect, those were the only two conversation I had with him—Iwas perhaps half an hour talking to him—I think I could have got through all the conversation in half an hour—he did not say he had been made drunk the night before—he said he had been talking spirits, but did not convey to me that he was the worse for liquor when he went to bed—I understood he had got it supplied to him in the house in which he was—he said that next morning some person spoke to him, Mr. Foreman I suppose—I do not remember that he said that he found Foreman in his bed-room on awaking—he said they asked him how he felt that morning—I cannot say that he left on my mind the impression that he was not out of bed when he first saw Foreman in his room—I cannot give word for word what he said—he certainly never stated that he found foreman had cut the parcel, nothing of the kind—he said that either Hoare or fore<lb/>man proposed that the two parcels should go—he was exceedingly distressed and grieved at the occurrence.</p>

(he had not told me at that time anything about a tailor,) that he added, "I fell very ill this morning"—that he said to foreman or Hoare, "Can you sell the small parcel for me?" and then Hoare or foreman Suggested that they had better be disposed of both together; they said, "We parcels;" and then he authorized the sale.</p>

               <p>am nephew of one of the part owners. I went out with the vessel, and re-turned with her—I remember her leaving Bahia—she was caulked there—it was my duty to take an account of the cargo—I kept a book for the purpose—I was not aware before I left Bahia that there were any diamonds on board—the captain had not communicated that to me before we left Bahis, and I had no account of any diamonds—I learned it on the homeward-bound voyage—I went down into the cabin one forenood, and saw the master overhanling some papers—I happened to look over the papere, and saw two bill of lading, mentioning diamonds—they were not with the rest of the bill of lading, among the ship's papers, but were by themselves—I asked the captain why they were not put up along with the rest of the bill of lading—he said it was in case of pirates or other people coming on board; that the most likely place they would look at would be among the bill of lading and papers of the ship, and he would put them up when we got closer home, or nearer England—after he had shown me the bills of lading, he took two parcels from a drawer in the starboard side of the cabin, and showed them to me—I cannot say whether be unlocked the drawer—I looked at the parcels—one was about one foot long, and half a foot broad; the other was about half that size—there was paper out-side, which was sealed and secured—the large parcel appeared to contain some hard substance, as a tin box—it had several seals on it—I did not feel the smaller parcel—it was sealed, and in paper—the drawer was kept locked during the voyage—the prisoner kept the key—he told me the parcels con-tained diamonds—he told me where he had got them, and said the ship was to have so much per cent. for the freight of them—I remarked, "If you were to take a few out of these boxes how should the people know?"—he said they were all weighed out before him in Bahia—I remember the vessel being off the coast of Brest on our near arrival towards home—I remember two gentlemen, coming on board at Duornes, at the south-east of Brest—I saw the two parcels at that Iport—the gentlemen asked to see the diamonds—from what they said they knew there were diamonds on board—the captain produced them from the same drawer in the cabin from which he had pro-duced them to me—they were then sealed and secured as I had seen thed when we were at sea—I cannot say that I saw him replace them in the drawer in the cabin—the drawer was always kept locked afterwards, as before—I did not see them again from that time—we arrived in the Downs, on the 21st of Jan. by nautical time—that was Wednesday, the 20th of Jan., by civil time—we were boarded by some Deal boatmen, not pilots—we were then laying in the Downs, in mid-channel, between the English and French coasts—I did not hear the Deal men say anything to the captain while they were on board—it was my watch below—the prisoner came down to me, and mentioned that the owners werw at Deal, and that he had a great mind to go on shore—I said it would be better for him to stop on board—I was the next officer to him, and did not like to hae charge of the vessel unless we had a pilot on board—the prisoner went away on deck, came down below again, began to dress himself, and said he would go ashore—this was off Dungeness, about fifteen miles from the coast of Folkestone—we could see the Dungeness light—the prisoner remained below about twenty minutes, and dressed in the same cabin in which the starboard drawer was, where the diamonds were—I remember the steward coming down to the captain—I have not got the ship's log with me—I made an entry of the captain's leaving or abandoning the vessel—when he came up dressed there was a boat along-side, with the Deal men in it—he got into it, and went ashore—he left one of the Deal men, who was the worse for liquor, with us on board—next morning Mr. M'Millan, one of the owners, came on board—in consequence of not</p>

               <p>finding the captain on board, he proceeded to examine the ship—I called his attention to the drawer of the cabin—we called the carpenter down, and had the drawer forced open—we found neither of the two parcels, only some papers—the prisoner's desk was examined, and the two bills of lading were found ther—I do not know who found them—I saw them in the hands of Mr. M'Millan.</p>

               <p>who is a salesman living close by—after I said I could recommend him a tailor, he said, "Look you here, I have got some stones here which I brought home on speculation"—he showed them to me, and said he had been trading out two years on his own account—he asked me if I could sell them for him—I said I had never seen such things before, and could not sell them, but I would take them with me when I went for the tailor—I saw them—they were in a white paper parcel about half a foot long—the paper was open on the table in the bed-room, and the diamonds in it—he told me to ask 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them——I went to Hoare, the tailor, showed him the diamonds, and asked him if he knew any one who would buy them, and he and I took them over to Mr. Gideon, a neighbour of his opposite—they were shown to Gideon—he sent for a man of the name of Benjamin to look at them—he came, and said he would take them into the market—he did so—I and Hoare went with him—they were offered in the market for sale, at the private Exchange—we went to one gentleman's office in the Royal Exchange—he said they would not suit him, and then I and Hoare went back to my house—I told the captain I could not get any such money for them—he said, "Well I am sorry for that, you have been gone a long time, and had a deal of trouble; there are a few for you, landlord, and a few for your tailor; take the lot and go and get what you can for them"—there were then two or three or four more small parcels on the table, all lying open, and a piece of brown paper lying underneath them—he put them to me and said, "Take them, and go and see what you can get for them"—this was about four o'clock in the afternoon—before Hoare left, he measured him for his clothes—I told him I could not go that afternoon, I would go for him in the morning if he liked—he said, very well—the diamonds that he gave me I put into my coat pocket, and Hoare did so too—he took them in his fingers and gave them to me—next morning I went with Benjamin and Hoare to Mr. Martin's, in the City, in Bucklersbury I believe it was—Ben<lb/>jamin proposed to go there<lb/>he said he would take them to the first-rate dia<lb/>mond merchants in London—Mr. Martin bought them for 1750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he weighed them first—he paid by cheque—I went to the bankers with the cheque with Hoare, and got 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and the rest in notes, which we gave to the prisoner—I told Mr. Martin who I was, and where I lived—the prisoner left my house about five o'clock on Saturday, and came back on Sunday about nine—he gave me a 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and told me that would settle his bill, and I might keep the change for myself—he did not mention the sum when he handed it to me—Hoare looked at it, and said, "Captain Kerr this is a 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—he said, "Well, that will pay your bill, and you can keep the change for yourself"—I left the prisoner that night at a coffee-shop opposite the railway station, in Shoreditch—I saw him there again next morning—he said he should not go by the train till the evening, and asked me to come and go with him—I said, "I will come if you wish it Captain—you had better come back along with me to stop, and not go down in the country"—he said he would go down for a few days or a week, and come back again—I went that evening and saw him in the train—Hoare and I put our diamonds together that evening, and I told him to go and sell them—I believe they were afterwards sold to Benjamin, but I did not go with them.</p>

I said, 'No;' he said, 'Well, I have not seen any of them since I gave them the bees' wax;' Bird said, 'You can go where you like;' I watched Bird to Mr. Higgins's, the mother of the other prisoner; in about a quarter of an hour afterwards they came home with something in a bag, which I believe to be the bees' wax; they all three came out in about twenty minutes, and Smith said it was very heavy; I went with them down to Whitechapel Church, where they asked a man if he knew where they could sell it; I do not know where they sold it; I was not with them; I never saw the bees' wax after it was taken; they spoke of the bees' wax before I went into the shop; Smith said, 'Let us send him in for some</p>

On Sunday morning, the 31st of Jan., I went from my private house to my warehouse—my dwelling-house has no internal communication with the warehouse—I found it all in confusion, the letters and papers strewed on the floor—the iron safe was broken open, the lock of it hanging off—the desk was broken, and one cupboard and two drawers—the back door was left ajar—it opens into an open yard—I noticed a pane of glass in the window at the side of the warehouse—it appeared as if a gimlet or bradawl had been forced in, the glass taken out, and the window opened—there is a beer-cellar under a covered roof, which comes up to the warehouse—it appeared that the warehouse had been entered by that covered roof evidently—I could see marks of footsteps—there were some rolls of floor<lb/>cloth under the window, affording a means of descent into the warehouse—I missed a check for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and one for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a canvass-bag with two half-sovereigns and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver in it—the checks were payable to bearer—I have recovered the one for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was presented, and the party stopped with it—this is it—it is a check of my partner's, and taken from the iron safe—the two half-sovereigns and the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of silver belonged to the firm—the premises were fastened up about seven o'clock on the Saturday evening, and the keys brought round to me—there were evident appearances of the premises being opened in the way I have described—there must have been a breaking to get in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman at the Fox and Peacock, Gray's Inn-lane. On the 15th of Feb., about half-past twelve o'clock at night, the prisoner came into the house—he was drunk and disorderly—he called for a pot of beer—I refused to serve him—he said he would be served—I told him he should not—my master told me to go round and put him out—I did so—when he got outside he struck at me, and attempted to come in again—I put out my hand to guard off a blow, which caused him to fall—I never touched him—I went into the house and shut the door, leaving him outside—about five minutes afterwards my master told me to go out and put up the shutters—I went out for that purpose—I had a stick with me with a ring to it to raise up the shutters out of a slide—it is an instrument which I usually had for that purpose—when I got out the prisoner was on the opposite side of the road—I was going to put up the shutters—he came across towards me—I put down the stick—he struck at me—I guarded the blow off with the stick—I never touched him—I put the stick away inside the front door, then went to him and told him—to go away—he said he would not, took me by the collar, and threw me down—we both fell together—I was undermost—after I was down I received a kick on the elbow from the prisoner—he had boots or shoes on, I cannot say which—I felt at once as if my arm was broken—I am sure that was caused by the kick—I felt it directly—I was taken to a surgeon, and the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>

I selected some of that wine to send Worthing—I selected eighteen bottles of port from one bin and eighteen from another—one eighteen was marked with black wax, with the word "port" on it, and I wrote in pencil on a label, the bins from which the wine was taken—I laid it flat on each eighteen of the bottles—the direction was afterwards written at my office at Wantage—this is the direction, in my hand-writing,(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>,) "W.

                  </hi>. I am storekeeper to Mr. Richard Gilbert and another—they are extensive printers in St. John's-square, Clerkenwell—the prisoner Connell was in their service—he took Mr. Sedgwick and me to No. 3, Co<lb/>lonnade, Brunswick-square—when we got there Connell went in—it appeared like a <hi rend="italic">cobbler's</hi> shop—there was a very bad light in the shop—there appeared to be lasts and bottles—Connell remained in about ten minutes, and I re<lb/>mained outside with Mr. Sedgwick—we then went in and I saw the prisoner Young—I told him we came about some property that the boy Connell said he had sold given him—Young said yes, he had some which he bought of the boy, and he had given him 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound for it—he said he had bought brass of the boy, but that he told him the foreman gave it him—he said he did not know where the boy lived or where he worked, but he believed it was somewhere down the Strand way—he said it would be very hard that he should lose the money after giving a fair price for it—I told him I did not believe he would lose the money if he had acted fairly in the transaction—he then, after some further conversation, said if we would retire from the shop, as he had no one to leave in the shop, he would go below and bring up the brass—we retired from the shop—he shut the door, and appeared to fasten it—I heard a noise—we remained outside a few minutes—he than opened the door, we went in, and he produced a bag, and placed it on the counter, from which he took seven packages of this brass-rules broder—this is one of the seven packages he took out of the bag—he placed them in a scale and weighed them—they weighed 25 1/2 lbs.—he again said it would be very hard for him to lose the money—we took it away. but he seemed very much to wish us to pay for it—I said we were not empowered to pay for it, but I gave him the direction of my employers, and said they were honourable men, and if they thought he had dealt honestly they would pay him, he would not lose anything by it—he</p>

               <p>said he would rather be paid then—I said if he did not give it up I should call in a policeman, and have it taken by force—he gave it up, and said he would try to call in the morning—I went the next day with Archer, the policeman—the policeman told him he had come about some brass which he had bought of a boy—he said, "I have found two or three more pieces, I was coming down with them"—I saw two or there pieces at the end of the counter—I observed, "That is not all, I know there were more pieces similar to that I took away the evening before"—he said he did not know of any more, he had searched, and could not find any more—the policeman then went into the parlour, and I saw him take from under the bureau this brass wheel, (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it was on the ground, near one of the legs of the bureau—the policeman then said he must search the cellar—Young said he had no more, but he unlocked the cellar, and the policeman and myself went in—the policeman turned over a quantity of brass gas-fittings and other things, and I observed this brass fork, and this brass shooting-stick—Young said something when we found them, but it was so low I could scarcely tell what he said—he said he brought things of any one that came, and then the police<lb/>man told him he must consider himself his prisoner—we told Young that Connell was in trouble about these things—I do not know the value of this brass-rule.</p>

I lived at 12, Britannia-street at the time in question—I was in the street—about a quarter-past one o'clock I saw Ward and three men, and a woman—the prisoners were two of the men—I had heard a great noise when I was at the top of the street—I ran to the spot, and Ward had hold of the woman taking her to the station-house—the three men were all about Ward, pulling him about, and saying the woman should not go to the station—Ward said, "You had better be quiet, or else you will all go"—they still continued hustling him about—he then pulled his rattle out, and began to spring it—Smith laid hold of Ward by the leg, and threw him on the ground. and immediately he fell the public-house lights were put out—they kicked him, but the light being out I could not see who it was, but believe it was Smyrk, from the dress and shape of the man—he had moved about several times before the lights were put out—I saw Ward kicked three or four times—I believe it was by Smyrk—the woman ran away, and so did Smith—in about ten minutes I saw Thompson, the policeman, go into a house, which I had seen Smyrk run into, and bring him out—two or three persons had shown Thompson the house—Smith and the woman ran down a court by the side of the public-house—I have no doubt of the prisoners.</p>

Pickford and Co.'s, which he had taken into Filmer's house—he said he knew nothing about it, that he had not been in the neighbourhood that morning—I saw Filmer go in and come out—nobody had been in but Newitt in the mean time—Cross-street is altogether cut of the way from the City-road to the Castle in Wood-street.</p>

I heard of the fight, went into the yard, and saw Fullerton lying down—Whorewood was standing by him upright—somebody helped Fullerton up—he ran towards Whorewood and struck him, and Whorewood knocked him down again—Andrews held her foot up, and said she would kick him, but I do not know whether she did or not—there were persons about—one of them took Fullarton to the water, and washed his face—I heard him say</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Little Chapel-street, Westminster, and am a hardware man. I took the house from the prisoner John Hyde, about six or seven weeks before I was robbed of this money—I told him at the time I took it that I had some money coming, with which I was going to set up in business; and on one occasion I lent him a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, which he repaid me the next day—on the 11th of Feb. I was in treaty for a house and shop in peter-street, from a Mr. Fisher—I told Hyde in the morning that I was in treaty for the house, and was going to buy the furniture and fixtures as it stood; and he said he would go down with me and see it—we went to Mr. Fisher's, and had half a pint of gin—I then found out I had come out without any money—I said to Hyde, "I must go home again, for I have brought no money out with me"—he said I had no cause to go home, what I wanted he would lend me—he lent me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we then had the half-pint of gin—I again said that I must go home for my money, and said it was no use my stopping</p>

               <p>there all day without money—he said he would come down again by and by and bring me some more—he said, "You stop here, and do not you leave the place, for you have bought the furniture and fixtures as they stand; if you go, part of the things may be taken"—he went away, and returned, and brought me half a crown—that was about one o'clock—he left again, and returned again about five o'clock—he then said the same words, merely telling me to stop where I was—Mr. Fisher heard him say that—her name is now Mr. Baxter—she kept the house—when he had said so many times, "You shall not go, "she said, "Both him and you shall go, for he is not to take the place until Monday next"—I told Mr. Baxter I would pay her for it then, and take possession of it at that time—Hyde said, "You shall not go; there is 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay, and if you want it I will lend it to you"—he then went away—that was about half-past five or six o'clock—before he went, Mr. Baxter said to him, "Mr. Simister is now <hi rend="italic">far on</hi>, and if he should get anything more to drink he will not be able to settle it"—I was getting the worse for liquor—I knew perfectly well what I was about—my wife was not with me—Mr. Baxter told Hyde that Hannah (that is my wife)was lying down, and to be certain not to disturb her, for if I got more, and was not able to settle it, she would return with Mr. Baxter, her husband, at nine o'clock, to settle it—I continued in the house till I heard I was robbed, which was a little before seven o'clock—a massage was brought to me to go home—my house is about five minutes walk from Mr. Baxter's, about a quarter of a mile—when I went home I went into my bed-room, and found my notes gone—I had left them in a little drawer that goes into the inside of a bureau—I had seen them safe in the morning—there were then ten 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, nine in a roll, and one was doubled, up and dropped into a case in the same drawer—that was a note which I had sent my young man out to change a day or two before—when I went home I did not find Hyde there—I went to his own house, and saw him—he and his wife were present—I told him he had robbed me—he said he had not—that was all that passed at the time—I went again the next day—the female prisoner, who is his wife, was in the little back parlour, and he was in the shop—his wife must have heard what I said the night before—she said, "I hope you do not think now, as you did last night, that we have robbed you, for I saw your wife put the roll of notes into her bosom"—about ten minutes after I went in again, and she said it might have been paper, she never saw the notes at all—I had got the money from the bank of England.</p>

I believe—I had laid out more than 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in stock—I do get tipsy at times unfortunately, once a week perhaps, or once a month—when I went down to this shop I left my wife on the bed, when I went with Hyde to Mr. Baxter's—we had not both of us been in bed drunk all the day before—I had been to bed after the effects of drink, to recover from it—that was on the Wednesday—I had been drunk once in that week—unfortunately, a very little will make me drunk—the injury I have received in my head makes it easy—I was drunk on Tues<lb/>day and was recovering from the effects on Wednesday—I cannot say that I did not drink on Wednesday—I was not drunk on Monday—I mean to swear I was perfectly competent to look after my business—I was the worse for liquor—I was not drunk and in bed on Sunday—I was perfectly able to do anything—I had been drinking perhaps tea and coffee, and perhaps gin—I was not drunk—I did not drink ram out of the bottle's mouth that—I</p>

"—I might have said it was more money than I knew of—I told him the exact sum he had lent me—there are other parties in the house that could prove it—he said he had lent me first 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., afterwards half a crown, and then 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had borrowed money of him on one occasion before that—we had been intimate—he told me he had got money, and I told him the same—he lent me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. once—my friends and lodgers, and all the person near, knew that I had money—my lodgers could not help knowing it because I sent them out for different things—when I came home, on being sent for I found one of the lodgers at home, the old man, George white—I stated, when I got up in the morning, that I had no thought of going to the public-house, till I had mentioned it to Mr. Hyde—I mentioned that I had taken the place—he did not know it till I told him—it was not on his recommandatin that I went—mentioned it to him, and he said, "I will go down with you"—I never said his offering to go with me was the sole ceuse of my going—I told my wife I must go and look after Mr. Baxter's place, or I should lose my deposit—I said I had put the receipt for the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Mr. Baxter had given me the night before, into my</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. I remember his leaving me on the 11th of Feb.—I saw him again in the evening, about a quarter to six o'clock, at Mr. Baxter's, in Peter-street—Mr. Hyde had told me there was a quarrel about Mr. Baxter wishing to move some of the goods—after my husband left me, about five o'clock, or very soon after that, I saw Hyde in his own house—we got into conversation—Hyde said my husband had said that he had got property in the house, and he should not be easy as long as it was there—I afterwards went into his house again—I had been down to Peter-street on account of what he told me—I left Mr. Hyde at her own house—I did not see her at my house till about a quarter to six in the evening—I had started from my own home, and came back from Peter-street—Mr. Hyde followed me in about two minutes—that was a very little after six—I took the candle, to go up stairs, as they wished to have the money to wattle for the house—Mr. Baxter had told me I bad better come home and fetch the money—I went up stairs, and sat on the side of the bed—Mr. Hyde sat on a box under the bed-room window, by the side of the bed—we got into conversation for about ten or twelve minutes, about wearing apparel, and then it began about the money—she said, "If I were you, if I had any property in the house, I should put it out of the way, for your husband is as likely to come home and take the whole, as to take 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and make use of it"—at that time no one knew where the money was—I got up, and saw the keys of the bureau lying on the mantel-piece—I was going to lock it, but could not, as a piece was broken off one of the keys—as soon as I saw the piece had fallen out where the lock went in, I took the drawer out the bureau—there was not a word spoken at the time, but she stood by and saw me deposit it at the bottom of the box—I did not take the money out—I left it in the drawer, I saw it there—I had it in my hand, and I put the drawer at the bottom of a box in which I had a cap and bonnet, and a great many letter—that box was not locked—I did that for safety, as I thought—I put the drawer under my cap, to conceal it—Mr. Hyde could see what I was doing—we then came down—as we came down stairs she said she wanted to go into the yard—the door was fastened—I</p>

               <p>unfastened it, and we went in, but did not stop above a minute or two—I did not at any time put a roll of notes or a roll of paper into my bosom—I was sober—I had had a glass of liquor in the afternoon, but I had laid down after that, and did not get up till half-past five, and then I went down to ask the man in possession of the house to help me light the gas—after I had deposited the notes in the box, I went down to Mr. Baxter's again, leaving George White at the house—I cannot say that locked the back door, but I shut it after me, I am positive—anybody could very easily get over the wall on the right-hand said of the back door, which is very low, and get in behind—they would then have to pass through the back door, and up a steep staircase, to get to the room where the money was—if any person had been in the shop they could not have seen anybody who went up, because there is a door which shuts our back parlour out from the passage—a person might go through the back door without being noticed in the shop, but when we walk across that bed-room it shakes all the house—anybody can hear distinctly a footstep going across the room—I went to Mr. Baxter's again, because she told me I had better fetch the money, and to see if I could get my husband home—I found him there—I did not get him home just at that moment, but I did a very little time after—I heard of the robbery while I was there, and then went straight home.</p>

On the day of the robbery Mr. Simister left me in charge of the shop—I lighted the gas, to the best of my recollection, about five o'clock—Mr. Simister came in, as near as I can guess, about a quarter past six o'clock—Mr. Hyde went up stairs with her—they remained up stairs, I should say, ten minutes or more—they came down again, but previous to that the back door, that leads into the yard, was locked—I saw them go out—I did not see anybody till Mr. Simister called to the little boy who was standing in the shop, and took him out with her—he was in the back par<lb/>lour, which adjoins the shop—I was there as well—I then remained there alone—in a little while Mr. Hyde came, and requested me to to come out and mind his shop—I went to the side of the window and he said, "Stop here, and then you can mind my shop, and see into your own too"—I stood with my side to the shop, so that if anybody went in I should have seen it, but if anybody went in the back way I could not—after he left I got up to the threshold of the door—in about five minutes I heard something go over the ceiling—the houses adjoin each other—when Hyde went away he said he was going to his workmen—he was away full an hour.</p>

               <p>prisoner was in our service for five or six years—it was his duty to at<lb/>tend me and my partner, at any sale which was going on—on those occa<lb/>sions he had a duplicate book of the catalogue of the sake that was going on, before him—I have the book here—if money were paid for an article at the end of the sale, if it were a single lot, it was the prisoner's duty to place it to the account of money—this is a printed catalogue of the day's sale—the catalogue is interleaved, and in the margin of the interleaves are the numbers corresponding with the catalogue—the first lot sold that day was to Solomon, for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the next two lots are bought in, and no account taken of them—the lot of Solomons is posted at the moment, No. 423—3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—if a party whom we know attends the sale, and makes a purchase of a lot, we enter the lot to the name of the party purchasing, and then post it into the book—if he purchases more than one lot, we enter the number of articles he purchases during the day—if an individual purchases a lot which is paid for, either at the time, or directly the sale is over, that is fires carried to the account in the ledger, and then transferred from there to the money-paper—it was the pri<lb/>soner's duty, with respect to the money payments, to furnish what we call the money-paper—here is the money-paper for that day—to make up the money-paper the prisoner goes through the ledger, enters the names of the parties who have paid deposits, with the amount of the deposit; all the names of other persons who have paid for their goods entirely, and the total amount of the money received for single lots—this is called the money-paper.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe you took the prisoner from a Mr. Ritcher? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not remember the name, but we received a very good character with him—the duties he had to perform are not very easy, they require attention—there is a great deal of confusion at times—I think the prisoner was given into custody about eight o'clock on Monday evening—he did not beg that he might be allowed to make out his accounts—his accounts were already balanced—he was told there was a deficiency—he did not beg that he might have an opportunity of balancing his account before I did anything—he was constantly employed, to my knowledge, to make purchases for other persons—he would not be intrusted with money to make the payments—we expect to be paid if we do not know the customers, or to have the goods on the premises—we have not credited the prisoner to any large amount—I think the most he ever owed the firm has been 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we have not, in point of fact, ever placed any restriction at all upon him—there are persons who attend our rooms, who are perfectly well known—they might, if they pleased, receive goods on credit, but not without our concurrence—there are customers that the prisoner would be perfectly entitled to give credit to, and allow the articles to be removed from the place on the day of the sale—there have been articles sold there on his account—I think we owe him for that about 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I have not sent that to him since this matter—he has been a purchaser on credit as far as a coat, or anything for his personal use—he purchased a piano-forte by private contract, my partner sold it him on credit for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 13 guineas—we made him debtor for the piano, and gave him him credit to the amount of 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I seat the caravan for the piano, and I believe we have it now—I have not sent it back to the prisoner—his two sisters and a friend came the day after he was apprehended, and I stated to them that this piano-forte had been obtained with the understanding that the prisoner should procure my consent before it was removed off the premises—that is what Mr. Debenham told me—I should think the prisoner's sisters are twenty or twenty-two years of age—I did not work on their fears—I told them I should send for the piano-forte it they had no objection—they said they had no objection, I was quite welcome to do it—I sent and took it—that was the day after the prisoner was in custody.</p>

I believe that was all—Mr. Robson's account was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but that was not one of them—there was not a sum for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for which he debited himself, and in point of fact made a mistake—Mr. Robson called the day after the prisoner was in custody and paid a sum of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which he had debited himself with—he debited himself with 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 15th, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 11th for lot 57, and since that time I have received these two sums—I have not sent them to the prisoner—Mr. Parry</p>

               <p>is a customer of ours—I am not aware that the prisoner debited himself with 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Mr. Parry on the same day—Mr. Parry bought a lot for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 15th, that is entered as paid—we have not been paid that since that I am aware of—Mr. Milo has not paid that to my know<lb/>ledge—Mr. Carter paid 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a lot on the same day—that has not been paid since—it has not come through our books—I do not know that Mr. Carter did not pay that—I have not heard that—I have heard nothing of that account except that Mr. Carter called a few days ago, and said he had given the prisoner 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the week before he was apprehended, to pay for this lot.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and carry on business at No. 26, John's-row, St. Luke'<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. The prisoner entered into my service about sir months ago—he wrote his name on this paper, as "James Horle"—it was his duty to receive money on the redemption of pledges—having received the money, he was to pin the two duplicates together, and put them into a drawer kept for that purpose—he had no right to put any tickets anywhere but into that drawer—I was in the habit of seeing these tickets every night, and com<lb/>paring the money with them—every night there would be an account of the money expended in advances, and the money repaid—I ascertained the ad<lb/>vances made by casting up the book—the prisoner cast up the book—it is what we call the auction-book, in which pledges are entered that are above 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—if the pledges are under 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., they are entered in another book—I refer to those two books, to the duplicate-drawer, and the money in the other drawer, and balance the whole—on the 13th of Feb., I found, on going through this procedure, that the money would not balance, there was a defi<lb/>ciency of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I mentioned it to the prisoner—he assisted me to cast the books over again to see if he could make the account right—he did not say anything about having any duplicates in his pocket—we did not succeed in making the accounts right—we gave it up—he was in the habit of going home on Sunday morning—he went home the next morning—after he was gone, I and my son had some conversation, and in consequence of that I sent him to where the prisoner kept hid clothes—my son produced to me a glove containing duplicates—I told my son to put the glove back again—the pri<lb/>soner came home about eleven o'clock that night—I had previously sent for sergeant Brannan—he was with me when the prisoner came—I said to the prisoner, "Walk in—you recollect last evening our account would not balance, and in looking over the auction-book, I perceive a watch booked 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the lad says it was taken in for a guinea, and they came and had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more on it—now, this is a sergeant of police—in looking over the tickets I could not</p>

               <p>find this guinea ticket—do you know anything of it?"—he said, "No"—Mr. Barnnan then went into the shop, and I went in with him—he took from a drawer a coat which the prisoner had worn up to the Saturday evening—he took from the coat the same glove with the tickets in it, and, on further search, a newspaper parcel was found with more tickets in it—the tickets did not appear to have been put in casually, they were wrapped up very carefully—I think there were twenty-seven altogether—the amount was about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—amongst them was one for a silk dress, redeemed for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; another for a gown pawned for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and redeemed; and a coat for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and there were both the duplicates applying to their redemption—here is another for a gown for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and one for a suit and trowsers for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—here are both the sets of duplicates here—when they were found, I made use of some expression, being a little excited—I said, "Good G—, what does this mean?"—the prisoner said, "they are your property"—it was his duty to have put these dupli<lb/>cates into the drawer, and, if he had, it would have appeared that there should have been 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd more in the cash-drawers.</p>

Q.</hi> How long has he been with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Since the 4th of Aug.—he referred me for a character to Mr. Budd, of Barking, in Essex, of the firm of Tomlin and Budd—I wrote in the name of "James Hoole, "which the prisoner gave me, and I was answered in that name—I have three youths besides the prisoner—most of them were present when this calculation was made—they had nothing to do with it—nobody served in the shop but me and the prisoner—the youths did not take money of persons who came to the shop—they took their tickets, put them into a bag, then rang a bell, and the lad up stairs found the articles, and passed them down the well—the tickets were then pinned together and taken to the prisoner—he delivered the articles out—the tickets were then put into a drawer kept for that purpose—the drawer was not locked—there was a hole to put the duplicates in—there is another drawer in which the tickets are put at night when they have gone through this ordeal, called the waste-drawer—when we take out the tickets, we take the money out of the till, and balance one against the other, and settle the books—if the tickets are of greater amount than 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., they are put into the auction-book before we settle the account, and the others we put into the book after we settle the account—we occasionally apply to the till for other than shop purposes—I have the account here where the prisoner has given 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the house for that day—both the prisoner and I apply to the till, but we give a check for it—a young man named Frederick was in my service before the prisoner—he had the place the prisoner had—when he was there we found occasionally that the accounts did not come right at night by a trifle—he was with me about four months, I think—the pri<lb/>soner is the third person I had had in the course of a year—I had had no change for seven years before that—I have discharged none since the prisoner has been in custody—he and the apprentice slept in the shop—my son sleeps in the shop sometimes, but did not on that Saturday night—he slept with me—my son went to the prisoner's drawer between nine and ten on Sunday morning—the prisoner went out at nine—the glove was put back again, be<lb/>cause the tickets were found in his pocket, which was an improper place—I told my son to put it back, to shut the drawer, and I would speak to the officer—when the prisoner came, I told him I had been 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. wrong, and I had heard from my son about the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the guinea—I asked if he recol<lb/>lected it—he said he recollected the transaction, but knew nothing about the ticket—he did not say he recollected the person having the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there was a case of dentist's instruments found in the drawer—he said my son knew that they were there—he did not say he knew perfectly well that they were there</p>

               <p>for the last three months—I do not recollect his saying my son knew they had been there for the last twelve months—my son keeps his clothes up stairs—he may keep a thing or two in the shop—he sleeps there sometimes, and takes his clothes off there—the prisoner generally stays to breakfast on Sunday morning—he did not on that occasion—he did not tell me he should not stay—he went out and said nothing—all the drawers in the shop are not unlocked—there was an entry in the auction-book of this 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—by referring to that I could ascertain there had been a transaction about the watch.</p>

                  </hi>, Jun. I am the son of the witness. On Sunday morn<lb/>ing, the 14th of Feb., I and my father were going over the accounts toge<lb/>ther—I went to a drawer where I knew the prisoner's cloths were, and found some tickets in the prisoner's pocket—I replaced them by my father's desire—on the Saturday night I slept up stairs with my father.</p>

Be-tween nine and ten o'clock in the evening on 15th Feb., I was sitting in my parlour, at the back of my shop—the prisoner came into the shop—a woman called out, "The boy is behind your counter"—I jumped up, and saw the prisoner rush past the women at the door—I ran and caught him about 100 yards up the street—I passed a man who was standing on the steps, who attempted to catch him, but he eluded his grasp, and he could not—I took the prisoner, the policeman came up, and I saw him search him—he found on him six shillings, nine sixpences, and four groats—as I passed out of my shop I saw my till open—it had not been open before—it was always kept shut—I could not tell the amount that was in it—it was in small silver, shillings, sixpences, and fourpenny pieces—there was about as much as was found on the prisoner, and that was gone from my till.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Barnett-grove, in the parish of Bethnal-green—I keep pigeons in the loft at the top of my house. On the 18th of Feb., at half-past six o'clock in the evening, I had eighteen pigeons safe there—next morning, at seven o'clock, I found six tiles had been taken off the roof, and sixteen pigeons were gone—on the Friday morning I found six of them in Mr. Pellet's possession.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Castle tavern, in the Holloway-road. I have known the prisoner Edward Burke twelve months—he used to work in the neighbourhood—on Saturday night, the 13th of Feb., about half-past ten o'clock, he came to my house—he had come on three previous Saturday nights, kicking up a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—his brother William followed him, and another man whose face I did not see—they had not been in two minutes before a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> com<lb/>menced—I went into the tap-room and said, "Now, Burke, you are come to kick up a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> to disturb me and my customers"—he was standing up to fight some man—I immediately put out the gas light—he ran out of the bar, looked at the clock, and said, "Now, you b—old b—, it is half-past ten, you have put out your gas, that is done because I am here"—I said, "Yes, you have come the last four or five Saturday nights to kick up a dis<lb/>turbance, and made me shut up my house"—he turned round and came into the tap-room—I had kept the tap-room door open, and stood with my hand to prevent his going in, and said, "You shall not go into my house to-night, I will lose my life first"—he immediately took off his cap, put it n my face, knocked one of my teeth out, and loosened some others—I did not know what to do—two persons came behind me, and thrust me away—one said, "Get out of the way, landlord, he will hurt you; I will take my brother out" I got out of the way—William pretended to put him out, but he kept him in instead—he kept saying to his brother, "Give me room"—he <hi rend="italic">butted</hi> me and <hi rend="italic">butted</hi> my son—with the assistance of my son we got them all out, locked the door, and bolted it—he turned round—I ran to the door—they broke the lock off the side door—some people outside said, "What are you breaking the man's door open for?"—he said, "I will murder every b—b—in the house"—they got partly into the house—we pushed them out—they got in at the door again, and Edward struck right and left at everybody—the others were aiding him—he struck my son and me—I said, "Good God, cannot you find a policeman?"—my man said, "There are two outside"—they</p>

               <p>came in—Burke said, "You be—, call in two policemen, why I will murder three"—as soon as I called for the police he said to his brother, "Take your neckcloth off," which he did, I suppose, to prevent anybody catching hold of him—the policemen came in—it took ten or twelve people to put them out—they all tumbled out together—we shut the doors, and got rid of them—one of my sons was hurt, and was confined to his bed next day—the prisoner Edward dislocated my finger—I saw William the second time when they came to the door, but did not see Kelly to identify him, but have no doubt it was him, because his dress is the same—William took hold of me, and prevented my using my arms—he prevented my pushing Edward out.</p>

I was employed in pointing a garden-wall down to the ground; on the side of the wall some grass was growing; I had to take it away, to keep the water from injuring the wall, and I turned this watch up with the grass; I put it into my pocket, and kept it seven days; it had stopped, and I gave it to a watch-maker to repair—I took it form him after it had been there eight days, and I pawned it on the 9th of Jan.; I em<lb/>ployed my brother to see if he could find anybody belonging to the watch; he found the prosecutor, and he went and told him I was willing to redeem it; he came back and said the gentleman would prosecute me, as I did not let him have it before; I only pawned it on the Saturday, and on Monday I let the gentleman know; if I had known whose it was I would have given it up; I would sooner have had the money than the watch.</p>

About a quarter-past five o'clock, in the afternoon of the 19th of Jan., I went to a paddock adjoining Mr. Soames' residence at Maize-hill, Greenwich—I saw Colegate coming out of the entrance of a subterranean passage leading to the foundation of Mr. Soames' house—the other two prisoners were out in custody of another officer—I called to Colegate to come out—we tied him to the other two prisoners, put them into the stable, and left them in custody of two officers—Patmore, and the gardener and I, went about 120 yards into the passage—we found all this property, boxes of various description, and a model of a boat and of a ship—I got up to Mr. Soames' celler, and found the bricks had been removed—I afterwards searched the prisoners' houses—at Phillips' house I found a new cloth cap and some beads—the cap has been identified by one of the boys at the Naval asylum, as the property of another boy who has left the asylum—I found nothing at the other prisoner' house.</p>

I was fetched to Mr. Soames'—I went to the bottom of the paddock, and found this hole—I sent a dog up, and I heard a voice inside telling the dog to go out—I called two or three times for the persons to come out, and no answer was received—I said if they did not come out I would smoke them out—I made a smoke, but could not smoke them out there—the gardener and another man made a hole further up—we made a smoke there, and they called out that if we would put the fire out they would come out—two of them come out, and Smith took Colegate—I went into the cave—I found this model of a ship, these boxes, bends, and other things there—I had never heard of the place before—I do not think any of the police knew about the entrance to the cave—it is on quite private ground.</p>

I saw the prisoners Jones and Phillips, and one of the name of Wood, going that way—Colegate was not there—Phillips had something in a sack on his back—on seeing me, they said it was too cold, and they turned back—I have not seen Jones so often as I have the other prisoners—the mouth of the cave comes out on the side of a bank, about 140 yards from the houses, on private property.</p>

I have not got it."—I said, "I mean to accuse you of nothing, I have lost my pocket-book, and only wish to find it"—he threw open his jacket, took one or two things from his jacket pocket, a bunch of keys and a handkerchief, making the re<lb/>mark, "You may search me"—I lifted his cap from his head, but did not seach him any further—on my going nearer to him he said "Keep your hands off me; do not be after putting anything into my pockets"—we searched at the bottom of the bedstead, where it would have been if it had fallen out of my boot, and also round about the room—I searched myself—he was close to me—we did not entirely search the room till Mr. Gander came—the book not being found I said to the prisoner, "I shall have a policeman"—he said he should call his master. he would not be treated in that way—we went to Mr. Gander, the landlord's room, the prisoner, my brother-in-law, and my<lb/>self—the prisoner went partly through the door, which is a kind of small place adjoining the room—it is a small room, closet, or passage, the Prisoner went in and spoke to Mr. Grander—I did not hear what he said—Mr. Gander came out after a little time—he came round to the room where I had my boots pulled off—he said he would not have any disturbance made in his house—he was perfectly satisfied with the honesty of his servant, to which I replied, "I am not satisfied, I have lost 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I must have a police<lb/>man; I will have the house searched but what I will have my money found"—Mr. Gander appeared perfectly satisfied, and the only remark he made was, "I do not believe you ever had the money to lose"—he said he was satisfied I had not lost it there, and that his servant had not got it—he said he would have no <hi rend="italic">row</hi> in his house—I wished to have the police called, and asked him for the key to get out—he or his servant had the key of the gate that leads into the street—I asked Mr. Gander for the key to get out—he replied it was not his place to open the door—he told the prisoner to leave the room, and go and call another person up—he did not go—that was after I had accused the prisoner of the robbery—I went down to the yard and to the gates, but could not open them—I then went back to the room—the prisoner, my brother-in-law, and I think, Mr. Gander and myself went—the prisoner finally opened the gates and let me out—I think full a quarter of an hour had elapsed since I asked to be let out to get a policeman—I went out and got Hall—he returned with me—by his desire I went out again, leaving him there, and fetched two more policemen, and returned with them and searched the room and gallery—one of the policemen went into Mr. Gander's room—he allowed him to do so—we searched the yard and different carts there and found nothing—the prisoner was in the yard—I said to him, "Now, if you will restore me my pocket-book I will give you ten sovereigns and ask you nothing"—he made some exclamation, <hi rend="italic">puff</hi>, or some word of the sort—no person was searched to my knowledge—I heard nothing said about search<lb/>ing, with the exception of the prisoner offering to let me search him—in the room, but saying "Keep your hands off." When I went towards him—no person was searched after the policemen came—nothing was said about it, to the best of my memory—we then went to the station, my brother-in-law, the prisoner, the three policemen, and myself—I and my brother-in-law walked together the greater part of the way—it is my impression that we were in front the whole way, but the policeman says not—I do not know the place where the pocket-book is said to have been found—I believe we did pass Adam's-place' as it has been described to me, but I do not know it myself—we were walk<lb/>ing</p>

I was present at the public-house when these parties were going to be married—it was at the King's Arms, in Aldersgate-street—I saw some money pass between them—I sat directly opposite Catherine and John Clarke—I saw the prosecutrix count money into his hand—he sat on the left side of her—her pocket was on the right—I made her dress—I saw her take the money out of her pocket and count it into his hand—that was not many minutes before we left—we got up directly and proceeded to Lambeth—Catherine proposed having a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and two females sat inside.</p>
