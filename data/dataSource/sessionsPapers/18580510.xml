                  </hi>. I am in the employ of my father, Henry Ash Israel, who lives and carries on business at No. 66, High Street, in the parish of St. Botolph, Aldgate. I locked up the house on 8th March, about 11 o'clock—Iwas the last person up—I was awakened by the police about ten minutes past 3 o'clock in the morning—I got up, and found the street door opened—thetills in the counting house were broken open; the iron safe was opened with a key which had been taken from my pocket—I found it on a stool in the counting house—two drawers in the kitchen were broken open—I missed from my clothes in my bedroom my purse, containing 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a few coppers from my pocket; I had left the door open when I went to bed—I also missed a gold watch and chain from a drawer in my room, my great coat from a peg behind the parlour door, and several other articles—the prisoner worked for my father some years ago on those premises—when the house was locked up, the key was left at the Turk's Head, for the men to come in in the morning without disturbing the family—when I have seen the key it has been generally behind the bar.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a victualler, of No. 9, Bear Street, Leicester Square. My house was open at about 3 o'clock, in the morning of 28th July, and a party of men and women knocked at the door—I refused to let the women in, because it was late, and they remained outside—the prisoner and three others came in—there were no other people there, and there was no one assisting me—they called for some drink, and when it amounted to 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I asked for some money; a watch was offered me, and I said, "Well, I will take that as security for what you have had to drink"—they went on, till it came to 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I lent them 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; the whole reckoning then came to 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; they had been drinking two hours—a few minutes afterwards, I missed one of them, and was suddenly seized by the neck from behind—(when I put the watch into my pocket, the prisoner said to the others, "Do you see?")—Iwas garroted from behind, and the prisoner and the others ran round the bar, and rushed at my pockets, and some of my money fell on the ground—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185805100009"/>
               <p>lost the watch and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., four sovereigns and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver, and the rest I picked up after they were gone—I became insensible, and when I came to myself, I found myself in a pool of blood, from my mouth and nose, and they were all gone—I do not think I was insensible more than a quarter of an hour—I believe they had gone out and spoken to the women, but I did not go from behind my bar—three of them have been convicted, but I do not remember seeing the third one; the police swore to him.</p>

I saw him pass by about five minutes before 9 o'clock—in a few minutes after, I saw a crowd in front of Bell Court—I went up, and saw the crowd assembled, and I saw the constable had Shea and Reardon—Riley was not doing anything when I came up; I saw her there—after I took Shea in custody, according to the prosecutor's charge, Riley came up, and struck him a blow on the side of the face—she was then taken—I am confident these are the three persons.</p>

I suppose this is what you are after"—Reardon smiled and said, "You have only had that since you have been in the police, and and you may soon have to lose it again, like a great many others"—Welch put his fingers close to her face, and she said, "If you put your fingers in my face, I will shove you into the road," and he did it twice more, and she shoved him—he put his finger to his mouth and whistled; he stepped off, and looked in the direction of Holborn, and he caught sight of the policeman—hewent to Reardon, and said, "What do you say now?" and he seized her by the hair of her head and dragged her very near the ground—Shea came up, and said, "Don't pull the woman in that way"—Welsh seized Shea by the collar, a struggle took place, he let go Reardon, and they both struggled and fell in the road—Welch left the child unprotected, and I took it in my arms—I saw no watch; I saw the chain; he held it up—if he had had a watch I must have seen it—I saw them both in the road—the policeman assisted them up—I did not see them get up—I conveyed the child carefully home to its parents, No. 4, Holborn Buildings—I knew that Welch's parents and Shea's parents knew one another—I do not know that Shea worked at Mr. Cubitt's; all the work that I knew him to do was his mother's household work—the greatest number of persons who were about might be forty or fifty—I am sure there were above twenty.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stationer, of No. 3, Worcester Place, Upper Thames Street. The prisoner was in my employ as commission traveller—it was his duty to bring orders, which I sent by my men to the respective customers—I gave a month's credit, and, at the end of the month, on this money being paid to the prisoner, it was his duty to bring it to me—Ialways sent a printed invoice with all goods, with my name on it—the pri<lb/>soner left my employ some time in Feb., on the same night that these accounts became due, and three or four days afterwards I received these three letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from him, without any address; a week or a fortnight afterwards I received this account; they are all in the prisoner's handwriting—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not the invoice I sent to Longman's; it has the prisoner's signature on it—I did not make it out; I supplied the paper to Longman's—Iwent to the prisoner while he was weighing it, and I weighed a part of it—it came to 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and was then sent to Mr. Longman, with a printed bill head, which was produced to me in the place of mine; it is not in my writing, and is for a larger sum—the bill that I made out I gave to the prisoner—I also supplied Houlston and Co. with some paper, amounting to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner never paid me this 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or this 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there has been 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. discount taken off the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

Longman about 18th Feb., and would have become due the latter end of March—it must have been the latter end of Feb. when the prisoner left, and this list was sent to me about a week or ten days afterwards—he was not exactly engaged to me, he used to sell for other houses as well; it was his own connection—the arrange<lb/>ment was not that I was to provide the goods and he the connection, and that the profits of the goods above a certain price were to be divided between us—hiscommission was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. percent.—he bought no job lots for me, nor has he ever told me that I was entitled to half the profit upon them in pursuance of an agreement between us—I dare say I have known him three years—I know Almar and Son; the prisoner never bought a job lot of them and told me that I was entitled to half—I think I had one small transaction with them through the prisoner; I do not recollect whether it was for goods which I had sent to them; I recollect the name very well, but forget what transac<lb/>tion it was—I know Mr. Plant—I have had no transaction with him through the prisoner—I do not recollect the name of Phillips—the prisoner never paid any money over to me; I do not suppose he paid me more than three items while he was with me—he has had money on account; he has overdrawn his commission account—there have been several transactions between us, but not such a great many—he had money on account from me, and, in addition to that, he detained the money he had from customers—that has been going on for a considerable time, but I was not aware of his having money in his hands which he received from customers—the first time he retained money, to my knowledge, was the time he left this list on my desk—I cannot say what the earliest date is of the receipt of moneys by him which he has not paid over to me, because I have not the bill-heads, but I should think it is about three months ago; they were, at all events, moneys which were due before he left—the earliest is Silverlock's, that became due about 4th Feb., and I inquired about the money on the morning he left the paper on my desk—I did not inquire of Silverlock's whether it was paid, till I found out other items being received—Whittaker's account was due on 4th Feb.; I made no inquiry about that, till this paper was sent in to me—it may have been sent early in March, but I cannot recollect the day; I cannot say what time it was sent in—I know a person named Briggs; I do not recollect any transac<lb/>tions with him through the prisoner—I have only sent Briggs about 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of goods.</p>

On the afternoon of 26th April, the prisoners came; Coker pointed to his waistcoat, and asked if we could match it—the assistant showed him the nearest to it; that was not near enough, and he asked for a green check angola—while the assistant turned to get it, I saw Deniord take a piece of goods from the counter, and slide it down by her side—Coker turned round, and stood between her and me, to cloak the operation—Deniordslid it under her cloak; she saw that I observed her—I went in front of her, and the assistant brought the piece of goods asked for—Coker looked at it, and said that it would not do—they were about leaving, and I told him I thought it was not his intention to buy, but to steal—he asked me what I meant, and I told him—Deniord got up, and the parcel of cloth fell from her side—I gave them both into custody.</p>

Bank of England note, as I supposed, and gave it into my hand—I gave it to my daughter, to get change; I looked at it, but did not examine it much—I gave it to my daughter, immediately I received it—she was in the parlour behind the shop—I returned into the shop, after I had given it to her—shewent up stairs, to get the change, and brought it down—she called to me, and said she wanted to speak to me—the prisoner heard her call, and he stepped up to the parlour door, and asked if it was any thing amiss; she said, "No, I called my father"—the prisoner then passed me, and went out, saying he would call again in five minutes; he did not take the bridle with him, or the change—I went direct to the police station with the note, to ascertain if it was good—I put my name on it—this is the note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and this is my name—on the following day, in consequence of information, I went to a public house in Long Acre, called the John Holt, and saw the prisoner there, and two others along with him—when he saw me, he walked out, and the other two along with him—he was dressed similar to what he was the day before—I am quite certain he is the same man—I followed him, and gave him into custody.</p>

               <p>the shop—that was in the morning—I noticed that he had a stick in his hand—I should know the stick, if it was produced—this is it (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—itwas a stick like that—he put it on the counter; it remained there for some few minutes—I saw the prisoner again, when he called that evening, about 6 o'clock—I saw him hand a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to my father—I heard my sister call to my father, and heard the prisoner ask my sister what was amiss—I saw him go out—next day, I saw somebody pass the shop window, who, I thought, was the prisoner—I saw him go into a public house in Long Acre—Icame back, and told my father, and he left the shop by himself—I after<lb/>wards saw the prisoner at the station, and recognized him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Whereabouts was he then, in the yard or in a cell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In a room—my father had told me that he was in custody; he said they had the man, and wanted me to go and see him—there was another man with him when I saw him at the station—I believe he was a prisoner—he was not a policeman; he was a youngish man, a very different looking person to the prisoner—it was my father that talked to the man who came about the bridle in the morning, and also when he came for the bridle—my father does not sell sticks—I have not seen this kind of stick before—I noticed that the person who came in the afternoon had a stick; I noticed it to be the same—Ican speak to it, by the button on it—I have seen one or two like it before—Icannot say that I have ever seen a stick in all respects like it before—Ispeak to it by the handle also—there is nothing extraordinary about the handle.</p>

About 10 o'clock that evening, I was called by Mrs. Southern—she was bleeding very much from the nose and mouth, and her dress was all over blood—I went with her and Adams, 158, to No. 3, Little Park Street—we went down into the back kitchen—I saw both the prisoners there, and several others—Mrs. Southern said she would give Har<lb/>ragan into custody for an assault upon her—I and Adams tried to persuade Harragan to come to the station; he would not—he said, "What for?" I said, when he got to the station he would be told—I put my hand upon him and told him he must go—the prisoners were not both drunk—I did not per<lb/>ceive that any of them were drunk; they knew very well what they were about—when we were taking Harragan into custody, Lynch came up and swore he should not be taken—he had got something, but in the confusion, I could not perceive what it was, and he struck Adams about the hand; and when I had got Harragan against the door, he dropped himself down, and clung round my legs, and threw me down on the edge of the bed—they forced me and Adams outside the door.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185805100039"/>
               <p>On Wednesday morning, 14th April, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was, with my wife, on my way home along High Street, Whitechapel—I stepped into a public house to get a bottle of ginger beer—while I was at the bar, the pri<lb/>soner White put his hand into my waistcoat pocket—I told him it was no use, and he had better go out as soon as he possibly could, or I should give him into custody—I did not wait for the ginger beer I had ordered, but left at once, seeing the company I was in—I had hardly got into the street, when I was surrounded by five men—the prisoners were four of them—Thompson placed his arms round my neck, and almost strangled me; and if it had not been for my wife, I think they would have murdered me; I have felt the effects of it ever since; the water ran out of my eyes, as he squeezed my neck—whilst Thompson was doing this, Kay struck me on the head; Thomp<lb/>son let me go, and I turned round and saw Kay; they hustled me, and tried to get at my pockets—I buttoned up my coat as I came out of the public house—after I received the blow at the back of the neck, they all ran away—theydid not succeed in getting anything—I am quite positive they are the four men that attacked me, and ill treated me—when I recovered myself a little, I saw my wife and the policeman together—we went in pursuit of the prisoners, and met with two of them; they were secured in less than twenty minutes; I identified them immediately—I saw the other one when the policeman brought him to the station the same morning, and next morning after they were remanded, my wife recognized Hart—I could not swear to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Thompson. Q.</hi> Where was it that you say I caught you by the throat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Outside the public house door—I cannot say how long you held me by the throat—I saw you when I went into the public house; I was not insensible—I did not say, when I gave you in charge, that I thought you were one of them—I said, "That is one of the men; and that is the other"—I did not know anything about your characters at that time—I pointed you out immediately to the policeman when I came out—I did not offer to fight any one in the public house, nor when I came out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">White. Q.</hi> Which pocket did I put my hand into? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My waistcoat pocket—I did not tell the Magistrate that you tried to put your handinto my coat pocket—I did not say that I was insensible, and could not say who it was that assaulted me, nor, when I heard the Magistrate say that Thompson had been in prison, did I say, "Then I will prosecute him"—I have been in prison myself for striking my wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Kay. Q.</hi> You say I struck you at the back of the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; you were behind me—I turned round to see who struck me, and there was no one near me but you—I never said that I heard you say to the other pri<lb/>soner in the public house, "Come away; let the man alone; I know him"—Ido not know whether you bad a weapon in your hand—I have no marks to show from the blow—I did not feel that long, but my throat I did; I can hardly swallow now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Hart.</hi> I do not know these young men, only as friends; I am not guilty. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I do not speak to Hart with certainty, but since I have seen him, I am almost positive he was one of them—I would not swear it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. I was with him on the night of the 14th—he went into a public house in Whitechapel—I remained outside—I saw him come out—he said that his pocket had been attempted to be picked, and he came out without any refreshment—we were coming away at quickly as possible; he buttoned his coat up, and we were surrounded, and his pocket was attempted to be picked—the prisoners are four of the men,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185805100040"/>
               <p>and there was one more—Thompson took my husband by the throat, I believe with both hands, but it was done so very quickly that I could not positively say—Kay came behind him, and hit him a blow—I cannot say whether he had anything in his hand—it was a violent blow; my husband almost staggered—I screamed out—they attempted to pick my pocket, and it was torn almost from my dress; that was done by White and Hart and another—they did not get anything—I called for the police, and the police<lb/>man was up so quickly, they all ran away—my husband was quite sober; he was quite exhausted—I saw Hart quite perfectly and plainly; he was trying to pick my pocket—it was turned right out of my dress—they tried to pick my husband's pocket, and he was surrounded—I saw their bands towards his pocket; I cannot say in his pocket—they were feeling all round his pockets, but he had not got anything in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Thompson. Q.</hi> When your husband came out of the public nouse, did he offer to fight any men that were out there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not hear anything of the sort.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">White. Q.</hi> Are you certain that I put my hand in your husband's pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not certain; you attempted; I did not say you did it—Hart is the one that turned my pocket out, but I had nothing in it—the police came up so quickly, they all ran away directly—my husband was almost insensible; I would not have called out for assistance if they would have let him alone—Idid not say at the station that I was so frightened that I knew nothing of what occurred—I did not notice any more persons about but you four and another—they were surrounding my husband and me at the same time—I know your face well; I had never seen you before—there were two gas<lb/>lights there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Hart.</hi> You said at first you did not know me, and after the constable had been talking to you a little while, you said you did. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I knew you directly I saw you the next morning—I have not the least doubt about you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where did you see him first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Outside the Court, in Worship Street—I do not know whether that was the day after the occur<lb/>rence, or a week after; it was the next time I had to go and appear against them—I was only at the Court once—the constable did not point kirn out to me; I saw him myself opposite, and knew him directly.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, H</hi> 129). On Wednesday morning, the 14th, I heard the cry of police in Whitechapel—I went to the spot, and saw the prosecutor there—I saw the prisoners running away from the spot where he was—he could scarcely speak; water was running out of his eyes very fast—assoon as he got over it a little, he said something to me—he was so exhausted, that, before going after the prisoners, I took him up to Whitechapel Church, and stopped with him until he got a bit round, and then we went to Spectacle Alley—I had known all the prisoners before, well—I apprehended Thompson and White about half an hour afterwards, in Spectacle Alley—Whitewas without his hat; the prosecutor said that was two of them—I took hold of Thompson, and said, "I must take you into custody for assaulting and attempting to rob this man"—White immediately ran away—the prosecutor cried out, "Stop thief," and pursued him; he was stopped by another constable—Kay was taken about an hour afterwards, in Keate Street—I said to him, "I want you;" he said "What for?" I said, "For being con<lb/>cerned, with two others, in assaulting and attempting to rob a man;" he said, "Oh, Mr. Dunaway, don't take me, don't take me I am innocent;" I said,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185805100041"/>
               <p>"I must take you;" I then handed him over to two other constables, and then went and searched for another one—when I got to the station Kay said, "What am I charged with?" I said, "You are charged with being con<lb/>cerned, with Thompson and White; do you know them?" he said, "Yes, I do, and I told them to have nothing to do with the man, but they would"—Hartwas taken on the Wednesday morning week, the day they were remanded to, he was at the Court—I had been looking out for him during the the week, and also for another one, a man of the name of King—I did not take Hart into custody until I went and spoke to the prosecutor and his wife—Itook him eventually, in consequence of what the prosecutor said to me—Hartis one of those that I had seen running away that night—he asked at the station what he was charged with—I said, "You know; with being concerned, with others;" he said, "I was standing there; I saw them at it; I am innocent of it, but I was not such a <hi rend="italic">flat,"</hi> or "such a <hi rend="italic">mug</hi>, to stand there to be collared."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">White. Q.</hi> Where did you see me run to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Up George Yard—I did not see you come down again—I apprehended you in Spectacle Alley—I did not take you and Thompson against the door of the Horse and Leaping Bar—Idid not tell the prosecutor you were the man I I asked him to point you out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Thompson.</hi> I have nothing to say,</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">White and Kay each put in a written defence, stating that the prosecutor was quarrelsome, and was challenging persons to fight, upon which a disturbance occurred, but that there was no attempt at robbery.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer; the prisoner is my brother. On 14th April, I was at Mr. Burchet's carpet ground, in Maiden Lane—the prisoner was at work at the other end of the ground—the deceased and I left the ground, and the prisoner asked him what he was going to stand; the deceased said, "I will be a quartern to yours"—I went to the public house, and they were quarrelling—the deceased did not seem to wish to go away, but he was rather wranglesome—the prisoner asked to have the gin, as he had challenged it, and the deceased struck him in the mouth—that was inside the house—they both went out—I went out in two or three minutes afterwards, and the deceased was on the kerb, and he rolled off.</p>

               <p>deceased—he had an extensive bruise immediately behind the right ear, extending backwards, and down on the right side of the neck the skin was slightly bruised; it was not a wound—I rather think it must have been occasioned by the fall on the kerb stone—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, and, on turning the bones of the skull, I found several small branches from the temporal artery ruptured—the skull was not broken, the membranes were perfectly healthy, except at the crown of the head, there they were consider<lb/>ably matted together—the ruptured vessels corresponded with where the bruise was—there was about three ounces of blood in the base of the brain, pressing on the top of the spinal cord—the cause of death was the pressure of blood on the brain—which I believe was caused by the fall—there was nothing else to account for death.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you hear that he met with an accident two years before, and was subject to giddiness; might that have been so great as to cause him to fall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I examined that place, it seemed to be an old injury, and round it there were no symptoms of congestion—undoubtedly a man subject to giddiness might be so excited by drink, as to cause him to fall down—I think in this case the rupture must have been caused by the fall.</p>

On Monday after<lb/>noon,10th May, I was outside this building, about 3 o'clock, and saw a crowd—two women were quarrelling—I crossed from one side of the Old Bailey; I crossed to see what it was about, and had only just got into the crowd, when I saw Waldron's right hand under his left arm, leaving my waistcoat pocket—my watch was in his right hand; I was standing on his left—he had some bread and meat in his left hand—my watch was detached then; it had been attached to this hair guard, as it is now—I saw his hand, with the watch in it, pass to the hand of Hartley, who was standing close to him—they dropped it between them; I cannot say whose hand it dropped from, but Hartley picked it up—I collared Waldron immediately, as this only took a second or so, but when I saw the watch picked up, I let go of Waldron, collared Hartley, took the watch out of his right hand, and put it into my pocket—I pulled him into the road, collared Hartley a second time, and they were secured—Hartley said, "It's a bad job, and cannot be helped," or something of that sort.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Deal, and am agent there for Lloyd's. On 20th March last, I went to Dungeness to raise the <hi rend="italic">Clipper</hi>; I commenced my operations on 26th March—on the 27th I moved her considerably in shore—after I had moved her on the 26th, the ballast port was nearly dry; on the first ebb there was about two feet over the ballast port, it might have been a foot—the first thing that we saw was the water bubbling up on the inside of the vessel, which led me to conclude imme<lb/>diately, that the ballast port was open; we found that to be so—the ballast port is the square port at the side of the vessel—I had previously caused her</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185805100061"/>
               <p>to be plugged, and covered with sheep skin, and a piece of wood nailed over it—that was done by a diver—when the ballast port is closed, the port fits into it—it is generally secured by a screw, or something inside; sometimes it is caulked, made a fixture of for the time—I found that the ballast port was out—on the 27th we discovered a hole in the starboard quarter in the run of the vessel; this model represents the position of it—the size of that hole might be, I think, about two inches, a little more one way than another; it was not quite square—that hole had evidently been made with a sharp instru<lb/>ment—ithad not been bored, it had evidently been cut with a chisel—it was <hi rend="italic">champered</hi> away at the end in a sloping direction rather, and the outside was cut through the zinc; the zinc covering the outside was cut through—it had evidently been cut from the inside—the hole opened into part of the hold, immediately under the captain's cabin; some people call it the "lazarette"—thecaptain's cabin is immediately over it; the scuttle in the floor of the captain's cabin is immediately over the floor; it is a little hatch which takes you down into this part of the hold—the hole was little more than three feet from the floor of the cabin—I hired some men to remove the ballast which had accumulated on that side, from her leaning over so much on the starboard side; and early on the Sunday mornning, on shovelling that away, we saw two auger holes just below the ballast port; those holes were about an inch in size, and round—a short time afterwards we discovered another hole—after those two holes had been plugged up, on putting my ear to the side of the ship and listening, I heard the water still coming in, and the carpenter went outside and put his hand underneath the plugs, and put his finger into another hole; that hole was not bored through, but only through the outside skin; not through the inner lining, but enough to admit the water; we heard it rushing in—the holes are correctly represented on the model—I had those holes stopped and secured, and the vessel was then towed to Dover—it took us three or four hours to get there; during that time she made very little water; she was towed by a steamer—it was not necessary to use the pumps at all; there was no gear at all.</p>

My brother, John Manhood, was mate on board the <hi rend="italic">Clipper</hi>—in consequence of something that was told me, I went to London Bridge station to meet the prisoner, with Mrs. Lakey, and my cart—the pri<lb/>soner did not arrive by the train—I drew the cart up in front of the Margate entrance, and I observed a man, with his hat rather drawn over his eyes, keenly observing me, and I then observed him as keenly as he was observing me—I did not know him before—it was the prisoner—he crossed over, and spoke to his wife; and then she said, "This is the mate's sister"—he had no luggage with him; the train had not arrived then; when it did arrive, the chief part of the luggage was Mr. Lakey's—there were three boxes and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185805100062"/>
               <p>a feather bed; compasses, some beef belonging to the ship, barometers, and a lot of things—it was put into my cart—Mr. Lakey stood by and saw it—mybrother John said, "Where shall it go?" and he said, "Let it go with yours, John"—it was taken to my house—it was put into the shop for about a week, and then, afterwards, Mr. Lakey came, on the Monday, and asked me would I burn the boxes and all the bags, and turn the things out, and mix them with mine—there were three long canvas bags, such as sailors put their clothes in; one had "William Lakey" written on it—he also told me to take the nautical books, and tear out all the parts that had his name in them—in the front of some of those books there was "Wm. Lakey" written; but I did not tear any of them—a good many of the things were marked in full, "W. Lakey," and he said, would I pick out all the marks—there was an official log—Mrs. Lakey took that away on the Monday that Mr. Lakey was apprehended at my house; but there was not any entry in it; it was quite plain, for I looked over it to find the name to tear it out; but I did not tear any of the names out; Mrs. Lakey has them—there were two ship's compasses and a barometer; the barometer is at my house now, and the gear that belongs to the lamp that makes it swing—all the charts were thrown on the top of my chest of drawers, and Mr. Lakey said, if I was asked, I was to say they belonged to my brother—he opened the barometer, and looked at it, and said it was broken, and not of much use, and I could hang it up and say that it belonged to me—he took the chronometer away on the Monday night; that was in Chestney's box—he unlocked the box and took it away—therewere three boxes, all belonging to Lakey—they are at my place now, on my pigstye—I told him, on the Monday night, that Mrs. Lakey had told me that he had said it was better to hasten the vessel, for if they went to sea in her, she would prove a coffin for the whole of them—he said, "You must make a mistake;" I said, "No, I don't make any mistake, Mr. Lakey; for you remember, at the time, Mrs. Lakey said to you, when you wanted to bring away the whole of the ship's tools, "My God, William, don't be so avaricious;'" and he turned round to me, and said, "It was owing to her taking a glass; she would sink the whole of us"—he told me to put the things among mine, and Mrs. Lakey herself mixed a great part of the things along with my things in my chest of drawers—I asked him what I was to say, if any one asked me about it; I said, "I might be asked to say and swear that these things belong to me;" he said, "Swear they are all yours;" I said, "How can I do such a thing as that, Mr. Lakey?" he said, "Me and your brother John will swear out forty of them."</p>

Q.</hi> Your brother John was the mate on board the vessel, was he not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he did not bore the holes in her; not one of them, that I am aware of; I was not on board the ship—it was by Mrs. Lakey's desire that I went to the railway—I had not seen my brother at that time, and I did not know that the vessel had foundered—the conversation with Mrs. Lakey, about the vessel being the coffin of all of them, was on the Mon<lb/>day previous to Mr. Lakey coming to me, and telling me to burn the boxes—I said to him then, that Mrs. Lakey had told me, that had they gone to sea in the vessel, it would have proved a coffin for the whole of them, and that William thought it would be better to hasten her—the prisoner told me to burn the boxes and the bugs, and to mix the things up with mine, and to tear the names out of the nautical books—he told me to put the compasses into my brother's box—the clothes were all mixed up with mine, with my knowledge—I am not aware that I have since mistaken any of them for mine—I have not taken any of them to the pawnbroker's—I have not taken</p>

               <p>anything to a pawnbroker's belonging to Mr. Lakey—I never took anything to the pawnbroker's myself—the girl that we had living with us took two shawls of Mrs. Lakey's to the pawnbroker's, and I have had to discharge that girl through dishonesty—to my knowledge, those were the only things that were mixed with mine that found their way to the pawnbroker's—I do not know that anything was pawned but those two shawls; they are all at my house—I am not wearing any of them, and never did—my brother is at Lynn, where he resides—he has no occasion to wear Mr. Lakey's things, when he has plenty of his own—my husband has not worn any—what should he want with sailor's clothes? he is a butcher.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to tell all this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw Mr. Jeremiah Lodge a week before Mr. Lakey was apprehended—I saw that my brother's reputation was at stake, and, if I had not exerted myself in the manner I did, it is possible he might have stood charged with Mr. Lakey, as accessory before the fact—thatwas the reason I acted as I did—I have been in the habit of keeping my father's books, and have had to do with acts of Parliament since I was very young—I thought my brother might be charged as an accessory before the fact—I saw Mr. Lodge at the Protection Society, at Lloyd's, a week before, and gave in this statement—I expected they would have sent an officer, and taken all the things from my house—I had given the whole of this informa<lb/>tion before the prisoner was taken into custody—I do not know why I was not before the Magistrate—I was before Mr. Yardley the day Lakey was there first—I was not called—this is the first time I have been examined.</p>

                  </hi>. I was cook and steward on board the <hi rend="italic">Clipper.</hi> Lakey was master—we got to Dungeness roads on the Saturday morning, and lay there Saturday night—in the course of the Saturday night, Lakey told me to take the table away, and to take the lazarette hatch off, and go down into the lazarette along with him—I took the candle, and went along with him—hebored a hole through the ship, under the ballast port; he bored one, and I bored one—they were bored with an auger—the water then came in—we then went back by the lazarette, and into the cabin—I think this was near 2 o'clock in the morning—about an hour afterwards, I assisted to make a hole in the lazarette—the prisoner was there, and assisted in doing it—the hole was made with a gauge and a chisel, an anger and a crowbar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner say anything as to why he made these holes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the first commencement of it, he said the ship was making so much water that we could not get into any harbour, and if we went any further she might be a coffin for all of us, and so he thought the best thing we could do with her was to let her sink there—the ballast port was knocked out; that was by the prisoner's direction—we all went away in the long boat—I took my things with me, and so did all the crew and the master—there were ten of us in all on board; nine men and a woman.</p>

               <p>diminished the water in the hold—we kept the pump sucking—the men did not knock up; they kept pumping—they said they were knocked up, but we sucked the pump when we came round Dungeness, and they were not asked to pump any more after we came round Dungeness on the Saturday morning.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I mean, when the captain turned back, and when you were off the Isle of Wight, before anything was done to the vessel, would it have been safe to have gone on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We could not have got any further—there came on a gale of wind about an hour after we bore away—the ship was not brought as near the shore as she might have been—the wind was about W. N. W., I think, when we were off Dungeness—that was nearly off shore—she was sunk in about three fathoms—it was not much of a secret, because, when the port was knocked out, the captain called them all up to haul the cable chain out, and put it on that side—I do not know that they knew much about it before that, though they might think something about; I cannot tell; I never heard them say anything.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The protest was here read as follow:</hi> By this public instrument of declaration and protest, be it known and made manifest, that, on the 18th day of March, A. D. 1858, before me, Henry Cornfoot Cheeswright, of the city of London, notary public by royal authority, duly admitted and sworn, personally came and appeared William Lakey, master mariner and com<lb/>mander of the late good brig or vessel, called <hi rend="italic">Clipper</hi>, of the burthen of 228 tons by register measurement, or thereabouts, belonging to the port of Dart<lb/>mouth, John Manhood mate, and John Chestney seaman, of the said vessel, who did severally, duly, and solemnly declare and state for truth as follows, that is to say:—That, on the 9th day of March instant, these appearers and the rest of the crew of the said vessel set sail in her from London, bound on a voyage from thence to Newport in ballast, the said vessel being tight, stanch, and strong, well manned, victualled, and found in every respect fit to perform her said intended voyage. That they proceeded with all possible dispatch down the river Thames, with fine wind from west-north-west and all sail set to advantage, nothing worthy of particular notice occurring until the evening of the same day, when they arrived in the Downs and came to anchor; the wind, however, shortly afterwards became more contrary, while there were heavy snow storms at intervals, in consequence of which they were detained at anchor as aforesaid, until the morning of Thursday, the 11th, following, when, the wind being moderate from north and fine weather, they again got underweigh, and proceeded under all sail down Channel, the weather con<lb/>tinuing favourable; nothing further happened until the following day, the 12th, when it came on to blow a gale from west-south-west and subsequently west, with a rapidly rising sea; at such time they were off the Isle of Wight, and finding, in consequence of the violence of the gale and exceedingly high sea, they could make no progress, they bore away for Dungeness; the ship making water, they kept the pumps carefully attended to, and on the following morn<lb/>ing, the 13th, at 10 o'clock, they came to anchor under the lee of Dungeness, in six fathoms water, with the small bower and sixty fathoms of chain; the gale meanwhile continuing, they remained at anchor in Dungeness roads aforesaid, comparatively sheltered from the fury of the gale; having pumped the ship out dry, they set the watch, and the crew west below for the night. That, on the following day, the 14th, at 4 A.M., the said appearer, John Chestney, being on the anchor watch, discovered the said vessel had sprung a very serious leak, immediately called all hands on deck, and sounded the pumps, when they found twelve feet of water in the hold, the said vessel in consequence settling rapidly; the only thing that could be done was to get out the boats, to save the lives of the crew. The wind being off the shore, it was impossible to run the said vessel aground, more particularly as, in all probability, had they ventured to set any canvas on her (being nearly full of water) she would have capsized; therefore, for the preservation of the lives of the crew, they got out the long boat, and the crew put a part of the clothes into her, and the chronometer was saved, in a damaged state, but they saved</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185805100066"/>
               <p>nothing else, and the crew then got into her, the said appearer, the master, remaining on board until he saw there was no hope of saving the said vessel, and at 7.10 A.M. he got into the boat, and they had hardly time to get clear of her when she sank in three fathoms (low water), Dungeness light bearing south-west three-quarters south, distant about two miles. That the said appearers and the remainder of the crew then proceeded to Folkestone in the long boat, but finding no Shipwrecked Mariners' Society they proceeded to Margate, where they arrived at 4 P.M., and the said appearer, the master, immediately repaired to the office of Messieurs Brooke and Mertens, notaries public at that port, and caused his protest to be duly noted. Therefore the said appearers declare to protest, and in and by these presents they do most solemnly protest, and I, the said notary, at their request, do also protest, against the total loss of the said vessel, her tackle, apparel, and furniture, facts, incidents, and occurrences aforesaid, and for all and every loss, cost, detriment, damage, and expense that hath, can, or may arise therefrom, to the end that the same may he had, borne, sustained, and recovered by those to whom of right it doth, can, or may appertain. We, William Lakey, master, John Manhood, mate, and John Chestney, seaman, all of and belonging to the late good brig or vessel called <hi rend="italic">Clipper</hi>, within-mentioned, do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare the contents of the aforegoing declaration and protest are strictly true; and we make this solemn declaration, conscientiously believing the same to be true; and by virtue of the provisions of an Act made and passed in the sixth year of the reign of his late Majesty, King William the Fourth, intituled, An Act to repeal an Act of the then present Session of Parliament, intituled, "An Act for the more effectual Abolition of Oaths and Affirmations taken and made in various departments of the State, and to substitute Declara<lb/>tions in lieu thereof, and for the more entire Suppression of Voluntary and Extrajudicial Oaths and Affidavits, and to make other Provisions for the Abolition of unnecessary Oaths." 'William Lakey, master. John Manhood, mate. John Chestney, seaman.—Thus declared and protested, in due form of law, at my offices, 62, Lower Thames Street, in the city of London, this 19th day of March, 1858. H. C. Cheeswright, Notary.")</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Edward Page, No. 44, Westbourne Road, Paddington, a cheesemonger. His shop is at the corner of Monmouth Road—there is a board outside his window, on which I am in the habit of placing pieces of bacon and cheese, and various things—on 19th April, about a quarter before 9 o'clock, I placed some pieces of bacon on that board—during</p>

               <p>the next hour, I was engaged in going from the cellar to the shop—about 9 o'clock, in consequence of something I heard, I examined the board, and missed one or more pieces of bacon—I can speak confidently to one, which is commonly called the collar of bacon, a piece from the shoulder part—itweighed about 3lbs.—that was one of the pieces that was placed out shortly before 8 o'clock—it was after half past 7 o'clock.</p>

On 19th April, I was serving in the shop in the evening—one of my shopmen was absent; the other was partly in the shop and partly in the cellar—I saw him bring some pieces of bacon and put them on the board, about half past 7 o'clock—I did not in the course of that evening sell a collar or shoulder piece of bacon—there was no one else except Rumins, who could have done so—about 9 o'clock, Mrs. Wright and Miss White came in—Miss White spoke to me first, and in consequence of that I went to Wiltshire, the police<lb/>man on duty, and gave him information of what I had ascertained—after hearing what I said, he referred me to the station—I went to the station and communicated what I had heard to inspector Grant; he said he would go with me to the superintendent—we went to Mr. Hughes' house; he was from home—Iwaited till about 12 o'clock; I saw him, and he directed inquiries to be made—we went to inspector O'Brien, the prisoner, about 1 o'clock, he was up and dressed—I saw his children, he was at that time keeping an empty house; I found no bacon in the house—I did not see a red pocket handker<lb/>chief found—I saw the prisoner in custody the next evening—after we had searched the house, we all returned with O'Brien to superintendent Hughes—heasked O'Brien where he was that evening—he said he did not know where he was, he was at certain places during the day—Mr. Hughes asked him to confine himself to between 8 and 9 o'clock—he said he was quite confused, and could not do so at the time—he said he was in the New Buildings during the day—he was ultimately taken into custody, and the inspector came the next morning and saw Mrs. Wright, and took her statement—I said, "I am now in your hands, Mr. Grant"—I gave directions for the prisoner to be taken; he was taken that evening—when he was brought into the inspector's room the charge was entered; he did not say a word—I did not at any time hear him make any statement about the charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 45, Westbourne Road, next door to Mr. Page. Monmouth Road is on one side of Mr. Page's, and my house on the other—I rent the shop and part of the premises—my husband carries on business as a matting and basket maker—previous to 19th April, I had known the prisoner by sight, passing up and down Marylebone Lane, where I had been brought up by my parents—I had spoken to the prisoner; he had come to the door, and asked how father and mother were—I did not know his name before—on 19th April, I saw him pass my door, with his arms free, and he passed Mr. Page's—he returned, and took a piece of bacon, and I saw him conceal it under the front skirt of the coat he had on, while passing my door—he passed Mr. Page's; he did not remain a minute; he crossed Monmouth Road, and returned directly—he took the bacon from the corner next Monmouth Road—I do not know whether his coat had bright buttons or not—he went towards the Galway Road; the next turning on the same side, past our shop—he returned in not more than five minutes, and had something in a red handkerchief, under his arm—he had nothing at all under his arm the first time; his arms were swinging—when he came back, he</p>

               <p>stood for five or six minutes at the corner of Monmouth Road, and then went and took another piece of bacon from the same part of the shop—he took the bundle from under his arm, and put the bacon under it, while pass<lb/>ing my door, holding the bacon in one hand and the parcel in the other—he went towards Galway Road again, and I saw no more of him that evening—afterseeing this done a second time, I communicated with my husband and Miss White—I went to Mr. Page, and gave him a description of the man, but I could not tell his name—Mr. Page went immediately to a constable—therewas one passing, and he spoke to him—I should think that was about twenty minutes after I had seen the second piece of bacon taken—that was a long piece and fat—the first was more of a square piece—I think the second was what they call the ribs; I do not know the name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you not communicate it the first time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I told my hus<lb/>band, and he wanted to go out, but I thought it might be a joke—I did not know the prisoner's name—I knew he was an inspector of police.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After he took the first piece, did you speak to Mr. Wright? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; before he took the second—my husband went across to speak to Mr. Palmer—hewas speaking to Mr. Palmer at the time the prisoner took the second piece—they were across the road at that time—after I saw the prisoner take the second piece, I got across the road, and I cried out, "He has taken another piece"—I then thought it was a joke for a little while—I went and told my husband he had taken another piece—I told him to that Palmer could hear—after I had said that, we did not all three stand there, my hus<lb/>band and I came back—I did not go to speak to Mr. Page for a little while—Palmerwent back to attend to his customers—my husband went to work—I told Miss White—till she told Mr. Page, none of us said a word about it—we did not like to tell him—I saw Mr. Page come outside the shop before the first piece was taken—I saw his wife there before the second piece was taken—Idid not tell his wife I saw the policeman pass by between the first and the second taking—I did not speak to him—I ran across after the second piece was taken—it was before my husband went across that the policeman passed—I did not see the policeman pass after my husband had gone across to Palmer—he passed after the prisoner had taken the first piece.</p>

I said, "Yes"—he named certain goods, which he requested might be sent that evening to No. 12, Beaufort Buildings—they came to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I sent them—the prisoner subsequently called upon me at various times, and</p>

I live at No. 6, Maldon Buildings, and was one of the directors of the General Pictorial Exhibition Company, at the end of 1856 or the beginning of 1857—it remained in existence three or four months only—thelast regular meeting was on 8th April, but the meeting at which the disso<lb/>lution took place was held at Mr. Maddocks', in Serjeant's Inn—previous to that the prisoner was secretary of the company; he was one of the promoters of it—in May, 1857, his services were dispensed with, and he was dismissed—Mr. Maddocka proposed that the chairman and secretary should be dis<lb/>missed—Isupported the proposition, and as it was not opposed, I consider that he was dismissed—I did not, on behalf of the company, give him autho<lb/>rity to act for them after that date—he had no authority from me, or in behalf of the company, to order goods of Messrs. Rowsell.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Cross Street, Rotherhithe. On 17th April, about 1 o'clock in the day, I was in Cross Street—I saw two boys fighting—it was the prisoner and the deceased John Boulton—Boulton was rather taller than the prisoner; he was thirteen years old—there were several more persons there at the time, but only three men were there besides the children—the prisoner, Hambrook, was one of the men—when the boys were parted I heard Hambrook say to the prisoner, "Give it him right and left, and hit him once under the ear, and he won't want to fight again"—I did not hear him say which ear—the boys had two rounds after that, and the last round Selless hit Boulton underneath the left ear, and he dropped down, and gave a scream, and curled up his feet—he was taken up, and taken into a doctor's—Selless ran over to his mother's, screaming, and said, "Oh, mother, have I killed him?" and he ran to the doctor's as fast as he could, and he was not at home when he went.</p>

Q.</hi> You are sure that you were there while the fight was going on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I did not come up just after it was over, I was there, and saw it—I was just going to my work—when I first saw them, I was about the length of this Court off, and I went over—there was no crowd round them—there were five or six boys round them, that was all—I saw three men come up—I knew some of the boys by sight—I knew the men—I did not know one of them—one was Mr. Ventham—I did not know Hambrook before—I did not know the other man's name—I did not see anybody go up and try to part the boys before I got up to them—noone went up and parted them, until I told a young lad to go up and part them, and he went up and parted them—the other boys never touched Boulton at all—when the boy parted them, this man said, "Keep up to him, young one, and give him right and left"—I was as close to them as I am to this gentleman (<hi rend="italic">the foreman of the Jury</hi>) when he said that—I did not hear the other men say anything—they did not come over at all, only one man came over—after the boy dropped down they came over, but not before—the three men were standing together over by the chapel—Hambrook was the first man that came up—he stood away from them—the two men stood together—the boys were fighting on the other side—Hambrook and the other two men were standing on the pavement, near the chapel door, while the boys were fighting across the street, and after the boy parted them, Hambrook came up and said something, whispered, and told him where to hit him—I can't say how many rounds there were before he made use of that expression; I did not count them—I dare say they were fighting somewhere about ten minutes before any<lb/>thing</p>

               <p>was said—then the boy parted them, and Hambrook walked up and said to Selless, "Keep up to him young one, and give him right and left"—Hambrook never touched the boy when he fell—I know John Ventham, I saw him there while the fight was going on, he stood over by the chapel; he was one of the three men—Hambrook did not go over and pick the boy up when he fell; he put up his hand and went away; he did not speak to any person, and send him to get some water for the boy, a woman brought some in a tub—I did not hear Hambrook tell her to get it—a <hi rend="italic">lot</hi> of people came up after the fight was over—at the time the boy fell there were several personi in the road, and when he fell a crowd collected—Hambrook was right inside the crowd, close to the boys—the crowd was pressing round us.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at Rotherhithe. I was called to see the deceased—I saw him about an hour after his death, I believe—on the following Tuesday I opened the body, the cause of death was the rupture of a blood vessel at the base of the brain—I certainly do not think that was likely to be caused by a blow under the ear, or behind the ear—there was no extravasation, there was no rupture of a blood vessel near the ear; it was at the base of the brain—the upper portion of the brain was in a very excited state, the vessels were all gorged with blood, and the boy tumbling would be quite sufficient to cause it—I think it was from a fall; I should say certainly not from a blow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corn dealer, of No. 144, Southwark Bridge Road. On 6th April, between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came, and one of my shopmen drew my attention to a bad shilling in her presence—Iasked her whether she had any good money about her, she said "No"—Isaid "I have reason to suppose you have come to the shop on many occa<lb/>sions offering bad money, and, as we have had so much bad money offered, I shall feel it my duty to give you in charge"—she tried to leave the shop, but I prevented her—she begged me to let her go, and she would never do any thing of the kind again—I gave her in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The shilling was quite straight when it came out of the other gentleman's hands, and when I gave it to him back it was bent in two. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> The shopman bent it before handing it to me, but it never went out of my sight—I think I marked it—I gave it into the officer's hand—there were several customers there, and it is quite possible I might have passed it over to them, but it never went out of my sight, and I am sure this is the same—I marked it directly the shopman gave it to me—it was bent then.</p>

I was on duty in King Street, and saw the prisoners standing at the corner of Cross Street—they went into the Newington Arms together, and came out together—I had seen them together several times in the same month—just as they got to the door, Potter caught sight of me standing in a dark corner, being in uniform, and said to Davis,"Here is <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi> here," and passed a parcel from his right hand into Davis' left—he ran to the left, and Davis to the right—I ran after Davis, overtook</p>

               <p>him, and said, "Give me that parcel"—he said, "I have no parcel"—while I was searching his right hand, he dropped a parcel from his left, on my foot—Ipicked it up; it contained ten bad sixpences, each separated from the other by a piece of paper—I said, "Halloo I here you are; at it again; where did you get these from?"—he said, "You know; you know where I have been to; wait a minute, <hi rend="italic">Dickey</hi> will be here"—Potter did not come, and I took Davis to the station, and charged him with having ten counterfeit six<lb/>pences—he said, "I picked them up"—I did not take Potter till the 29th, this being the 23d—I had been looking for him in the meanwhile—going to the station, Davis said, "I suppose you mean having <hi rend="italic">Dickey</hi> for this?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I suppose we shall get it for this"—I told Potter that he was charged with a lad named Davis—he said, "Davis"—I said, "Well, your little boy"—he said, "I have got no little boy"—Davis is called <hi rend="italic">Dickey</hi> Potter's little boy—I told him it was at 10 o'clock or a quarter past—he said, "I was in bed at 10 o'clock"—I said, "Who were you in bed with? if you will tell me, I will go and make inquiries, and see whether I have made a mistake, but I know you too well to make a mistake"—hesaid, "No, it is no use sending you to my friends; they are all convicted thieves"—I have no doubt about Potter.</p>

On Saturday night, 10th April, before 9 o'clock, I was sitting in my kitchen, down stairs, I heard the door open—I went up into the hall, and missed two coats, which had been hanging up there—I immediately joined in the pursuit, and saw two men, each with a coat on his arm—I ran after them, and called for assistance—they ran into Seven Step Alley, which is no thoroughfare—I pursued one of them, with one of the coats on his back; he knocked me down, cut my head in a most dreadful manner, and broke the top of my shoulder bone—they got away from me; I got up as well as I could, and two officers assisted me home—the prisoner afterwards came to the door, and I identified him as the one who had knocked me down—he said that he knew where my coat was; I said, "You rascal, you are the one that had the coat on"—he said that he was not, but that he came to my assistance, and was knocked down—nobody came to help me—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of my coats; the man who knocked me down had got it on.</p>

               <p>On Saturday, 10th April, I was standing at my door, which is not above four minutes' walk from the prosecutor's house, and saw three men with caps on, rush up the court—Mr. Ives followed them—two of them entered the enclosure, and Mr. Ives took hold of the third, and called out,"Stop thief! Murder! Police!"—they struggled together till they got the length of two houses, and then fell, and in getting up the man threw this coat off, and left it on the ground—they all three ran off—the prisoner came up about five minutes afterwards, took the coat off the ground, placed it on his arm, and said that he knew where it had been stolen from, and would return it to the owner—I said, "The police are the proper persons to take charge of it"—a policeman came, and he and the prisoner went away together—Idid not see the faces of the three people.</p>

"I did; I have left my name and address there"—the prosecutor said that he was sure the prisoner was one of the three, and I asked him to accompany me to the station—the inspector asked him his name and address—he said, "John Williams, No. 42, John Street, Broad Street, Ratcliffe"—the inspector was going to send a man there, and the prisoner said, "If you send there, you will not find me there"—the sergeant was then recalled, and the prisoner was given in charge.</p>

               <p>it is a common lodging house. I was sleeping there on 23d April—there was a man in the same bed, a captain—I placed my purse on a chair; it con<lb/>tained 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—about half-past 8 o'clock in the morning the captain awoke me, as the door was open; he got up and closed it—shortly after that there was a noise outside, as of some one coming down three steps towards the bed-room door, and then they burst open the door from the passage, and came in—itwas sufficiently light for me to see their faces, and they looked towards us—the prisoners are the men—Waring went out first, through the window, and Callaghan after him—I directly missed my purse—I had not seen whether it was safe when the captain closed the door—they did not pass that part of the room where the purse was—it was taken when I found the door open—I knew both the prisoners before.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the same house as Gosling, and on that night I occupied a room on the same floor; I was not alone, it was a girl who was with me—towards morning I heard men's voices, and Callaghan came into my room—I said, "Who is there?" and looked up, and saw him with the door in his hand—he said, "It is Harry Waring"—I asked him what he wanted, and he went away—I had not known him before, except seeing him the afternoon before at a public house door near, but I knew Waring—I am quite sure Callaghan is the man I saw—I got out of bed directly, and before I had gone into the other room they were out at the window—any one can step out at the second floor window on to the wall, which is not very high, and there was a ladder leaning against it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you any blind in your room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Curtains; there were no curtains to the bed—the door was shut, but not locked—Cal<lb/>laghan was brought to the house before 7 o'clock that morning—the captain was there then—he said that he did not know which of them had taken his money, and he did not wish to stay—Gosling said that she had lost her money, but she did not have him taken; he was allowed to go away again—thereare upper blinds to Gosling's room, but no curtains—I went into that room as soon as I had put on my dress, and the blind was down on one side; there is no roller to it, and it was tucked in the rope on one side.</p>
