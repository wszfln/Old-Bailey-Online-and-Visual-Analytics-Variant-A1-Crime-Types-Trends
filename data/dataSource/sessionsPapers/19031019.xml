Wall," which is written in afterwards—I refused to pay it, and gave it back to the prisoner—he went out, and I gave instructions that he should be followed—about ten minutes later Rimer came in, bringing the same order—I did not pay it, I kept it, and he went away—shortly afterwards Hitchcock again came in and asked me for the order—I said I had not received any order from him, and, therefore, I could not give him one back—he was a bit cross about it, and then went out—I reported what had happened to the Post Office authorities—when Rimer came in I noticed that he had on the same coat and hat that Hitchcock was wearing when he came in, and when Hitchcock came back the second time he had the same coat and hat on again.</p>

You were seen to meet the post-man Rimer; you exchanged coats and hats with him; do you wish to say anything about it?"—he said, "Quite right; he asked me to change it; I went to change it, but they would not do so, so I gave it back to him; I have changed about seven or eight postal orders for him"—I had 29 postal orders which had been traced to Rimer—I then showed him three orders, and said, "These three orders have been stolen from post letters, besides others I have here; I suppose you know where he got them from?"—he said, "Yes, he got them from letters"—I showed him the 29, and he selected seven or eight as those which he had received from Rimer and cashed himself—the earliest date was July 4th—he said, "I changed those for him, and some others which I do not remember"—the eight were all made out in different names.</p>

I live at 47, Lower Chapman Street, Commercial Road, and am employed by Burroughs, Wellcome and Co.—I assist in the manage<lb/>ment of this boys' club—I have known the prisoner for about a year—he is a member of the club—I thought he was a respectable boy, and think so now—on September 28th I saw him at the club at 6.45 p.m.—he was what I should call quite drunk—I do not think he was accountable for his actions—I heard the conversation that he had with Mr. Iselin—he answered intelligently—he was not raving, but he did not know what he was doing—he said people would give him drink when they would not give him anything to eat—his thumb was cut and bound up with a piece of rag—I asked him what he had done; he said he had cut it, and would I bind it up; I did so—I asked him if anyone had a knife, and he said he had—he did not say where he got it—he was not playing with it while in the club—he left about 9.30—he had nothing to drink while he was there—we have a vaulting horse in the club and he went over it two or three times and hurt his shin—he conducted himself quietly and soberly while he was there.</p>

               <p>left on that date with your daughter, aged about three months, in your possession, and at 7.30 on September 1st you were seen to leave a shed at the rear of a house in course of construction in Bowes Road, New South-gate. At 8 a.m. a female child, nude, was found in the space left for the hearth stone in the back parlour of the building. It was concealed with a quantity of cow hair. The child's head was found to be fractured, and it is since dead. It has been identified by one of the witnesses at Edmonton Union, as the child you left the Union with on August 31st. You need not say anything unless you desire to do so, but whatever you say will be taken down and given in evidence against you"—she replied, "The child was with me yesterday; I have been looking about for it all day; it is not quite five weeks old yet"—I said, "At the time of your arrest you were found to be in possession of a quantity of baby's clothing with bloodstains upon it"—she said, "I cannot account for the blood on the child's clothing"—I conveyed her to New Southgate police station, where she was charged with the murder—she said, "My child is not three months old yet, it is only five weeks; I left the Edmonton Union with it yesterday."</p>

I am an agent, of 83, St. Paul's Churchyard—on October 1st about 2.30 p.m., I was in Fleet Street, walking on the left-hand side towards my office—when I got close to the Cheshire Cheese, the prisoner John knocked my glasses off and made for my throat—I concluded that he was going for my scarf pin and I put one hand over it and the other over my pocket—I was then thrown on to the pavement—I could not see which of the prisoners threw me—I know there were two at me—one of them got on my back and the other took my head and hammered it on the flags, cutting it severely—I exerted all my strength and threw myself clear of them and ran to find a policeman—John Austen followed me—I met a policeman, and pointing to John Austen said I would charge him—I did not see what became of Harry Austen—I went with the officer to the station and was asked what charge I made against the prisoners, who were both present then, and I said, "Assault and attempted robbery"—John Austen said, "Quite right"—I had some money in my pocket, but I did not lose any—I lost a rule which may have tumbled out of my pocket.</p>

               <p>course of my investigation, and am acquainted with his writing—the entries in the cash book and ledger are his—there is nothing in the books to account for the deficiency of £239 19s. 6d.—there is a suspense account opened for £40, but what that refers to I do not know; there is nothing in the books to explain it—it is carried into the profit and loss account in the balance sheet—the advances account in the ledger shows the amounts lent out upon loan, and the amounts repaid—the amounts still out upon loan properly amount to £3,981 4s. 8d.—they, in fact, appear as £4,181 4s. 8d., the "41 "having been written over an erasure—there is a genuine error in the customers' account, of sixpence—that appears in the cash book for the next month—altogether there is £239 19s. 6d. concealed, which is the exact amount of deficiency in cash—the £200 too much in the advance account is dealt with by two sums of £100 being entered twice over—they are first entered to the credit of the City branch of the Bank, and then credited over again as amounts received as repay<lb/>ments of loans—I also produce a till book kept by the prisoner which shows a cash balance in hand at the beginning of October of £86 13s. 7d.—during October, according to the ledger and cash book, the cash in hand was increased by £57 2s. 4d., making £143 15s. 11d.—the till book shows only £42 15s. 2d. as cash in hand at the end of October, a deficiency of £101 10s. 9d.—under the date of October 21st there is an entry, "Paid £101 10s. 9d," but nothing to show to whom it is paid—there is no trace of it in the ledger or cash book—all the other entries contain the names of the persons to whom the money is paid out—this entry happens to be the last on the page, and I believe it to be fictitious—I have spoken to the prisoner several times about the deficiencies, and he told me that the explanations are in the journal and the till books—those books are not forthcoming—one till book (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) was found by the Directors, but there are fifteen or sixteen altogether—I was present at a meeting when the Directors asked the prisoner for an explanation, but I did not hear them ask any specific question.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fruit salesman, of 4, Rosetta Place, Bishops-gate—I was married to the prisoner in September, 1893—I ceased to five with her on April 11th last year—I went to America to find work, because business was bad here—we parted the best of friends—I left her £178 in the Moorfields Bank in Middlesex Street—she has now £78 there—it is my money that I worked for—she kept it from me—I asked her, and she said she had not got a penny of my money—I went once to the bank, but the money had gone, eighteen months before—I gave her the money—it was in her name—I came home at 8.30 on Sunday morning, August 2nd, and found her in bed with another man—I knocked at the door of the house she was living at—it was opened by a little girl who was living in the house—I walked up to the room—I did not want to cause further trouble, so I walked out—I said nothing—on September 2nd, about 11 p.m., I was walking down Whitehorse Lane with my friend <hi rend="italic">Ben Susan</hi>, who on September 26th gave evidence at the Thames Police Court, and has since disappeared—I think the other side got him out of the way—Mrs. Emmanuel and another woman were with her—my wife called me a dirty <hi rend="italic">ponce</hi>—that means living on a woman's prostitution—she said, "Get out of it, dirty <hi rend="italic">ponce</hi>," and when I was walking away she kept repeating the same words—I said nothing—she passed me again repeating the same words, and I stopped—she asked if I had a home to take her to—I said, "Not for a common thing like you"—she deliberately took a hat pin out of her hat and stabbed me with it—I had only slapped her face, that is all—one of her friends said, "Stick the <hi rend="italic">bleeding</hi> hat pin</p>

               <p>Station at 12.10 a.m.—I found three wounds on his chest—one was in the third intercostal space—it did not appear externally to be serious—when it was washed, two others appeared—they were inflicted by the same instrument, which was somewhat smaller than an ordinary knitting needle—one wound was sufficiently large to admit the end of my fine probe—I did not push the probe down far, because it would push the needle or whatever was there, further in—he was in great distress; when he lay down he became easier—he was kept in a recumbent position for that reason—if it is a hat pin the knob very likely was broken off—he was fully dressed—I found no marks on his clothing of the instrument passing through—he was very much collapsed and rallied on being placed in a recumbent position—I administered brandy—I searched the clothing for some metallic substance, but discovered nothing—the wound is very dangerous still—he was pressed to have it got out as there was danger of blood poisoning, though that is not present now to the same extent, from a septic weapon which had passed through a woman's hair—it would be surgically dirty—about 3.40 p.m., I examined the prisoner—her right eye was contused—she showed me some old bruises on the inner side of her right thigh, and said there was pain, and that they were in<lb/>flicted the previous night—I thought otherwise—she had received a scratch on the lobe of her left ear, and a contusion of her lower jaw—the bruises were old, because they were getting yellow—the scratch was probably inflicted by her own finger nail—the prisoner is a very powerful man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the London Hospital—I admitted the prosecutor there after midnight, on September 3rd—he was cold and collapsed—his temperature was normal—that might have been owing to doses of brandy—he complained of pain in his side—I noticed a small puncture on the third intercostal space—he rallied twelve hours afterwards—I applied the Rontgen rays, and procured this photo<lb/>graph—I agree with Dr. Arnett that there is a foreign body, long and thin, probably metal, which makes the shadow, starting on the left side, passing obliquely downwards, backwards, and inwards, entering the pericardium—the nearest point is an inch to two inches—the wound was dangerous in such a part of the body—I suggested that the patient should be operated upon—he said he was frightened at the operation, and declined—he was discharged on September 19th—a radiographer took the photograph produced under my instructions—the instrument that inflicted the wound might have been a hat pin, or a portion of a hat pin—most probably the head was broken off—the wound could have been self inflicted, but I think it improbable.</p>

I am a carpenter, of 3, Baker's Row, Warner Street—I came from near Naples—I have been four years in England—for twelve months prior to September I had been keeping company with Filomena Cerrone as her lover—on Sunday, September 27th, I was in a house in Back Hill about 2.30, when Filomina came in with Spampanoto—the prisoner was standing outside—he went away with Filomena of their own act—after ten minutes the prisoner returned alone and stood outside—I then went out with Clementi Spampanoto—the prisoner was outside—he looked upset—Spampanoto and I entered a beer shop—about 7 p.m. we stood in the doorway of a baker's shop—the prisoner passed two or three times with Filomena—about 9 p.m. I went for a walk in Hatton Garden and other places with my friends Nappi. Robino, and Napolitana—we made a round and came back to Back Hill to go to bed and to sleep—I went to my house—I was on the public-house side of the street—my companions walked in the street, I walked on the pavement—I saw Filomena alone, and wanted to speak to her in a friendly way—I spoke to her on the pavement about the length of this room from the public-house, and opposite a sweetshop, for two or three minutes—she replied, "You are good-for-nothing lazy people, and if you do not go away I shall have you caned, beaten"—when she spoke those words I slapped her in the face once, with my open hand—I believed she was making a joke—we acted similarly when we were together formerly, and I slapped her some<lb/>times, and so it was all a joke—then I felt a shock and found that I had been shot on the left side of my neck, where it shows—I heard three</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant secretary to the Institute of Bankers—I live at 20, Queen Ann's Grove, Bedford Park, Chiswick—on September 1st I missed from my house six silver fruit knives, a silver plated fish, slice and fork, half a dozen silver plated fish knives and forks, a silver gong, a silver tea caddy with spoon, and three silver serviette rings—I identify the articles produced, each having private marks put on by myself and members of my household; the "W "is the initial of my sister's name and the "J "that of her husband—I have here a silver candlestick which corresponds with the other one that was missed—the whole of the articles I missed are here—they were kept on a sideboard in the dining room close to a French window leading into the garden—some were on the shelf of the sideboard, and some otherwise—when I discovered my loss I gave information to the police—these articles were shown me in the police station at Notting Dale about October 2nd.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the chief officer at the Assay Office of the Goldsmiths' Company in London—I have the duty of assaying and marking gold wares by punches—the dies and punches are engraved from year to year—they are destroyed annually in May, and fresh punches are engraved for the following year—they get worn by use towards the end of the year and do not produce such sharply defined marks—the dies used for marking gold wares are the Crown, the figure denoting the stan<lb/>dard 18 or 22, a leopard's head, which, is the usual mark of the London Goldsmiths' Company, and a date letter—the other standards are 15, 12, and 9 carat, making five altogether—the Crown and the "18 "are the marks which are especially prescribed for the 18 carat gold—rings are brought in the flat to Goldsmith's Hall to be marked, they are straight and not manufactured into rings, they have to be turned up and down—articles are supposed to be sent to the Hall complete in every detail and properly soldered together, except where it is impossible to mark the article when it is complete—the polishing is done afterwards in the majority of cases, and the marks very often become partially obliterated in the course of finishing—the leopard's head is a difficult mark to impress clearly—22 carat gold is softer than silver, "18 "is probably harder, or about the same—the inferior qualities are made harder by thealloy—the marks are affected by wear and become less distinct—we use straight punches; sometimes a sepa<lb/>rate punch and sometimes a combination one—as a rule we use a combina<lb/>tion punch which marks them for rings with one blow—we mark gold chains with the Crown and "18 "on an 18 carat gold chain, on every link except one, which has the leopard's head and the date letter, so that every link-bears two marks—no special order in which we put on the marks is prescribed by Statute, and we vary the combination marks from time to time, some<lb/>times the Crown may come before the "18" and sometimes the "18" before the Crown—a few pence are charged for marking gold and silver articles, but that does not support the expense of the Assay Office—in May this year, the Company took criminal proceedings against Solomons, Curtis, and Gould under the Act of 1344 for uttering articles with the</p>

               <p>marks upon them; they pleaded guilty, and were sentenced at the June Sessions of this Court—the rings and chains which were produced as being in their possession have since then been in the Company's possession—this ring (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is one of those produced at that trial; it is a genuine gold ring and, I believe, of French manufacture—it has a French mark outside it, an eagle's head, I believe—it is marked with the French hall mark; they mark, I believe, on the outside—on the inside I find a mark resembling a leopard's head, "18 c," and a mark like a Maltese cross; that conveys no idea to my mind; there is no hall mark like that that I know of—it is a small Roman "c "similar to a letter which was used by the Company in 1898—this ring Exhibit No. 2 is a base metal ring; I find inside a mark resembling a leopard's head, the figures "18 c," and a Maltese cross, and on the outside there is a dent very similar to the mark on the French ring, it looks like a stamp; it is no sort of French hall mark—Exhibit 3 is a ring and a chain; I find on the ring a Maltese cross, the figure "18,"a blurred mark, which may be anything, and the letter "c"—there is nothing on the outer side—the chain is base metal, but each link is marked "18 c."—Exhibit 7 is a base metal ring with a dent outside the same as on Exhibit 2, and a mark inside imitating the leopard's head and "18 c."—the base metal rings Nos. 2, 3 and 7 are all similar in pattern to the genuine French ring, Exhibit I—the stone in the French ring is a common diamond; I believe it is genuine, but I am not a judge of stones—these other rings I believe are not genuine, but they are similar in regard to marks and numbers except the last, which has only three marks—No. 1, 2 and 3 have four marks, Exhibit 7 has three but no Crown—I think they are all put on by the same die—these four punches (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) are curved, they are for the purpose of marking rings when they are actually in the hoop—this one would produce an "18," another a Maltese cross, and another is an imitation of a leopard's head; not a genuine leopard's head of the Company—there is also a small Roman "c," very similar to the real serial number—these two straight punches would produce one an "18" and the other "18 ct."—that is a combination punch, a "c" and a small "t"—we never have two letters on genuine punches, and never use a letter "c "except as a date letter—we change the letter every year, on May 29th, and when we come to the end of the alphabet we have another of another kind of letters—in my opinion the marks on Exhibits 1, 2, 3 and 7 are capable of being produced by these punches—I think they have been used by the look of the blunt end—they are not genuine 'dies of the Company, they are counterfeits—Cooper has never been in the Company's employ in any capacity—I have been with the Company between thirteen and fourteen years—the Goldsmiths' Company is the only authority in London which has the right to mark gold and silver ware—they had the duty imposed upon them by Statute; all plate has to be brought to us for the London hall mark—there are provincial hall marks of Birmingham and Chester, but the leopard's head is peculiar to London.</p>

               <p>class of engravers obtainable—the Crown, the "18," the letter, and the leopard's head are in straight lines, but not always in that order, we might have the Crown first, and then the leopard's head; the order is laid down in the regulations; it is uniform, and if it is found to work satisfactorily, they do not alter the order—it would not be the letter on a ring, it would be the leopard's head—we distinguish between a ring and other things—on a ring, the usual order is the Crown, the "18," the leopard's head, and a letter; that would not vary—on a chain, each link would bear a Crown and "18," with the exception of the centre link, which would have the leopard's head and a letter; that order is invariable—we do not use the Maltese cross at all—I will not commit myself as to whether this is a horse's head or an eagle's head on the genuine French ring—I said I could not say whether it was an eagle's or a horse's head on the outer ring, an eagle's head was mentioned at the police court, but not by me, I said that I could not decide it—I think it is made to represent a leopard's head, but, whatever it may be, it is reproduced in the exhibits shown to me—on the inside, there is also a leopard's head—no one who knows what a proper hall mark is would take the Maltese cross for a hall mark—I do not believe 99 out of 100 people would know the proper order—on the ring which is attached to this chain there is a Maltese cross—I have" tried these punches, I struck these marks myself (<hi rend="italic">On a plate</hi>), this metal is pewter, it is not so hard—this is a real leopard's head—I believe it is a criminal offence to have punches with hall marks on them—you can go into a shop and buy a punch without any mark, they are used for a great many purposes—you can buy them with letters or numbers on, but you cannot buy them anywhere with the hall mark—I know where I can buy punches of this shape with letters and numbers on, but you cannot order marks similar to the hall marks to be put on them, you can other than hall marks—I do not know any place where the Crown and so on can be made—I think all the wedding rings of the poorer classes in this country are made of base metal—the law requires the maker's initials to be on the article before we can accept it—I see on this paper, "Gold and diamond pin 1s. 6d." all those have marks drawn on them—it says, "Experienced judges deceived"—no advertisement of this sort has been brought to my attention, if so, whether we should act upon it would depend upon what the matter was—this punch is "18 Ct." not "C." alone, there is no mistaking that, not in this punch—I should not expect to see the letter "C "next to "18 "on a ring—the order is that the letter is the last—when the leopard's head gets indistinct, it may be like anything—I do not remember Dorrington or Donnington being charged and convicted of a similar offence to this—I have heard of Roberts' case—I do not know whether it was exactly the same offence as this—these prosecutions are not frequent, the evidence is different in different cases.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> During the last four or five years, these prosecutions have been about once or twice a year—punches are to be purchased with the makers' initials on them, there is no objection to a man adopting some private mark of his own, and putting it upon jewellery, or putting his own name on it, such as Mordans pencils, some of which are hall marked—</p>

                  </hi>. I am head of Carrington and Co., jewellers and goldsmiths at 130, Regent Street—I have had about forty-five years' experience in the trade—I have seen this French ring—the French mark on plate varies according to the date, instead of a variable letter they have a variable mark, it is a very different plan to ours—this ring is a genuine gold ring, the first mark inside it appears to me to be a leopard's head, similar to that of the Goldsmiths Company—I think I should be able to distinguish it if it was genuine, it is a fair imitation—upon genuine rings of gold, marked at the Goldsmiths Company, it is frequently found that there is a certain amount of indistinctness caused by wear and tear, but they wear well—the leopard's head is a mark which it is difficult to get sharp from the die, being <hi rend="italic">en face</hi>, the features are not very distinct, the next mark is an "18," the next "c," that bears a resem<lb/>blance to a date letter, the fourth is a Maltese cross—invariably the reare four marks stamped at the Goldsmiths Hall, they are generally in a similar position as these on this ring—this Exhibit 2 is a base metal ring—I find the same imitation leopard's head, the "18 "is practically the same, the "c." is exactly the same, and in the Maltese cross the sole difference is that here it is a little closer and a little plainer—in my opinion, these marks are struck with the same die that struck the marks on the other ring—on this other base metal ring, Exhibit 3, I find similar marks on it, which I believe are struck with the same die, but in different order—Exhibit 7 has three marks on it, the Maltese cross is wanting, the other three marks are the same, and struck with the same die—the chain in Exhibit 3 is a base metal chain, and every link is marked with "18 c."—I should say that the public do not understand hall marks—some customers take a great deal of interest, the majority I should say distinctly not—with my business, it is a matter of confidence, they rely upon me entirely—the Crown is an old hall mark on Sheffield silver—these gold rings (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) are from my stock, I have selected two or three to show how the finishing renders the marks indistinct—the leopard's heads on these two are most indistinct, they are absolutely new rings, and marked within a year or two—I see on your own ring (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Bodkin's</hi>) how the marks have become indistinct by wear and tear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The more indistinct they become, the less easy it is to distinguish what they were—I am prepared to swear that the imitation leopard's heads are on the rings—I am not influenced in thinking that it is a leopard's head by the fact that I find a very indistinct mark in the neighbourhood of the three other marks, it is purely a matter of opinion, but I have no doubt about it—I do not know that there is a huge trade going on in base metal jewellery in this country, I have never heard of it—I was rather surprised to hear that the poor people's wedding rings are of base metal—four marks are the customary thing, but I have found things with three on them—I do not know how that happened, I did not make them—anybody seeing an article with only three marks on it would examine it very carefully.</p>

               <p>to an indictment at this Court with Solomons and Curtis, in connection with putting off sham jewellery as real, and getting money by it (<hi rend="italic">See page</hi> 861).—I was a boot laster by trade—I knew Solomons at the beginning of this year, and Curtis previously, I knew the prisoner three years ago—between the time I first knew him and lately, I went to South Africa, when I came back I met a man named Jack Jefferys—what I did Solomons and Curtis was to show genuine jewellery to a purchaser which he would have tested, and would then offer money for it, which would at first be declined; then the seller would relent, and let him have it, but really give him some sham jewellery just like the real—for that purpose it was necessary to have some genuine jewellery, we had a genuine ring and chain—I know Mr. Layman's shop in Whitechapel—on January 2nd. I bought this single stone diamond ring for £45s. there, this is the receipt—it had no marks on it except this one on the outside—I took it to the prisoner at 24, Wynyatt Street, Clerkenwell—I knew him as a working jeweller and optician—I had bought some sham jewellery from him before which had been marked—when I went to him with this ring, I said I wanted some other rings the same as this, he agreed to get them for me at 3s. 6d. each, no measurements were taken, I left this ring with him, when I went for them about two days later I said, "There is no mark in this, I want the marks putting in this ring," that was the genuine one—the marks were "18,"a "c," and those two smudges which are in there, he said, "All right, if you want them put in I will put them in, although I never put them into any rings that I do not do myself, but I will put them in for you," and he put them in with punches like these (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) while I was waiting, it took about five minutes—I got the other three that I had ordered, and paid 3s, 6d. each for them—I do not think he charged me anything for making the French ring, but I may have given him fid for a drink—I also got some chains about that time, they were the Newgate pattern, with a long and two short links, he marked them in the same way—sometimes he did it while I was—there, sometimes they were ready marked—I paid 6s. 6d. each for them, the rings and chains I got from him were used for my work with Solomons and Curtis—one gentleman we operated on was Mr. Stanford, he parted with £7 or £8—he had one of the rings which I got from the prisoner, he did not have one of the prisoner's chains—I was arrested on May 18th—I had one of his rings and one of his chains in my pocket—I was introduced to him by a man named Gilbert—at my home, in my waistcoat, another of the prisoner's rings was found, one was a big ring which I had got from the prisoner, it was not one that I had ordered—after I had had the French ring for some months, I pawned it at Mr. Layman's—I never took it out of pawn.</p>

I am a French polisher of 37, Moody Street, Mile End—I remember meeting Solomons, Curtis, and Gould in a public house—I got from them to show to a jeweller two rings and a chain—I showed them to a jeweller, and in consequence of what he said I offered them £8—they did not take that at first, but they did next morning, when a chain and two rings were handed to me—I gave them £8—all the jewellery had marks on it—they looked like the ones I had seen the day before, and I took them in that belief—I looked at them afterwards, they did not look so nice later on—I found that they were brass, and went to the police—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is the ring I bought.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Inspector J.</hi>) I had charge of the case in June as well as this one—in the course of my inquiries I heard of the prisoner, and on May 20th I went to 24, Wynyatt Street, Clerkenwell—I had some conversation with the prisoner and wrote down his answers—when he handed over to me the punches, he made this statement, which he signed: "I live and carry on my business at 24, Wynyatt Street, Clerkenwell, my customers are principally dealers and travellers' hawkers; I do not work for any shops. Anyone who brought metal, jewellery of any description to me for repairs I should do the job. I make all kinds of imitation gold chains and rings, similar to the chains and rings produced and handed to the police by Mr. Stanford. I set the rings with imitation stones and put marks in the shanks similar to the two rings produced, which means 18 cased, but I sell them as metal rings for 2s., 2s. 6d., and 3s.; and the gipsy set ring produced may have been made by me; I could not swear it was not my make. The chain, and split claw set ring I do not recognise. The chains I sell at various prices; the chain produced I should sell for 3s. without gilding, but a customer who wanted such a chain to look like solid gold would, after leaving my hands, have the chain taken to a gilder. When I am asked to recommend a gilder I refer them to Grimmie, Myddelton Street, Goswell Road, who is an electro gilder and plater, and does work for me; or to Maunders, Queen Street, Percival Street, who is a water gilder, which is a more expensive process. The cost of gilding varies; the chain produced, if water gilded, would cost at least 4s., bringing the value of the chain after it leaves my hand to 7s., and would wear for years like solid gold; the electro gilding can be done for as little as 6d. per chain, which would make the value of the chain 3s. 6d., and look like a chain of the value of £7 to an inexperienced person, and anyone could wear it without even an expert telling it was not gold without examining it. I used to do a considerable amount of work for Mr. Pike, of the Abyssinian Gold Company, making gipsy rings. Again looking at the</p>

               <p>chain produced, it may be possible to make similar marks with the punches now in the hands of Inspector Collins. The punches can be bought for 1s. 6d. each at Grey's, in Clerkenwell Road, or at Haywell's in Spencer Street; the punches were made for me by Mr. Smith, a tool cutter who keeps a paper shop in Goswell Road, I don't know the number; I get the punches cheaper from him than I should at the shop. I am not a sham maker, I am a finisher; I buy the chains in the rough state and finish them off and mark them if required; I mark them in various ways, sometimes with 18 c, some<lb/>times with 18 Ct., and the other marks which could be made with the punches produced. I never put a Crown on. I have a book of hall marks. The names of the five men read out to me by Inspector Collins I do not recognise. I know a little Jew whom they call 'Solly' whom I have done business with; I should know him again"—Gould's name was among those that I read out—"I have dozens of people call on me as customers, and many others write from all parts of the country; they are hawkers and travellers in jewellery, and know that I make imita<lb/>tion gold rings and chains as near like the real things as possible, and finish them the same as solid gold. If I did not I should not get the orders. I know a man named Jefferys, who was sentenced at the Old Bailey for forging a hall mark in a watch. He subpœnaed me to give evidence on his behalf at the Old Bailey, and a man named Hills, of Spencer Street, was also subpœnaed. I was at the Old Bailey for four days, but was not called upon to give evidence and received no expenses. Jefferys called on me once after his liberation from his sentence; but I did no business with him then, and he has not called since, as I told him I did not want to have anything to do with him. I did not keep chains of the pattern produced, I only make them to order. The composition of these chains is known in the trade as gilding metal, and costs 10d. per lb. It can be bought any thickness and any form, round, half round, or any shape. It is a mixture of brass, copper, and sometimes a little zinc in it. I have been in the trade and lived in 'Clerkenwell all my life. The six punches I produce are the only ones I use for stamping any marks on rings or chains, and I am willing to lend them to Inspector Collins for examina<lb/>tion"—I did not go Into the prisoner's workshop, I was in the parlour.</p>

About the statement I made the other day, I now remember the man Gould you mentioned the other day. I should not remember him, except that a fighting, man from the Wonderland, Goodwin, I think his name is, he came, and when he described Gould as a little Jew fellow who had been at the war, I remembered him. I had a letter from him since he has been in prison. I destroyed the letter. It started like this, 'Dear Charlie, will you get some rings and come up and give evidence for us, and say we can buy rings anywhere like you sell? "I destroyed the letter.

I read in to-day's <hi rend="italic">Daily Mail</hi> an account of five men being charged at North London Police Court with possessing and uttering chains and rings bearing some marks and also hall marks. Of the five names therein mentioned I recognise two as being the names of men I know, Solomon Solomons, whom I know as "Solly,' and have known him for two years or more, having frequently met him at Duke's Place, Hounds-ditch, on Sunday mornings, in the jewellery market. The man Curtis I also know well; I have known him for about two years. To the best of my belief he was first introduced to me by a man who brought him here; but I do not remember who the man was. I do not remember what his business was when he first came here. Solomons and Curtis have both been to my place frequently, but not together; they have both brought chains to me and I have stamped them at their request. I have not stamped anything for them this year, but Curtis has been to my place this year, and I have repaired watches for him. Solomons has not been to my place, and I have not stamped any chains for him for the past twelve months. The only stamp I use for chains is an "18 "with a flower.

I am a widow, and keep a lodging house at 70, Vincent Street, Westminster—before April 15th the prisoner was in my employment—I have a stable at the rear of my house—I had a chestnut mare—I had had her for about fifteen years—she was pensioned off and did no work—the prisoner was with me for about three months—I gave him notice to leave on Tuesday, April 14th, because there were complaints about him from the servants, and he would not do his work—I do not know if I said anything to him about his temper, but he had a very bad one—on</p>

               <p>the Tuesday evening the mare was all right—the stable is quite close to the back of my house—I could hear the mare get up in her usual way—on the Wednesday I was in my kitchen, between 8 and 8.30 a.m.—I heard an unusual noise in the stable of kicking, plunging, and squealing, as if something was wrong—I went towards the stable—when I got to the kitchen door I saw the prisoner coming out of the stable door with one hand on the door, like <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, and a dung fork in the other—I got back to the door, so that he did not see me—I let him shut the stable door, and then ran after him and said, "What is the matter with Bessie, quick?"—at first he did not answer—I did not take much notice of his condition; I was anxious to see the pony—I asked the prisoner the second time what was the matter—he said, "Nothing"—I went to the stable door and opened it, and said, "Bessie, what is the matter?"—the prisoner was not there—the mare did not answer or call as she generally did, she was trembling at the back and she did not turn round—I looked at the floor and saw blood on the Straw at the back of the mare, between her legs—I called to the prisoner and said, "What is this on the straw?"—he would not answer me at first—the second time he said, "Nothing," and got out of my way—my servant Agnes Contain came into the stable when I called her—the prisoner had gone away then, but he could hear when I spoke to Agnes—I said, "Come and look at Bessie; what is that?" alluding to the mark on the straw—she said, "Blood"—I said, "Will you pick it up?"—she said, "Yes; I do not mind "; she did so and said, "It is blood"—I said, "Will you put your hand down?"—she put her hand into the straw and said, "It is warm"—the prisoner was in the yard all the time—he would not come in—I went and got a plate and said, "Wait a minute," and I put the straw on the plate—then I saw that it was blood—I used now and then to hire the pony out to Mr. Ruttle—he took her out on the Friday—I saw her every day between the Wednesday and the Friday, because we took her out pieces—her food all went, so I thought she was better, but I afterwards found that the prisoner had thrown it on the dung heap, where I found it—I thought it had been eaten—on Friday she was out with Mr. Ruttle for about two hours—he complained about her when he returned—on the Saturday I went out in the cart with the prisoner—the pony did not seem to go very well, and I found she would not eat her food—we went back home—we were out for about an hour—when we got back, I and my son and the prisoner were all together—I said to my son, "Don't leave, Alfred; put the pony in yourself and give it some extra food"—we gave her some brandy and things—before my son went round to put the pony in, the prisoner had taken her into the stable—I sent for a veterinary surgeon, but the pony died on the following Wednesday—I had three surgeons, but the prisoner would not fetch them—he left my service before my "vet." came the second time—he said, "If there-is going to be this bother I will go"—I said, "If you go before the 'yet' comes back I will lock you up, but if you stay I will see what I can do"—I did not pay his wages; he did not ask for them—he did not say anything about Agnes Contain.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a veterinary surgeon at West-minster—on Sunday, April 19th, I was called to Mrs. Holland's house—I saw this chestnut mare pony—I examined her, and at once found that she had been violently interfered with by the staggering gait of her hindquarters—I lifted her tail and saw that the left side of the lips of the vulva were severely lacerated, and that the walls of the vagina on the right side were also lacerated with slight penetrations—I came to the conclusion that the injuries had been caused by some person with instruments—they could have been caused with this fork—when I saw it it was covered with spots of dry blood, and there were several hairs on it corresponding with the chestnut hairs of the pony—the fork is very rough at the edges—a fork used for manure would very likely set up blood-poisoning if used in this way—violence would have been necessary to insert the end of the fork—I think the wounds were about three or four days old, it may have been longer—I saw the prisoner and said, "You scoundrel, what did you injure this mare for?"—he said, "I did not mean—"; then he stopped all of a sudden, and after a time said, "I know nothing about it whatever"—that was on the Sunday; the pony died on the following Wednesday—the wounds I saw were consistent with wounds inflicted on the previous Thursday—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—death was caused by the injuries, and mortifi<lb/>cation had set in.</p>

               <p>August 18, from the same address—I know his writing—I have known him for over eight years—he was a tutor in a school—in my opinion the whole of this cheque is in his writing—I know Poach slightly—I knew his father—I have never seen him with Harries.</p>

Coutts and Company's Bank, 57, Strand"—he replied, "It is ridiculous, I know nothing about it"—in the train he said, "I know a man named Philip Peach, aged 25, height 5 ft. 4 in., complexion fresh, hair and moustache dark brown, rather thin face and cast in one eye, and wears glasses; he is a son of Pemberton Peach; I met this man in June or July last in the Free Library, Holborn; at the time I was very hard up; Peach asked me to have a drink; we went to the Flower public house in High Holborn, and Peach paid for two drinks; he said, 'My father has acted as your agent, and now that he is away I will do what I can to help you; if you will give me the names and addresses of some persons who knew you in better days I will write to them for you, and see if I cannot get something'; I showed him various letters I had received from various gentlemen who had befriended me, amongst them was one from Mr. Alexander Mont<lb/>gomery and one from Sir Lewis Morris, Athenaeum Club; I cannot say if I gave Peach any of the letters, I may have done so or perhaps he stole them; I did not forge Mr. Montgomery's name; I know Peach's hand<lb/>writing if you show me the cheque; I am innocent of this charge"—I showed him the cheque—he said, "That is not my handwriting"—I saw Peach at Bow Street in custody—I brought him out of the cells and confronted him with Harries, and said, "This is the statement made by Harries, I am going to read it over to you"—I read it over to him—he made no reply—I then told him I held a warrant for his arrest—I read it to him—he said, "I know nothing about it"—afterwards, in the presence of Rolinson, I showed him an envelope on which was written "Coutts' Bank," and said, "This envelope is said to have been written by you"—he smiled and said, "I know nothing about it"—I also showed him a letter to Harries, which I had obtained from 5, New Turnstile; that is a paper shop where both the prisoners had been receiving letters—I have seen Peach's writing; I should say this letter is his, "Dear Harries, I want to see you: very important news for you, so please drop me a line to 76, Westminster Bridge Road"—there is no date on it—while Peach</p>

                  </hi>. I am an expert in handwriting, at Holborn Viaduct—I have had nineteen years' experience—I have seen the documents produced in this case—I have compared the letters written by Harries and the cheque for £76—I find about three instances of resemblance in the writing, for instance, the two figures in the date "03 "are joined together on the cheque by a stroke from one figure to the other, and that occurs in four instances out of five in the letters; there is also some resemblance in the capital P of "pay," and the P used several times in Harries' writing; but I must say that the resemblances are insufficient to justify me in saying that the writing on the cheque is Harries'—I have no opinion one way or the other—I think that if I said either way I might be wrong—I give my opinion with all respect to Powell—it is a splendid imitation of Mr. Montgomery's writing—you cannot always tell a tracing—sometimes there are indications on the back or face which show that it is a tracing, but a tracing must be written slowly—this signature is written by a free hand—the writing on the printed document is obviously written by a person who desires to disguise his writing—I should say that that writing is the disguised writing of the person who wrote this letter card—I am unable to identify the writing on the face of the forged cheque with the writing on the letter card or on the printed specimens, but the endorse<lb/>ment on the back of the cheque, Henry C. Neal, in my opinion is undoub<lb/>tedly in the handwriting of the person who wrote the letter card and the other specimens—the writing on the envelope addressed to Coutts' Bank, to the best of my belief, is in Peach's writing—I am prepared to give my reasons for that opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Peach.</hi> I believe the writing on the letter card is undisguised, but the endorsement on the cheque is somewhat disguised.

                  <hi rend="italic">Harries' statement before the Magistrate.</hi> "I have already made a statement to the police, which has been read out in Court, but I should like to make an addition. I know nothing about the cheque or the circumstances attending it, and never saw it until it was shown me at Bow Street. I have not seen Peach since last June, as I described in my statement to the witnesses. Powell's evidence proved that I was in Somersetshire during the month of August, when this cheque was written and presented. The witness from Coutts' bank and also Mr. Montgomery himself said that his cheques were signed "Alexander C. Montgomery," and the cheque that I received from him was so signed. If I had wished to forge his name to a cheque should I not have done it properly like the one I received, and not as this forged one? I am charged with writing the cheque only, not with issuing it, and the only evidence brought against me is that of hand<lb/>writing; but the expert was unable to give as his opinion that the cheque, was in my writing. I shall ask your Worship to say there is not sufficient evidence to commit me for trial."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Peach, in his defence, said that the boy who identified him was mistaken; that he had not given the boy a cheque; that he, could not see without his glasses; that he never wore a felt hat, and that the coat found at his brother's place was a mackintosh and not a cloth coat; that it was his brother's and not his; that none of the writing on the cheque or letter card was his; that he had not seen Harries since June, and that he</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Harries</hi>) <hi rend="italic">had never handed him any letter for Mr. Montgomery.</hi>
