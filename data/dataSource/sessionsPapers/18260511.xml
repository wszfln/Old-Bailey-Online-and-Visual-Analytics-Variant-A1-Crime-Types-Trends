I called to the horses to stop, and the man who asked me the way ran and stuck my fore horse through the nostrils, with a pen-knife or something - I ran to the tail of the waggon; two of the men jumped out, and just as I got to the tail the prisoner jumped out; I knew him before, by his frequently following my waggon of a night, but did not know his name. I went to seize him, but he knocked me down; when I got up my horses were running round, in confusion; the men were running away - one of them called out, "We will serve you out - you know Sam Morris;" I got into the waggon, and found a cord, which fastened the sugars, cut in six places. My hat had fallen off when I was knocked down - I looked about, but could not find it - I have not seen it since; I cannot say who took it - if it had been left on the ground I must have found it. I described the prisoner's dress and features to Mills, and on the 13th I went with Mills to a public-house in Grub-street, and saw him sitting on a bench in the skittle-ground - when he saw me he turned his back towards me; I went and looked him in the face, for about a minute, then came to Mills, and said I could swear to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BARRY. Q. On which side of the road was your waggon? A. On the near side, against the rails - it is the darkest side of the road. I had two horses - I did not see the man cut the horse, but I found its nose bleeding; the watch was not set at the time. I told Mills I had frequently seen the prisoner lurking about the carts. My master had hand-bills printed, offering a reward. I said nothing about the man being deformed - I never noticed that he was deformed.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 13th of April I went to the Weavers' Arms public-house, Grub-street; Bettridge came out of the skittle-ground, and said the man was there, and he could swear to him. I then went to the prisoner, and said I wanted him; he said he knew nothing about it. As we went along he said, "Sam has got a heavy sentence" - I said, "Yes - I wonder he had not more." Samuel Morris had been transported for seven years, for robbing the prosecutor's employers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he introduce the subject of Morris' conviction? A. Yes. The prosecutor described the prisoner's dress and countenance - I had my doubts; I knew the prisoner, and should have taken him from that description.</p>
               <p>Q. What were your doubts about? A. I did not doubt - if I said so I did not mean it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I frequent the Weavers' Arms; and about six weeks ago Mills apprehended a man there with a chest of tea - it was the subject of conversation in the house, as Mills resorts there; I asked him how the young man got on - he said he was transported for seven years; I said, was it not a heavy sentence. On the 8th of April I went home between six and seven o'clock, and never went out till ten next morning; any one who has seen me once could recognise me again, on account of a deformity in my hand. I cannot cut my victuals, much more knock a man down.</p>

            . I work for Mr. Mitchell, a typefounder, and live in Mitchell-street, St. Luke's. The prisoner has lodged five years with me. On Saturday, the 8th of April he came home between six and seven o'clock, and never went out till next morning - I am sure of it. I lock the street door every night, and must have known if he had gone out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time did you lock the door? A. About eleven o'clock - he sits with me - I was at home all the evening; we drank our beer together. I do not know where he was on the 1st of April - I remember the 8th of April, but cannot tell why, except that I stopped at home that Saturday night, which I am not in the habit of doing; my sister fetched the porter - the prisoner went to bed about eleven o'clock; we supped about a half-past ten. He brought in some bullocks' sweet-breads, and we had them for tea.</p>

My husband got up first, and alarmed me; I found the wash-house door and window as he has stated, and missed two large Cheshire cheeses and a half, a Glo'ster cheese, half a side of bacon, 12lbs. of candles, and a blue apron. I keep a chandler's-shop. I had seen them all safe the night before, at a quarter to eleven - they were worth 6l. 18s. I have found none of them. I was cleaning the yard, as the thieves had left some filth there, and found a piece of a waistcoat. I sent for Pullen, and gave it to him in the state I found it - I found it in an hour after I came down stairs.</p>

I am an officer of Bethnal-green. - On Friday, the 14th of April, Mrs. Harris sent for me; I examined the windows and doors; she gave me a piece of a waistcoat, but being busy I desired her to give information of the robbery at Worship-street; I kept the piece of waistcoat till Parish, and officer, came to me. I saw the prisoner on the day after the robbery, coming by my shop; I had some beef on my shoulder, and could not put it down; I saw him go along with his coat off - he was endeavouring to put it on - the wind blew it aside, and I saw a piece torn out of his waistcoat, on the right side - I put down my beef and ran out, but he was gone. I knew him before.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. Pullen gave me this piece of a waistcoat. The prosecutor's wall is eight feet high. On the Monday after the robbery I met the prisoner in Shoreditch - I had seen him about that neighbourhood before, and knew him. I unbuttoned his coat, found his waistcoat torn, and matched the piece - it exactly fitted the tear in every way; it is a black cloth waistcoat - I produce it and the piece - I am certain it must be part of the same waistcoat. I took him in charge, and asked what he had done with the cheese; his answer was, "You are bouncing me;" meaning I wanted to find out what he had done with it. I then matched the waistcoat to the piece - he said, "I can satisfy the Magistrate how I tore that waistcoat - it has been torn some time;" part of it is torn in a point, and fits in the stitches and every thing.</p>

On Saturday, the 29th of April, at half-past ten o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner, in company with two men, in Chapel-street, St. George's East; the prisoner had a roll of sheeting across his shoulder - one of the men walked by his side, and the other rather a head; I had seen the prisoner before, but did not know much about him; I went up, and heard the one who walked by his side, call out to the one a head by the name of Sam, and that person replied,"We will take it to Albion-street;" I went up to the prisoner, and asked what he had got there; he said what was that to me; I told him I was an officer, and it was my duty to know, and asked where he got it - he said a man had given it to him to carry; I asked where the man was - he said he did not know; I asked where the man gave it to him - he said he did not know; the others ran away - I took him to the watch-house. He let the sheeting fall when I first took him - I took it up, and gave it to Little.</p>

The money was in a letter, which was put into a purse, and then into the jar - every thing but the jar was gone.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On Saturday, the 29th of April, soon after eight o'clock, I went with a warrant to Bund's house. I found the prisoner there, and told her I was come for the money and purse which she had taken out of the jar in Mrs. Bund's room - she said she had taken none, and seen none - I then told her I had a warrant to take her into custody, and should search her - she then said, "Do you mean that little old purse?" - I said Yes; she then produced this leather purse, and was told that was not it; she opened it, shewed me a guinea, and said that fell out of the jar while she was dusting it, and she meant to give it back again, but she had seen no other money and no purse. I proceeded to search her boxes - she then said, "Do you mean that little old net purse?" she was told Yes - she said it was in her box; I found that purse at the bottom of her box, but nothing in it. I found two half-sovereigns in her box; she said her husband had brought her them that evening; by the time I had done searching the room her husband came. I told him, in her presence, that she was in custody for stealing money, and as it was not all found I must search him; he was very patient while I searched his right-hand breeches pocket, but when I came to the left he resisted - I there found a new crown piece, which he said he had received for his wages; I took them both to the watch-house till Monday. I told the man I should go to his master, and asked if he meant to persist in that account - he then said he had received the 5s. piece from his wife, and she said it fell out of the jar at the time the guinea did. I held out neither threat nor promise to her; she said on Monday that she had changed some of the silver at a silversmith's, in Leicester-square, and bought a gold seal and a gold key, at the same time, and changed one of the guineas there; she had asked me what they would do with her; I said the money was not all found; she then said if I would let her out she would tell the whole of it - that she had taken all the money on that day, Saturday, and could not tell what induced her to do it - that she had also changed a guinea in Sydney's-alley, and bought a brooch; I said nothing whatever to induce her to confess; I asked where the things were which she had bought; she said they were in an old glove in one of the boxes I had searched; I found them, wrapped in a piece of old paper, at the bottom of the box, but not in a glove.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner an excellent character.</p>

I saw her at the Grapes public-house, on Monday, and asked her if she had sold the watch, as it was my husband's, and I set great value on it; she said, No, it was pawned, and if I would forgive her she would tell me where all my things were, but I said nothing to induce her to confess; she said she was very sorry, and had not had a week's happiness since; she would not tell me where the things were; I have recovered nothing. I found the key of my room inside a carpet, which was folded up in the passage.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did we not always put the key in that carpet for one another? A. Yes; but we used not to fold it in the carpet. I do not think I went out but once while she was with me - I do not know where I put the key then.</p>

            . I live in Princes-street, Drury-lane. On the 17th of April I saw the prisoner at the Grapes, next door to Bow-street Office, in custody; I was leaning over the table, and saw her take hold of Mrs. Hanson's hand, and say, "If you will forgive me I will tell you where the watch and spoons are - I meant to return them to you in a twelve-month, knowing them to be your husband's;" Mrs. Hanson asked her what she had done with the other things; she said she would say nothing about them, only to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you hear me say any thing to her? A. Yes; the officer called to Mrs. Hanson to tell her to hold her out no promise.</p>
               <p>ANN HANSON. The prisoner told me what West has said - she sat close to me, and must have heard it, and said she heard it. I am a widow.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You know nothing passed but what was in a whisper - you said if I would tell you what was done with the things you would stand my friend. Witness. Nothing of the sort - she was intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I lodged with the prosecutrix for a short time, and after I left her she, through spite, charged me with robbing her, and taking feathers out of the bed, and at the third examination brought a young woman to swear that I begged forgiveness - nobody could hear what passed between us - it was whispered; what she has said is quite false; any one could have access to her room; the key was always left in the carpet.</p>

I was at the bridge one Saturday when he brought it; my sister marked it for him; I sat by her and saw her do it - it was my sister Mary Ann - here is the mark she put on, W. T. and a figure. I got up about six o'clock in the morning - my brother was in bed then, and the door locked.</p>

On the 16th of March, 1825, I missed three geldings and a mare in foal; the geldings were all black, and had long tails; the mare had a switch tail; the off hind-fetlock of one gelding was white. I missed them at four o'clock on Wednesday morning, the 16th of March, and searched for them directly; I went on the Friday following, near the Plough, public-house, Mile-end-road, and saw the mare in foal in the stables; the hostler shewed her to me; on the Saturday I found one of the geldings at the King's Arms, at Bow, and on the Monday following I saw the other two in School-house-lane, Ratcliff, in possession of Rayment. I estimate their lowest value at 120l.</p>

            . I am Mr. Batten's servant. I had seen these horses at a quarter to eight o'clock on the night before they were missed - I locked them in the stable - I went next morning at half-past three o'clock, found the lock broken, and missed three geldings and a mare out of five; my master has described them correctly; the lock was broken all to pieces, and the door propped up with a piece of iron, which belonged to master, and that iron was also broken.</p>

            . I live at Lemsford-mills, Hertfordshire, and am a publican. On Tuesday evening, the 15th of March, I saw two men get off the Hitchin coach, and throw down a basket; I heard something rattle in it, like iron - I suppose it was stirrups; one of the men was James Harper, and the prisoner the other - he went by the name of Joseph Ludlow; I knew him before, and am certain he is the man; he had been in my house before that time; they both came to my house about six o'clock in the evening, and waited till about seven - I had some conversation with them - the prisoner joined in it; I am certain he is the man. I saw them leave my house about seven o'clock- they went up the road leading to Batten's; he lives not quite a mile from me. The prisoner carried the basket on his shoulder - I did not see what was in it; they gave my child a halfpenny - it dropped into the basket, and they said, "Don't take it out - we will give him another." I had sold Batten some of these horses; Batten called me up about five o'clock next morning, and on the Friday following I saw his mare in foal, at the Plough, at Mileend, and next morning I saw the little black horse at the King's Head, and in the afternoon I saw the two others at work in a brick field.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BARRY. Q. How long have you kept this house? A. Thirty-eight years; I was examined here on Harper's trial; I do not recollect whether I mentioned Ludlow by name; I was not asked - I said Harper came with another man - I told the Magistrate he went by the name of Ludlow. The prisoner had four examinations at Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say at the two first examinations that you knew Harper, but could not swear to the other man? A. I did not say I could not swear to him - I was threatened that if I did swear to him they would set fire to my house, or blow my brains out, some time or other. I swore to him at the last examination; I said at the two first that he was the man, but I would not swear to him, not that I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not your words "I believe him to be the man, but cannot swear to him?" A. No: I said he was the man, but I would not swear to him at first, because I was threatened to be shot, or my house to be set on fire. I said all the while I knew the man, for I had known him for many years; I said I would not, not that I could not swear to him - it was because I was threatened. I said nothing about his looking like the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you had seen the man but once, and then but for a short time? A. I did not; I said I had seen him before at my house.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You did not say you could not, but you would not swear to him? A. Yes; I never had a doubt about him, but I was threatened. I never denied that I knew him.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Did the prisoner threaten you? A. No; he could not - but several people said if I swore to the man they would set my house on fire, and the first fair they met me at they would blow my brains out. The threat was held out to me before the first examination; I did not mention it till the fourth examination.</p>

            . I am hostler at the Crown, at Holloway. In March, 1825, I was hostler at the King's Head, Kingsland-road; and one morning in March two men came into our stables with three black horses and a black mare, which appeared in foal - I knew one of them - it was the prisoner; I am quite certain he is the man - I knew him by the name of Joseph - he had been there several times before - I have not the least doubt of him; he told me to take care of the horses, to clean them, and give them some food - he did not stay in the yard five minutes - he came again at night with another man; I cannot say whether it was the same man as came with him in the morning, but am sure of the prisoner - he wanted the horses out; I gave them to him; he said he only had a sovereign, and could not pay - I told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182605110008"/>him not to mind, as he was in a hurry, and I had seen him before, it did not matter. Attfield came to our stables, and looked at the horses that day. The tail of the mare was rather shorter than the geldings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You could not tell whether the mare was in foal? A. She appeared so; I was not examined on Harper's trial, but was here at the time, on another trial; there were horses in our stables belonging to the prisoner at other times, but not then. I always took him to be a horse-dealer. I never knew where he lived, he has brought horses to our stables about six times.</p>
               <p>Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. As such, you were perfectly acquainted with his person? A. Yes.</p>

On the 17th of March, 1825, three black horses and a black mare in foal were brought there, by two men; I knew Harper, who was one of them - the prisoner looks like the other, but I cannot swear to him; two of the horses remained with me all night; the two men took the others away, and Harper took away the mare in foal next morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you recollect it was on the 17th of March? A. It was on a Thursday night; I am sure it was in March; we sometimes have horses to bait and at livery.</p>

            . I am a constable of Worship-street. On the morning of the 17th of March, 1825. (Wednesday) about nine o'clock, I went to the King's Head, in search of some horses, from information, and found six there; my attention was directed to three black geldings and a mare in foal - one of the horses had a white fetlock on the off hind foot; I saw that horse produced by Batten, at Dockray's stables, close to Worship-street office, in March this year. On the 13th of March I apprehended the prisoner, at the Salisbury dairy, New North-road, Islington.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you first get information of him? A. About the end of February; Clark did not inform me about him; there is nothing remarkable in a horse having a white fetlock. I was examined on Harper's trial. I had assisted in apprehending four men.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was Harper tried more than once? A. Yes - I was only examined on one trial - I am not certain which it was; I think it was for stealing Mr. Maitland's horse; I was a witness on two indictments, but only examined on one.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent. I was never in Clark's house in my life.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's clerk - it was the prisoner's duty to account to me for money he received. When he came from his Christmas journey he delivered me an account, in his own hand-writing, which I produce - here is no account of this 2l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know of his being deficient in 75l. and 25l., and paying it back when he got money? A. He certainly was deficient; when I applied for 75l. to Mr. Alchin, of Hastings, he said he had paid it; the prisoner was on a journey at the time, and when he returned included it in his cash account, as if he had received it that journey. I believe he borrowed 150l., by his wife's means, to raise it.</p>
               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was that before or after you discovered it? A. Afterwards, about February this year - he had received it in August.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I humbly implore your merciful forbearance, in consequence of my heart-reading situation. About the 6th of February, in consequence of the severe conduct of my father, I unfortunately left home, to await till his anger was abated; I kept out all night, and was afraid to return home, in consequence of his passionate temper - I love him as an honest industrious parent, and gratefully acknowledge that he instilled into my mind the necessity of industry.</p>
               <p>Several witnesses gave the prisoner a most excellent character - one of whom engaged to employ him.</p>

This property was in my bed-room, which is over the stable, and is at a little distance from the house - it is all one premises. On Monday, the 3d of April, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I went out and left the property, stated in the indictment, safe; I fastened the windows and put the shutter up - I locked the door and took the key with me, leaving nobody there; I returned about half-past eight, and missed all the property; I found the shutter down, three panes of glass broken, the hasp moved and the window had been opened. On the Saturday I found my jacket at McCoy's - I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. After McCoy had given her evidence before the Magistrate, did you go to her, and ask her to change the time at which she said she bought them? A. No; I said to her "You told me you bought them on Tuesday morning, and you had better mind what you are about," as she had told the Magistrate she bought them between three and four o'clock on Monday afternoon - I did not go to her after the examination; the stable is about ten yards from the house - it stands down in a hollow by the river - a board fence joins it to the house, except that there is an opening to let persons into the yard - there is a front door to the stable opening into the public road without going through the yard.</p>

               <p>CHARLES ANGEL HUNT. This coat and waistcoat are mine. I am sure they were safe on Monday evening, at six o'clock, for I hung the coat on a chair when I went out - the coat is worth 4s. - the great coat cost me 3l. 6s. the latter end of last year - there was not a brack in it.</p>
               <p>MARION McCOY. The prisoner sold me this waistcoat and two coats - the great coat was not so good as the one produced - I am sure I bought them on Monday at three o'clock; I told the officer by mistake that it was Tuesday, but I recollected afterwards.</p>

I had just left my aunt's, and was going to my cousin's - I left my aunt at the corner of a turning, stopped to look at these handkerchiefs; in two or three minutes the gentleman came over, and laid hold of this youngster - I looked at him, he laid hold of me, and asked if I was one.</p>
               <p>TIPPER's Defence. I was leaning on the bar when the gentleman came and collared me.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave Langley a good character.</p>

            . I am street-keeper of the Foundling estate. On Friday, the 7th of April, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in Guildford-street, going towards Speldburst-street, with a stick in his hand, driving two oxen; I asked him if he was gone back to Lindus, his old master; he said No; I said"Whose beasts are those?" he said his own. On the Sunday following he came to the watch-house to bring a young man his breakfast; I said "Why Jem, you are getting on in the world, if those beasts are yours that I saw you with on Friday morning;" he said "Yes, people thought he was getting down in the world, but they were mistaken."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What hour was this? A. About a quarter past six - he had lived in the neighbourhood - I have seen him driving beasts before.</p>

On the 6th of April, about eleven or twelve o'clock in the day, the prisoner came to the shop and, in my presence, said to my brother, that he thought he should buy two beasts at Smithfield the following morning, and asked if he could kill them in his slaughter-house; my brother said he could, and next morning, about half-past six, he knocked at the door - I opened it to him - he told me he had put two beasts in the pound, and could I let him into the slaughter-house to kill them - I did so - I saw one of them before it was killed - it was a brown one; I did not notice any mark - I saw him kill it - I do not know who killed the other - there was a person assisting him - the skins of the beast were taken away by Benbow, Mr. Beby's man, on the same evening; the carcases went away early on the Saturday morning - there was no other beast slaughtered at out house that day; I do not know who took the carcases away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have slaughtered beasts of all colours at your slaughter-house, I suppose? A. Yes, we generally take the skins away the same day, and sometimes the next day; the markets begin business about five o'clock in the morning - the carcases would go away early to be at market - there is nothing extraordinary in that.</p>

I called out Stop thief! as soon as I could, and they were taken; I staid there till the people brought the two men back; I had never seen them before. I saw them plainly before they took my watch, and can swear the prisoners are the men; I think Ling is the man who knocked me down; I cannot exactly say which took my watch, but he is the man who knocked me down, and I think him the man who took my watch, for it came upon me all of a sudden. I am certain it was one of those two men who knocked me down - I think Ling is the man who took my watch - it was returned to me by the party who took them.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen them before you got to the place? A. Why, I did see them, because they stood at the end of the court; I had no time to evade them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. You only saw them just as you came up to the court? A. Yes - one stood on each side of the court; it was the one of the right-hand side of the court who took it. I was struck some little time after my watch was taken. I do not wish to speak positively as to which robbed me, but I recollect their countenances perfectly, so as to swear they are the men, one of whom took my watch.</p>

            . I was about a yard from this court - it is Crown-court - I was standing still, and saw the prisoners come down Portpool-lane, and stand talking to one another - Ling went down the court about a yard; Yates stood at the top. This old gentleman was coming by - Yates rushed against him on purpose, and took his watch; he fell down with the rush; Yates took the watch, and they both ran down the court; the old gentleman rose up, and hallooed Stop thief! I hallooed also, and ran down the court - I lost sight of them for about half a minute - they ran round a corner in the court - Yates returned, and went down a little alley - he came up the alley again, and threw the watch down, and knocked the old gentleman down - I saw him throw the watch down. The old gentleman was just by this little alley; Yates then went on to another gentleman who was there, and threw him down by his legs, as he was going to assist the old gentleman in taking them. I picked up the watch, and gave it to the old gentleman. Yates ran up the court - Kemble ran after him, and caught him; Ling was taken in a privy in the court, by Baillie. I am sure they are the men; I never saw them before. I live in Crown-court.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. The person who took the watch ran against the old gentleman, and threw him down? A. Yes, and came back again and knocked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182605110015"/>him down - he was thrown down twice - I am quite sure of that - he ran down Crown-court when he took the watch; the court is no thoroughfare. The other gentleman who was knocked down is not here - he had as good an opportunity of seeing them as I had; the watch was thrown down at the top of the alley. I had lost sight of Yates for about a minute, when he took a turning in the court; there are about eight houses in the court; he knocked the old gentleman down the second time, just at the head of the court; there are several lodgers in the court - the doors are generally open. I am sure the prosecutor was knocked down twice.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Ling neither took his watch nor knocked him down? A. No. I had seen them talking together at the end of the court; Ling parted from him about a yard within the court before the gentleman came up. The gentleman no sooner got on his legs than he hallooed Stop thief! I think the outer case of the watch was on when I picked it up, but I am not sure. The privy belongs to three houses in the court, and is for the use of the lodgers.</p>

            . I am a shoe-maker, and live at No. 2, Crown-court. On Sunday, the 26th of April, about half-past ten or eleven o'clock in the morning, I was at work in my house, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I lifted up my window, and saw Yates knock the old gentleman down in the court, right under my window; there was a bit of a scuffle between another man and him. I then went down stairs - they were both on the ground together, and Yates got from him - that man is not here. I secured Yates, and took him to Hatton-garden Office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ever see Yates before? A. Never; he was on the ground himself - I lost sight of him in coming down stairs; it is a small court - a man could soon run out of it. I did not see Phillips till afterwards.</p>

We went into the parlour altogether; there was nobody else there. I joined their company, and staid there till a little after eleven o'clock; we all drank together, and had three pots of porter; I paid for one pot; Child went out a few minutes before eleven o'clock; I went out soon after eleven; the two prisoners followed me out. I lodge about thirty yards from the public-house. Goodwin was on my left side, and the other on the right - I had not got seven or eight yards from the public-house, when I was suddenly knocked down by Goodwin, in Duke-street; Price took hold of both my arms, and forcibly kept them down, while Goodwin dragged my watch out of my fob; I called out: he put his hand into my right-hand pocket, and took out 9s. in silver. I called for assistance, and they both ran away. I got up - Child was coming towards his quarters, and I seized him by the collar, told him I had been robbed, and I suspected he had something to do with it. The patrol came up, and I gave him in charge. I had not seen Child about me, but I suspected he was concerned. I went to the watch-house, and described the two prisoners; the constable found them that night. I saw them in custody next morning, and knew them; I was sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. What are you? A. A <rs id="t18260511-24-viclabel156" type="occupation">gentleman's servant</rs>

I had been to the Rose and Crown public-house before that, and had a pint of beer - I went there alone; Child came in afterwards, and had a pint of beer; I do not recollect seeing the prisoners there, but there were a great number of soldiers there; I had a pint of beer when I first went in, and took it into the parlour with Child - it was put into somebody's pot; I drank two or three times out of it; but had not spirits.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not drink two pots yourself? A. Certainly not; we drank two or three times round; I only paid for one pot: I could not have drank two pints. I went there about eight o'clock, and staid till half-past nine, then went to the Black Lion with Child, and there we had three pots among four of us, and half-a-pint of gin; I had nearly one glass: we staid there till a few minutes after eleven. I was knocked down seven<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182605110016"/>or eight yards from the Black Lion; I was perfectly sober. The landlord was up - a watchman goes up the street; I do not know where his box is. I knew perfectly well who knocked me down, and who robbed me. I seized Child, as I thought he was concerned - only two persons robbed me. When I got up Child was just coming round the corner towards his quarters; he had not passed me. I could scareely get up, the fall was so great - he made no resistance; he was not at the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you invite either of the prisoners home to sleep with you at your lodging that night? A. Never. I did not ask Goodwin to take charge of my watch, because I was so drunk. I was at no other public-house that day; I dined at the Black Dog public-house; I took two pints of beer with my dinner, and had about three glasses of ale in the afternoon; I staid there till half-past four o'clock, then went home to tea, and about eight went to the Rose and Crown; Child had two eggs with me at dinner. We only had three pots of beer at the Black Lion. I have been out of town for a few days since the robbery, with my friends, in Essex.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of Essex? A. I went to inquire for a friend; I went to the Eagle and Child public-house, Epping-forest, and took a lodging in the village, just by - I was only gone two days; I slept there one night. I swear I was perfectly sober.</p>

            . I am a patrol of St. Giles's. On this night, Quarn had given information at the watch-house, I went round to different houses, and about one o'clock I was going through George-street, and by a lodging-house I turned my eye, looked through the curtain, and there saw Price sitting in the parlour, with a female; they seemed at very high words. I listened for about five minutes; she threatened to charge the watch with him for ill-using her, and for another thing. I beckoned the girl out, and in consequence of what passed I went in, and took him to the watch-house. I found a shilling, a halfpenny, and a penny piece on him; I left him in the watch-house, and found Goodwin in the upper part of the same house, about half an hour afterwards; we broke the door open; he was in bed with a woman: we desired him to get up and dress - he did so. I searched his pockets before he dressed; his clothes were on the floor, by the bed side, and in his left-hand jacket pocket I found the watch and a purse, with four shillings and four-pence in it- he put that jacket on when he dressed. I took him to the watch-house, and asked if he had got a watch - he said No. I said, "Have you got a purse;" he said, Yes, I have a metal purse, with two shillings in it;" I shewed him this watch and purse - he said he knew nothing of them - I do not think he had seen me take them from his pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you tell him you were an officer? A. No. I broke the door open, and told him I took him for ill-using a female. I thought him quite sober - he did not appear to have been drinking.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was about thirty yards off when this was done. I saw Quarn down on the pavement in Duke-street, Bloomsbury, between eleven and twelve o'clock, and when I made towards him I saw two soldiers run from him - they were close to him, and ran off, evaded me, and got away. I made towards Quarn- he had then got up, and laid hold of another soldier, and gave him in charge. My attention was drawn to it by hearing a scuffle. I only saw two soldiers come from him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go before the Magistrate? A. Yes; I was sworn, and gave this account; my deposition was not taken down; I cannot say how the third soldier got there. Quarn accused him of being concerned in robbing him of his watch and money.</p>
               <p>PRICE's Defence. I have witnesses to prove I was not in the house for an hour and a half after Quarn came in. The landlord will prove he drew five pints of ale.</p>
               <p>Prisoner GOODWIN to THOMAS QUARN. Q. Did you never drink with me at the Two Brewers public-house, and gamble with me at the Queen's Head public-house? A. I never saw you before.</p>
               <p>Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not frequently gamble with him at the Canteen? A. I have no recollection of him. I have been at different public-houses since I have been out of place; I do not gamble much, and have no recollection of gambling with him; I never played at dominoes with him. I have no recollection of playing with him on the 1st of this month, nor the night before the robbery. I have been at the Canteen in the King's-mews, but not with him, to my recollection. I do not think I played with any soldier on the 1st of May, at the Black Lion - I never recollect seeing him. I once went to the Black Lion with Child, and gave him 6d. to fetch something to eat, and they did get something.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by "They did get something?" A. Why, there were a great many soldiers there - I never paid for eggs and bacon for supper for the prisoner, that I know of - I know nothing about it. I do not recollect paying for any soldier's supper; I might have done so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner GOODWIN. Q. Did you not come to me at the Rose and Crown, and drink beer and liquor, then go to the Black Lion, and give me the watch to go home with you to your lodging? A. No - on my oath I did not.</p>

On the 2d of May I was at the Rose and Crown with them and Quarn - Child was there; we drank porter and ale; I was there with them about an hour; Goodwin was in their company: the prosecutor spoke to him, as if he was an acquaintance. I left about half-past nine o'clock leaving them there; Quarn then appeared as if he had drank a good deal. I was, about four weeks before, at the Two Brewers, George-street, St. Giles's, and saw Goodwin in Quarn's company; they were playing at dominoes, and drinking porter together.

            . I keep the Black Lion. On the 2d of May Quarn came in about one o'clock; Child, who was quartered on me, joined his company; they had eggs for dinner - after dinner another soldier and a gentleman joined them; he drank a pint of ale by himself, and after they joined company they drank four or five pots. Quarn left my house about five o'clock, and returned a little before ten; they went into the parlour - he, Child, and the prisoners, together, and drank three pots of beer; they came in as friends, and drank as friends, and as they went out had half-a-pint of gin; Quarn could not be sober - they had liquor enough to make them all drunk. After they had been out a quarter of an hour the four soldiers and him returned, and knocked at my door - I opened it with the chain; Child said, "Open the door, and let me and my friend in;" I said I would not unless it was for him to go to bed; he said he would not.</p>

               <p>THOMAS HILTON. I am guard of the Express coach,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182605110018"/>from London to York. On the 28th of January I received from Mr. Hand a parcel, in the country office at Sir Richard Carr Glynn's; I took charge of it on my own responsibility, independent of the concern; I took it to my lodging in Giltspur-street, and gave it to Mr. French, to take care of while I went to bed. I started from the Saracen's Head, Snow-hill, with the coach, a little before seven o'clock in the morning; I received the parcel from French overnight, put it into a basket, and took it to the Saracen's Head in the morning, and put it into the coach-office, in the book-keeper's charge; I received it back when I loaded the coach, put my hand in, and took the parcel out - I locked it up in the hind boot, and put the key into my pocket. I had occasion to open the hind boot at Ferry-bridge, and immediately saw that the basket had been moved, and the parcel was gone; the bag which had contained it was left, but the parcel gone. We had four outside passengers; and inside was a lady and gentleman, a little girl, and another person. I knew one of the outside passengers particularly; I did not know his name, but his features - that was not the prisoner; three of the four got up at the Saracen's Head, and the other at the Peacock, at Islington - three of them left the coach before I got to Ferry-bridge - the fourth remained - he went to Catterick, about forty miles beyond York; it was Mr. Strappins, a school-master; the one whose features I knew, went off with the other two.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where do you think the parcel was stolen? A. I cannot tell - I do not know which was the best place to rob it; we dined at Biggleswade; I left the coach there for a quarter of an hour, but I could see the coach through the window - I only had three passengers behind; I did not leave the coach after dinner. I have carried parcels for Sir Richard Carr Glynn for ten years, and always put them into that place, unless they were small enough to go into my pocket. French gave me the parcel between ten and eleven o'clock, when I went to bed - I did not lock my door; another guard, named Gamble, slept in the same room - he belongs to the Leeds Rockingham coach - I put the parcel at my bed side - he might know it was there, but did not know what was in it. I set it down in the office under where Mountain, the book-keeper, writes, and took it up from the same place in about half an hour; the boot has a common padlock. When I am on my seat my feet are on the flap of the boot - it might have been taken while I was changing horses. When I got seventeen miles from town I left my seat, and sat on the box with the coachman, as I very often do; I rode about forty miles on the box. I looked at the boot at Ferry-bridge, and the lock was safe - it must have been opened by a false key. The clerk told me how many notes it contained; three of the passengers sat on my seat - the first of them got down at Wansford, near Stamford, and the other two at Stamford; one of them got up at the Peacock; he rode in front seventeen miles, then went and sat with them. I looked at the boot, and the lock was safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear the prisoner was on the coach that night? A. I could not tell; they were wrapped up in cloaks; I will not swear he was not there; I never swore he was not; I said I could not recollect him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not sworn you did not believe that man was one of your outside passengers that night? A. I do not know that he was, or was not. I said I had never seen him before in my life that I knew of. I went on to York after missing the parcel; I told the coachman of the loss about a quarter of a mile on the other side of Ferry-bridge. York is twenty-two miles from Ferry-bridge; every body was a bed at Ferry-bridge, except the hostlers; I went to Sharp's Bank, and told them; I returned to town on my journey, and gave Messrs. Glynn's notice; Sharps had sent them word about it. I have not been called upon to make the loss good.</p>
               <p>Mr. LAW. Q. Have you always said you could not say whether he was on the coach or not? A. I have. The parties were wrapped up in cloaks and travelling coats, and their persons very little exposed to view. I returned from York two days afterwards.</p>

            . I keep the Market public-house, Fleet-market. On the 25th of March I received this 1l. Bank note (looking at it, No. 90,155 dated December 26, 1825) from the prisoner; he had a glass of liquor, which came to less than 6d.; I applied to one of my young women to write his name on it; he said, "No, give me the pen and ink - I will put it on myself," and he wrote the name of Long, Holborn-bars, March 25, which is now on it - I gave him the change.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was a stranger? A. Yes. I never recollect having an address of that kind before; I am quite sure he is the man; I think it was in the after part of the day; a message was left at my house some weeks ago, and I saw Ellis about it; and told him, when I saw the prisoner, that he was the man. I told Ellis he was a very singular character, and I thought I should know him again, and said he was a short man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, "It is impossible for me to take on myself to say I should recollect the man?" A. I might say so. I now swear positively to him; I saw him at Bow-street, in a large room, with about twenty, and pointed him out myself, at once - Ellis took me into the room to find the man out - I think he had his hat on.</p>

In March he came and had a glass of brandy, which came to 3d. - he paid me a 1l. note, on which I wrote "Pearce, Goswell-street;" he gave me that name and address; this is the note (looking at it); I see by the date it was on the 29th; he paid me another the same day, for something he had at the bar; here it is - I have marked them both 29-4, but it should be 3;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182605110019"/>the same name and address is on both; I know the 4 is an error, for I was examined at Bow-street the beginning of April.

Preston, Red-lion-street, Holborn," which I believe to be his writing - here is "Pearce, Old-street;" I believe both to be his writing - another has"Pearce, Old-street, St. Luke's;" nine of them have Pearce, written on them - they are numbered 90,175, 90,196, 90,169, 90,199, 90,179, 90,152, 90,316, 90,198, 90,317, 90,195, and all dated December 26,1825.</p>

            . I keep the Anchor and Hope public-house, Fore-street. I took some 1l. notes of the prisoner. I was examined at Bow-street - it was a month or two before that (looking at two, Nos. 90,307, 90,309, dated December 26, 1825); I took both these from him, and have written on them both, by his direction "10l, Goswell-street," but no name or date. I believe he told me at the time that he was a pawnbroker, but seeing him a few times afterwards, he said he was a broker.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You received a 10l. note from him once? A. Yes; I have known him four or five months; I took these 1l. notes of him, one or probably two months before I went to Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not write on them till you paid them away? A. No; I paid them away the day I received them - I am sure he paid me these notes.</p>

            . I am bar-maid at the Edinburgh Castle, public-house, Strand. I have repeatedly seen the prisoner at the house. I took this 1l. note of him (No. 90,153, dated December 26,1825) - I cannot speak to the date, but I saw Mrs. Heeman write the name and direction on it, from her knowledge of the prisoner - we knew him by the name of Reed, No. 30, Panton-street, Haymarket, which is written on it with her initials - I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you always see your mistress write on notes? A. I do not like to change without her leave; I gave it to her, and asked if she would change it- she said Yes, and inquired his name; I said "Why, it is Mr. Reed;" she said "I beg your pardon, Sir, I had forgotten you;" this was about two months ago, I think - it was five or six weeks before I was examined - he was in the habit of changing notes.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BOUQUET re-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. I have been in the Bank some years. I do not know the amount of notes issued in a year - notes are issued of the same numbers, but not the same date and number - there have been no ones issued for the last five years, till the latter end of last year; I never knew before this of 1l. notes being issued with higher numbers than 80,000, but I will not swear that; I am in the habit of examining and posting them daily, and never knew one of a higher number till this last issue.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Would notes issued in 1823 be dated 1825? A. Certainly not - there never were duplicates of any notes.</p>

On the 6th of April I took him from the watch-house - he asked me who was coming up against him - I shewed him a bit of paper, with the name of Vickress and Smith on it - he made no observation - I asked if he had any account to give of the notes he had paid them - he said Yes, he found them about two months before in Goswell-street; he could not recollect how many he found; there might be between thirty and forty - he did not know the number - that he found them wrapped in a piece of brown paper.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner twelve months last March, and co-habited with him, but am not his wife - we lodged at No. 2, Nag's-head-court, Golden-lane; we lived in Arthur-street when he was taken up; he came home ill on the 23d of January, and was confined on the 23d and 24th with a violent cold in his loins, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182605110020"/>had a swelling on his hip, which was obliged to be plastered; he kept to the house for sixteen or seventeen days, and was not out of it; he was at home and in bed on the 29th of January - he was not out till the 8th or 9th of February, because the 9th of February was my birth-day, and I know it.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Did you know him long before you lived with him? A. No; I never heard where he came from - he was a very close man and never told me; I had no notion where he came from; I first met him at a young woman's, whom I knew, at No. 2, Play-house-yard - that was twelve months ago last March; we lived together about two months after that, and have continued so ever since; he never told me he came from abroad, nor did I ever hear him tell any one else so, I swear that; I can read but not write.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was taken ill had he a doctor? A. I went to a doctor in Whitecross-street - he did not attend him for we were too poor to pay him; I did not know he was charged with doing any thing on the 29th of January, till he was taken up; I know the day he was taken ill was on a Tuesday; I have no almanack; I know it because he was so bad, and there was no money in the house, we began the new year so bad, - we were all laid up in a fever in the court, the week before, and one died.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What reason have you to say it was January more than February? A. Because of the new year coming in, and we were so badly off, and we were all getting well, and the 9th of February was my birth-day - I have no other reason for remembering it - I fetched a woman to attend on him - she came on Tuesday, the 24th, and staid about a fortnight - her name is Ann Ray.</p>
               <p>Q. How does the prisoner get his livelihood? A. He told me he went out writing and portering; he was never away from me a night; I did not attend at the office to give this account - I was too ill.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Was he a good deal from home in the course of the day? A. A few hours, but never at night; my birth-day was on the 9th of February, and for sixteen or seventeen days before that he was at home ill. We have only the ground floor room; there is only one room; Mrs. Racket lived in the room over us; we were very friendly; she came at times to ask how he was; all the people in the court used to inquire for him, and come to see him; there are only two houses in the court; none of his relations came there, but my sisters and brothers did; one of them lives in Benwell-street, Clerkenwell; my brothers sent us money, and my sisters came to see him; I went to Dr. Reeves about him; he said it was a cold, and gave me some stuff and pills.</p>

            . I live at No. 3, Star-court, Barbican. I went to nurse Mr. Lloyd on Tuesday, the 24th of January; he lived in the bottom room; there is only one room on a floor; I did not sleep there, but was not home till twelve o'clock at night, and went at ten in the morning, every day for about a fortnight; he was not absent one day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear of any birthday? A. No, but the new year came in very bad with them; I poulticed his wound and attended to him; I have never been paid for it, for they were in so much distress they could hardly afford a cup of tea. Colvin had got out of a fever a week before.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. When did you first hear of his being taken upon a charge of robbery? A. I never heard of it; she said he was put into prison but I never heard what for till this evening; I came here last night but I did not know what for; she called on me last week to tell me to come to say I was attending him.</p>

               <p>Q. And that you began to attend him on the 24th of January? A. No, I knew that; she has mentioned the date to me; I cannot say how long since it was that she came to fetch me; I saw her three or four times about it; we have not talked over what I was to say - I was not going to tell her what I had to say, nor had I any notion of what she was to say; I said I could swear to the time I was nursing him.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, what makes you certain it was the 24th of January? A. Why the new year coming in - it was just before the new year came in.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Was it before Christmas or after? A. After; Colvin asked me to come to say the time I was nursing him; I recollected that it was the 24th of January myself; I would not take a false oath for an apron full of gold; I have known Lloyd five or six years, and all her friends.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know Mrs. Lloyd's sisters? A. Yes; they came to see him, and I used to go to them for money; the lodgers used to ask how he was.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you remember that it was the 24th; there are other Tuesdays in January? A. I cannot say, but I nursed her in the fever, and she had only got well a week - I can give no other reason - I do not know when she was taken ill, or when she got well, but she had got out a week when he was taken ill; I thought it was the 24th - I cannot say it was not the 17th.</p>

My cellar communicates with the house, and has a flap opening into the street; before I went to bed I looked all over the house; the flap was secure, and was bolted inside all secure. I was alarmed by the watchman about one o'clock; I threw up the window, and the watchman called to me; I went down stairs, and found the cellar flap wrenched off its hinges; I went up and dressed myself. The watchman produced a crowbar, which tallies with the marks; I missed nothing. The cellar was full of different things. The prisoners are strangers to me.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the Bow-street pa<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182605110021"/>trol. I was on duty in Mile-end-road on the 25th of April, about twelve o'clock; I had just got to the corner of Dog-row, which is about fifty yards from the prosecutor's house. I stood up at a door-way, out of the rain, as it poured hard - I could not be seen. I stood there about five minutes, when the three prisoners came down Whitechapel-road, and passed close by me, in company, talking together; Archdeacon's house is on the left-hand side, on which side I was. When they got to his house, in a minute, I heard something give a tremendous crack, which attracted my attention - I looked, and watched them; I could see every thing by the gas lamp, which shone against the house - I heard another crack in a few minutes - they then walked away, down the road; I could see them all three at the house; whenever any body passed, which was three or four times, they went away, and returned again to the house; I then saw them stooping towards the cellar flap, and missed one of them; he must have got down the flap into the cellar, for I saw him occasionally up and down, and have no doubt but he was in the cellar; I saw his head go down and up. I watched them in this way for three quarters of an hour; whenever any body passed all three went away; the one was not long in the cellar, and then he came up again; it was then getting towards one o'clock, and I went down towards them - at that time two of the patrol were coming up the road, meeting me - they all three walked away, as they had done before when any one passed; I saw collins put his arm over the railing of an empty house, about fifty yards from Archdeacon's, and heard something drop, which sounded like iron - I afterwards picked up a crow-bar in that place, by the assistance of the watchman; I secured them, and they stood by while I found it. When I saw collins drop this iron I caught hold of Francis, who had a fustian jacket on; the two patrol came up - I called to them, and they secured the other two. I then got over the rails, and found the crow-bar; they were never out of my sight. I searched them at the watch-house; Francis has a phosphorus-box and matches up the sleeve of his jacket, and a piece of candle, rolled up in paper, up the other sleeve; I found some duplicates on the other prisoners. I went back to the prosecutor's, and found the watchman had alarmed him. I went all over his place, and found the door of the cellar flap wrenched open. I fitted the crowbar to the marks - it was broken in teeth, and fitted the place exactly. I have no doubt it had been broken open by that crow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CHESWELL. Q. Are you quite positive that Cormack was in company with them? A. Quite.</p>
               <p>Prisoner COLLINS. Q. Did you not get over three or four places before you found the crow? A. Yes; there were three or four railings, and I got over them till I found it, by the assistance of the watchman's light.</p>

I asked the prisoner how he could be guilty of driving so furiously, as every body around complained of his driving so furiously; his answer was he was driving no faster than he usually did; I said, "If you have any witnesses to prove you were not driving furiously, you ought certainly to take their names, for it appears a very serious matter, and there appears ten to one against you;" he turned round, and said, "This gentleman saw something of it." He made no attempt to get away, I assisted in carrying Mr. Cundy into Mr. Ponsonby's house, and remained four hours with him.</p>

            . I am a solicitor. I heard of this affair, and waited on Mr. Layburn, of Newgate-market, the prisoner's master; he sent for the prisoner, and I asked him to describe what occurred in Regent-street - he stated that he had been leaving some meat at Messrs. Swan and Edgar's door, in the Quadrant, and was driving home in a direction for Carlton House, and just below the Circus he came in contact with a gentleman on horse-back; I asked what time it was - he said about half-past nine o'clock; I drew a small sketch of the street, and said, "Now describe where you were exactly" he said he was in the middle of the road - that something<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182605110022"/>had passed him, but there was nothing by him on his own side of the road at that time; Mr. Layburn asked at what rate he was driving - he replied, at a moderat rate; he was asked how many miles an hour - he said eight miles an hour; I said that was too great a pace to drive in London - he made no reply.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. As the street is very wide, if Mr. Cundy had been on his right side this would not have happened? A. If it was in the middle. I call eight miles an hour a very great pace. The street is McAdamized.</p>

            . I am the deceased's brother; I saw him at Mr. Ponsonby's, about two hours after the accident happened: he said, "I was going at a fast walk up Regent-street, towards the County Fire-office - about eight yards before me, I saw a gentleman on horse-back, riding at a slow trot; I heard the rattling of a cart, and saw a gentleman before me put his horse on the pavement, or on the curb-stone, in order to avoid the cart; the butcher's cart was coming at a furious rate towards me - I then attempted to put my horse on the pavement, which I could not effect - I therefore turned my horse to the right hand, to gain the other side of the road; the butcher appeared to turn his horse also, with a view of correcting my error; I met him about a third of the road, and so the mischief occurred;" he thought the prisoner did all he could to avoid it. My brother lingered eight or nine days, and then died.</p>

            . I was standing against a post, directly opposite Mr. Ponsonby's door, when this happened - the prisoner's cart was within five yards of the pavement - if the gentleman had kept on his right side instead of endeavouring to come between the prisoner's cart and the pavement it would not have happened - the gentleman's horse was not restive.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Do you know which is the proper side? A. The left; he was coming from Jermyn-street, and kept on the right side, instead of the left - before that he was in the center as near as possible; a gentleman on horse-back saved his life by turning on the side, on the stones - that was the deceased - he went on the flag stones, and fell instantly. I saw no other gentleman on horseback.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. The left was the gentleman's proper side - the cart was on the right? A. On the left, but on the proper side - the gentleman was on the wrong side.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What were you at? A. Sweeping the crossing. The cart was within five yards of the curb, on the left; the gentleman's horse got on the curb, with the force of the cart. The cart went straight on - it never turned aside.</p>

            . I was standing with Green, sweeping the crossing. I have known the prisoner a long time. I think the gentleman was in fault, for he was not on his proper side, and he came cantering up; the cart was coming straight down the Quadrant; a carriage was coming up, which prevented the gentleman keeping the proper side.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he from the pavement? A. Within five yards; the accident happened just at the crossing, by Piccadilly; the cart was right in the middle. I did not see the gentleman's horse on the pavement.</p>

On Saturday, the 22d of April I went out with my wife about ten minutes past eight o'clock in the evening; I left my little girl, who is five years old, and my little boy, who is two years old. in bed - there was no other person in the house; I fastened the door - the window had been fastened before - we returned twenty minutes before nine o'clock; I found the door as I had left it, but the candle, which I had left burning in the front room, had been moved into the back room; I saw a mustard-pot empty, in which I had left a half-crown and a shilling: I found a pair of old slippers in my room which were not mine, and were not there when I went out; my boots were taken from the cupboard - they were there when I went out; I went into the back room and missed my hat and the box in which it was kept; I went to some pawnbrokers in the neighbourhood, and when I came back my wife said "God bless me, they have taken all my child's clothes," which had been tied up in a bundle; I went out again and found my hat at a pawnbroker's, who gave me a note; I did not miss my other property at that time - the house could only have been entered by a false key, as there were no marks of violence on the door or window; there is another way of getting in by the back door, but they must have got over the neighbours' gardens, which were all safe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ROBERTS. Q. What time was this? A. About ten minutes past eight o'clock - it was getting dark; I only had this hat a week, and had worn it on the Sunday; I then put it away, and had not seen it again; I saw the box but not the hat.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did your hat box stand? A. It hung on a nail in the back room.</p>

            . I am shopman to Messrs. Nichols and Latter - they are pawnbrokers, and live at No. 80, Broad-street, Ratcliffe. On the 22d of April, between nine and ten o'clock, Eliza Douglas, whom I knew before, came and offered a hat to pawn, which appeared nearly new - it was in a box; I lent 6s. on it - she told me where she lived - here is the hat and the box.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MALCOLM. I take this hat to be mine - there is no mark of mine in it; I only know it by the maker's name - there was a crape on it - here is the name of Braggs on the box, which was put on by the maker, I suppose for a person it had misfitted - it was on it when I bought it; the hat was wrapped up in paper - it fitted me exactly and so does this; I have every reason to think it is mine; I have not found any of the other things since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the maker's name in the hat? A. Yes; but no mark of mine - this is like the hat I had; I left the house ten minutes before eight o'clock, and returned twenty minutes before nine - there is a clock in front of my door.</p>

On this night three weeks I fastened the back kitchen doors and shutters with a bar across them between seven and eight o'clock - the door had two bolts - the front kitchen door was locked, for I tried it; I and my fellow-servant Holland went to bed about twelve o'clock; we were the last persons up - we slept in the front kitchen - every thing was fast; I got up at a quarter to five o'clock in the morning - it was day-light; I was the first person up; I found the back kitchen door wide open, and the window, which looks into the garden, open - there was a hole cut through the shutter - the casement was thrown up; I found the bar of the back kitchen shutter left in the garden close by the window, laying down under it; a hole was cut in the shutter with a centre bit, large enough for a man's hand to be put in, and close under the bar - a man could then unfasten the bar; there were footsteps under the window - they were the footsteps of more than one man; they were different sizes and quite fresh done, and there were marks where they had got over the wall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. You could not tell that it was done with a centre bit? A. No.</p>

Bank notes; that was gone; also a telescope, a work box, a cruet stand with seven bottles, silver mounted, a coat, a pair of gloves, a handkerchief, and two gold tooth-pick cases; the coat was on the bannisters.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On Sunday morning, the 23d of April, I and an officer went to the prosecutor's house, and examined it about twelve o'clock - I found marks of footsteps in the garden - the back kitchen window had been lifted up, and the inside shutter bored with a centre bit, and the piece taken out; I found this piece of wood on the window cill - it fitted the hole in the shutter - the door leading from the back to the front kitchen had been forced, and there were marks of the crow bar on the side of the door; I went up stairs, and in the parlour found two cupboards forced open, and marks of a crow bar on both of them; the inner lock of a very handsome writing desk had been forced; on the Friday following, the 28th of April, I went with other officers to the Blue Boar tap, Aldgate; the prisoners Binfield and Savage were sitting there in a box together, smoking their pipes - (Wilson had been previously apprehended); Armstrong and Van immediately stepped up to Savage - both prisoners dropped their pipes, and Binfield, who sat on the right of the box, stood up and put his hand into his pocket; I immediately stepped into the box on the opposite side to him, and seized his right arm just below the elbow, as he drew his hand out of his pocket, and in about half a minute something dropped out of his hand; I afterwards found it was this pistol, loaded with powder and ball and primed (producing it); I have taken the priming and flint out; I proceeded to search him and took a screw driver from his pocket - he seemed very uneasy; I held him while Attfield searched him further - I saw him take from his pocket a powder-born, containing powder some bullets, a bullet mould, a phosphoros box and matches, with some other articles, a small knife, and a tooth-pick case; we secured them both; one of the officers pistols went off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long after you took hold of his arm did you find the pistol? A. After the search had been made, but I heard it drop; I looked under the table and found it, perhaps four minutes after - it had a stop lock - he had not time to cock it - he made no attempt to seize it when it dropped.</p>

            . I live in Thrall-street, Spitalfields, and am a watchman of Shoreditch. On Sunday morning, the 23d of April, about twenty minutes or a quarter to five o'clock, I was on duty in Hackney-road, it was broad day-light - I saw three persons coming out of Union-street into Hackney-road - it was the three prisoners - I noticed them; I particularly noticed Binfield, as having a shooting jacket on, made of the skin of some animal, and am surehe was one of them - the other two prisoners were with him - I am sure they are the three prisoners; just as they got rather past me, two of my brother watchmen turned out of Union-street, and beckoned me to stop them - I went back towards them, all three turned round with their faces towards me - I then noticed Savage having on a dark brown coat; I went up to Wilson, who had a parcel under his arm - he turned round and ran away - I threw my stick at him - he instantly dropped the parcel, containing this work-box - I picked it up directly; he ran towards Shoreditch, and the other two down Cooper's gardens, and all got away in different directions - I did not know them before; I saw Wilson at the office on the Thursday following; I am positive they are the three men; when I went back to them I had a full observation of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was in Hackney-road? A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182605110025"/>Yes; I always said it was broad day-light when I met them, but said I could not tell when it got light; I do not know where the prosecutor's house is; I had them in my sight four minutes perhaps, it was not five minutes; I was close enough to Wilson to put my hand on him - I had to go close to the houses to let the three pass me; I first saw them ten or twelve yards off, but could not observe their dress so plain then as when they came close to me; I saw Wilson in custody on this charge on the Thursday following, going up to the bar - he had his hat on, and so he had on this morning; I saw the others in custody on the Saturday following - I swore positively to them then, and said what their dress was - they changed their dress every day they were examined - Wilson appeared to wear the same dress on the Thursday, but I could not swear that it was.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How was Wilson dressed when you saw them come from Union-street? A. He had white stockings, light corded breeches, and a blue-coat; Binfield had a light-coloured shooting-jacket, and a waistcoat made of the skin of some animal; Savage had a dark brown long coat; I gave the work-box to Page.</p>

            . I am a stick-maker. On Sunday, the 23d of April. about a quarter to five o'clock in the morning, I was at the end of Union-street, Hackney-road, going a sparrow-shooting, with a friend, and saw three men turning out of Union-street into Hackney-road - it was broad day-light - I did not know them before; I noticed them, and know the three prisoners are the men - I am quite sure of them; I pursued them after they ran away; I had observed two of their faces in following them - because Savage and Binfield turned round and faced me as I pursued - and Wilson had a yellow handkerchief with something in it, with a yellow bright foot coming through it - he wore a blue-coat, corded breeches, and white stockings; I have no doubt whatever of them; I ran after them because the watchman sprang his rattle; I was stopped by the inspector - ran round another way, and met Savage and Binfield; I saw Binfield give Savage a stock and bit, which he threw over the wall in Loggerhead-lane - I was quite close to them, but they got away; Binfield had a small bundle in a silk handkerchief - I do not know what became of that; I pursued them to Friar's-mount, when both Savage and Binfield turned round and faced me - they presented their pistols at me - I had a pistol in my pocket loaded with bird-shot, and presented it at them, and they presented their's at me; their pistols were short, with bright barrels like those produced; they made towards me, and I ran away, and saw no more of them; I did not face them above a minute - I did not see their faces before - I was agitated, but still am quite certain of them; I went back into Loggerhead-lane, informed the inspector, who got over the wall, and brought the stock and bit from where I pointed out, and gave them to Morton - Binfield were a shooting-jacket and light trousers to correspond - I did not notice his waistcoat; I saw Wilson in custody on Wednesday evening, it was just dark, and at that time I did not knew him; I saw him again on Thursday at the bar, and knew him; I saw Savage in a public-house next to the office, and knew him directly, and Binfield, when I saw him; I am sure they are the men who presented the pistols at me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you had any conversation with Parker, the watchman, about this? A. No; he pursued the men as well as me, and must know that I pursued them; we have not talked about whether I should know the men.</p>
               <p>Q. Your only opportunity of seeing two of them was when they presented a pistol? A. Yes; I did not run away directly, for I faced them, and pulled my pistol out to them - it might not be so long as a minute - I saw Wilson's face, because he turned round to me, but I did not see him drop the box - that was the only opportunity I had of seeing him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not sent into the lock-up-place, where there were several persons, to pick them out? A. I stood at the door, looked at the prisoners for a very short time, and said, "No, there is none of them there;" there were only four in custody - it was just before seven o'clock in the evening, and not quite light; I knew him next morning.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty in Hackney-road on this Sunday morning, the 23d of April, about a quarter or twenty minutes before five o'clock - it was light. I heard a whistling and tuning in Union-street - I went towards the street, and saw three or four persons coming towards Hackney-road, together, one after the other, walking. I saw Binfield among them - I have known him two or three years - he once lodged near my beat; I am sure he was one - he had a lightish coloured dress on. Wilson was one of the others; he was walking fast; I did not know him before - he had something red under his left arm, in the shape of a box; he walked very quick towards Shoreditch; I walked quickly after him, on the other side of the road, and when he came up to Parker he gave a spring off the pavement, and looked round, then began to run; I ran after him, and tried to hit him with a stick, but could not reach him - a stick came very quick past me, and he dropped the box - Parker picked it up; he wore a blue coat, light small-clothes, and white stockings. I cannot speak to Savage. I am sure Wilson is the man who dropped the box; he was nearly within reach of me at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was that all the opportunity you had of seeing his face? A. I could see his face when he was on the other side of the road; when he was before me he looked over his left shoulder towards me. I have not talked this over with Parker or Jackson particularly; I said I knew Joe - I do not know that I described him; if we had any conversation it was very trifling; we mentioned their dress before they were taken, but not after.</p>

            . I am watchman at the corner of Union-street, Kingsland-road. On Sunday, the 23d of April, about twenty minutes or a quarter to five o'clock (it was broad day light), I saw the three prisoners turn out of Kingsland-road into Union-street; I knew them all three before; I have known Binfield twelve or eighteen months; I knew the others by sight; I knew Savage by name for three months, and knew Wilson by his driving a sand cart - I had only known him a week or two; I am sure of them all three; they were in company together;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182605110026"/>they passed me on the other side of the way. Wilson had a red handkerchief under his left arm, and wore a blue coat, white stockings, and light corded breeches. Binfield had a shooting jacket on, and a pair of trousers. I saw Binfield look into my box - he went on to the Union public-house, and danced on the shutter of the cellar; I then began to follow them, and called out twice, "Joe, stop;" they did not stop, but pushed away quicker, and turned into Hackney-road, and by Cooper's-gardens they divided; Wilson and Binfield ran down Cooper's-gardens - I saw no more of them. I got over a wall in Loggerhead-lane; a man came out of a house there undressed - I saw him pick up a stock and center-bit some distance from the wall, as if it had been thrown over - he gave it to me, and I gave it to Morton.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you directed to look for the prisoners in the lock-up-room? A. I was not there.

I never told Armstrong I could not speak to Wilson.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Cording, a pawnbroker, of Aldgate High-street. I have a coat, which Binfield pawned with me, for 6s., on the 28th of April, in the name of Tugall; I gave him one of the duplicates produced. I did not know him before, but am certain he is the man - he was about five minutes in the shop. I took particular notice of him; I picked him out at the office, from about thirty persons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was it? A. Between five and eight o'clock. When I saw him among thirty persons I said I believed he was the man, to the best of my recollection, but I immediately recognized him, and was positive - it was nearer eight o'clock than five - it might be rather dusk - I think the gas was lighted.</p>
               <p>Mr. BIGG. This is my coat.</p>

            . I am landlord of the cottage in Novascotia-gardens, Crabtree-row, Hackney-road - Gleed's premises join the cottage. I let it to Savage, by the name of H. Hall; I did not know him before, and did not know his name was Savage; he gave me no name, but I found it was Hall. I let him the cottage fourteen or fifteen weeks ago, at 3s. a week; Binfield used to come there to see Savage's wife; I only live twenty yards off, and frequently saw him there - I have seen Binfield come out of the cottage in his shirt sleeves, about eight or nine o'clock in the morning. I never saw Wilson there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How lately before the 28th of April did you see Binfield there? A. I can safely say I saw him there a month before.</p>

            . I am Bowen's daughter. I used to receive the rent of this cottage - I know Binfield and Savage by seeing them both there, early and late - I considered that they both lived there; they used to bring the rent to my mother once a month, but I saw them there constantly every day; two women lived there, who were called Mrs. Savage and Mrs. Binfield.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How lately before the 28th of April will you venture to swear you saw Binfield there? A. About a month.</p>
               <p>Mr. BIGG. This coat is mine - it was left on the bannister. The handkerchief is mine; I believe the snuff-box to be mine - I have no doubt of the tooth-pick case and knife; the coat is worth 1l., the cruets 31s. 6d., my hat 7s. or 8s. - the property is worth above 40s., and my pocketbook contained Bank notes and unaccepted bills.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you any mark on the coat? A. Yes, and my name is engraved on the tooth-pick case.</p>

               <p>MR. BRODRICK to JOSHUA ARMSTRONG. Q. You shewed some prisoners to Stockwell in the lock-up-room? A. Yes; it was on Wednesday - Wilson was there; he said there were none of the men; there was plenty of light for him to see; and before that we were out with him, looking for the prisoners, till one o'clock in the morning, and then he said it was of no use waiting any longer, for he should know none of them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. In what way was he brought to the office? A. He came voluntarily, because a man was in custody - he produced a small seal at the time, such as are put on cloth.</p>

On Monday evening, the 24th of April, I put into the cash-box ten sovereigns, a half-sovereign, a crown-piece, half-a-crown, a 10l., and a 5l. note, a draft for 22l., two bills of exchange, for 37l. 2s. 6d., one for 24l., one for 5l, one for 40l., one for 50l., three for 20l., one for 22l. 17s. 10d., two for 24l. 5s., and one for 9l. 4s. 5d. I locked them in the cash-box, and put it into the iron-chest, about half past eight o'clock in the evening; the prisoner slept in the house at that time; I went home about twenty minutes past eight o'clock, returned about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, and he was gone, and the property also; he did not return. I went to Kidderminster on the Wednesday week after, and found him in custody there. I found the iron-chest locked as I had left it: I had put the key of it into my own desk, which I locked up. I found my own desk broken open, and the key of the iron-chest gone - I have never seen it since. The prisoner had not intimated to me that he was going to leave; nobody was aware of it; none of the property has been found; there were other servants in the house, who still remain there. When I saw him at Kidderminster I told him he had made a bad job of it, and asked him where the property was. I held him out neither threat or promise - he denied all knowledge of it at that time, and did not account for his leaving so suddenly. The property amounts to 230l.; he was searched at Kidderminster, and some silver and a sovereign were found on him.</p>

I have never found the key of the chest, nor recovered any of the property.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Munn, and sleep in the house. The last time I saw the prisoner was at a quarter past eight o'clock, or a few minutes after, on the night in question - Berry had then gone out - I did not see the prisoner leave the house - he was screwing up the bolts of the shutters at that time - he had given no intimation of his going away; I did not see him afterwards till he was apprehended; if any wages were due to him it was very trifling. I went out at a quarter past eight, returned at half-past eight, and he was then gone, and the door not fastened, as it usually is; he always used to lock and bolt it after me when I went out, but I found it not locked, and only the bolt dropped. I had told him to fasten it after me when I went out, and heard him bolt and lock it, but when I returned he was gone, and only the bottom bolt dropped - it is a double door.</p>

I had a candle lighted when I saw him; he came inside the kitchen door, and wiped his hands - I asked where he was going - he said he was going to fasten the door after Smith, which he always did. I let Smith in, and found only the bolt slipped. I found all the house safe when I got up in the morning.</p>

On the 5th of May I dined out, and returned in a hackney-coach, which the prisoner drove: on getting to the coffee-house he demanded 12s. - I took 12s. from my purse, intending to pay it, but desired the witness, Thomas, who was by, to ask him the reason of so extraordinary a demand. I left my purse on the bar-counter while I turned round for an answer, keeping the 12s. in my hand - I left Thomas at the bar, to speak to him about it, and while Thomas was turning to me with his answer, I was surprised at seeing the prisoner moving off without his fare - I had six new bright sovereigns, and about 7s. in silver, in my purse; the prisoner has never demanded his fare of me. I dropped the 12s. into my pocket, being tired, and went up stairs. I did not miss my purse till morning not thinking of it. I applied to Read, who apprehended the prisoner the very next day, at six or seven o'clock in the afternoon - he was then dressed entirely in new clothes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CRESWELL. Q. At what time did you come home? A. About eleven o'clock. I was sober, and as capable of doing business as I am now - I had taken 12s. out of the purse, and put it on the barcounter; I was much fatigned, but perfectly sober; I saw nobody take it. Thomas and the bar-maid were at the bar. The prisoner was close to the counter, leaning over it - it is about eighteen inches wide.</p>

I spoke to him. The prisoner was leaning on the bar<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182605110030"/>quite close to the purse; he demanded 12s. - Mr. Owen wanted to know the distance he had driven - there was an altercation, and all on a sudden the prisoner left, without receiving his fare.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you make any observation to Mr. Owen about his purse after the prisoner was gone? - A. No; I did not miss it at the time. Owen is my uncle - I had rode with him in the coach.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe it is your custom to expect a man to bring you so much a day? A. Some do, but I leave it to their generosity; I expect my horses home at half-past eleven o'clock; we have no means of learning how much they get; if he had said he had not received 12s. I should expect him to go and get it; he has been about three months with me, and conducted himself well; I have known him from a child; I do not know that he was going to be married.</p>

I left home on the 9th of April, from twelve till four o'clock; when I came back I saw a bundle under the table, but I took no notice of it. After she had her tea she took the bundle, and put it under the bed; she went out about eight o'clock, and returned about half-past ten; she then had this pin in her bosom, and said she found it in the Strand. I searched my box, and missed several things; I found this petticoat in her possession. I asked her to go with me, but she refused, because it was late. Mr. Hughes, of Bow-street, went with me, with a warrant, to search her box; I never lent her any thing. I swear the pin is mine - these things were found in the prisoner's box, which was locked up, and she took the key to the watch-house.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

On the evening of the 13th of April, about eight o'clock, the prisoners came to my shop, together - they asked to look at a piece of lace edging, and I shewed them some; they selected one piece - while I was measuring the quantity, I saw Pearl take a card of lace off the counter; Burn put her elbow before her, and Pearl put the lace under her cloak. I ordered my husband to be called; he went round the counter, and moved her round.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. When you told your husband, did you speak loud? A. Yes, but the prisoners remained there; several persons were in the shop; the lace was found on the floor. I am sure I saw her put the lace under her cloak.</p>

I am a watchman of Euston-square, On the 11th of April, about five o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner with a saddle - he had a bag at his back; I asked him where he had brought the things from - he replied, from the Load of Hay public-house, and that he was going to Finsbury-square, to fetch a sick horse; I asked him what he had got in the bag - he said a bridle and horse-cloth. He at first said that he brought them from a gentleman at Hampstead, and then from the Load of Hay; I said it was rather an unlucky affair - he threw down the things, and ran away; he jumped over the railing of the nursery ground, and ran across it; I sprung my rattle, and he was taken by Humphreys.</p>

On the 10th of April, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was coming from Kensington, and was passing within one hundred yards of Gloucester-lodge - I saw a gentleman and lady before me - from an observation they made, curiousity induced me to look into the hedge, and I there saw some lead; I knew it immediately, because I had been employed at Gloucester-lodge, and put this lead up myself - it is stamped with my name. I took it to the gardener - he said two men had been seen on the premises, and that he could swear to them; I pursued the prisoners, and challenged them. Adams attempted to run away; Grove said he knew nothing at all about it. I took them in charge. I found a trowel on Grove, and a line on Adams - it did not appear that the trowel had been used on the occasion.</p>

            . I hold a government situation. I was in my garden opposite to the prosecutrix's house, on the 10th of April, between four and five o'clock - I saw Mrs. Evans on the grounds of Gloucester-lodge - she said that there were two men on or about the stables; I went, and saw the two prisoners there - it is an old building, from whence the lead was taken. I saw one of them take something up - I followed them up the lane, and they divided; I went back, and down another lane, where I met Grove. I saw Mrs. Hyndman's gardener, and told him what I had seen. I then saw Mr. Draper, who said he had found some lead in the hedge. There is a field round the premises. I said I had seen two men - they were strangers to me, but I am sure of their persons.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I was on duty in the Uxbridge-road on the 28th of April - I fell in with the prisoner about a quarter before twelve o'clock at night, near Acton; he was carrying a bundle; he said he got it from a friend, for whom he was taking it from town- I found it contained linen, handkerchiefs, and other articles; I had hand-bills posted up about Acton, and in two days I found the owners of the property now produced - this hammer was found on him.</p>

            . I keep a pigeon shop in Brick-lane, Spitalfields. I have known Mr. Church some time - he came and told me of his loss, and asked me to stop the pigeons if they were brought - Bailey came about eight o'clock on Sunday morning and brought five, and said he had two more - he said they were worth 12s. - I said they were worth 9s.; I asked if he could give me change for a sovereign - he said he could not - I said he must stop till I got change - I said they were very clean, and he replied that they belonged to his brother, who had a good place for them to fly in; I told him to call in about ten minutes; I went to Gooding and told him I thought they had been stolen; I am a pigeon fancier - if pigeons get out, and other people get them we then buy them - if they are let out, and are decoyed away it is considered fair game - that is the custom of the trade.</p>

At eight o'clock on Saturday, the 29th of April, they were all safe - the pigeon-house stands upon four posts, twelve feet high - they cannot get out unless I let them out - at seven o'clock the next morning I missed twenty-eight; I went to the two witnesses and informed them of it; I can swear to these pigeons from having attending them - the two white ones are about two years and six months old.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. How many white pigeons had you? A. I had seven old, and eleven young ones.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there not many white pigeons about London? A. There are, but I can swear to these - I would pick them out from one hundred - I put no mark upon them - I know them by their faces; there is considerable difference in their faces, and it is by their countenances that I know them - a hundred pigeons probably alter at times by getting fatter and stouter - there is a difference in their noses - we call them models; there are two old ones, a cock and hen - the other three white ones are hens; I am in the habit of minding them when young.</p>

            . I am servant to Taylor, and was collecting pots in Cadogan-street on the 6th of this month - I saw the prisoner walking towards Sloane-street - she dropped a pot from under her shawl - I thought she had stolen it - I followed and found these four pots upon, three in her apron, and one under her shawl - she was three or four yards from my master's house when I saw her first.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been at work at the building and supposed that these pots belonged to the Cable public-house, and was taking them home as I had done several times before.</p>

            . I am a cheesemonger, and live in Henry-street, Pentonville. The prisoner lived with Mr. Buley, of Newgate-market, who is an egg-merchant - he was in the habit of coming to me twice a week with eggs - on the 16th of December he came with seven cheeses in a cart - he had left three cheeses on the 9th - he sold the ten to me at 80s. per cwt., which was a fair price - he said he would call for the money when he returned; I paid 19l. 19s. 8d. for them; he said he sold them for a person who was short of money, and that they came from Pickford's wharf; I did not ask him the person's name; I conduct the business for my aunt; I called on Mr. Pettifer, and saw some cheeses there like them; I formerly lived with Pettifer two years.</p>

I have known the prisoner seven or eight years, and have dealt with his master for the last six; in December, last year, I had one hundred and fourteen Cheshire cheeses in - my shop was very full, and had some trouble to place them; I placed four at the door to show, as they were fine old cheeses; I went out, and on my return I found three were missing, although none had been sold; I could not find them any where, until March last, when I found some in the shop of Mrs. Butt, of Pentonville; Butt said he had purchased ten of the prisoner; I found one of them with my own mark on it; I could not swear to the others which were not marked; here is one of the cheeses which I put on the tub at the door in December.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CRESWELL. Q. Had you a brother living with you at that time? A. Yes; the prisoner never came to me, and told me what my brother had done about cheese; I did not see the prisoner in my shop about the time I missed them to my knowledge.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's brother. I am now in custody - I know the prisoner - there was a conversation between us about cheeses; I at first gave the prisoner one cheese, on account of his large family - after that he enticed me to give him another; he was always asking for another; I gave him twelve cheeses of my brother's altogether; he came up in a morning before the shop was open, to carry three away - he helped me to remove them; he said if I would let him have them he would let me have half the money they sold for - I only got from 8l. to 9l. - this was from December to March last; I did not say any thing to my brother about it; he at last asked me if I was not troubled in my mind, and then I told all about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CRESWELL. Q. You say you gave the prisoner twelve cheeses in all? A. Yes; he used to come with a cart to fetch them away; he used to be in the cart sometimes, and I gave them to him; I was taken into custody about this, and have been confined ever since.</p>

I am his clerk - Turner was walking along - I saw the man at the bar in company with two other persons - I saw the prisoner put his hand into Mr. Turner's pocket, and draw out something in his hand - I was close to him - Turner looked round and said he had lost his purse, and I told him what I had seen - I pointed to the prisoner, and said "That's the man who has got your purse;" the prisoner then hobbled away - I am quite sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not see him hobble when he first took the purse out; I was going to Knightsbridge with some bottles - I had never seen him before - he merely pushed against the prosecutor, and then put his hand into the pocket.</p>

I think it is sixty yards from where the prisoner was found, to where the child had been at play; he had got the child on some dark steps in a dark part of the passage; when I went down I met Miss Hunt bringing the prisoner by force; the child said "Father, the man took my handkerchief" - she cried at the time - she said the prisoner said he took it off to put some cakes in; the place was so dark and retired where he had got the child, that he might have completely stripped her unobserved.</p>

            . I am a constable of Highgate. On Saturday, the 8th of April, about twenty minutes before eleven o'clock, Mr. Boston gave me information - I took the prisoners at the Green Dragon public-house soon afterwards; I seized Royal as he came up to the house, and pushed him into the tap-room - the landlord and the other young man pushed in the other two prisoners - the landlord said "Here is the row of beads;" they were then on the floor; I do not know who they fell from.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far is this public-house from where the beads were taken? A. About a mile and a half - I cannot say they were not on the floor before - several persons had been there before.</p>

I saw him thrown down and stopped - I did not see the things taken from him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. Were you not intoxicated? A. I was not so drunk but I could see what I was about. I was walking steadily home; I had been at a public-house, where I had a bottle of wine, a glass of brandy, and one glass of brandy and water, of which three of us drank; we came out of the house about eleven o'clock, and my companions went up Holborn, and left me; we were not turned out of the house - there was no disturbance; some of the party sung, but I was unacquainted with them. I was robbed just by the house; there were several persons passing, and I might have spoken to some of them - when I came out I did not go to a cook-shop door with those persons - if I was at the door they might have come up to me, but I did not notice that there was a cook-shop; I cannot undertake to say I had not lost them before - I did not take notice of any persons near me, but I was pushed against another man. I am quite certain I ran after the right person with my chain - I had seen him in the public-house, and knew his features well - I was not in company with him; I did not know the prisoner was near me; I might have spoken to him in the house, but not afterwards. I did not speak to him and two or three other persons in the street, before I was robbed. I do not recollect calling at a cook-shop - I will not swear I did not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you mention before the Magistrate that the person who took it had been in the public-house? A. I believe not - I was not asked the question. I had not known him before he was in the public-house; he had sung a song there.(Property produced and sworn to).</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 3d of May I was on duty in Cow-cross-street, between eleven and twelve o'clock; I heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running - he passed me, and was stopped in Cow-cross, by two young men, who were standing near Sharp's alley; they threw him on the ground. While I was taking him to the watch-house I saw the prosecutor. I found these seals about an hour afterwards, on the spot where the prisoner was when he was on the ground - no other persons were there but those who threw him down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there not a general confusion, and a great many people running? A. There were some other persons there. I do not know the two men who stopped the prisoner - I was very near him when he was stopped. The prosecutor was not perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say there was a general confusion and several people? A. Yes. I saw the prosecutor running after the prisoner, but the prisoner was first - I am quite sure he was before any other person.</p>

            . Between eleven and twelve o'clock on the night in question, I went to the cook-shop for 1 1/2lb. of beef sausages - there were ten or twelve persons there; some of them were very respectable - the prosecutor was one; when I came out I saw him and some others pass me; I turned my head, and saw the prisoner was one; there was a great shout and noise. I turned round by the oyster-shop - the prosecutor ran up against me, and nearly knocked me down - he sang out Stop thief! I saw the prisoner there, running, and several persons cried Stop thief! I took no notice of them, and they dispersed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the prosecutor in the cook-shop? A. Certainly I did; there were several persons in company - I cannot say how many; the prosecutor was there when I went in, and staid about two minutes; there were a number of persons running all ways - they appeared in sport.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were they all laughing together at the time the cry of Stop thief! was raised? A. Yes - the prosecutor did not say, in my presence, that he had lost his watch chain.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came out of the house - it was late, and I was in a hurry; there were a great many persons on the stones; I ran down Cow-cross, because I thought the door would be shut - there was a cry of Stop thief! and two gentlemen came and knocked me down.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

I let a furnished room to the prisoner, at 5s. per week; another person took it for her first - she lodged in it; she staid ten weeks, and went away on the 11th of April, with a large bundle. I followed her to the Water-works public-house - she came out again with the bundle, and I followed her to the Coach and Horses public-house, with these two pillows behind her. I asked how she came to take my things, and she said she did not. I then got the constable. The room had been taken in the prisoner's name, and she paid the rent for it, or caused it to be paid every Saturday morning, by Mrs. Smith, who fetched 14s. a week from her husband.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 18th of April, between ten and eleven o'clock, I met the prisoner Watts in Poland-street - I did not see her come out of any house; I had some suspicion of her reticule basket, and asked her what she had got in it; she hesitated a moment, and then said some rings, which she had bought of a woman, for 7s.; I then opened the basket, and saw a cloth, tied up with some papers, which seemed to be papers of nails; I said, "Here is something besides rings;" she said"I gave 7s. for them altogether." I then took her to the office; she was committed till that day week - I inquired at different ironmongers; among the rest I went to the prosecutors, where I received information, and left word for Mr. White to come to the office - he came; I we got a search warrant, and went to Watt's residence, in Peter-street; we searched, and found a quantity of glue behind the counter, in two baskets; the prosecutor claimed it, and I brought it away; there were some other articles, which he would not swear to; I then went to the stables in Nag's Head-yard, where I found Ward dressing a horse; Mr. White, who was with me, said to him, "William, I have something serious against you;" he said, "What is that, Sir?" Mr. White said, "Oh! we know all about it - do not you know what your wife sold this morning" - he said,"It was only a few tacks, or nails," nails I think he said - I said, "Do you mean to deny that there were some rings?" he said, "Yes, a few rings too." I then took him into custody. I went to his lodgings in Poland-street, and found these articles - some of which have a mark upon them.</p>
               <p>Mr. WHITE. I know these nails by the papers they are tied up in.</p>
               <p>Mr. CRESWELL. Q. Can you swear that these are the identical papers they were tied up in? A. Yes - they were tied up and marked on the 18th of April, by a person who had not been in our employ before. The things are worth above 30s.</p>
               <p>Mr. PHILLIPS to THOMAS CLEMENTS. Q. You say this woman said she bought them of a woman? A. Yes; she might have carried away other things; it was in broad day. I told Ward his wife had sold them, because Watts said she bought them of a woman. I did not see Watts at their lodgings, but in the same street. I found nothing at Watts' house which the prosecutor could swear to.</p>

It was too late last night to get an attorney, and he said he would draw up a short brief; I wanted to employ counsel, and he said "We must get up a short brief," or I did - I cannot say which. I rather think I asked Mr. Plank to do it, and he said it was in very good hands. I did not give him any instructions - he had attended at the office. I suppose I am to pay him as an officer - he gave me the brief to look over, and then I put it into my pocket. I brought it to you this morning, and you said you were engaged in the case.</p>

I went there again about half-past six o'clock in the evening, and the coat was removed; he was not in the loft then, but I had heard him there a short time before. I got an officer, and we took the prisoner as he left the yard; I asked him for the coat which he had taken out of the chaise - he denied all knowledge of it at first, but afterwards said he was very sorry - that he deserved any punishment, but hoped I would spare him, on account of his wife, and he would show me where it was - he then went to the loft, removed five or six trusses of straw, and gave the coat out; he had lived with me about seven months, and conducted himself with great propriety.</p>

About seven o'clock in the evening of the 25th of April I saw the prisoner near the shop; he looked in, and I suspected him. I went to the back of the shop, and saw him take this umbrella from another, to which it was attached by a bit of string, and hung in the window; I saw him put it down, look round, and then take it away; I ran out, and the constable, who had been watching him, had just stopped him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS, JUN. Q. These were in the window, for people to look at, and to handle? A. Yes, but he took it off the hook; I saw him in custody in two or three minutes - he appeared to be in liquor. The place is much frequented - he might have been seen by twenty or thirty other persons. It has Mr. Moore's name inside - he did it quite openly, as a man takes his own umbrella.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is it an usual course of dealing for people to ask the price, or to walk off without asking? A. They generally ask the price.</p>

            . I am a headborough. On the 12th of April I was going along the City-road by Mr. Stevenson's house; I heard a cry, and saw Evans following the prisoner, who crossed over and passed me; he ran down Plummer-street, and threw down this umbrella; I followed him up Ebenezer-street, where a young man, named Harding, stopped him; as we were coming back we met Evans, who said "You villain, what did you do in the kitchen - what did you do with the watch;" we came back, and Evans took up the watch from under a wheel-barrow on the pavement - the case was parted from it.</p>
               <p>DAVID STEVENSON. I went out on the 12th of April, and left Evans in my house - this watch was hanging over the front kitchen mantle-piece, where it usually does; I know it to be mine - the prisoner is quite a stranger, and had no right there.</p>

            , who was sitting on the bench before me - very shortly afterwards I felt something again at my pocket; I put my hand to my pocket and exclaimed "I have lost my pocket book;" Sir Thomas Croft heard it; I saw the prisoner next me, and I said to Mr. Littledale, a friend of mine, to whom I had been talking, "Look into that hat, (meaning the prisoner's) I am sure my pocket-book is in it;" I fancied I had seen his hand go from my pocket to his hat; I had distinctly seen something put into it; he had then moved about half a yard or a yard from where I had first seen him - he heard what I said; I got over the ballustrade, and Sir Thomas Croft said to the prisoner "Allow me, Sir, to look into that hat," seizing it at the same time, and I picked up my pocket-book close by where the prisoner was standing - there was a pencil case in it, but no money - I was sitting quite still when I felt, first, one snatch at my pocket, and then another - it was not possible for the book to have fallen from my pocket in the situation in which I found it - Sir Thomas Croft took the prisoner, and he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was the house full? A. Yes; very full, and the passages were crowded as much as the seats - when the ballet is on the stage the people press upwards rather, and then the ballustrades are the only things that were between us - when the people are straining to see the ballet, it makes some impression on those who have seats; I believe every alternate seat has a back to it; I was about half way down; the pressure I felt the first time might have been from the crowd - the prisoner had the same pressure as others - he moved from his place - my book was in the pocket next the crowd; I made no observation the first time, but the second time I exclaimed "Good God, I have lost my pocket book;" the music was playing and the ballet was going on - the prisoner might not have heard me - he had his hat before him, and I saw something put into it - he was then parallel with me; I do not know whether there was any thing in his hat or not - he denied any knowledge of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The rails do not extend all the way down? A. No; but there was a rail where I was sitting; I was close to the rail, but I cannot say whether my coat pocket was outside the rail or not; I had seen the prisoner standing there about five minutes.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did he attempt to make off, or did he keep his ground? A. When I saw him the second time he had removed about a yard.</p>
               <p>SIR THOMAS ELMESLEY CROFT, BART. I am acquainted with the prosecutor - I was formerly in the same regiment with him; I was sitting on the left hand side of the pit on the night in question - at that part which is ballustraded; I was looking at the ballet when I heard Captain Barton say "Good God, I have lost my pocket book, look into that hat;" I was sitting on the corner of the seat before him; I knew the gentleman before me, I therefore saw there was no one to whom he could allude but the prisoner; I seized his hat as he was standing with his back to the boxes, and said "Allow me to look at that hat," and, without waiting for any reply, I took hold of it as he was holding it against him; he turned pale, and, as I took hold of it, I saw him shuffle this pocket-book out of the hat with his right hand, and it dropped at his feet; I took hold<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182605110047"/>of him by the collar - he made no resistance; I gave him to the officer; Captain Barton took up the book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see the book in his hand? A. I saw it shuffling out of his hat and he touched it, but I did not see it in his hand; I do not know whether there was a handkerchief in his hat, - I did not look into the hat, but I saw the book fall - there were many persons close to him, but I should think they were too much engaged looking at the ballet to notice him if he had taken the book from the pocket - no person said that they had seen him do any thing - this was during the dancing.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am entirely innocent of it - some person might have put it into my hat - my handkerchief was in it, and, in the pressure, my hat was doubled, which all persons who go there know to be the case; I never touched the garment of Captain Barton - if any person can say I did I will not say another word; if you find me guilty you will deprive a wife and three children of a husband and a father; I have heard of persons having things slipped into their pockets - there is no proof that I robbed him; I had my gloves on at the time; I do not mean to say the pocket-book could not have been put into my hat; I might have pulled out my handkerchief, and this little book might have fallen in.</p>
               <p>JURY to SIR THOMAS EDMESLEY CROFT. Q. When you took the hat from him, was there any reluctance on his part to your having it? A. Yes; there was at first - he was holding it close against him with his two hands; when I took hold of his hat he partly quitted his hold of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. If any person wished to pass you, would not you have kept your hat up as closely as possible to let them? A. Yes; I should, but there was no one passing you at that time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there room for any other person to have passed? A. Yes; plenty of room; I swear I saw the book drop from the prisoner's hat.</p>

I came up from Winchester to see my sister, who was ill - the prisoner overtook me between the London Apprentice public-house and the Lying-in-hospital, in Old-street-road - he walked by my side, and a person two or three yards before him dropped a needle-case; I had not noticed that person before - the prisoner took up the case, opened it, and took out a needle and bodkin, and stuck them in his coat, and then took a pin from his coat and put it into the needle case - he then tapped me on the shoulder and said "I will have a joke with him" - he then walked up to the man and said, "My friend, you have dropped something;" he said "It is not of much consequence; it is only a needle-case with a couple of needles in it;" the prisoner then said "You are a saucy fellow, you do not care whether you have it or not I suppose? and I will lay you a quart of beer there is no needle in it;" the man then said,"I will lay you 2l. there are needles in it;" the prisoner said he had not 2l. with him, but if he would wait till he went home, he would go and get 2l.; the person said he could not wait, and the prisoner asked me if I had a sovereign I could lend him, as he could win 20l. of him - I told him I had not a sovereign, nor shilling, nor halfpenny, about me, which I had not - he then asked me if I would pawn my watch to lend him a sovereign - I hesitated a moment, but soon consented to go with him to Mr. Walker's, the pawnbroker, in Tabernacle-row, where I pawned my watch for a sovereign, which I lent him, and the prisoner said he would return me the money as soon as the bet was decided - when we got into the street there were two or three other persons assembled, and the prisoner said to the other man,"I will bet all the money I have, which is 3s., besides the sovereign" - a third person held the stakes, which the prisoner put into his hand, and the case was opened - a pin and a needle were both in it - as soon as the prisoner saw that he ran away, and I pursued him - the two persons near me attempted to hold me, but I got away, and followed the prisoner - the stake-holder was one who tried to stop me - a young man pointed out the way the prisoner had gone, and then a second person assisted in running, and a third person came and caught him as he was attempting to go into a house - I have never seen my sovereign again, nor the man who held it.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. What are you, a shepherd out of place? A. No; I was a gentleman's servant - I lived with a gentleman near Winchester - I served an apprenticeship to a clergyman in Devonshire. who was a farmer - the place where this happened is not a great thoroughfare - the prisoner did not speak to me before the case was dropped - I had not noticed the man who dropped it; I had no share in the bet myself; I did not take the stake-holder, because the prisoner had the money from me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You did not lend him the money to pay you when he could, but to be paid immediately? A. Yes; as soon as he had won the bet.</p>

I have a small garden in the front of my house - I saw the pots safe on the Sunday night; I lost in the whole thirty-six pots, which were taken at three different times. Some were taken between Sunday night and Monday morning; there is a railing round the garden. I saw the plants again at Lambeth-street Office, but they were in flower. I took one as a sample of them - this was on Wednesday; I cannot swear to them now because the blossom is gone. I swore before the Magistrate, when the blossom was on - the pots there produced were those of which I was robbed - I knew them by the sticks, the strings, and the mould. There is one pot here which was never mine in my life.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Look at this desposition - is the signature to it your hand-writing? A. Yes, but I did not understand the paper then. I cannot now say whether these were my pots or not; I did not swear to the pots before the Magistrate; if they have so put it down it is put down wrong - if I marked the pots I cannot swear to the marks, and I never will.</p>

            . I belong to Bow-street, and was in company with Gooding and Robinson. I met Bonwick and Phillips in Baker's-row; when they saw me look at them they turned back, but I apprehended them. Phillips had four pots on his arm - I found a key in his pocket, which he said belonged to his house, in Robert's-place, Green-street, Spitalfields; I went there, and found a young woman - Gooding went up stairs, and there we found three other pots. Phillips' wife said to Hutton,"You got them, Harry, and you know from where;" as we were going to the watch-house he said something about Mutton-lane, which induced us to go there; we saw the prosecutor, who said he had lost fifty pots. Tipper said he could not swear to the plants, but he could to the pots and the sticks, because he cut them with his own knife. After he signed the deposition he marked the pots with his knife, and made two notches on them; he desired the publican, where they were left, to water them. Tipper has since declined to prosecute - when I went to him yesterday they would not open the door, but went up stairs to speak to me.</p>

               <p>COURT to JOHN TIPPER. Q. Were those pots marked by you? A. I marked some pots, but I will not swear to these - any body might have marked them; they were marked in the public-house, and not in the office. At the time I marked them I knew them to be mine. I marked them, because the officers wished me. If I had had the care of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182605110049"/>them ever since I could have taken my oath.

I then showed him some others from a case at the bottom of the shop - he said they were too light, and he would have the other if I would scratch and clean them, and he would give me sixpence for my trouble - while I was doing that I saw him shuffle about, and put his hand to his back. I then went to put the shoes into the window, and missed a pair which I had brought from the case at the bottom of the shop. I seized him, and found them under his coat - he asked me to have something to drink, and said he would treat me with half-a-pint of anything I liked - brandy, rum, or gin; he then went away - I gave an alarm, and he was taken.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner running when I was about twelve yards off; I pursued him, and took him at the corner of Bluegate-fields. The witness said he had taken a pair of shoes, and he had taken them from under his coat. I searched him, but found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He is a false-swearing man - the pair of shoes I had I gave into his hand, and he said he would make an example of me; I gave him the shoes out of the chair; I never wear a coat. The shoes are not worth taking.</p>

The prisoner came to our shop on the 9th of May, about two o'clock, for a pen and a sheet of paper; my master does not make a practice of selling them - she lives in the same street; she asked my mistress to try the pen for her; mistress went into the parlour, to dip it into the ink; I was at the end of the shop, and saw her stoop down while my mistress was in the parlour - I did not see her take anything, but when she was gone my master missed the spectacles.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GREGORY. I am a spectacle-maker. I was in the parlour, and heard a woman come into the shop - she asked for a half-penny worth of paper and a pen. I had left a pair of spectacles on the counter - when the woman was gone I went to see for them, and they were missing. I went to Simmond's, the pawnbroker, and found her in the act of pawning them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was not going to pawn them - I picked them up from the ground - I thought I would use them, as my eyes began to fail me.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GREGORY re-examined. I left them on the counter, and no person had entered the shop but this woman, from the time I left till I missed them - they were wrapped in a bit of paper.</p>

I went there about ten o'clock, and staid till half-past eleven; we went out together; the prisoner stood at the door, and my shopmates went away; when I got about twenty yards the prisoner came to me, and said he would see me home - I thought he was my friend, but I found his hand in my pocket - I took hold of his hand, and called the watchman; the prisoner threw me down, and when I got up I could see nobody - I suppose he was stronger than me - he knocked me down; he hit me about the shoulder somewhere. I fell on my hands and face in the kennel; I lost 27s. from my waistcoat pocket - I had had my hand in my pocket at the public-house - he got away, and I was in search of him for a week.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ask the prisoner's brother whether his name was Dan Sullivan? A. No; his brother did not tell me, "My name is not Dan, but my brother's name in Dan" - upon my oath he did not, and I did not say, "Oh! then it is your brother I want - he is married to a carrotty woman;" I had drank part of a pot of beer at the pay-table, and had been at several other public-houses afterwards, with Carty and Tom Farrel; I did not tell Tom Farrel to be sure and say I was sober. I cannot say how many public-houses I was in.</p>

            . I am beadle. I apprehended the prisoner on the 24th of April - he said at the Thames Police-office that he had bought the hat of a person in East Smithfield; I went with him, and he pointed out Gideon to me, but he denied having sold him this hat, and said he never had such a hat in his possession.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (through on Interpreter). I had a good hat on my head, but it fell down, and they would have it that I stole it.</p>

The other four surrounded me, and struck at me with sticks, but I got him into a cook-shop - he directly laid hold of a knife, and I cut my hand in getting it from him.</p>

I inquired if a seal could be sent to Paris, and the person said they were continually in the habit of sending things to France, and it could go; I was to pay the carriage to Dover - I think I paid about 2s. for it, and then it was booked - it was a small parcel, and I was desired to write upon the outside what it contained; I do not recollect whether I wrote it, or the man wrote it, but I told him what it was, and he said it would prevent its being opened at the Custom-house. I cannot say who the persons were that I saw there the first time - I saw the prisoner at Marlborough-street, but I cannot say whether he was at the steam-packet office. I saw the seal at the Police-office three or four weeks since.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Has your evidence been always this? A. I believe so; I was asked by the Magistrate if the prisoner was at the office at the time this happened, and I said I thought so; I have called at the packet-office two or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182605110057"/>three times since, and have seen him there, but I cannot be positive whether he was there when I left it or not; I cannot recollect whether I saw any person at the office who is now here. I inquired about the seal, and they told me it was very likely detained at the Custom-house - I saw several persons at the office, but I cannot say whether I saw the prisoner there. I do not know whether the Magistrate asked me that question. This is my hand-writing(looking at his deposition) - it was read over to me; I did say I thought the prisoner was one of the persons in the office, and who gave me the answer when I called again; I thought so then, but I have since thought, by my calling to inquire several times afterwards, I might have seen him afterwards, and that was the reason why I thought so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Were there not nine different examinations on this subject? A. I never attended but one. I know that Lancaster, the bookkeeper, who was in the office at the time I left the seal, is now in Clerkenwell prison - I cannot swear whether the prisoner was present at any time. I did not see the seal again till three or four weeks ago, at Marlborough-street.</p>

            , a pawnbroker, at No. 66, Long-acre. I have a gold seal and chain pawned on the 6th of July, 1825, in the name of Charles Abbott, No. 36, Regent-street. In December last the prisoner, I believe, came and said he had lost the original ticket, and we granted him an affidavit - he claimed it as his own property - he was quite a stranger.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it usual for persons who go to pawn things they have stolen, to give their own name and address? A. That is at their own option; we are obliged to ask their names and address. I cannot state that the prisoner pawned the seal, or made the affidavit.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say some person pawned it in the name of Charles Abbott, No. 36, Regent-street, and in December last a person came by the name of Charles Abbott, for the affidavit? A. Yes; but I cannot say whether it was the prisoner - I rather think it was him, but I cannot say. I believe he is the person who pawned the seal, and afterwards came for the affidavit, but I cannot be certain - this is my hand-writing. I believe he is the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This is upwards of nine months? A. Yes. I believe the prisoner is the man who pawned the seal; there is a man named Lancaster, who was tried at the Sessions this time, but I do not know whether he was at the office.</p>

I went into the country to see my friends, seven or eight weeks ago - I left my trunks and drawers quite secure; I was away a fortnight. When I returned I missed some of my things, much more than are mentioned; my box seemed to have been opened with a common key, because I found it locked. The prisoner left while I was away; I sent for an officer, and he went to her lodgings, and found some of my things - among the rest the things named in this indictment - she did not say how she came possessed of them.</p>

            . I went to the prisoner's lodgings. The prosecutrix found some things there, in the apartments of a woman named Griffiths; I asked the prisoner her name, and whether she had a box - she said she had; the first thing I found was a pair of stockings - I also found two caps, which related to other property. I searched further, and found two more pairs of stockings and a skirt.</p>
               <p>MARY KNIGHT re-examined. The prisoner lived as cook at our house - she had been there a fortnight when I left. The property produced is mine. The stockings marked "Husband" were given to me by my mistress.</p>

The prisoner, whom I had known before, came on the morning of the 6th of May, to fetch a rump and loin of beef, and a lamb, which he had bought the night before; I weighed it and booked it to his employer, Miss Tandy; he took it to the back part of the shop, and I saw him carrying it home in two large trays; I saw that he had got more meat than he should have, and I followed him to the next door but one, when I found he had got a leg and loin of mutton.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. How many men were in the shop? A. Four, besides myself - they are not here; I have got the prisoner's place myself now - I have been there three weeks - the prisoner had dealt at that shop, for Miss Tandy, fifteen or sixteen years; it was not I who helped the tray on his head; I believe some man helped it on his shoulder; there are no legs or loins of mutton in that part of the shop, where he put his tray; he did not say any thing - he returned in a quarter of an hour, and took the remainder of the meat he had bought; he was not then detained, because I was so agitated I could not speak to him; I did not want to let him have the lamb, but he said if Mr. Baker wanted him he knew where to find him - another man was a witness at the office - he is not here - the prisoner was found at home when the officer went for him the second time; I expect to have 10s. a week at Miss Tandy's.</p>
               <p>CHARLES BAKER. I keep this shop. When I came from Newgate-market I told the witness not to let the prisoner weigh his own meat, as I had suspected him for some time - the witness was only there for a short time.</p>

            . I am groom to Mr. Nichols, at Brentford. I saw the two prisoners and another young man in the barn where the pump was found, on Thursday, the 2d of March, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning; I said "I know you," and Sheppard replied,"we are at no harm here, Tom."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had they slept there? A. I do not know - when I opened the door, they went out at the back door into Mr. Jones' premises, who is a gardener - they were outside the door when they spoke to me - they then ran.</p>

            . I have lived all my life at Old Brentford. I know the two prisoners very well - we were all together on the night of the 2d of March, and were intoxicated - we went and got Mr. Shackell's pump - we pulled the wood work away with our hands; we took the pump to Mr. Nichols' barn, and left it there, about one o'clock in the morning; we staid there till about half-past eight, when I saw Thomas Vaughan - he asked what we wanted there - we said we had been resting; we then went out. I was taken up on the 24th of April; I had not been away from home - I had seen the prisoners once or twice afterwards, near home, but not oftener.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You never were away from home, did you not think you had done any harm? A. No; I do not know which of us were taken up first. If they are convicted I expect I shall get off; I was never in any Court in my life; I was taken up once, but I did not go before a Magistrate; I cannot recollect when it was - it was within six months; I was taken before a Magistrate of Brentford - it was on suspicion of stealing a rope, but they would not take the young chap's evidence that wanted to swear our lives away; the Magistrate committed me but I was not tried; I was in prison three weeks - I do not know who took the pump up.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SHACKELL re-examined. I have since exchanged the pump for another; I took it from the barn myself - I did not know it would be wanted.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Staines. On the 22d of January I returned home from my beat, and, in consequence of some suspicion, I changed my clothes, and went back to my beat, and saw the prisoner in a yard, with a sack on his shoulder; I asked what he had got - he said a sack of oats he had brought from Mr. Dexter's - I ran to see if any body was up at Dexter's, but they were all in bed; I returned and saw him putting the sack into a cart, and covering it with some hay - he then went away, and I took the oats to Mr. Dexter's, and he said he believed they were Mr. Jones', and grew at Longwood.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose oats did the prisoner say they were? A. Mr. Dexter's; I afterwards went to Mr. Jones', and saw the premises he had lost them from - here is a sample of the oats the prisoner had got.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not you help the prisoner in with the oats? A. No; he did not say he believed they came from Mr. Dexter's. I have known him three or four years; I have never heard anything against him - I believe he gave himself up voluntarily.</p>

In September last I and Mr. Goring bought some oats, which were growing - there were twenty-nine quarters, and we divided them; I had fourteen quarters and a half - I missed some on Sunday, the 22d of January - the constable afterwards brought me a sample which I compared with what I had, and they appeared to be the same sort - I saw the sack, and have not the least doubt but is was mine - I had seen it on Saturday.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many oats did you miss? A. From five to seven quarters at different times; I keep them in a loft over a cart house; I saw them on the Saturday night; they were in bulk - I saw the bulk had decreased about one sack from the Saturday night, and there was a hole where it had been taken from, and the sack which had been placed to keep them from rolling about was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you not a servant of the name of Ben Rush? A. Yes - he went away that evening - I had charged a constable with him, but he got away, and we have not heard of him since; there is a fence six feet high round my premises. The prisoner has been in my house on business from his uncle - I believe he was born at Staines, and I never heard anything against him - his brother came on Sunday morning, and told me if I had any charge against him, he would come and give himself up.</p>
               <p>COURT to JOSEPH GREENER. Q. What time in the morning did you see the prisoner? A. Between five and seven o'clock, about two hundred yards from Mr. Jones'.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you tried to find Ben Rush? A. Yes, but I could not.</p>

            , and some others; I met the prisoner, by appointment, on the 11th of April - I had received from Mitchell, some money, in the presence of my brother James - some of it was shillings, and one of them in particular was marked; I had no other money. The prisoner was to bring some counterfeit money - he brought a sovereign, and said the person had no other coin ready - he asked 7s. for it, which I paid him. Mitchell was waiting with my brother at a distance; I told them what I had done, and they took the prisoner, and found the marked shilling on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you give me a shilling going along, after you paid for the sovereign? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER MITCHELL. I am a surveyor of the Thames Police. On the 8th of April I saw Thomas Fogg at the Black Boy public-house, Wapping - Green was then present. I searched Fogg, and took his money from him; I gave him 7s. 6d., which was not marked. I saw him again on the 11th of April, in company with Green - I then searched Fogg, and gave him 6s. 6d., and one of the shillings I marked with my pen-knife - I followed them to the court, and saw them go into the house - they came out in company with the prisoner, and went to <placeName id="t18260511-158-crimeloc907">Whiterow, Spitalfields</placeName>

I searched Fogg, and found on him a counterfeit sovereign, which he said he had from the prisoner; James Fogg then searched the prisoner, and found on him the shilling which I had marked and given to Fogg.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Tuesday afternoon the prosecutor said he had been robbed of a great deal of property - he said he did not know the numbers of the notes, but I should find a name written over the number, some with pencil and some with ink; I made inquiry, and on the Wednesday I went with him and a brother officer to a house No. 14, Cold-bath-square, kept by Edward Hill; the prisoner came out at the back door, with a little boy, and a large bundle on his head; my brother officer stopped her, and took her into the parlour, but found nothing on her - Hill opened a bureau, and took out this 5l. note, and three sovereigns; I asked the prosecutor if that note was part of his property - he looked and said it was- we found some property which the prisoner had purchased.</p>

I heard the two prisoners come to me on the 21st of April, and ask if I would buy a flock bed and bolster, and two chairs- I asked if my son should go and look at them, but they brought them in about three quarters of an hour - they wanted 10s. for them, but I said I would give them 8s. 6d. for them, which they took - they said the young man they lived with was in trouble, and they wanted to raise money to get him out.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took up the prisoners together, on the day after the robbery - they said they knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Elizabeth Harris put in a written defence, stating that she had lived with the prosecutrix, and paid her share for the furniture - that they quarrelled, and agreed to sell them and divide the money, and accusing the prosecutrix of having been the cause of her seduction, for which she received 13l.</p>
               <p>ELEANOR HARTNELL re-examined. Q. In what service was Harris? A. She was about the street, and I took her in - she did not advance money to buy these goods - I knew her - I have never paid her any wages; I bought the six chairs since I knew her, for which I paid a sovereign; I will swear she did not pay any part of that; I will swear I never received any money from any gentleman for her; I have been imprisoned for robbing a man I met in the street, but I was acquitted - there is a charge against me now for disorderly conduct - I never turned Harris out into the street - she was not in the habit of sharing her money with me - I never had any money of her - I charged her nothing for the lodging - I never saw any of her money - I had known her before, and she said she would come and clean about the place if I would let her be with me - I gave her lodging and board for that - she never had any share in my property.</p>

On the 18th of April, about 4 o'clock, I was going home, and went to get a pint of beer; a person came and said there was a man in Mr. Jefferys'. I went there and saw a number of people - Mrs. Jefferys was trying to unlock the door, but she could not - I asked her to let me break the window and get in, which I did; I went in and found two silk handkerchiefs on the parlour-floor - I went up stairs and found the things scattered on the floor - I searched the house, and saw some soot which had come down one of the chimneys. I took the prisoner down from that chimney, and I delivered him to the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you entered the house, the door was shut, and the window shut down? A. Yes; I was obliged to ask leave to break the window to get in; whether the prisoner got in before the woman and her grand-daughter went out, and secreted himself, I cannot say - the front door was bolted inside, which was the reason Mrs. Jefferys could not get in.</p>

I was at Mr. Jefferys' house on the 18th of April, between four and five o'clock; I went into the bed-room on the first floor, and saw the prisoner along side of the bed, in custody of Fortune - the street-door was opened to me by Mr. Goodwyn; I have brought a box which I found turned up, with a few things at the bottom of it; I found this small chissel in between the sheets of the bed - it seems to fit the marks made on the box which was broken open.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Could this chissel open the door that was locked inside? A. I should think not.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. I was at the prosecutor's house on the 18th of April, and found these skeleton keys, one of which opens the street-door, between the bed and the mattress in the first-floor room; it was then about half-past four or five o'clock; I got in at the window, and opened the door to Mr. Thompson - it was not bolted, it was only on the lock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was not then bolted? A. No; only on the lock; I was examined twice before the Magistrate; the first was a very short examination; I produced these keys then, as I do now - I was not then sworn; the first room I went into was the front parlour - I had not searched the other rooms before I saw the prisoner, he was then in custody of Fortune.</p>
               <p>Mrs. JEFFERYS re-examined. Q. Were there any picklock keys or chissel in that room when you went out? A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you turned the bed over? A. Yes - I do it every day; I turn the bed quite over, but not the mattress; I did not make my bed till late that day, for I had been washing; I never had any char-woman in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182605110065"/>my life; I had been in my bed-room a minute before I went out - my drawers were then shut, but not locked.</p>
               <p>Mr. JEFFERYS re-examined. Q. Did you know of any skeleton keys or chissel being in that room? A. No; the value of this shawl is about 7s.</p>

            . Q. You asked leave to go in at the window? A. Yes; the door was then bolted and locked, but a man named Foulkes unbolted it and let in Mr. Jefferys.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you go? A. Down to the kitchen, after passing through the two parlours, I left Foulkes at the foot of the stairs to see if any body came down; he had not unbolted the door till I came up again.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 20th of April, about ten o'clock in the morning, I was on Holborn-bridge, and saw the two prisoners together, going up Skinner-street, and watching people as they passed. I then missed them, but saw them again in the Old Bailey, where I heard Smith say to Pawsey, "We will go this road" - they went on to Ludgate-hill, and I saw Scott go along on the Bridge-street side; Smith tapped Pawsey on the shoulder, and pointed to him, with the books; he crossed, and spoke to him - Smith followed, and talked to them, till they got to Bridge-street - they then turned down, and were talking for some minutes; Scott seemed loath to part with the bag, but it was put down on the step of a door, and Smith and Scott went on to the corner of Bride-lane - I passed on to see where Pawsey was, and saw Scott coming back, calling out, "Halloo, you have got my books"- I said, "Run on - it is all right;" I then pursued Smith, and took him by the collar as he was going down Bride-lane, in a direction to have met Pawsey again.</p>
               <p>SMITH's Defence. I was going over Blackfriars-bridge, to see for a place, and this boy came and asked if I would go on an errand - I asked if it was far; he said No. The prosecutor put his bag on the steps for this lad to mind. When we got to the top of the street we both forgot the number of the house - he went back, and when he got to the corner he cried out "My books are gone," and I ran to get them - the officer then took me.</p>
               <p>PAWSEY'S Defence. I do not know the other prisoner at all; when the gentleman came to me the lad had got his books on his shoulder, and was going home with them.</p>

On the 18th of April the two prisoners came to the shop together, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, and asked to look at some Irish linen - they looked at some, and I turned to get some more - my back was not turned more than a minute. Vallance then bought two yards of linen; they left the shop, and I missed a piece of printed cotton from the counter; I knew it had been there an hour before, but I thought it might have been removed. I went out, and brought them back - they had got about twenty yards. I brought them into the shop, and Bell dropped this piece of print from her, which I had seen on the counter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BELL. Q. Was there not a shopman at the door, hanging up prints, and some were on the floor? A. No; he was on the steps, hanging up prints, but they were not on the floor.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What size shop is it? A. It is a large shop - and the print was taken from the further end. - There were only two articles near the print, which made me remark it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>HENRY BROWN re-examined. Q. How near were they together when they returned? A. About two yards from each other, but I know it fell from Bell; a neighbour said"Look out," and I saw it fall from her - I had hold of her arm.</p>

On the 17th of April a customer called out that a man had stolen a shawl and ran away; I ran out - the lady pointed out the man, and I cried Stop thief! the prisoner ran up Aldersgate-street, and dropped the shawl; I lost sight of him for not more than a minute, while he turned the corner of Fan-street; I gained sight of him again - he was stopped. I am quite sure he is the person who took the shawl; I saw him as he turned the corner. The shawl was picked up, and given into my hands while I was running - this is it - it is the property of Joseph Thompson. When I came back I missed it from the place where I had seen it about five minutes before.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Then it was done in a moment; and altogether a surprise upon you? A. Yes. I had never seen him before I saw him stand at the door for about a minute; he appeared very much in liquor; Langley was not saying any thing to him; Langley did not appear to be heated; I had not heard any words; I was not far off. I had not been in the public-house; I know it as a watering-house. I saw one person came out (just after the prisoner), who picked up the knife. He could have no spite against me; I had not opened my lips to him, nor he to me.</p>

            . I am the waterman. On the morning of the 9th of March I saw the prisoner, whom I had not seen before to my knowledge - he went into the public-house about one o'clock; I went in at the same time, and had something to drink with him - I came out and left him there - I was not with him above three minutes - I did not see him come out again, but I saw him after he was out, in about half an hour's time - he walked up and down, and appeared vexed - he muttered something to himself - he appeared to be more drunk than when he went in - he walked about up and down about forty minutes; Norris, who had been feeding his horses, then came and spoke to me - the prisoner had bade me good night about five minutes before, and went towards Whitechapel, where he said he lived - he had asked me to direct him which way he must go - he had not got across the street, when he returned, pulled out a knife, and struck at me in the back - he did not say any thing to me then, but he had before said he would have his revenge, but he did not say on whom - the knife went through my coat and waistcoat - he then turned round and struck Norris through the hand - he did not say any thing to him - he appeared to strike at random - he did not offer to run away - I went for the watchman - the prisoner remained behind, and did not offer to run away.</p>
