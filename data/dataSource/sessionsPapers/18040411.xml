             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Briggs; on Tuesday, the 28th of February, the prisoner was sent for pollard, and brought it home between three and four o'clock in the afternoon; there were six quarters, which is twelve sacks; one was shot in the bin, and two set in the sacks, at the end of the bin, in the stable; and the other nine carried into the granary, just across the yard; I saw them unloaded about four o'clock; I cannot say to half an hour; the next morning, when my master and I looked the pollard over, we missed one sack out of the stable; my master was very particular, and made me measure that out of the bin; he had given a strike and a half, or two strikes, to the horses, and the rest was there; then we looked in the granary, to be sure it was not there; and there were nine and no more; about half an hour afterwards, I went to Mr. Howard's, just opposite, across the road, and he shewed me a sack of pollard standing in his house; the sack was marked G. and M. Martin; there are two brothers partners; the sacks were very much marked, and this was marked like them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You knew Mr. Martin? - A. Yes, one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. They supply a great number of farmers in your neighbourhood with pollard? - A. Several farmers deal with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Howard here? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't mean to swear to the pollard? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I know the prisoner; he was carter to Mr. Briggs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever employ him to bring any pollard from Mr. Martin's? - A. Yes; on the 27th of February he came to me, and told me he was going the next day to the mill, for pollard, and asked me if I wanted any; I told him he might bring me one sack of a bettermost sort of pollard, and I gave him 8 s. on the tap-room table, to pay for it; I used to pay 8 s. for it; on the 28th, between five and six in the evening, he brought it; I was at home, but I did not see him bring it; he came to me from the bar, and told me pollard was fell, and returned me one shilling; I gave him sixpence and a pint of beer for his trouble in bringing it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Briggs know that you were employing his carter? - A. I don't know that he did; I had employed him before, and several neighbours round he had brought pollard for besides me; my wife is here, she saw him bring the sack of pollard; Mr. Briggs and Hogsflesh came the next morning, and saw it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. It is not at all unusual for the servant of a neighbour's team, when he goes to the mill, to bring some pollard for the neighbours? - A. Yes, it is a general way.</p>
               <p>Q. And he had brought many times for you from the same mill? - A. Several times; I cannot say how many.</p>
               <p>Q. He made no secret of this? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that the pollard and the sack that Mr. Briggs and Hogsflesh saw? - A. Yes, my husband gave him eight shillings the over night to bring it, and he returned one shilling the next night; we always paid ready money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What time was it when he brought it? - A. It was day-light.</p>
               <p>Q. And you live directly opposite Mr. Briggs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Briggs.) Do you understand the marks of Martin's sacks? - A. They are generally very full of marks with his name, 
and the sack that was found at Howard's was marked in the same way.</p>

               <p>Q. Suppose any of these bales of silk were loose, what would have been his duty then? - A. There was no bale in the waggon but that.</p>


               <p>Q. Supposing that it had been loose, what would have been his duty? - A. To have put it in again, and secured it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your employ with Mr. Willan? - A. My employment is as carman.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it would not have been his duty to have told you any thing about it? - A. He did not tell me any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave him no opportunity of saying why he had taken this property to secure it for his master? - A. He did not make any mention at all about it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are a book-keeper at the Bull and Mouth? - A. Yes; Dowker gave me information, in consequence of which I searched the prisoner, and found, under his top coat, a quantity of silk under his left arm; there was one pound twelve ounces of it; the prisoner did not say a word, I have had the silk ever since, (produces it;) it is part of the contents of a leather bag containing silk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q. Had you an opportunity of seeing the contents of this bag? - A. No, I saw a part of the bag opened.</p>
               <p>Q. That was afterwards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see it before it was put into the waggon? - A. I did not see the bag till it was brought to the Bull and Mouth Inn; the bag had the appearance of having been broke, the end of the bag was drawn as under.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know that silk? - A. Yes, perfectly well; the prisoner came from the Bull and Mouth Inn with a four-wheeled cart, or waggon, to take a pack of silk from my house, which is situated near the church, at the corner of Leadenhall-street; it was put into his charge for the purpose of taking it to the Bull and Mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a part of the silk that was in that pack? - A. I am sure of it; there was a larger deficiency than this, and the next day, upon my writing to Mr. Jefferies, he sent me the remainder, which was found in the privy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. This hank came out at one corner, and I put it under my coat to take it home, that it might be put into the bale again; and before I had time, when I got to the warehouse, they took it from me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are quite sure it was not quite separated? - A. No; it was confined by an iron hold-fast to keep it close to the wall; it was confined by bricks on each side.</p>

               <p>- FRANKS sworn. - On the 3d of March, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I went out at my door, which is almost opposite where Mr. Grey lives: I saw two of Mr. Grey's servants with a lighted candle at the door, looking at a leaden pipe; I went over, and observed the pipe pulled out of one of the joints, with a good many of the hold-fasts pulled out, and likewise from the front door into the area, about seven or eight feet down, and there were a great many of the bricks torn away with it; it was fast at the lower end; it was almost twisted off within an inch. In coming back, I saw the prisoner looking past the end of my house; I went back, and told them to go in with the candle; they did so; I went back again, and saw the man come back in about five minutes; he ran over very quick indeed to the pipe; he took hold of it, and twisted it about half a dozen times; some bricks fell out of the wall, he ran away, and I took him; I was not above three yards off, and he ran towards me; it was as dark as pitch; I knew him to be the same man, because I had at my own door two very large lamps, which made it as light as day; he was very quick for a minute or two; some bricklayers labourers came up before the watchman came up, and then he was threatening to strike them; I delivered him to the watchman.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you reside at Hackney? - A. I own a house at Hackney: On Sunday, the 19th of February, about half after twelve at noon, I was walking in the fields, over what they call <placeName id="t18040411-14-crimeloc81">the Hide, behind Clapton</placeName>

               <p>Q. Look at him? - A. I am very sure he is the man; he passed me upon what is called the Hide, and afterwards came back again; he passed me twice.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore you had an opportunity of observing his person? - A. Certainly; when he passed me I was in what they call Love-lane; the prisoner went down Love-lane; I went very gently along down there; it is a long narrow walk, but about the middle of it there is a sort of elbow that you can neither see the top nor the bottom; when I got to that elbow he popped out upon me, and collared me; he got me fast hold, and asked me for my money.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he laid hold of you by the collar had he any thing in the other hand? - A. He pulled out a long knife, a long carving knife, which he held at my breast; he asked me for my money, and I gave it him in a little leather purse; there was only five shillings and sixpence, and an Indian piece; then he asked me for my watch; I pulled my watch out and gave it him; he then desired I would go: now, says he, you go that way; I did; I could not help looking back, and he said go on; I went on a little farther and looked back again; I found he was gone, and I run after him as fast as I could; I saw at a distance a person coming along, and I called out I am robbed.</p>

               <p>Q. When you see the watch again shall you be able to know it? - A. Yes; there is a seal with S. B. and another seal with three heads upon it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What are you? - A. A shoemaker.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - A. In Cold-bath lane, Church-street, Hackney: I heard the prosecutor call out, either I am robbed, or he has robbed me, pointing with his stick, but I could not see to whom he was pointing it; I instantly turned round, and met the prisoner running.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he point his stick in a direction which led to the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. And in consequence of that you saw the prisoner running? - A. Yes, I ran after him, and he was out of my sight about a minute, or a minute and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the same man who got into your sight again afterwards? - A. Yes, I pursued him; the prisoner turned round and looked at me; I still kept running after him, and he was out of my sight again; when I got into Clapton I got information of the prisoner, and ran into Pound-lane; I saw him run across the field to the right, and I pursued him; he then wheeled to the left, and ran into Clapton again; then he took a tack to the left as if he was coming to Hackney; I called out stop thief, and he jumped over some low paling to the left.</p>

               <p>Q. Before he jumped over, did you observe him do any thing? - A. No, he then ran across the field to some high paling, and then I saw him stoop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe him do any thing? - A. I cannot say I did; he stooped as if he was laying something upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he stoop at that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been running all the time you have been describing? - A. Yes; he then rose up again and got over the high paling; I got over the paling, and saw a young man of the name of Thurling had got hold of the prisoner; he heard me call out stop thief; he was then taken to Hackney-cage, and searched; there was none of the property found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you afterwards present when any of the property was found? - A. Yes; I went up to the high paling where I saw the prisoner stoop, I looked down and saw the watch lying there; I took the watch up, and found a little leather bag underneath where the watch laid; I took the property to Mr. Brown, in Hackney-grove, and he identified it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. (To Brown). Was that watch and the leather bag which the witness brought to your house, the same that the prisoner had robbed you of? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had shown it to Brown what did you do with it? - A. I carried it home; I took it to Worship-street the next day; it was sealed up and delivered to me. (Produces the property).</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Brown). Is that your watch? - A. Yes, I am sure it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that bag? - A. This is what I gave him; the seals are my seals.</p>

               <p>Q. What happened to your house? - A. On the 29th of March, between seven and eight o'clock, I was going out to a neighbour's house; I was in Whitcomb-court; I observed the prisoner in a corner that leads to my kitchen; there is a window in the court that lets light into the kitchen; there are wooden bars outside the window, and glass inside; I went up to the prisoner, and asked him what he was doing there; he said he was doing nothing; I said you must be doing something there, and then he struck me, I then laid hold of him, and another jumped out of the window at the same time, and I took hold of him, and then they both struck me; I had hold of them both at the same time; the man that came out of the window ran away, I then took the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say about the saucepan? - A. When I first came up to the prisoner, I asked him what he was doing, and he dropped the saucepan; he had one, and was in the act of taking out the second; he dropped them both; they are here.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know yourself what part of the house they were in? - A. They were upon the dresser in the kitchen after being cleaned; I had seen them there at five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. It was pretty light then? - A. No, it was growing dusk; I could see him very distinctly.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw the other man again? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a window is it, does it shove up? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a slider? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it made to open? - A. There is a bolt inside; they broke the glass to push back the bolt; the wooden bars were broke and taken away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never had the property; he struck me first.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not strike him, he struck me.</p>
               <p>- GARDINER sworn. - Q. You are an officer? - A. Yes; I was coming up St. Martin's-lane, I saw a mob, and knowing the prisoner, I searched him, and found nothing upon him; I then went to the house, and found that a window had been broke; it was a casement window, one of the small squares had been broke to push back the bolt.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the saucepans? - A. Yes, the prosecutor delivered them to me. (Produces them).</p>
               <p>Court. (To the prosecutor). Q. Look at the saucepans? - A. They are both mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I know nothing about the saucepans. I was coming through Whitcomb-court: I heard a piece of work about some kettles, and I was curious enough to stop and look, and the prosecutor struck me, and I struck him again, and then he gave charge of me; I never was in his house, nor did not know any thing of the property.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you attend the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it this happened? - A. On Saturday, the 10th of March; about half after one o'clock, the prisoner, Fisher, came into the shop, with another woman, to look at some ribbons; the prisoner, Matthews, I never saw till I saw her before the Magistrate; the other woman made her escape; Fisher asked to look at some ribbons; I took out the drawer, and placed it upon the counter; she turned over the ribbons several times in the drawer; there were none there that would please her, and I took some out of the window; she made choice of one, it was scarlet, with chocolate in the middle; the other person was difficult, and did not make choice of any; Fisher asked for a yard and a half of the one that she made choice of, and the person that was with her paid for it; they each offered me a seven-shilling piece for change; I took the seven-shilling piece from the other woman, whom she called Nance; I gave her six good shillings in change; she hesitated about the change being good, and I told her I had looked at it before I gave it her, and was sure it was all good, and I would not change them; a Mrs. Kemp then came in, whom I knew, for half an ounce of pins; she said to Fisher, that she believed the silver to be better than them; I asked her her reason for saying so; she said, they were shop-lifters.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they present? - A. Yes, they were; they went away immediately as quick as possible.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the ribbon come to? - A. A shilling; the woman that was called Nance sat upon a low seat in the shop; she pretended to have a very bad cough, and hid all her face entirely; she had a large cloak on, and she had either her gown or her cloak over her face at times; Fisher stood close by her; I did not see her drop any thing, but she certainly had the means of dropping them into her lap out of the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the shop at the time? - A. My servant,

               <p>Q. You did not see any thing go yourself? - A. No; I immediately missed a piece of plain white ribbon from the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that was in the drawer when you produced it? - A. Yes, I saw it afterwards at the Magistrates, between seven and eight in the evening; the prisoner, Fisher, was then in custody; I missed a piece of figured ribbon at the same time, from the same drawer, which I saw again at the Magistrates the same evening with some others; I lost five pieces in all, I saw four of them at the Magistrates; I knew them to be mine, two of them had my shop mark upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Matthews in custody at the same time with Fisher? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Fisher before? - A. I don't think I ever did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure she is one of the two women that was in your shop? - A. Yes, they might be in the shop altogether about twenty minutes; I went in search of her with an officer, and found her in custody; I was not at the apprehension of either of the women.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. A great many persons were in the shop during the time they were there? - A. There was my servant and Miss Bromet.</p>

               <p>Q. Is Miss Bromet here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You yourself did not see any thing taken? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to follow them? - A. I had business at Ratcliff-cross, and I went in for the parcels I had to carry there; I told Mrs.

               <p>Mrs. Kay. These pieces have my shop-mark upon them; I have sold some small quantity: I had a pattern of one of the others before the Magistrate, but I have not brought it here; the other piece I cut in a hurry, and put a blanket pin into it by accident, which is a very uncommon thing; it has a blanket pin in it now; this is the ribbon that I sold them for a shilling.

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Do you mean to say you lost this table-cloth and the sheets on the 24th of February? - A. I suppose so, I had not seen them for some time.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you ever marked the same names at the back of Bank-notes before? - A. Not to my knowledge; I marked these on suspicion.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. Q. You are the wife of the last witness? - A. I am; I saw my husband write upon the notes; the last time I saw the notes in the drawer was on the 24th of February, near five o'clock; they were then safe in the drawer, and I left them under lock and key; my husband missed them on the 25th in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing else? - A. I did not miss them till I saw them, and knew them to be my own; the officer brought me a table-cloth, a pair of sheets, and a white apron,</p>
               <p>Q. How long before that time did you see them in your house? - A. I cannot exactly say, because they were in a drawer in my own bed room; I saw two of the notes which had been lost in the parlour, when I saw the linen.</p>

               <p>Q. What else passed between you and him? - A.

               <p>Q. When was it? - A. On the 10th or 11th of February last.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what you did in pursuit of the prisoner? - A. I first went to Bristol, by the direction of Messrs. Robarts's house; I made enquiry there, but I did not find the prisoner; I then went to the Post-office, and in consequence of the information I obtained, I went from there to Andover; I got some information, and from thence I went to Basingstoke.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get any information of the prisoner there? - A. Yes, I went back to Whitchurch, and from thence to Market Hilsley, between Newbury and Oxford.</p>
               <p>Q. At Market Hilsley, did you come up with the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find him? - A. In the Oxford coach, going to Oxford; I addressed him by his name, Hansard; he said his name was Hansard; I told him I wanted him, he must come out of the coach; he seemed very much surprised, but got out of the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this? - A. On Wednesday, the 15th of February; I took him into the public-house where the coach was standing; I asked him for his money; he asked me at what suit I apprehended him, I told him it was for forgery; I asked him for his money, he pulled out a purse with upwards of 40 l. in gold; I asked him for the remainder. After some hesitation he told me he had left 420 l. with a friend in Coventry-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention that friend's name? - A. Not at that time; I believe he did afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether he did or not? - A. I believe he did, and 2001. he had sent in his saddle bags from Whitchurch the night before, directed to a friend in Eastcheap, and a letter at the same time, desiring that friend might send it to Messrs. Robarts the bankers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at all say what the money was composed of that he sent, whether notes or money, or what? - A. I cannot charge my memory; he said he had no doubt they had received it before the time of my apprehending him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any thing from him? - A. I took upwards of 40 guineas in gold from him, and a pocket-book, in which there was some writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you looked at the writing at all (produces<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110020"/>it); Does it contain any thing relative to this? - A. I believe it does. (It is read).</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did you look into the pocket-book immediately after you had apprehended him? - A. No; it was two or three days afterwards; it has never been out of my possession.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Is it exactly in the same state in which you took it from him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing else to you? - A. I do not recollect any thing more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he express any astonishment at being found? - A. He was very much surprised; he said, from what had happened, his friend having sent back the 420 l. and the 200 l. having been sent to the bankers; he did not suppose they would have troubled their heads in sending after him.</p>

On Wednesday, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, the 14th of March last, I went to a friend at the Prince of Wales's Feathers, in Exeter-street; his name is Winter, and was to purchase a horse and a cart for me; I went to pay one Dunn, a baker, for the horse and cart; he was there, and the prisoner at the bar; we all drank and eat together; I have known the prisoner for some time, but not by name.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you occasion to pay for the horse and cart? - A. I pulled out of my pocket-book, and gave to the said

             a 10 l. note to give to Mr. Dunn, the baker; I do not understand notes, being no scholar: I see Winter give Dunn the 10 l. note for the horse and cart as part of payment; the prisoner was in the tap-room at the time Dunn, the baker, and Winter went away as soon as the victuals were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this? - A. I found it was between the hours of eleven and twelve. After Dunn and Winter were gone, the prisoner continued in my company.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you drinking together? - A. I cannot recollect that; we drank after they were gone, if we did, it was only a pint or two; I had drank gin in the morning, I think three glasses; I did not drink beer till after I had my victuals, and then I drank very near a pot to my own share.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say how long you had continued in company with the prisoner after Dunn and Winter were gone? - A. Very near three quarters of an hour; we sat talking; he says to me, if I was in your place, Mr. Dunn, I would go and look after my property, the horse and cart I had bought; I said, where is the use of my going, when I have given the man liberty to work the horse and cart till Saturday, that was part of the bargain; he said I would have you go, for fear the horse and cart should be sold again; with great persuasion I went, and he went with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it when you left this public-house? - A. Near one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you feel yourself at that time with respect to your sobriety? - A. Quite sober.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell the Justice that you felt yourself in liquor? - A. I did not, I had been drinking a little gin in the morning, and after that I had some victuals, and the porter does not hurt me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say the Justice mistook you; after you went from the public-house, what state were you in? - A. I was quite sober; I and the prisoner went down to the King's Arms, in Soho-square; as we went along we called upon one Dunn, a Police-officer; the prisoner asked him if it was not right that I should go and get a receipt for the 10 l.; then we all three went together to the King's Arms to get a receipt from Dunn, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110021"/>baker, for the 10 l.; he lived opposite: I had to pay 1 l. 6 d. the remainder of the money; I took out my pocket-book, on purpose to give Dunn, the Police-officer, a 1 l. note to pay Dunn, the baker, I had another 1 l. note besides in the corner of the pocket-book; I did not know what money I had when I went out; I had a 5 l. note; I afterwards found, when Dunn returned the pocket-book to me, a 5 l. note and a 1 l. note too; I did not know it was a 5 l. note; I am no scholar.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that you gave it to Dunn? - A. Yes, the 5 l. note and the 1 l. note too; I put them in my pocket-book, and put it in my coat-pocket; the prisoner was with me all the time; we staid at the King's Arms the best part of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you had some more liquor there? - A. Yes, because we joined the company of Dunn, the baker.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you say you were perfectly sober when you left the King's Arms? - A. Not quite, but as sensible as I am now,</p>
               <p>Q. When you left that house, who was with you? - A. The prisoner, and Dunn the officer; we walked together from Soho-square till we came to the Cadogan Arms; Dunn, the officer, parted from me just by York-street; and the prisoner promised Dunn to see me home.</p>
               <p>Q. What occasion had he to see you home? - A. On account of my limbs being so bad; I am very feeble.</p>
               <p>Q. No other cause? - A. No, I was supported by the prisoner, till I desired to lean against a wall.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be resting that way? - A. About two minutes; he stood at the right-hand side of me, and I felt his hand in my pocket; then I said to him halloa, what are you doing; as soon as I had spoke that, he took to his heels, and run round the corner of York-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that you felt with your hand his hands at your pocket? - A. Yes, my pocket was turned inside out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you immediately miss your pocketbook? - A. Yes; I immediately called out stop thief; there came several neighbours round me, and asked me what was the matter, I told them I had been robbed; they asked me if I knew him; I said I knew him very well, but I did not know his name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your pocket-book again? - A. Yes, it might be about two or three minutes after, that a man that lives in York-street, picked it up close by me, and gave it me; he is a newsmonger.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him open your pocket-book? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to examine it then? - A. I did not then; when I came to Winter's house I examined it directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say, that what you call a 5 l. note was taken out of the pocket-book? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that you had the prisoner taken up? - A. On the Saturday following; I left that to Mr. Dunn, the patrol, who understood the business better than I did; I informed Mr. Dunn of it on Friday.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you not to inform him of it sooner? - A. I went to the Prince of Wales's Feathers, there I saw the prisoner; I did not go nigh him, but sat at the other side of the tap-room, I said nothing to him about it then; he owned to other people on Thursday in the tap-room.</p>

               <p>Q. You have none of these people here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take him up? - A. On Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present, and what did he say? - A. He said he was willing to go.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing found upon him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean about your pocket-book laying by where you were standing? - A. Very likely he might have dropped it there.</p>
               <p>Q. How could he possibly open your pocketbook and take your note out; you told us he was running away? - A. I cannot say whether he might have took it out before; I am not clear in that, and was trying to put it in.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you do not know your note again? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. In what state was the prosecutor in at that time with respect to sobriety? - A. In appearance he was fit for any sort of work; I thought he was sober; I went with him and the prisoner to the King's Arms, there I saw Dunn, the baker; I said to him, I am authorised by this man to say to you, if you will be good enough to take the remainder of the money, and let the man have the horse and cart; he said the difference between him and Dunn was, that he was to work the horse and cart till Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of the conversation, did Dunn take out his pocket-book? - A. Yes, he gave me two notes, one a 5 l. note, and the other a 1 l. note: As Dunn, the baker, would not take the remainder of the money, I gave it him again; I said, take notice what money you gave me; I saw him put it in his pocket-book, and I saw him put his pocket-book in his right-hand pocket; we staid at the King's Arms about half an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110022"/>hour, or a little more; Dunn, the baker, went away, the prisoner and I went with him; he is quite a cripple; he cannot walk above forty yards without sitting down; he was supported by me and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be sober when he quitted the King's Arms? - A. As sober as he is now; I walked with him about half a mile; I left them together; I said, Mr. Dunn, I must leave you because of my duty; the prisoner said he would take care of him and see him home.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you saw Dunn the prosecutor again? - A. Not till Thursday night; I saw the prisoner again on Friday.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was this? - A. At the great gate that leads into the yard; I went up immediately to Mr. Hargrave's, and told him there was certainly somebody in the warehouse; he told me to call his men up; I went, and called the men up; they got up, and they all came down stairs together; Mr. Hargrave came down stairs, and unlocked the warehouse-door; we went into the warehouse, there were the two prisoners standing by the window; they had the sash up, if possible to 
make their escape out, but they could not; then the ostler secured one of them, and the other man belonging to Mr. Hargrave pricked the tall one, his name is Barnett, on the left shoulder; he begged for his life; he said, behave like gentlemen to us, and we will surrender as prisoners; accordingly they did; we bound their arms behind them, and brought them to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. How did he behave himself? - A. He behaved himself very well; I had suspicions he was not an honest man.</p>
               <p>- SEARLE sworn. - I am a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say? - A. He begged that his master would not discharge him, and that he would forgive him.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Fuller.) What is the value of those cuttings? - A. Eight shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. These tea-pot spouts I had to strike, he would not suffer them to be cut up stairs for fear of knocking the cieling down, because it was very heavy work: I had to take them down stairs, with four dies, and a crooked pair of shears, in all it was three quarters of an hundred-weight; after I had cut them, I had to enter them in the accompting-house; it was my practise to put the cuttings in my waistcoat-pocket, the dies and shears in my arms, to go up stairs; then my master said I had something about me that was his property; had he given me two minutes longer they would have been out of my pocket; I never took a penny-weight of silver out of his house, nor did I mean it at that time; I have a wife pregnant, and two children.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He said he took these two tea-pot spouts down to strike; he did not, they were struck by another man.</p>

I went with the seven-shilling piece to get a shilling to give the prisoner; then I told Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones followed her, I went after him, and lifted up her great coat, and saw something under her gown; we took her back, and sent for an officer.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you give the alarm immediately? - A. Not immediately; I went to the top of Chandos-street, then I returned up St. Martin's-lane; I always suspected the character of Richardson.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you stand from them when you saw them trying to lift up the sash? - A. About four doors from them; they were first one and then the other endeavouring to lift up the sash; I shifted my ground, and went facing the shop, and there I saw two of them trying; I am not certain of Clements, but I am certain of Richardson; I went into Mr. Allen's, the last and patten-maker, and gave the alarm; Mr. Allen went to Mr. Wheeler's, and Mr. Wheeler's wife told him the window was broke open, and the property was gone.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any knowledge of them at the time? - A. Yes, of Richardson; Clements followed me as far as St. Martin's church; I returned back in the course of twenty minutes, and heard of the robbery; I went to the prisoners, knowing Richardson to be a suspicious character; I took both of them.</p>

The locks of the drawers and the boxes were all broken; I missed a few pieces of coin that I had since I was about ten or eleven years of age, a crown-piece, a half crown, that was a medal of the late King of France; the money was taken from a drawer in this purse, (shews the purse;) up stairs some of it, and the other in a little box.</p>

               <p>Q. They must be worth more than fourteen shillings? - A. I believe they are.</p>
               <p>Q. The next article is your gown, do you know that? - A. Yes, it is a new one almost, it cost me twenty-three shillings, I have had it about eleven months.</p>
               <p>Q. It must be worth more than ten shillings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a shirt, is that worth five shillings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There is child's cloak, do you know it? - A. Yes, I value that at five shillings, and the waistcoat is an old one, I have valued that at three shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Goodall.) These are all the articles found in the bundle? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where are the keys? - A. (Goodall produces the keys and an iron crow.) They are all skeleton-keys; I let Mrs. Paterson in the next day with one of these keys. The crow fitted the mark on the drawers, and it looked as if they had been forced by that.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the sword? - (The sword produced by Goodall, and shewn to Mrs. Paterson.)</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of such a sword? - A. Yes, it is Mr. Paterson's.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went away, did you leave a canary bird? - A. Yes, it was missing when I went there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the cage gone, or only the bird? - A. Only the bird.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a myrtle in the house, where was that? - A. On the first pair of stairs in a little room backwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you yourself observe whether any thing had been stripped off? - A. Yes. (The myrtle produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any sprig that had been stripped off? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to correspond with what had been stripped off? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110032"/>Court. You may compare it, but I suppose it is too dry now.</p>
               <p>(The sprig of myrtle was placed where it had been stripped off.)</p>
               <p>Wilson. It exactly fitted the joint on placing it to the myrtle, I am confident, when it was fresh; it was kept in water till on the second examination, it fitted then, and was in appearance quite fresh.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mrs. Paterson.) Is that your half handkerchief? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner live? - A. In Islington-Road, with his mother, in one room.</p>
               <p>- HANCOCK sworn. - I am a constable of the Public-Office, Hatton-Garden: the prisoner lived with his mother: on the 23d of February, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I found these articles I now produce tied up in a handkerchief, as they are now, excepting two articles that I found in a chest. (The articles produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. What are these things? - A. A night-cap, a pair of cotton mitts, one silk sash, two cards of black trimming, two cards of white, sixteen pair of garters, cotton and worsted, fourteen dozen of cotton laces, and three pair of cotton gloves, these were in her room; I met her coming out of the house; she said she was going to buy a penny candle; I went into the butcher's shop and borrowed a candle, and when we came up stairs there was a candle burning in the room at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who knows any thing of these things that the prisoner delivered up himself?</p>
               <p>Mackworth. A. These papers were delivered in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110033"/>my presence, which now contains my mark, and the other paper of purse contains a ticket, the hand-writing of which I am well acquainted with; it was a warehouseman that lived with us, but has left the warehouse for some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Can Mr. Dawson speak to the purse? - (Mr. Dawson looks at them.) A. I believe them to be of my manufactory, and as to the garters and laces I know them by passing through my hands at several times, and these articles, and what was delivered up by the prisoner in the parlour, I believe to be of my manufactory.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, which was read as follows: Being totally unable to have Counsel, we most humbly beg leave to state our unhappy case before this Honourable Court, not doubting but we shall have every mercy shewn us; I am in the 57th year of my age, have lost the use of my right arm, am in bad health, and very poor. My poor son is in the 24th year of his age, and very often troubled with deranged senses; he has had articles from his master to take out, and has had different articles to those he had to deliver, supposed to have been put up by mistake of his master or Mr. Mackworth, which articles have always been faithfully brought back.

               <p>Q. (To Mackworth.) Had you delivered them to him to carry any where? - A. I never delivered to him on that day any thing of the sort.</p>

Six pounds a year; I gave her five or six shillings, or a guinea at a time; she had her wages just as she wanted it; she was paid every halfpenny, and thirty shillings more than was due to her when she went away; I told her at Marlborough-street, if she would acknowledge it I would forgive her, but she was impertinent, and the gentleman forced me to prosecute.</p>

             sworn. - The prisoner Flaherty brought me some pieces of calico to sell; she asked eighteen-pence for them; she dropped this piece of sleeve of a child's frock on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Brosnell). Is that the sleeve of your child's frock? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the other prisoner? - A. No, only finding her in bed with Flaherty, when I had her taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not heard any thing of your gowns? - No.</p>
               <p>- I am a constable; I took the two women;

               <p>Prisoner Flaherty's defence. I was coming home from my hard day's labour, I met with Ms. Langford; she asked me if my landlady bought things; she said she had lost a bed and a bolster; I had bought a rump bone, I went for a peck of coals; when I came back again, my landlady said where is the woman that was speaking to you; I told her she was gone home for what I knew; with that she told me I should not light the fire till I told her where the woman was gone; she took me to Bow-street, the Magistrate said, he wondered she had the impudence of coming there, as she had been convicted of buying stolen goods, and was six months in prison for it; my landlady came in the morning and caught us both in bed; she then said I will take a book-oath, I will not hurt you if you will satisfy me for what money I have spent; she went to all the linen-drapers to see if the calico belonged to any of them; I bought it at Rag-fair; you can buy pieces of calico in Rag-fair, of three yards for sixpence; she charged me with the calico belonging to a Gentleman in Holborn; I insisted on letting the Gentleman see the calico; they said she was a wicked woman, and fairly forced her out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Langford's defence. As I was going down Drury-lane, I met Mrs. Flaherty, I told her I had been robbed of my bed and bolster; she told me to go to the pawnbrokers, and her landlady bought such things; you can enquire if she has such things to sell; she told me to stop at the door till she carried the rump-bone up stairs; when she came down, she said, I will not go in now; I do not think any body is at home; we went into a public-house and had a pint of beer, and I never saw Mrs. Flaherty till past eleven o'clock at night; I was in bed, and when she came to me she said, my landlady says she will put me in the watch-house; in the morning, this woman came to me, and seized us both in bed; she said, I am very glad I have found you here; very well, said I, if you think I have got any thing, you are very welcome to search; she found nothing; no gowns, nor patchwork, nor pieces, I ever saw.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going up to my aunt in Long-acre; as I was going past this woman's house, I met a woman with a bundle, and she asked me if I would help her to carry it; I said, yes; I found they were wet, and asked her what she was going to do with them; she said she was going to take them to dry and iron; then I was stopped, and asked what I had got; I told them it was no business of theirs; they took hold of each of my arms; the woman walked on, and they brought me back; I heard that gentlewoman say that she had transported one man, and she would hang me if she could; then she took me to Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Kerrison. When she brought this property back, she threw it down at my landlady's door, and said, I know you will hang me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

            , jun. sworn. - I am the son of the other witness: On Shrove-Tuesday, my father sent me with a pair of pantaloons to Ironmonger-lane; I set out from Bateman's-buildings with them between two and three o'clock; the prisoner at the bar met me just beyond Clare-market; I had them in a silk handkerchief; he asked me what trade I was; I told him, a tailor; he said, so was he, I did not know him before. He asked me where I was going; I told him, to Ironmonger-lane; he told me he was going to Mr. Payne's a tailor, in Bream's-buildings, Chancery-lane; he told me that he lived with Mr. Payne, as an apprentice, and he had run away, because he had not used him well, and he had left his things there, and when I got to Bream's-buildings, he shewed me the house, and Payne was on a brass plate on the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to Bream's-buildings - was it in your way to Ironmonger-lane? - A. It was the nearest way; he said he would not mind giving any body a shilling to knock at the door, because he wanted to see the maid, but did not want to see his master, as they had had a fall out; he asked me to knock at the door, and told me to put my bundle under my coat, for fear they should think it was something coming to Mr. Payne, because he was a tailor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put your bundle under your coat? - A. Yes: then he said, you had better give it to this boy; I had met a boy at the top of <placeName id="t18040411-42-crimeloc243">Bream's-buildings</placeName>

He said to the boy, Jack, how is your mistress? there was a woman just gone into Mr. Payne's, the door was not shut; the prisoner took hold of the bundle; I saw the door going to shut, I run up, and knocked at the door, and told the maid; he run off immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the boy? - A. He was almost a man; he ran with him up Bream's-buildings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pursue them? - A. Yes, I gave an alarm, but I never saw him again that day: On Saturday three weeks, as I was going to Mr. Mills's, the scowerer, he crossed the way, and went into Crown-court; I then went up to him, and caught him by the coat, and asked him where my bundle was; he told me that he would put me in the watch-house if I said so again.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not say what bundle, did he? - A. No; he said, you come there to my uncle's, there it is; he pointed to some house in the court, and said, there it is, and when I came there, he said it was only a little further. He got me on so till he came to Leicester-fields; I said, where does your uncle live; he said, in Sloane-street, down here; I caught hold of his coat, and said he should go no farther; then he knocked me down; a gentleman came up, and he ran down there by Orange-street; I got up, and ran after him, and he was caught just by the King's Mews.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given any alarm? - A. Yes; and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110037"/>the gentleman that saw him knock me down, ran after him, and caught him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the prisoner is the person who knocked you down? - A. I am sure he is.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Had you ever seen this lad before? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear positively to his person? - A. Yes, I am sure the prisoner is the person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never saw that boy before in my life till this day he happened to meet me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you know of this transaction? - A. Upon the 16th, the day before the transaction, I lent Pobjoy two pounds; he was a customer of mine for two months before that, he lives in the same street; I told him, when I lent it to him, I should want it the next day: On the 17th he brought it back - the two pounds; I believe it was between ten and eleven o'clock of the day; I had given him an order for a suit of cloaths; he brought them home the same day - the coat and waistcoat. He brought me the two pounds an hour before he brought the clothes - it was a one-pound note and a guinea he brought me; I wrapped up the one-pound note, and put it in my right-hand waistcoat pocket. When he brought the clothes home, I was going to try them on in the bar; he said, as they were acquaintances of mine and his in the parlour, he thought I had better put them on in the parlour, as they might see how they fitted. I went into the parlour, and pulled my coat off, and laid it on one chair, and my waistcoat on another; one was about a yard and a half distance from the other, as near as possible. I observed the one-pound note and the guinea was in my pocket when I laid it down; when I was fitting them on, I turned, and said to him, do not be a thief, not suspecting any thing of that kind, I went on putting my clothes on.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had said do not be a thief, had you any suspicion? - A. No, I spoke it as a joke; I have seen him take an handkerchief out of my pocket, and he has given it to me again; I do not know why I made use of that expression, only from seeing his hand at my waistcoat; I said it as a joke, I did not suspect being robbed at that time. After I had fitted the clothes on, I took off the new ones, and put on the old ones again; I did not feel in the pockets immediately. Soon after, I had to go out of the room to give Mr. Chartery ten pounds; he wanted me to lend him that sum; he was in the room at that time; I went to my wife, and said, if you have eight pounds, I have two pounds; I went to feel for it, and it was gone; I then felt in every pocket I had. Chartery called me on one side, then I suspected Pobjoy, and I directly went to his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner near the waistcoat? - A. I saw his hand at the waistcoat, I had no suspicion at the time; I only suspected that he had took something out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to look immediately? - A. I could not suspect a tradesman in the neighbourhood; I know that I had that money in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. You never looked nor searched while he was present? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Strange conduct - did you find it afterwards? - A. No, I never found it afterwards; I accused Pobjoy of it afterwards, and he appeared to be a little agitated, as if some guilt was on him; that might be imagination; he said he knew nothing at all about it after some little agitation; it might be a minute or two.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You never were charged with any felony? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him? - A. About three or four months.</p>
               <p>Q. He uses your house? - A. Yes, he has a club in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose there was nobody there but Mr. Chartery? - A. Yes, there was a Mr. Curtis and a Mr. Harris.</p>
               <p>Q. And they had the same opportunity of seeing, as you had? - A. I do not know that they had; one was reading the newspaper, and the other was looking over his shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, do not be a thief? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. It is no joke in your license in your house, to say, do not be a thief? - A. There is no such thing in the license.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Chartery did not shake the coat, and take it up? - A. He did take hold of the coat, and shake it.</p>
               <p>Q. He never touched the waistcoat? - A. He never did; nobody touched the waistcoat but Mr. Pobjoy.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to separate the waistcoat and coat? - A. I laid the coat down on one chair, and the waistcoat on another.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he seemed to be very much agitated? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take him up? - A. I did not take him up at all; I was at Guildhall; I believe Alderman Boydell was the sitting Magistrate that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110038"/>day, and while the warrant was making out, Pobjoy came and surrendered himself, and said, there was no occasion for taking out a warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Pobjoy, at the Justice-room in the City, came and said, he would surrender where he expected to find you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of it then? - A. The Alderman said that the evidence did not go to commit him, but he must find two bails sufficient.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the story before the Alderman, the same as you have to-day? - A. Yes, word for word.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What did the Alderman say? - A. He said there was no evidence for him to commit; he recommended me to advertise the note.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. How long did he stay in the house after you had said, do not be a thief? - A. About three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink together? - A. We did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you drink, for God's sake, together? - A. We had, I believe, a bottle and a pint of mulled wine between four of us.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had called that man a thief? - A. No, before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not drink together after that? - A. We finished the remainder of the bottle; we had nothing more in; Mr. Curtis and Mr. Harrison was not there all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. You sat down together check by joul, and drank together very comfortable? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner after that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say, if you could get the notes, you would say no more about it? - A. I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you never say that if you could get the notes, you would say no more about it? - A. Upon my oath I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. He desired you to go into the parlour, did you ever accuse him of having robbed you? - A. I accused him of having robbed me in the warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, in the room where Curtis and Harrison were, in that room did you ever charge him of having robbed you? - A. No, not in that room.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. There were persons present - you were staying three quarters of an hour together; the question is in the presence of those persons there - did you ever say that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were before the Magistrate, the Magistrate said there was no evidence to commit him? - A. He did not commit him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not shuffle with me? - A. Mr. Smith gave him a good character, and he said he would not commit him; he advised me to advertise the note.</p>
               <p>- CHARTERY sworn. - I am a victualler: I live in Water-street, in the Strand; I was present when Mr. Pobjoy came to Mr. Fulcher's house; I saw him take a piece of paper out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Fulcher see that? - A. I do not know whether he saw that, or no; Mr. Fulcher saw his hand at his waistcoat pocket, and turned round, and said, do not be a thief; Mr. Pobjoy put his hand behind him, and put the paper in his great coat pocket, and when Mr. Fulcher missed the money, Mr. Pobjoy was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to Mr. Fulcher? - A. I did not say any thing then, I did not think it was money; Mr. Pobjoy went away then.</p>
               <p>Q. Immediately? - A. Very soon afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon? - A. He stopped a few minutes, and then he went away out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you remain in the house? - A. About an hour, or an hour and a half, after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if Pobjoy staid an hour and a half you must have known it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had staid an hour you must have known it? - A. I was not out of the house the whole time.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had staid half an hour you must have known it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he did not stop half an hour after that? - A. He went away a very few minutes afterwards, that I am sure of.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before the loss was found out? - A. Very little time after Mr. Pobjoy was gone, it might be half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you think it very strange, that a tradesman and a neighbour should commit a felony of this kind? - A. I did not know it was a felony.</p>
               <p>Q. You were all upon good terms? - A. I never heard them quarrel.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. It was a mere accidental visit of your's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go there for the purpose of borrowing ten pounds? - A. Yes, I did; there was ten pounds between us, and I went for it.</p>
               <p>Q. How was that? - A. There was a difference between us of ten pounds.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Upon your oath, what purpose did you go there, to get ten pounds - did you go there to borrow ten pounds? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any account between you? - A. There was; I cannot exactly tell what it was, some little scores.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by telling me that there were ten pounds between you? - A. I cannot say that there were ten pounds between us then.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he in your debt? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, is there any thing between you? - A. Yes; I owe him, it may be, near two pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you go to borrow ten pounds - what did you borrow that day? - A. Ten pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you owe him at that time? - A. I had some liquor of him, and what it was I cannot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110039"/>say; it was ten pounds at that time, I went to borrow it, and he lent it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you near the waistcoat at all? - A. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you examined first as a witness? - A. I cannot tell well the day of the month I went before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. How long afterwards? - A. How long afterwards?</p>
               <p>Q. What is the occasion of your repeating what is said to you - it is only to think of what you shall answer - was it the 18th.? - A. Yes; the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the Alderman? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You never heard? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The Counsellor has done every thing that I could wish; there has been a great combination against me; I beg you will grant me a copy of my indictment; I have a great many witnesses here.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him the best of characters.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to stop him? - A. By the property being concealed, and he walking in a suspicious manner; I asked him what he had got under his coat, he told me slings for weighing; I asked what he was going to do with them, he told me he was going to get one of the same pattern, he told me Gravel-lane, Ratcliff-highway; I asked him the person's name that made them, he could not tell the person's name; I asked him how he should know the house, he said he should know it if he was by it; then I asked him what house he brought them from, he told me he brought them from no house, a man gave them him on this side of London-bridge; I asked him what the man's name was, he said he did not know his name, he should know the man if he saw him; I asked him to walk with me, and I took the slings from off his neck; I then saw the broad R on the head hook; I asked him if he could find the man any where; no, he said, he did not know where the man lived.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the King's mark? - A. Yes, I know the broad R.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got them here? - A. Yes; (produces them); the head hook has the broad R, and the others have not.</p>

I told him it was scale-rope; the hooks catched hold of three different people passing along the street, it catched hold of one gentleman and made his clothes crack, and he was angry; the witness asked me where I got these things from, I said they were given me by one of the King's warehouse-men, at the corner of Tooley-street: he calls to me, Beal, how far are you going over the bridge, he asked me to carry them; I put them across my shoulder, and coming over the bridge the first person I met the hooks catched hold of; he was to pay me one shilling for taking them; I know him as well as I know any body, I have known him between these three and four years; I never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110040"/>could get out, or else I could have found him directly; I would not have stooped in the street if I had seen them lay down to pick them up; I never was in any hobble before, I am as innocent as a child unborn.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there a number of articles that you could identify, the property of Messrs. Bush and Howard? - A. There were; I took them away in a coach, and left them in the Compter; the prisoner said, some of the articles were sent him as presents from the country, and some were given him by some of the young men in the prosecutor's warehouse; he said in the coach, as we were going along, he hoped I would say what I could in his favour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You know the partnership very well? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Are these the articles that you found upon the prisoner? - A. They are; they were not left in my care, but I left them at the house all sealed up.</p>
               <p>Payne. I can speak to the opodeldoc, it is of my own making, and my own putting up. (Looks at the articles.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Payne.) Q. Is that the label of Messrs. Bush and Howard? - A. It is; and we have not sold any out since we have been on these premises, they are part of the old stock from Baldwin's gardens.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, respecting the soap, how was this damaged? - A. I am not able to say how this was damaged; here is some British oil, I believe, of my own manufactory; here is some Spanish juice, it is cut off at the ends, which is not generally the case; this appears to be rolled out in a long roll, and cut off from the length.</p>
               <p>Court Q. Do not others do the same? - A. I never saw any.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in this business? - A. About fourteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have the prosecutors lost any of these articles? - A. They have.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner access to these articles? - A. He had access to every part of the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Had every young man, employed in the warehouse, access to where these articles were? - A. They had.</p>
               <p>Q. You said they were brought from Baldwin's-gardens? - A. The opodeldoc, essence of lemons, and British oil, were brought from Baldwin's-gardens: they were Steed's and Howard's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they sell by retail? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose they had many of their friends retail dealers? - A. They had.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Will undertake to say, that Steed and Howard might not have sold any of the opodeldoc? - A. I did not sell any; I was there, and saw every order that went out of the house, and never saw any of that order go out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not sold only at your shop, it may be sold at Newberry's, the bookseller, in St. Paul's-Church-yard?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110041"/>- A. It is sold at Newberry's; the patent is expired, and any one may make it.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose any one may make it according to their own receipt; it is not Steers's but Bush's opodeldoc - do you mean to swear by the composition or by the bill? - A. I mean to swear by the settling that is at the bottom of the bottle.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether Newberry, the bookseller, makes the same kind you do not know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Will you take upon you to say, that you never saw any other opodeldoc with that settlement at the bottom? - A. I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>- NASH sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You know respecting the soap? - A. The soap came from Baldwin's-gardens; there is something on it that I spilled upon it; compound tincture of peppermint.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe that that is part of the soap you injured with the rest? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How much is there of that soap? - A. Seven or eight pounds; the soap was in an unsaleable state, we meant to exchange it to the man who made it; the prisoner denied taking the soap, he said he found it at the corner of Whitecross-street; the opodeldoc he acknowledged having taken it, saying he was very much subject to the rheumatism; the British oil, the essence of anchovy, the Spanish juice, the court plaister, the mustard, the tincture of cardamom, he acknowledged of having taken these, and the essence of peppermint, he also acknowledged to have took it, his wife was subject to wind, for which purpose he took it; and the Turkey rheubarb also, he acknowledged he had taken.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of all these things? - A. I suppose five pounds.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You are certain he acknowledged taking all these things? - A. I am certain.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. This was in the Compter, after he had been committed for examination, before he had been to the Mansion-house - how came you there? - A. I went in with Mr. Bush and Mr. Howard, on purpose to get an account.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention all this at the Mansion-house afterwards - was it taken down in writing? - A. I am not positive.</p>
               <p>Q. So you went to the Compter to pump him before you went to the Magistrate, and then you went after to the Magistrate, and told - did not you give him to expect some favour if he told? - A. No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence, but called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you loose your watch? - A. I was discharged from the guards the seventh of last month; my friends got two substitutes for me; I had been making a little merry with my friends; we were going home; I was rather intoxicated in liquor; going home about nine at night to my lodgings in Westminster, the Three Tuns, I happened to call at a public-house, the sign of the Blue Bell; it was in my road home I met with the prisoner at the bar there; she seeing me rather in liquor, inticed me to go home with her to her lodgings; she asked me, and I went there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was her lodgings? - A. I do not know property; I am rather a stranger to that part of Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. What countryman are you? - A. I am a Yorkshire-man.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in London? - A. About five months since I came up; I went to her lodgings and stopped about an hour, and during that time I fell fast asleep; they waked me, and wished me to go home to the barracks; they did not know that I was discharged; I set off to my lodgings; it might be between ten and eleven; as I was going along I missed my watch, and being rather unacquainted with the place, I could not find the way to get back; I run about the streets till morning; nothing occurred, and in the morning I went to my lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Has this watch since been found? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were getting quite drunk; are you sure that is the woman? - A. I am sure that is the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from your lodgings to where she lived? - A. About half a mile; I do not know property the distance.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name of the place where she lived? - A. I do not know the name of the street properly.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a Yorkshire-man you say? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you acquainted with her before? - A. I never saw her before that night.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you laid down on the bed, and took asleep? - A. I was not in the house above in hour.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were in the room with her, of course you laid down in bed with her? - A. Yes, and fell fast asleep.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you present when he was apprehended? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or did you not hear him say, that this stone belonged to Hobbs? - A. He told me he had bought stones of Hobbs.</p>

             sworn. I am a constable; when I first saw the prisoner, I saw him turn from Buckingham-place with this stone under his arm; I thought, by his carrying the stone, he had not come honestly by it; I followed him, and before I came up, he turned out of the street into the yard; I there lost sight of him for one minute in Mr. Mennolls's yard; as he turned out of the yard into the street, I took him in custody; I now produce the stone; I have had it in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Rowtry.) Is that the stone you saw him with? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Did you produce the stone before the Magistrate? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say before the Magistrate you should not know the stone again? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mennoll). Is that your stone? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes, he is a stone-mason; he worked for me about twelve months ago, for the best part of a week.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are there any other persons having stones in your yard? - A. There are one or two more; Cole has stones on the north-side of the yard, and Hobbs has stones on the south-side.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. This Hobbs and I had a dealing to the amount of 11 shillings, and we shook hands as we parted; he said there is another piece of stone, come and take it; I had told him I wanted another small bit to finish my job; Accordingly I went over, and looked out a piece of stone; I was there half an hour before I looked it out, and I enquired of a man whether Hobbs owned all the stones.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here? - A. I do not know, this Rowtry met me, and asked me whether I worked for Mr. Hobbs; I told him I had bought it, and if I was going to steal a stone, I would not go at noonday.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You are shopman to Mr. Hind, your brother? - A. Yes, he lives at No. 134, Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoners at the bar, did you see them there on the 12th of March? - A. At half after one they both came into the shop to buy a brass footman; it had iron legs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that what they asked for at first? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you shew them the articles? - A. I did, the price was four shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of the women was it that particularly spoke for the article? - A. The person that called herself Evans; the one that goes by the name of Whiley.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the woman that has the child in her arms? - A. Yes, they bought the footman, and offered a one-pound note; I had not sufficient change for it; I went to get change, when I returned I suspected the note; I sent for Mr. Tare.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come into the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate any thing to him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened after that when Tare was with you? - A. He thought it was a bad one; they said they did not know it, and offered another, a good one, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the first note? - A. Mr. Tare had it his possession.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did both of them say they did not know it was a bad note, or only one of them? - A. I believe both of them expressed their surprise; but one of them I know said they did not know it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the other note? - A. Yes, that was a good one; Mr. Tare had the possession of the other; I delivered the bad note to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110044"/>Q. You received the other note; did you give change for that? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Mr. Tare do with the women. - A. He told them they must go with him to the Bank; I asked Evans for her address; she at first refused to give her address; she said she would call the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she afterwards give you any address? - A. Yes, Mrs. Evans, No. 7, Essex-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Tare had possession of the note, and went to the Bank? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. These two women came together? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They asked for a brass footman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And Mrs. Whiley is the person who gave the note? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At this moment you are quite sure she is the person that gave you the note? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not quite sure of the person that said they did not know it was a bad one? - A. No, I am not, but both expressed their surprise.</p>
               <p>Q. You said it was a bad one? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you asked them any thing about their address? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then intimating it was a bad one, she gave her name, her description that you have stated? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But at first both expressed their surprise of its being a bad one? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. I understood you to have said that Evans, who is proved to be the name of Whiley, expressed her surprise? - A. They both expressed their surprise.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this footman at the door or in the shop, so as passengers could see it? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it was a thing that a stranger might observe passing? - A. I believe it was behind a stove; they asked at first whether we sold footmen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Was it or was it not exposed out of the shop? - A. It was not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. What passed between the two women and you? - A. I enquired where she took it; she said that she took it of a man that sold pork in Swallow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that? - A. Whiley; I asked her if he was a shopkeeper; she said no, he sold it about the street.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110046"/>Q. Do you recollect seeing in your master's shop the prisoners? - A. They were both together there about the middle of the day; on the thirteenth of February they both came into my master's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they ask for? - A. Two lumps of fresh butter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you serve them with it? - A. No; I told them I had none.</p>
               <p>Q. What said they? - A. They asked me to let them taste the best Cambridge salt butter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they offer to purchase any of that? - A. I let them taste that, and they asked for three pounds first, and then afterwards they asked for six pounds, at sixteen pence a pound.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did that amount to, at sixteen pence a pound? - A. The butter they had amounted to eight shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they purchase any thing else then? - A. Yes, two shillings worth of eggs, they had ten shillings to pay me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they do towards paying you? - A. They gave me a two-pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave you that two-pound note? - A. That lady with a child in her arms, Whiley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at that note? - A. Yes, I told them it was a bad one.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say? - A. They seemed rather alarmed.</p>
               <p>Q. They did not own to it? - A. I presented it back to them; they neither of them took it up; I took it up from the counter; I asked them where they lived; I agreed to take the note upon these terms, if they would tell me where they lived.</p>
               <p>Q Did they, either of them, tell you their names? - A. Yes, that lady with the child in her arms, Whiley. (The note handed to the witness.)</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at that note - what address did Whiley give you? - A. She gave me the name of Evans, and said she lived at No. 19, Charterhouse-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that street near you? - A. It is not far off.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time Whiley gave you her address, and the name of Evans, what did the other person say? - A. The other person said, what use is that direction to you; if she wished to give you a bad note, do you think she would give you a right direction? I said, suppose she does not, if I should meet you in the street, how foolish you would look in the street with a false direction; I took the note, and gave them their change, and they took the butter and eggs.</p>

               <p>Q. You are quite sure these are the women? - A. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. This is a long while ago - when was it? - A. On the 13th of February.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. How long was it before you found it was a bad note? - A. On the Friday following.</p>
               <p>Q. You put them altogether, did not you? - A. I had marked it on the back.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Had you written Evans on all the other notes? - A. No.</p>
               <p>(The note handed to Mr. Bliss.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. (To Mr. Bliss.) Q. Is that a forged note? - A. It is a forged note, the whole of it is forged; the paper is not Bank paper, nor is the writing any person's writing at the Bank; the engraving is not like the Bank engraving.</p>

            , by profession a Quaker, of Broad-street, Bloomsbury, a grocer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember these two persons? - A. I remember on the 28th of February I was called by my husband to come and assist in the shop; he had a note in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these two persons in the shop at the same time? - A. They were; my husband said he was afraid it was a bad note, and he would step into Mr. Rider's, his next door neighbour, and ask him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go into Mr. Rider's? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did he return? - A. Almost immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between your husband and the prisoners? - A. When he came in, he addressed himself to the prisoners, and said it was a bad one, and Mr. Rider came in with him, and he said he would swear it was a bad one; Mr. Corder said he could not think of giving up the note without they would bring any body to satisfy him how they came by it, and then they should have it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Mr. Rider making any observation about that? - A. Mr. Rider said, he ought to detain them also; my husband asked them where they got it; Mrs. Whiley, (I do not recollect the other said any thing,) said, she took it in exchange for a ten-pound note in Swallow-street; she said, of a man that sold pork in the street; I do not recollect any thing further; they gave a good two-pound note, and took the change; they took the articles they had purchased, and went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they mention where they lived? - A. Mr. Corder asked where they lived when they were going out; they said No. 3, Charlton-place, Charlton-street, Sommer's Town, and that their names were Evans.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that answer given by Whiley? - A. I think it was; I do not recollect the other saying any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they ever come again? - A. I never saw them any more till I saw them in the Poultry Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw them, then you knew them? - A. I knew them directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what accident happened at your house that day? - A. I believe my husband cut his finger, I did not see it, but I observed it bleeding, and I observed some blood upon the note; I had it in my possession till the next day; (the note shewn the witness.) That is the same note that I had; I wrote my name upon the back, February 29,

               <p>Q. Did you make any observation upon his saying he could not give the note up? - A. I told them I thought he ought to detain the persons; I have no doubt but they heard it; they gave him a good two-pound note, and he gave them the change.</p>

               <p>Q. A good one? - A. I believe so; I found two seven-shilling pieces, two shillings, and a sixpence, in her pocket; from Ann Haynes I took two two-pound notes in paper, in her pocket were four seven-shilling pieces, one half-crown, fourteen shillings, and one sixpence; in her purse there were two two-pound notes and seven one-pound notes, one guinea, and twenty-seven shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. What name did he give you? - A. Edwards; he came on the 25th, I think, again; I am not certain; it was on Saturday, and the next time it was on the 28th, the Tuesday following; when he came into the shop I was in at tea; I saw what he wanted; I got the seal, and gave him the seal and the three shillings he had left for the earnest; upon his receiving it, he gave me a 2 l. note; I took the 2 l. note and looked at it; it was quite dusk, and there was a lantern alight at the farther end of the shop; I went and fetched the lantern, and looked at the note; I said, I do not like this note, where do you live; he said, No. 4, Charterhouse-lane, West-Smithfield; I looked again at the note; more particularly; I was fully persuaded in my own mind that it was a forged one; I immediately said to him, I would advise you to be careful what you are about; I had not a single doubt but it was a forged note; I said to him, where and from whom did you take it; he told me he had it from one Mr. Hallam; I understood him so; he pointed with his finger to an indorsement at the back of the note; pointing to a name that he said was Hallam, that he took it of; he then took hold of the note, as if he meant to look at it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say he took hold of the note, as if he meant to look at it, did you part with the note? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He took hold with his hand, while you had it in your hand? - A. Yes, and pulled it, by which the note tore; then he immediately let go; he put the seal and the three shillings out of his pocket on the counter; I continued looking at the note, pondering in my mind what I had best do;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110051"/>the prisoner then said that he took the note fairly; it was hard for him to be at the loss of it; that was nearly the words that he made use of; then he drew back from the counter; I continued looking at the note, and during that time he went out of the shop; the next morning I told Mr. Spinks what had happened with this note; I gave the note to him; I put my own initials upon it; he went to the Bank; I took the particulars of the note on paper. (The note produced by Mr. Fielding.)</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this note? - A. This is the note.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you ever, in the course of your life, in the course of your conversation with any person, find one more ready to give an answer to what you asked? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the course of business fair and open? - A. It appeared so.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you his address, which address turned out to be a true one? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. You did not go to the door to look after him, to see if he was in your reach? - A. No; there was no one in the shop besides.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you first see the prisoner? - A. I saw him first in company with Mr. Stiles, in Charterhouse-lane; when Mr. Spinks brought the note to the Bank it was the 29th of February.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the prisoner at home? - A. We did, at No. 4, Charterhouse-lane; Mr. Stiles went in first of all, and informed me he was at home; I went in; I told the prisoner he must go with me; he said, where; I then mentioned where; he went with me to our Solicitors; he said, he thought he was going to Mr. Spinks; I took him to our Solicitors, Messrs. Winter and Kaye, in Swithin's lane; Mr. Freshfield took some minutes in writing, in the presence of the prisoner.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Were these minutes taken by yourself? - A. They were, on the 29th of February. (The minutes read as follows:) I saw a man in Clerkenwell, with a box of trinkets upon his neck; I looked at some pencils, and bought a couple; he told me he dealt in a great many things; and seeing some boxes I told him I made silver ones, and gave him my card; he called upon me about a week afterwards, and bought silver boxes to the amount of ten pounds twelve shillings, and said his name was Hallowes; he paid me in all two-pound notes, except the twelve shillings; I paid one to a pork-shop, in Fleet-market; I paid one at Jenkins's, a pawnbroker, in Redcross-street, where I redeemed some silver boxes; last week, at the beginning, I paid one to redeem six silver tea-spoons, in Shoreditch; two ladies keep the shop, left hand side, near the bottom of Old-street; about three weeks ago today, I paid another in Holborn, Middle-row, near Brook-street; bought a pair of shoes and gaiters; I went to Mr. Spinks, in Barbican; when I was told it was a bad one, I went away; was much surprized it was a bad one; I asked Mr. Spinks's young man if he should take it to the Bank today; he said he should; I said I would call to know if it was a bad one; I wrote the name of Hallowes upon the back of that note, and some of the others, as soon as the man was gone; I am a bright engraver by trade, but can make boxes; I work for Eames, in Paternoster-row; I am employed by my brother and Hallowes, in Hunt's court; also Merrit, Foster-lane; the boxes made for Hallowes laid by me some time.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The same name as he worked for? - A. Yes, but not the same person; upon the first of March I asked him at Bow-street (there was no Magistrate sitting then) about a note not included in this paper; he said he had that of the man also; I told him of a 2 l. note, that had been traced to Mr. Thorn; I asked him to give an account of that note; he said he received it from the same man he received the others.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Giles. Q. You are porter at the Golden Cross? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the last witness? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember receiving from him a two-pound note, for which he gave you change? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at it - is that the note? - A. Yes; Mr. Clark's name is at the back of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Clark's name your hand-writing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. You are able to say then with certainty, that the note you gave your boy to pay Cross, was the same you received from the stranger? - A. I went up stairs, and put it in my pocketbook.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other two-pound note in your pocket? - A. I had neither a two or a one, to my knowledge; I am certain it is the same, I had no other; I observed, when I took it, the paper looked rather dingy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make the same observation when you took it out of your pocket-book? - A. I did not take particular notice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. (To Baxter.) Q. Look at that note, (Hall's note), is that the forgery? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it in all respects, both paper, and engraving, and signature? - A. I have not the least doubt it is the same manufacture as the first.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at that, (Clark's note), is that a forgery? - A. This is just the same as the other two, I have not the least doubt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. (To Mr. Terry.) Q. Be so good as tell us whether these notes are from the same plate? - A. These are from one plate, all three; they are altogether forged. (The notes read.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Mr. Freshfield.) Q. You were led to go to the pawnbroker's from the information the prisoner gave you? - A. We knew the notes were uttered at these places.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore he was the person who gave you the information? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have nothing to say, but that I have stated the truth how I came in possession of the notes; I am a young man, and have not been taught that caution which the Counsel against me seems to think I ought to be in the possession of.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called nine witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. When he took me, he asked me where I was going with the jacket; I told him I was going to No. 101, Wapping, to get one made like it; I was going along Wapping-wall, and met this crimp and another man; I was going up to the India-house to go on board the Lady Burgess; the man gave me the jacket to carry, so I was going along, and this man came running after me, and said it was his jacket; I said, how can it be your jacket, when a man gave it me to carry? I said, come along, and I will prove it to you. So he took me along, and we met this man, and he carried me to the Police-office.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you present at the time? - A. No; I am a relation to Mr. Brewer, I am come to prove the property; I saw her go into the kitchen to the cook.</p>
               <p>- GOSS sworn. - I live with Mr. Pattmore on Ludgate-hill: On the 17th of March, the prisoner came and offered two spoons, and from their being engraved the Swan and Two Necks, Lad-lane, it gave me a suspicion that she did not come honestly by them. When I interrogated her whose property they were, she said she was sent by Miss Bolton, who lived at the Swan and Two Necks; I detained her until I sent there; they immediately came and said that she stole them.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner at the bar coming to your house, and when? - A. In the beginning of December last; I had some beer of him, and paid him when he delivered the cask; whether he asked me if I wanted the beer, or would I take the beer, I cannot say which of the words.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a servant of Messrs. Hanbury and Co. at the time you were a customer? - A. I knew him before, by coming with other men to serve me with beer.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he came to you in December, you were not a customer at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say from whom he came? - A. I knew the dray, and from whom he came; I took a cask of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you pay for the cask? - A. Ten shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What cask was it, a large one? - A. I think they hold twenty-seven gallons.</p>
               <p>Q. What price was it? - A. Mr. Smith told me it came to fifteen shillings; I gave him ten shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you buy it of him as from the house of Hanbury and Co.? A. - Yes, being so inferior, I thought I gave the value of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where he brought it from? - A. No, he did not; I knew the dray to be Mr. Smith's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You reside in Essex? - A. Yes, at Walthamstow; when the dray came round, they always spoke as they passed; I had a brother lived there.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner brought you a cask of beer; you bought it, and gave ten shillings and sixpence for it? - A. Yes; it was not fit for the pigs; I gave it to the pigs at last.</p>
               <p>Q. It was represented to you as good beer when you bought it? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. When you tasted it, it was sour and griping? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. The beer you formerly had of Hanbury was good; do you think the last beer was theirs? - A. It may; all beer does not run alike.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You said you had a relation in this house of Hanbury and Smith? - A. I had; he was a cooper.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he acquainted with this man? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. You live at Walthamstow; what are you? - A. I am nothing but a washerwoman.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of Walthamstow is your house near? - A. North-green; just before you come to the forest.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you have left off dealing with Messrs. Hanbury and Smith? - A. Near four years; if not quite.</p>
               <p>Q. You have lived upon the spot ever since? - A. I have lived on the same spot thirty-six years.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you keep a house there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A wooden tenement? - A. No; a brick one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you taste the beer before it was left? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not know it was bad when you bought it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you pay? - A. Ten shillings and sixpence; that was the money he said it came to.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did it not strike you that you could not have twenty-seven gallons of beer for ten shillings and sixpence. What does your family consist of? - A. People that I employ, sometimes five or six.</p>
               <p>Q. How many casks of beer do you consume in a month? - A. Not many in a month.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you have your beer from? - A. From Mr. Aslam, at Stratford.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever get twenty-seven gallons of beer from him for the same money? - A. I never had such a large cask of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you pay him? - A. Ten shillings for eighteen gallons.</p>

            , jun. sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are the son of the Gentleman examined here before; I understand that the man who delivers beer, has it entered in a book when he comes home by the clerk, and he signs it; have you the book of the 2d of December last? - A. I have the book here, there is no delivery of that kind (the books produced), this is the book they sign, and this is the book they post it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any account in the other book of any money having been received of a cask of beer to Mrs. Sexton in December last? - A. There is no name of Mrs. Sexton in it; there is one Gentleman, Mr. Allen, that suspected that he had not so many as we booked to him.</p>
               <p>Court. The fraud this fellow commits is this; he charges Mr. Allen for three casks, and he has had but two; they are accounted for to the master, therefore the only evidence to prove against the prisoner would be, that he has charged to Mr. Allen three casks, and he has only had two.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he tend you the second one? - A. No, I saw another in his hand, he seemed to tremble; I told him I rather supposed he had more, and that I thought it was necessary to send for a constable, and search him; we found upon him two good shillings and two bad ones, a seven-shilling-piece, and two pence in halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the bad shilling he tended you? - A. I kept it in my hand till the constable came.</p>
               <p>- PEDDER sworn. - Q. You are the constable, and searched the prisoner? - A. I did; I have got the two bad shillings here. (Produces them).</p>
               <p>Q. (To White.) From whom did you receive that shilling at Mr. Barnard's? - A. From the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of those two shillings was tendered to you? - A. That is the shilling I took of the prisoner, (shewing them); and that is the one I took out of his hand; he had two good ones in his hand to pay if he chused.</p>
               <p>- HICKS sworn. - Q. How long have you known the prisoner? - A. About two or three years; I only know that he was in the habit of passing it, he has been in confinement for the same.</p>
               <p>- PARKER sworn. - Q. Look at these two shillings? - A. They are both counterfeited: they appear to be new coloured, they have not been in circulation since they have been coloured.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. When I went into this man's house I pulled out the silver, and a seven-shilling-piece, I called for a glass of pepper-mint; his wife that served at the bar, I gave her the shilling; she handed that over to the publican, and said, this here is a bad one; I would have given them the money I had in my hand to have changed, I had a seven-shilling-piece in my hand; that is the truth.</p>
               <p>White. My sister was not in the bar.</p>

             sworn - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a servant belonging to Mr. Restall: I was ordered by Mr. Oliver, on Thursday the 8th of March, to watch the sawyers; the next morning I marked four pieces, and three of them were found in Mr. Fitch's dwelling-house; on Tuesday morning following, about half past eight o'clock, I saw King go and take three or four pieces of scantling, and put them in the saw-pit to his partner Walker; Walker was in the saw-pit; the bottom part of the saw-pit against Mr. Fitch's premises is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110059"/>level with the ground, and an open pale-fence, and to one of the boards there was a nail out at the bottom, so that the board could be put of either side; it was only fastened at the top, and when it was shoved on one side, any thing might be put in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go to Fitch's premises with the officer? - A. Yes; I saw some scantlings in his outhouse where the coals were, belonging to Mr. Fitch, I saw seven or eight; I knew three, I had marked them before; Fitch is a publican, he keeps the Cherry-tree.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What are you? - A. I am a carpenter.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose if it is necessary for a carpenter or a sawyer to make his work higher or lower when he is at work, at any given piece of wood, he may remove any piece of wood honestly and fairly to make his work more easy? - A. Justly so.</p>
               <p>Q. The man who is at work on the wood can see every body that is in the yard? - A. He might, perhaps, if he had known where I had been watching.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Here is a saw-pit six feet deep; the situation of the man who stood on the top of the wood, could not he see over six feet; he could see you if he had looked round? - A. He could not see me in the yard, because I was not in the yard; I was in a house that looked into the yard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Where is this outhouse of Mr. Fitch's, that you saw these scantlings taken from? - A. An outhouse very near the yard of Mr. Restall.</p>
               <p>Q. And there you found three pieces of oak-scantling? - A. There were seven in all, three I had marked.</p>
               <p>Q. How are these premises of Mr. Restall guarded? - A. With high paling; some part is ten feet high, and other parts are not above seven feet, and some part with a brick manufactory at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the outhouse of Mr. Fitch, is that very well secured? - A. Yes, for what I know.</p>
               <p>Q. The skittle ground is behind that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there not a yard that any body may have access to? - A. If they do they have no right.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Tell us how Mr. Fitch's yard is situated: in the first place there is a paling belonging to Mr. Restall, that you have told us is seven feet high; what is Fitch's fence of the other side? - A. I cannot say.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are clerk to Mr. Restall? - A. I am: On Thursday, previous to the thirteenth of March, I marked as many pieces as the sawyers had been collecting together, for some unknown purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they pieces to be sawed up? - A. They were not; they are called oak-scantlings.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. By no means to be sawed up? - A. They had been sawed up a year before.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had marked them on Thursday morning did you go there, and did you miss any? - A. I went there every morning after I marked them, but I found more added to them; I had missed some for some time previous to that; but on the Tuesday following, as soon as I went into the yard, I found every piece that I had marked was gone excepting one; I immediately applied to Davis, whom I had put in a situation to watch their conduct.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of some information he gave you, you got a warrant? - A. I did, and we, with some officers, went to Fitch's premises on the thirteenth of March; when we went to Fitch's house, we found him at work with a carpenter, making a skittle-frame in the yard; I immediately recognised a piece of fir-scantling, and a piece of fir-batten; it was a piece of fir that I had missed out of the yard; we immediately, in company with the officers, told Fitch that we had come in search after some stolen timber; he said he had got none: Smith then called him on one side; I heard what Smith said; Smith told him that he had a warrant to search his premises, and if he knew of any he had better tell him and the others where it was; he then said, that a man had left some pieces of scantlings for some gentleman over the way; he then pointed to his coal-cellar; the coal-cellar is level with the yard under his dwelling-house; as soon as we approached the coal-cellar, there I found the pieces I had marked; there were seven pieces to the best of my knowledge; in the whole there were four pieces that I had marked, and three Davis had marked; Smith asked him if he had any more, he said not to his knowledge; I then requested him to open the door adjoining his coal-cellar; I believed he called it his wine-cellar, and there I found two oak-ends I had missed out of the yard; I had no private mark on them, but they were such as I am positive that they were my master's property; Mr. Fitch told me these oak-ends were appraised to him when he came into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long since had you seen the oak-ends? - A. I am positive they were in the yard after the twenty-seventh of May, last year.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has Fitch kept the house? - A. I do not know; I have very little knowledge of the man; I had marked a piece of fir that was in the skittle-ground; he assured me they were appraised to him; the principal part of the frame I had not missed out of the yard till I saw the fir; they were then framing it and nailing it together, and closing it to some batten that it was confined to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Was it that part that you had not missed before; was it marked before you saw it? - A. There was a bad end; it was marked with an axe mark.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. There is a great many more men<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110060"/>about this place? - A. Not at that time; there are at times.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you always upon the spot? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you tell? - A. They are not suffered in the yard without my leave; I had a person watching at this time; he can speak.</p>
               <p>- SMITH sworn. - I went to Fitch's premises with a warrant; I found in the coal-cellar what the last witnesses described, and that which made the skittle-frame was taken away by Mr. Oliver's servant; it is all here; the moment I went into the yard I saw Fitch with the carpenter; I told him I had a warrant to search for some stolen timber; he said, I have none here; a man has left some timber; it is in the coal-cellar; I have not purchased it, nor have I stolen it; he said he had no more than what was in the coal-cellar; I said, are you sure; he said, yes; and when we found more, he said they were appraised to him when he came into the house, about ten months ago; Mr. Oliver identified the piece of frame; he was very ready to let us search; there were two oak ends, that were in the wine-cellar, and two pieces of fir that were in the skittle-ground.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You say he was very ready to let you search? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>(The timber produced and identified by Oliver and Davis.)</p>
               <p>King's defence. I am as innocent as the child unborn.</p>

               <p>Fitch's defence. I cannot say any more than what I have said.</p>

               <p>The prisoner Fitch called eight witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

Yes; he was with me till he came near the Office; we went to the Public-Office, Lambeth-street, Whitechapel, and when we came near the Office, he turned round and gave me a violent blow on the temple, and knocked me down, and ran off; there was a cry of stop thief, and he was soon brought back, and I took him to the Office.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure this is one of the men? - A. Yes; I never took my eyes off him; I never lost sight of him; I took and put him in the butcher's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is one that hustled Mr. Mansfield? - A. Yes; and immediately I heard Mr. Mansfield say he had lost his watch I ran across the road and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner were they hustling him? - A. They were shoving round him.</p>
               <p>Q. Using violence against him? - A. Yes; he was quite out of wind when I came up, and he said in a low tone of voice that he had lost his watch.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took him to the butcher's shop, what was done with him? - A. When we came back he was gone; there was a mob assembled about the door; they said they had no right to keep him, so they let him go; he was found about ten or eleven days after.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he is the man? - A. That is the man; the butcher's sister is here; she will swear to him, as well as myself; and I will swear he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe Ellison? - A. I had not time to recognize that man; Mr. Mansfield took him; I saw this man and Mr. Mansfield at the Office; Mr. Mansfield had his eye cut; it was bleeding; that man, if he was there, he must be in the front of him; this Jackson and the man in the flannel jacket were behind Mr. Mansfield at the time of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time of the robbery, could you observe who was in the front? - A. I could not; I did not turn my head that way; I run across the way when he said he was robbed, after Jackson, and while I took the prisoner, Jackson, I lost sight of the prosecutor and Ellison, and never saw him till I saw him at the Office.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure the casks are Mr. Sellon's? - A. Yes; they have the mark of Mr. Sellon.</p>

               <p>Q. With a publican who deals with four or five different brewers, it frequently occurs that mistakes happen, in a fair regular course of trade? - A. It certainly does.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Does it happen, in course of business, that these casks get exchanged, suppose Mr. Meux takes the cask, and sends it out with beer? - A. A man may get one cask by way of another, by way of mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose Mr. Meux takes Mr. Sellon's cask, and fills it again, does it happen they fill it again? - A. It does happen so.</p>

               <p>Q. What day was it? - A. It was some time within a fortnight after I was there; I had been there a few days, I have forgot the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Mr. Sykes was a customer of Mr. Sellon's or not? - A. I do not know any customer.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When you came to Sykes's house, there was one left there - who did you see when you left it? - A. I do not remember seeing any body when I left it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the man in the house, or any of his family? - A. No, there was a door that goes out of the street into a stable-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the house before? - A. I cannot say I did, I never was in that quarter before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or he roll it down? - A. I helped him; he said, we will leave this here till another time, or day, I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing in it? - A. I cannot say whether it was full or not; there was something in it, but I cannot tell what was in it.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not see any body there? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Look round, and tell me whether that is the man? - A. I believe it is.</p>
               <p>- HANCOCK sworn. - I am one of the Police officers of Hatton-garden; I went with a warrant to Sykes's house; I went with Mr. Evans, and in Mr. Sykes's cellar I found a cask of beer, and an empty cask, said by Mr. Evans to be the property of Mr. Sellon; and after Mr. Evans went to fetch the dray to take the beer away, Mr. Sykes was left in my custody; during the time he went, Mr. Sykes behaved very well; when Mr. Evans returned to take the beer away, during the time they were loading the dray, Mr. Sykes being then in my custody, withdrew into the back kitchen; at that time I did not know there was a door that leads into the yard from the back kitchen, I knew there was a window that came into the yard; Mr. Sykes went out of the door into the back kitchen, and got over the water-but and over the wall; I said nothing at the time, but rushed out of the door, and turned to the left up a stable-yard, and caught Mr. Sykes by the jacket; Mr. Sykes told me, when I laid hold of him, it was not his intention to escape, and desired that I would not hold him; I told him I was obliged to secure him, in order that he might not escape; I told him he was very much to blame, and we went into the kitchen again, nothing more passed; then I took him to the Police-office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Mr. Sykes told you he did not mean to escape - did not the Magistrate take his word for his appearance? - A. I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. He was admitted to bail, and he came here and surrendered himself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Was not that at the request of Meux's house that he was admitted to bail? - A. I believe it was.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM-MARMADUKE SELLON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Mr. Sellon, have you any partner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Sykes any customer of your's? - A. No, he never was.</p>
               <p>Q. The other prisoner, Jackson, was a servant of your's - how long has he been so? - A. About ten months.</p>
               <p>Q. There are no orders for beer without your knowledge? - A. Whatever directions are sent to my brewhouse cannot be sent to the customers till I have set my initials on the margin; they cannot send from my brewhouse till I have set my regular mark.</p>
               <p>Q. What beer is that? - A. It is small beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Publicans cannot have small beer in their cellars? - A. They are liable to an information if they have.</p>
               <p>- ROADS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you apprehend 
               <persName id="t18040411-65-person696">Jackson</persName>
             the same day? - A. Yes, I was sent for to take him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass at the time? - A. He said that the man that had turned against him ought to have something said against him, because he was to have part.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that was the expression? - A. He ought to have suffered with him, or instead of him; he ought to have suffered, because he was to have part.</p>
               <p>Jackson's defence. That beer, your Lordship, was my property, I will prove it, which all dray-men have; it is the bottom of the casks that all draymen have.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did you ever know instances of their taking beer home, the drains from different barrels from different customers, to the master's house, and then fill it into the master's barrels, and take it out and sell it; I will take it down in writing, if you will swear so? - A. No, not sell it, but they take it home; I always understood it was their perquisites.</p>
               <p>Court. You do not understand any such thing; you only come here to perjure yourself.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. His wife at first told you he was not in the house, and afterwards you found him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is what many a man's wife will do? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Do you know the prisoner, Howes? - A. I have known him nine years; I have known him as an attorney at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that letter, (a letter handed to the witness,) and tell me whether you believe that letter is Howes's hand-writing? - A. I have a great doubt; it is a great similitude, I think it is wrote too loose for it; I was in Mr. Humphries's chambers, I then thought, at the first flush, it was his handwriting, it has a great similitude; upon my oath, I think he did not write it.</p>


               <p>Q. Look at this bill, (another paper handed him,) what do you say to that? - A. Formerly, in my days, he did not write full Robert, only R; I cannot believe it, I never saw it done; it is not his mode, he wrote quite a different hand in my days.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Condescend to look at it for one minute, and do not look at the blank side? - A. He wrote quite a different hand in my days; he wrote in a stiff technical way, he could not write this loose hand in my days; it is a strong resemblance.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose any of your property on the 5th of April? - A. There was a silver watch of my nephew's lost from the premises, and all the articles mentioned in the indictment; I saw all the linen, I believe, about twenty minutes before hanging up on the line in the kitchen; she absconded about half past ten at night.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether your house was shut up safe? - A. The way that I came to discover it, was this; it was the usual practice of the servant to set up to let the man in for his nightly labour, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110067"/>came, and knocked at the door two or three times; the man begins his work at eleven at night, and myself about two; she was not there to answer the door when the man knocked; he rung the bell, and not hearing the servant attend the door, I went down to let the man in, or rather, the door was open to let the man in, but he did not discover it; I called to the prisoner by name, and told the man the door was upon the jar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the door upon the jar at that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure? - A. I am positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married man? - A. Yes, I have four children, my wife, and a nephew.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your wife gone to bed? - A. Yes; I secured the door, as I usually do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man and you look over the house? - A. I went into the kitchen, and perceived the things were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the woman again? - A. On Monday, the 9th of April, I saw her in Lambeth-street Office, Whitechapel, in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your things again? - A. One petticoat only.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has got that? - A. The person who took it into pledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that produced at the Office? - A. Not at the Office she was first taken to; she was sent to Bow-street, and there I attended, and saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she given you any intimation that she meant to leave you? - A. No; we were quite happy to think that we had got a woman that suited us so well; she was a very handy woman in the house.</p>

            : On the 3d of March, between twelve and one o'clock, the prisoner came into my shop with two others; one of the women came to the counter where I was, not the prisoner, and asked to look at a piece of cotton for a child's frock; I took down two pieces; the second piece they told me would do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean they - I thought you only said one person, not the prisoner? - A. One person said one of the pieces would do.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was not one of the two women? - A. I think she was not. When they said it would do, I cut off a yard and a half; they gave me a seven-shilling piece to pay for it, the yard and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110068"/>a half came to two shillings and ninepence; I gave them four shillings and threepence change, and they went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say they all three came in together? - A. I am not certain; I saw the prisoner warm herself at the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe, as they all three went out of the shop, that at the same time, they all went the same direction from your shop? - A. I cannot say, I had more customers in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she, while these women were bargaining for this yard and a half, interfere in the matter? - A. She did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing after these people were gone? - A. No, not immediately; in the space of two minutes after, some person said the shop was robbed; a servant of mine ran out; I immediately left the shop, and went out myself; I turned to Piercy-street, which is two doors from my shop, and I saw the prisoner and another person running up Piercy-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pursue them? - A. I saw another person running after them; they were secured, and brought back to the shop. In the pursuit of them, I saw the prisoner drop one or more of the pieces of cotton; I did not stop to pick them up, but I pursued the prisoner; as soon as they were dropped, the servant stooped, and picked them up; I pursued the prisoner; they turned down a place at the top of Piercy-street, the first turning is Gresse-street; the prisoner turned down the left hand turning, and the person that was with her kept strait into Rathbone-street; I catched the prisoner in Gresse-street, and brought her directly back to the shop, and the servant followed me with these goods; they had been put upon a bale of goods for shew; I know them to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you seen them before? - A. Half an hour before these people came in, that was the extent.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other customers in the shop at the time while these women were in? - A. I had two or three, I cannot say exactly the number; I brought the prisoner back myself; an officer was following me back from Piercy-street, and he took charge of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search her? - A. The officer did; nothing was found on her concerning me; she said she came on purpose to buy a gown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she herself make any purchase? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. While these people were talking, she was about the fire warming herself? - A. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these goods? - A. They were on a bale of goods about two yards from the fireplace, fronting the door-way; they were not on the counter at all.</p>

               <p>Q. Who were serving in the shop at that time? - A. Two lads, whom I have here; my partner went out in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of that that was dropped by her, and picked up by your servant? - A. I have not directly ascertained.</p>
               <p>Q. Put the lowest value you can? - A. Upwards of four pounds, upon the most moderate calculation; Mr. Kelly, the officer, has the pieces of cotton.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never dropped any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the prosecutor.) Are you quite sure you saw her drop the things in Piercy-street? - A. Yes, she acknowledged the same in Marlborough-street.</p>

               <p>Q. (To the prosecutor.) Did the prisoner leave the shop before the other? - A. No; she did not take the child; the child was troublesome.</p>

             occupies a part of that warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he any partners? - A. None: On the 20th of March, a merchant bought fifteen dozen of shawls, and nine pounds of silk twist; I packed them up myself in a wooden chest; they were both in the same chest, with other articles.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a package were they in? - A. They were in an iron-bound package, and the iron was screwed down on the package.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the dimensions of the package? - A. About eight feet wide.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you yourself see this package perfect? - A. I did, it was quite perfect.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of this package on the morning of the 21st - was it taken by itself, or with others? - A. With four others.</p>
               <p>Q. How was this package marked? - A. I marked it myself P. A. B. I saw them all put in the cart, and safe down to the Guillotine; I saw that with the other packages, one was marked N, with a diamond, No. 91.</p>
               <p>Q. You accompanied the cart yourself? - A. I did, I went with it to the Guillotine.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of it there? - A. I then saw it taken out of the cart; the Guillotine is near the Custom-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of them then? - A. They were taken out of the cart, and put under the care of Mr. Mackenzie, the lighterman.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this? - A. A little before ten o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them put on board the boat? - A. I did not; I saw them after they were on board the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. What boat was it? - A. A lug-boat of Mackenzie and Gray.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when you last saw this boat? - A. Near eleven in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the packages appear then? - A. Quite perfect; in the same condition as I left them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That boat was close to the Custom-house? - A. Close by in the water.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other packages in the boat? - A. There were about ten more.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they put on last? - A. Yes; they were to be put on board the ship Kingston, bound to Boston, laying at Wapping Old-stairs; the tide had then run down about half an hour; the tide served about six hours good tide.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What are you, Sir? - A. I am an importer of British goods to Boston, in America.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not a navigable man? - A. I have crossed the Atlantic twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Some tides you go very expeditiously - do you know how the winds were on the river? - A. Very adverse winds.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know what time the lug-boat set sail? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it so late as two o'clock when it set off? - A. No, it was not; I saw the packages safe; they were uppermost in the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether you have been up and down the river? - A. I have in a boat, as far as Blackwall.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Your packages were large? - A. Yes, and the others were small, in proportion to ours.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the prisoner at that time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore whether he had any charge of that, you do not know? - A. No; upon the day the goods were re-landed, I saw him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110070"/>Q. He came forward voluntarily? - A. No; he said he had not done it, he had never left the boat, and was not concerned in the plunder.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You are foreman and inspector to Mackenzie and Gray - is it your business to attend the quays to receive them on board the craft? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 21st of March, did you receive these five packages that came from Mr. Pratt's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they put on board the lug-boat? - A. They were, I saw them on board; as near as I can recollect, it was about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they continue in your care on board the lug-boat? - A. About two hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came and took charge of them then? - A. The prisoner; that was near one, or thereabout.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did he go off from the quay? - A. As soon as he received the order from me; he left the quay about one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time were these five packages safe in the boat? - A. In all appearance to me they were, at the top; I saw them, they appeared safe; I have no doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any other person go with the prisoner? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see the boat go off? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it to go with sails, or with oars? - A. With paddles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are foreman to Mr. Mackenzie? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If the wind happened to be a little east, whether it was most condusive to the service he was employed in, to go down to Blackwall first, and work up, or whether to have gone first to the Kingston? - A. He stopped as he went down, and delivered at New Crane.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You did not see him do that - which would have been the best to have delivered, the packages at Wapping, or to have gone to Black-wall first, and then work up? - A. If he had found no difficulty of stopping, it would certainly have been his duty to have stopped there, could he have got the goods into the Kingston without stopping.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Was the wind north or east? - A. It blew east.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think, if he had gone to the Kingston first, he could have got back? - A. I am confident he could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course it would have been best to have gone to Blackwall first, and then to have worked up? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you come on board the boat? - A. I was not on board all the whole time after it left the quay, after I had put them on board.</p>
               <p>Q. Then between eleven and one o'clock there was not any body on board the boat? - A. There are always people belonging to Mr. Mackenzie and Gray about; there are two watchmen and myself.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was it possible, that when you had put it on board the craft, for any person to take it out and pack it up again? - A. I believe it possible, I cannot say it is likely.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did the prisoner tell you when he came back, whether he stopped at the New-Crane going or coming back? - A. Going down.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not he have stopped and left these packages in the Kingston at Wapping Old-stairs, as well as to have stopped at New-Crane? - A. You may have one single box in a boat, or skiff; sometimes people are engaged in stowing away the holds, they may be so engaged as not to be able to deliver their cargo; it depends upon circumstances.</p>
               <p>Q. What length of time would it have delayed him, to have stopped at the Kingston without impediment? - A. It would have detained him half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that the delay of half an hour was such, that he could not get to Black-wall? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You packed these things on board the lug-boat; is it your usual custom to pack things that come last at the top? - A. Yes, it is; when I put those goods in I did not know of these goods.</p>

B. one of the iron hoops was loose, and the ends had been rivetted on; it appeared loose by losing its rivet, and losing some screws; there was another marked N, and a diamond, the battens were some of them broken, that was corded; to all appearance they had been opened; there was some discourse with the mate and the prisoner concerning the state of these chests; the prisoner said, they had struck against the windlass; something about coming at the end of the windlass.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing of their coming at the end of the windlass? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they put that night? - A. Down in the hold, they were locked up, and the mate had the key; I staid on board all the night, I cannot say whether the hold was open in the night or not; the next morning I saw the hold open, I waited for that purpose; they did not come out of the hold till the day after, during that time they were under my care.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they brought up on deck the day after? - A. They were; and they were in the same state as they were when delivered on board the ship by the prisoner. In the morning, as soon as the hatch was open, I went down to inspect them; I found there had been formerly screws, and in the room of the screws that were taken out, there were put old nails which would not fit the holes; the smallest case that was iron bound, which is marked P. A. B. some part of it seemed to be very much broke indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not open them at that time? - A. No; the next morning I made a report, after they were put on board.</p>
               <p>Q. The morning of the 22d of March, you made a report? - A. Yes; and on the 23d, I put them on deck, and sent them on shore.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had parted with them, were they in the same state as when delivered by the prisoner? - A. There was some little difference made by Mr. Raines's men, who had been opening them, after Plumrage had been on board; Plumrage was present at their opening.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner came with the chests, did you hear any thing done when he came along-side of the vessel? - A. I heard him hammer.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the hammering that you heard was in the boat? - A. I suspected that it was at first, but I afterwards found it was upon the deck, as they came over the bows.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it as he was delivering you the package as he came over the bows? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were on board the ship, how many seamen were there? - A. Several, and two mates.</p>
               <p>Q. The head mate has the controul of every thing on board the ship? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the mate give a receipt to the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he assign any reason to the prisoner for not giving the receipt? - A. I do not believe he did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Was the chief mate on board when the things were delivered? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no answer made by the second mate to the prisoner, that he would not give him a receipt, that no one but the first mate should give a receipt? - A. I did not hear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Evans on board at the time these things were delivered? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. He might hear it? - A. I did not hear it.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not mean to ask you whether any of you had not access to it, the property was under lock and key; now the second mate shipped the packages, and kept the key; had you no access to the property? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that you had not? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you sleep? - A. Aft.</p>
               <p>Q. Aft is a long way, that is one half of the ship; Whereabouts did you sleep? - A. Near the cabin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you sleep in the cabin? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you slept on the deck? - A. I slept in the fore hold.</p>
               <p>Q. That is below stairs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They might get from the cabin to the half deck, and from the half deck to the hold; if there was any secret they might get there without a key? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore this place, locked up, if a man got into the cabin, he might get there? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the chief mate come on board that night? - A. He did.</p>

               <p>Q. What day of the month was it? - A. The 21st of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Quite dark at seven o'clock at night? - A. Yes, it was; I should not have been able to have seen then without the assistance of the moon.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it darker on the Thames than in London, were there are many houses? - A. I could not see to take the marks without the light of the moon.</p>
               <p>Q. Yet you could see they were broke when they came into the ship? - A. Yes, apparently.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not your duty, not to have received<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110072"/>things that appeared to have been broke? - A. I did not see it till they were upon deck.</p>
               <p>Q. That is no answer - I ask you whether it is or not the duty of the chief mate, or the person who is superintendant of the ship? Is it not the duty of a Custom-house officer to refuse taking in goods that appear to have been plundered, aye or no? - A. I do not know how far that may go.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a Custom-house officer? - A. Five years.</p>
               <p>Q. And not know your duty yet - you keep accounts on board a ship? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got that book here to-night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not your duty to have entered in your book, that night, that these things appeared to have been plundered? - A. We are not so particular; if the captain and the mate receive it, we do not so much mind; when I had examined them more particularly the next morning I made a report.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. What part of the entrance to where the things were put was it that the mate locked up? - A. The hatch.</p>
               <p>Q. After the hatch is locked down, is there any access from the cabin to there? - A. There is a door that leads to it opposite the cabin-door.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were in possession of the cabin? - A. The chief mate, and the second mate.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Erabraim. I am a Custom-house officer, a searcher: When I got on board the Kingston, on the 22d of March, I went down into the hold, I saw one package marked P. A. B. with an iron hoop round it; they appeared to have been screwed, but the screws were drawn, it appeared to me to have been plundered.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did it appear to you that it had occurred by accident or by design? - A. By design: I opened it, and there was a little box with a hat, some red cotton, red and blue thread, that was all that I found in this case; the one marked N and a diamond, it appeared to have been broke, it appeared to have Irish linens, I did not take the lid off quite; I saw there was a cavity in which were some birch broom stuffed in it; there was another package, it did not appear that there was any thing taken out; I left them in charge of the officer.</p>

               <p>Q. How long would it have took them to have opened the case in a regular manner, without doing the case any damage? - A. I cannot say, they were broke in such a manner; they might have compleated it, as it was done, in the space of twenty minutes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When you saw them they appeared to have been broke; where they were broke you cannot tell; on board the ship, or elsewhere? - A. I cannot.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110073"/>in the Strand; do you remember seeing the prisoner Howes in the month of November? - A. It was the last week in November; he came to buy some goods he said for a friend of his at Portsmouth that was going to the West-Indies; he desired me to be quick, for the ship was going off.</p>
               <p>Q. What direction did he give you? - A. He gave me this kind of a card. (Shews the card.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send the things? - A. I did in the course of three days.</p>
               <p>Q. When he called upon you what then passed? - A. He gave me a draft of thirty guineas; I gave him four pounds one shilling; the goods came to more when they were packed up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you endeavour to get your goods back in consequence of an information? - A. Yes, a porter brought them back the morning after, and in half an hour after that a person brought another bill, in the name of W. Williams: in about an hour and an half the prisoner Thodey came; that was the first time I saw him; he said he was come to accept a bill; I said, what bill; he said, Mr. Howes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew him this bill? - A. I did, and I asked him about Mr. Howes; he spoke very highly of Mr. Howes as a professional man; he said that he had got him a cause a twelvemonth ago; he accepted this bill in my presence, in my house; I saw him write it, and he promised to give me the four pounds one shilling that I had given to Howes; Mr. Howes wrote upon the back of it, and Mr. Thodey signed it.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this indorsement signed? - A. At the same time; it might be a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Howes present when Thodey accepted it? - A. He was; I told him I wanted my four pounds one shilling; upon this Mr. Howes wrote this memorandum at the back of the bill, and Thodey: signed it; and Thodey told me he would call in the evening, and give me the balance; and while Howes and Thodey were present, my neighbour, Mr. Bird, came in; I shewed him the bill; he asked them several questions; I began to be alarmed, I was very ill; Mr. Bird began to question them who drew it; they were agitated and confused, and I began to suspect.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You had been for some time acquainted with the prisoner Howes? - A. No, never before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never employ Howes as a lawyer? - A. Only a week before; I believe he was employed to recover eighteen pounds; Mr. Simpson brought him to me, and Howes said he had got a good order for me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he recover that money for you? - A. No, I had no money; he deceived me very much.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was Simpson? - A. He belonged to one of the play-houses; the eighteen pounds I never had; I had been plundered very much; he was a Jew that accepted that bill.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You gave this Howes an order to get your debt, and in about a week after they were taken up? - A. I never expected to get it.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew where Simpson lived, therefore you had an opportunity of enquiring about Howes? - A. I knew at that time, then he lived at No. 12, London Road.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had some conversation with Howes concerning an order for a person at Portsmouth, Mrs. Williams called upon you; previous to that you had sent the goods; they were in the possession of Howes, at his lodgings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not approve of the security he had given you; he returned the goods? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. After a whole night he had them in his possession? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mrs. Williams after tendered you the bill, neither of them came at that time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The bill was then unaccepted; where does Mrs. Williams live? - A. No. 4, Temple-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after Mrs. Williams called did the prisoner Thodey call; the bill was drawn upon Mrs. Williams and directed to

I said I have a friend, I shall consult my friend; I wanted to keep them; they were in my possession, the cut glass was, when Thodey came to accept the bill.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The goods that Howes had were returned again? - A. Yes, all but some plate-frames.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Thodey write that acceptance of the bill before Howes made his appearance at your house? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. I believe you were somewhat uneasy about the four pounds, and you sent for Mr. Howes by Thodey? - A. No, I sent for Mr. Bird; he came before Mr. Bird was there; I am certain that he came without being sent for: Thodey said, when he came, he had called to accept the bill drawn by W. Williams; he wrote

             sworn. - I am the wife of the last witness, at half past eight o'clock at night, I went to put my little girl to bed before I went up stairs; I opened the kitchen-door, my sister was in the kitchen; I told her to mind that nobody came into the shop; when I went up stairs I left my street-door shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your's an open shop? - A. My shop has a large glass bow window.</p>
               <p>Q. How does your door shut? - A. With a latch; I was not up stairs five minutes; when I returned again, I found my street-door open; I asked my sister who had been in the shop, she said nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your sister here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you staid up stairs long enough to put your child to bed? - A. Yes; I had sent my sister up before.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is she? - A. My little girl is seven years old; I went to my fore-door immediately; I saw a little boy, I received some information; I run over the way to the sign of the Blue Anchor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your husband there? - A. Yes, he was spending the evening; he had just gone; I opened the parlour-door, and said, Dunant, the till; I could say no more my fright was so great.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came home you looked for the till? - A. I went into the shop and looked for the till, it was gone; I did not know what the amount of the money was then exactly; I knew it was near three or four pounds in copper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the persons of these two men? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Your sister is not here? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any light below? - A. There was a candle on the counter, and my sister had a candle by the fire in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the candle away when you went up stairs? - A. I took the candle away where I sat, my shop is first, and my parlour is second, and the kitchen is behind all, on a floor.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Can they see from the kitchen into the shop? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the door was latched? - A. Yes, I am sure the door was latched; I had a customer in the shop; I went after them and latched the door, as I always do; I am positive I latched the door.</p>

             sworn. - I am used to go out to service; I have been very ill, and now I go out a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110078"/>cleaning; I had been over to Stepney, and returning home, on Friday, the 23d of March, between eight and nine o'clock, I met Briggs; he had at his right side something like a till.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - A. I never saw him before that I know of; I met him in Brook-street, just by Shakespeare's Rope-walk; he had a till by his right side, and with the flap of his coat over it; I perceived both penny-pieces and half-pence in the till; the moon was very bright; I said to him I wished they were mine as I passed him; he made no answer; he had another with him; but as to say I should know the other, I should not.</p>
               <p>Q. Which is Briggs? - A. That man in the yellow waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure? - A. I am positive they went towards the Commercial Road, and I saw them no more till after they were brought back into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon were they brought back? - A. I believe it might be half an hour, not more; Briggs was brought back first, to the sign of the King's-head, in Brook-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was brought back, were you sure he was the man you saw with the till? - A. I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the till when he was brought back? - A. No, he had nothing then; I knew him by his person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You had never seen Briggs before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - A. I am a servant.</p>
               <p>Q. You are out of place? - A. No, I go out to cleaning and washing sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there is a forty pounds reward if you convict this man? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know; has not Turnbull the officer talked about it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had any conversation with him about it? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a moon-light night? - A. Yes, I am sure of that.</p>

               <p>Q. I observed that at first you said it was something like a till? - A. Yes, and about the breadth of my hand was uncovered.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, as it was under his coat, how could you see they were penny-pieces? - A. They were just enough uncovered to see that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Briggs tell you, that if you did not come forward, he would take you to the House of Correction? - A. No, he did not say a word about that.</p>
               <p>Q. You have always sworn to the tallest of the two? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you read or write? - A. I can read a little, but not write.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you it was the 23d of March? - A. It was my birth-day on the 7th.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to state it to the Jury that you knew it by your birth-day, that it was the 23d of March? - A. No, I heard it when he was brought back; I did not know he was taken till he was brought back into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you take notice of the tallest? - A. I did not notice the little one.</p>
               <p>Q. You liked the tallest best? - A. I did not like either of them; I took notice of him, because he had the money.</p>
               <p>Q. It is the money only? Do you mean to swear positively to his person? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you know of this transaction? - A. Going along the Commercial-road on the 23d of March, between the half-way house at Stepney-Causeway, these two prisoners and a boy along with them, seeing me come along, they turned out of the road directly, they seemed to have something under their coat, and they carried it along-side of them, with the flap of the coat over it; I think it was on the right side, I was about ten yards off.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see what it was? - A. I could not see particularly what it was, because he had it under his coat; I had suspicions, by their turning out of the road, they had been doing something they should not; I turned back, and looked which way they went, they stopped about forty yards from me; I went on about twenty or thirty yards further, and

He had it on his shoulder; the till was emptied into his apron, and he carried it then on his left shoulder, and held it with his right hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he that apron when he went up the passage? - A. Yes, before he went up the passage we saw him with it; then Edward Passey and I took him; he seemed obstreperous, and said we should not take him; we told him we would take him, and we took him near the half-way house; we had only one then, Briggs.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take the other? - A. Passey thought Briggs would be too many for him, so we got hold of him, each on one side; when we got him nearer the half way house, he seemed stronger than we thought he was; then Turnbull came up, he took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other one? - A. Dunant took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that Taylor was the other person that was walking on the other side? - A. I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a moon-light night? - A. Yes; they were taken to Turnbull's office, and from there to the Thames Police; we found the till in a gravel-pit, I was the first that saw it in a gravel-pit in the Commercial-road, nearly opposite where I saw them first.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw it, was it like a till or like a bundle? - A. I cannot say; I was ten yards off.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. (To the Prosecutor.) Q. Whether he ever missed any thing while I was with them, being employed frequently by him, sometimes I have been employed there for three weeks? - A. I never detected her in any thing, but at the time she was employed I had no servant and no lodger in my house; I lost my shirts and waistcoats; she told me, when she was in custody, she had taken three pair of stockings, a waistcoat, and other things she had robbed my house of, and had pawned them at Mr. Dobree's, and that the duplicates were all burnt, except this one.</p>

             sworn. - My husband is a bricklayer; about the middle of March, the prisoner came to me, and asked me to lend her a shilling, and she would leave me that duplicate till Monday; a woman that I met at the door, Mrs. Crane, told me it was stole, and desired me to take it to Mr. Farmer's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take it to Mr. Farmer's? - A. I did.</p>

               <p>Q. (To the Prosecutor.) Look at the ear-rings? - A. I know them to be mine; I bought them at the corner of St. Swithin's alley; they were under lock and key at the time they were stole; my house was in a deal of confusion; I had two physicians attending, and an apothecary three or four times a day; I believe I left the key somewhere careless; I have had them in my hand since Mrs. Farmer's death.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. When I saw you, Mr. Farmer, did I not say that Mrs. Farmer gave them me; the reason was, you once broke a pair of earrings in her ears, and therefore she would not wear any more, you were so passionate; they were given me by the deceased upon my word; I have been backwards and forwards for a twelvemonth; I am not saying but he paid me honest and just, but his treatment to his wife was bad.</p>
