            . I am a hay salesman, at St. James's market. On the 5th of May, the prisoner came to me, and paid me for a load of hay, which he had bought of a man who I employ - I believe him to be the person, I have no doubt of it. It came to 4 l. 2 s., he gave me a cheque for 9 l. 10 s., which I produce - I gave him change, and took it to Messrs. Jones and Loyds, it is drawn on them by H. C. Lloyd; they did not know the person, and it was not paid. On the 13th of October, I saw the prisoner again at Bow-street - I have no doubt of his person. The man who sold him the hay is not here.</p>

After the robbery, I compared the numbers with the blocks, and missed this and two others, it is worth 15 l. or 16 l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was any of it sold - A. Yes, seven or eight years before. The blocks are all marked different. I took stock two years and a half before the robbery, it was safe then - I cannot say when it was stolen; Fletcher had formerly been employed by me, but being weak, I allowed him to stand on the wharf with his truck, to convey empty boxes and light things for people. I was present when he was convicted of stealing the tin.</p>

            , ESQ. I have a house at Edmonton, Middlesex. This is a correct plan of my premises, (producing it) the laundry is about eighty feet from the dwelling-house, a wall incloses it with the house, on the East side of the house, and extends round it, the laundry is within the wall, which is joined by an iron fence, and the whole incloses the premises.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. On which side is the laundry - A. On the West, beyond that is the wash-house, dairy, and a coal place - the wall is a continuation, it is completely inclosed with the dwelling-house; my garden is inclosed by a wall, and the drying ground by a paling.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are we to understand that the garden, and dairy, are under the same protection, as the other part of the dwelling-house - A. Yes, nobody could get at them without breaking over the fence or wall.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Ray. I and two other servants had been washing on the 30th of October, I was the last person in the laundry - I was there at nine o'clock at night, locked the door, and took away the key; the articles stated in the indictment were there, part of them were Mr. Ray's, and part belonged to the other servants.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. In what state was the wash-house window - A. I cannot say, I know the laundry window was shut. The wash-house communicates with the laundry.</p>
               <p>COURT. A. Do they communicate internally - A. Yes, you go from one to the other without going out. I locked one wash-house door, which is an outer door, but not the door between the laundry and wash-house - the window has iron rails before it, and nobody could get through it into the wash-house or laundry, without breaking them. It appeared in the morning, that they had entered through the wash-house door, which I had left secure.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Ray. On Wednesday morning the 31st of October, at five o'clock, I came to the premises, and found the Lodge gate open, it is in the high road - I came up to the passage door leading to the coal room, which was burst open, and the bolt of the lock out from the lock, the catch was wrenched off - I found the wash-house door broken open, and there was a mark of a tool, on the door close to the lock, and I found the coulter of a plough there, which I applied to the marks, and it fitted, it was Mr. Ray's coulter, and was in the plough which lay under the haystack the night before. The laundry and wash-house windows have iron bars - I did not find them broken, the persons must have come in through the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far are the bars apart - A. About four inches. The haystack is at the further side of the field, you go through the lodge gate into that field. It was very dark when I came in the morning.</p>

            . I am a constable. I accompanied Harland and Bramhall with a search warrant to the prisoner's house on Saturday, the 3d of November, at noon; he lives at Bow's Farm, about two miles from Mr. Ray's. I found him and a woman there, I was reading my warrant, and Ray's servant said, in his hearing, "There is some part of the property," which hung by the fire. In a drawer I found some lace, a cap, and handkerchief. I went into the bedroom, and found a sheet hanging up to dry, and under some sacks there was a wet bundle containing towels and handkerchiefs, cut to pieces. I found other property in a chest in the same room, and up stairs, I found a pair of sheets hanging on the line wet and dirty, as if they had been in the dirt. I took the prisoner in custody, he said I need not touch them for they were his property, he said so when I found the handkerchief or frill in the bed-room. I said "We will touch nothing but what we want" - then he said "A manbrought them here for my wife to wash, and gave her 5 s. to do them." I took the things to the Magistrate, and they were dried there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you said you was come to search the house - A. Yes; he said he had nothing there, and I was welcome; I began to read the warrant, and the servant said some of the things hung there - He spoke of a handkerchief or frill as being his, I did not take that.</p>

They were all in the laundry on this night, and are worth above 3 l. - I swear to every one of them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In what state was the linen when you left it in the laundry on Tuesday - A.

               <p>Q. Did you then leave the house - A. No; Mrs. Deakin having a good deal of ironing to do, I sat in the house all night; he got up about six o'clock in the morning - I then asked him about carrying me some potatoes.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Where did you live - A. About one hundred yards off, at the Old Cock, public-house. I thought I was locked out, and stopped there - I did not like to trouble them by knocking them up; I went to Deakin's about eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you go there for - A. I used to dress his wounds when he was scalded, he had no wounds then; I went to sit there an hour or two, as I often do.</p>

On the evening of the 10th, or the morning of the 11th of November, we lost 4 cwt. of loaf sugar from the lump-room, in the sugar-house. Our servants sleep in the dwelling-house, communicating with that room, it is not under the same roof - we have two ways into the sugar-house, one from the street, one from the yard, and a third from the men's apartments. I cannot say when I saw the sugar safe. The persons had entered at the garret windows of the sugar-house; nobody slept there, I saw the sugar on Sunday morning at Lambeth-street office, and knew it by marks on it.</p>

Between six and seven o'clock the next morning, I heard the sugar was stolen; I went to the garret window, and found it open and some things in disorder<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050007"/>- I missed, I thought about forty loaves; they weigh from nine to eleven pounds each, they had been taken out through the garret window - I saw them that day at Lambeth-street office, and knew them by the marks; they got them out at the window, they must have carried them through Mr. Herbert's empty warehouse, they could then get down stairs into the street - half a square of glass was taken out at the garret window, there was then room to put a hand inside to undo the button - the window was quite taken out.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the morning of the 11th of November, at a little past eight o'clock, I saw the prisoners very near the prisoner Newman's house; I went into that house, they were then a little way from the door; I went into the front room and up stairs, seeing the stairs were very dirty, and found a quantity of sugar there, neither of the prisoners came in - I came down and called Freeman, my brother officer in; they were then in a little place close by, standing by some harness. He bought them in, neither of them had their hats on, Newman had neither waistcoat or handkerchief. I told him to put his things on to accompany me; I handcuffed the other prisoner, and asked where his hat was, he said he had none, I said "You must have a hat," he then said it was up stairs; Freeman went up and brought one down, he said that was not his; I asked where it was, he said up in the bed or on the bed, I do not know which - Freeman brought another down from the room the sugar was in, which he said was his, and put it on. Newman's clothes were in the lower room on the ground floor; there was a bed in the room, I do not know who lived in it. The sugar could not be carried by one man, nor two, all at once; this place was about 150 yards from the prosecutor's. I examined the premises, but cannot say how many persons had been there; there were footmarks on the lead, but I cannot say whether it was from one or more persons. The prisoners said they knew nothing about it; the room it was in was open, I believe there was a lock on the door and the key was in the lock.</p>

            . I am an officer. Foster's account is correct; I went up stairs for the hat, Wiggins at first said he had no hat, Foster said "You must have a hat," he then said it was up stairs. I did not know that either of them lived there till that morning; I have seen them in the same room at a public-house together, I cannot say they were in company. The first hat I brought down he said was not his; I found his own among the bedclothes - Newman occupied the ground floor; there are only three rooms, the other room was empty. I think one person could not have carried the sugar away, as it must be deposited in two or three places before it could be got away; they must have drawn a ladder from the sugar-house up to the garret windows, the garret is on a level with the windows; it must have been carried along the leads and through the tiles into Herbert's warehouse, and down by a loose ladder to the first floor; then the ladder must have been shifted and carried down to the bottom floor of the warehouse, which is where they first entered, and from that to Newman's, is 150 or 200 yards off. I think it is impossible for them to be carried into Newman's house without his hearing it; if it was carried when it was light, they must be liable to be seen by people - Newman's bed-room is on the right of the ground floor passage.</p>

            . I am a cheesemonger, and live in St. Martin's-le-grand. On the 12th of November, the prisoner came to my shop and asked if I wanted to buy waste paper, and produced a quantity of copy books, not used, I believe forty-six. I asked where he got them, he said his fellow apprentice gave them to him, and that his masters<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050008"/>were Messrs. Baldwin Craddock and Joy, Paternoster-row. I said I thought they were not honestly come by, and I would not buy them; he said very well, he would take them back. I then thought I would buy them to detect him; they weighed 4 3/4 lbs. at 4 d. per lb. - I paid him 1 s. 5 d. for them. In about an hour, I went to Messrs. Baldwin and Co's., and from there to Messrs. Whitaker's, in <placeName id="t18211205-6-crimeloc35">Ave Maria-lane</placeName>

I am a constable of Blackfriars.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050009"/>About half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, of the 9th of November, I was sent for to Evangelist-court, and saw the prisoner, and took her in custody - she had all the articles stated in the indictment in her apron, she said they belonged to her uncle, and she would send for him, if I thought proper - did not tell name, or where he lived; she lived in Whitecross-street, I detained her on suspicion. At the examination Mrs. Fox claimed the things, as the property of Windurs. I found four keys, all of which will open Windur's door. I found one in the door at Evangelist-court, and three under the mat.</p>

At the end of the second act, the prisoner and his companion rose instantaniously, to quit the Theatre - I immediately felt for my pocket-book, and finding it was gone, I charged the prisoner with having taken it; he denied it, he rose to go out, and his companion was going away in a different direction - I seized the prisoner, we struggled considerably for some minutes, in the course of which, we had moved towards the side of the benches, I saw him stretch out his arm as far as he could under the benches, apparently as if depositing something there - I asked the people who sat there to look if there was a pocket-book near their feet, Mr. Williams who sat third or fourth on the bench from the end, picked up my pocket-book, and gave it me. I detained him with some difficulty, and gave him in charge of Bond. I should know the person on my left, he went out on the opposite side while we were struggling, and when he stretched out his arm, no other person stood near us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. When you entered the Theatre, there were many people about you - A. Yes; the pit was not at all crowded till after the second price. Several people were with the prisoner, they left, only the prisoner and the other sat near me. The lining of my pocket was cut at the bottom, I charged him with it without asking any one if they saw him do it - he was genteely dressed - the pocket-book was found within arms reach of the prisoner.</p>

Directly after Mr. Thomas turned round in the direction in which I stood, and desired the persons near me to look for a pocket-book; I stopped<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050010"/>down, and directly under my seat, picked one up, and gave it him, he claimed it - they were at the end of the bench behind me.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BOND. I am a constable, attending the Theatre. The prisoner was given in my charge; he was well dressed - the pocket-book was cut, I found a small knife on him.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 2d of November, about half-past one o'clock in the morning, I found Mr. Ward's door open, a young man stood with his back against the shutters, I asked him why the door was open, he made no answer - I walked into the passage, and the man said, "Come out of there d - n your eyes, what are you doing there." He had no sooner spoke, than a man darted out of the back parlour into the passage, and I apprehended him, I took it to be the prisoner - I held him for three minutes, and then he broke away from me; I sprung my rattle, and pursued him, he was taken in about four minutes - I lost sight of him, as four hackney-coachmen stood in the way, ran, and crossed me, I did not lose sight of him a moment, and then saw him again - I noticed as he ran, that he had no hat on, I found a hat in Ward's passage after he was taken to the watch-house. When he was first brought back he was in custody of Vincent. I examined the house, but could find no marks of the door being forced - I suppose it must have been opened by a false key, no keys were found on him. I tried the hat on the prisoner at the watch-house, it would go on his head, but was rather too big for him. I went to the house, and alarmed Mr. Ward - I was absent from the house about five minutes; I then found the hat, the clock was missed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You lost sight of the man who ran out - A. Yes; the coachmen interrupted my view. He said the hat was not his - I put it on, and it dropped down over his eyes. I did not see him secured, as I was on the other side of the coach - he got into the coach, and on my opening it, he got out on the other side, I kept my eye on him till he got into the coach. I had known him by sight four or five years, he is a hackney-coachman - when I first saw him, it did not strike me that it was a person whom I knew.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the morning of the 2d of November, I was in Bow-street, and about half-past one o'clock, heard Sullivan's rattle spring - I came to the top of Charles-street, and saw the prisoner running, and Sullivan in pursuit - the prisoner then crossed the coaches and got into one of them; when I got up to the coach, Sullivan had the door open, and was going to pull him out, he jumped out on the other side - I came round the horses heads to the opposite side, and he ran down Charles-street again; I pursued him, he ran round the coaches, and came up the street again, and when he came up close against the third coach, he sat himself up close against the horses, and I took him - I cannot say whether he had a hat on when I first saw him; he had one on when I took him, and a coachman whipped it off his head and said it was his.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time you pursued him had he any opportunity of getting a hat - A. I cannot say, for he went round the coaches different times. I am sure he is the person whom I first saw - I did not know him before; I might lose sight of him when he got into the coach, but at no other time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not know him before - A. No. There were twelve or fifteen coaches there - I think he could not mix with the other coachmen, as more watchman were pursuing him - I did not lose sight of him, I only saw his back while he ran round the coaches; the hat might be put on his head, but I did not see it done. The coachmen did not interfere to stop him - I was within a foot of him when he stood up at the horses heads.</p>

I did not see the man who was running away, to distinguish him, till he got out of the coach - he had no hat on then; I saw him taken, I lost sight of him once for a moment, he ran round the coach rank two or three times - he had a hat on when he was taken; I saw a hat thrown from one of the coachmen to him, just before he was taken, but whether the coachman put it on his head or into his hand I cannot say, when he got it on, he turned round to the horses, as if he was attending to them - a coachman came and took the hat off his head, I caught hold of it and asked what business he had with it, he said it was his own, and that the prisoner took it off his head, the prisoner said nothing to it - he was within a yard of him. I cannot say whether he heard it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was taken off his head while he was being taken away in custody - A. Yes; we had not moved towards the watch-house, he was taken instantly.</p>

            . I am a constable, of Bow-street. I saw the man who was running after he came out of the coach, he then had no hat on; I came to the horses heads, and found the prisoner was secured - I cannot say he was the man who was running; I was about a foot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050011"/>from him when I first saw him, I seized him momentarily with the watchman; I am not positive that the man I seized was the man who ran, the watchman had seized him while I ran round the coach and met him, he was out of my sight for a moment - when I caught sight of him again, he had a hat on his head, a man knocked it off and said "This is mine;" the prisoner said nothing. There was a great noise, I heard him very plain, he was not out of my sight above a second - I saw nobody else running away.</p>
               <p>Q. If the person you had seen without a hat had ran away, must you have seen him - A. Yes; I can speak with certainty to him, as I have known him for years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are not certain that the man who was taken is the man who ran - A. No; A handkerchief hung out of the hat down his back, which fell when the hat was taken off - I believe the coachman picked it up.</p>
               <p>MR. WARD re-examined. My door was fastened when I went to bed at twelve o'clock, I was not the last person up, I saw it fast about a quarter before twelve o'clock, I always see it fastened, it was not bolted, only on the single latch, my lodger, (Mr. Allen,) being out at the time; and I left Mr. Gladstanes up with a friend. When the watchman came, I went into the back parlour and missed the timepiece off the sideboard; it was not carried away, only removed into the next parlour - it was nearer to the front of the house than the parlour in which it was; a small tea-chest was taken off the drawers behind the parlour door, and taken away entirely. I and my wife went to bed at the same time, leaving Mr. Gladstanes up - my back parlour door was not locked, but shut; a light was left there for the lodgers. There is a door from the front to the back parlour, which was left open, but the door from the front room to the shop was forced open; it had been locked, but was forced.

I saw three men on my right, and two on my left hand - one man on my left hand called out "Now," and pointed to my reticule, when two of the three on my right caught hold of my bag, it was twisted round my hand; I pulled it towards me, and then the prisoner pushed me back and struck the back of my hand with his fist; it was a violent blow, and made me quit my hold - I am quite sure of his person. I let go of the reticule, the two men pulled it and broke the string, which they left round my hand. Mr. Johnson struck the prisoner over the head with a stick, which made him reel against the wall; Mr. Johnson then seized him, he tried to get from him, but he held him till the officer came and took him - the reticule was a black silk bag, worth 1 s., it contained the articles stated in the indictment.</p>

            . I am a surgeon in the East India Company's service, and live in Ratcliff-highway. I was walking with the prosecutrix in Brick-lane, about seven o'clock, and at the end of Thomas-street, I saw the prisoner and two others on the right, and two on the left by a post; but as we came up, one of the three on the right snatched at her reticule - I struck one of them with my stick, I saw the prisoner strike the prosecutrix on the back of her hand as she was struggling for her reticule. I immediately struck the prisoner several blows on the head which made him reel against the wall, and I secured him. On his recovery, he said he had nothing to do with it, that he was merely passing by and he would run after the others, but I seized him by the breast and held him till the officer came - I am sure he is one of the three.</p>

His parents keep a green-stall in Park-street. After he left me, he used to call occasionally; he called on the 25th of September, about three o'clock in the afternoon, and broke some flint stones in my area; I live in the kitchen. I took him to a public-house and gave him a pot of porter, we came back and I gave him sixpence. He wanted to do some jobs for me, he said "You have got something that wants cleaning in the cupboard I know" - I know, he opened the cupboard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050012"/>and took a bill-book out and covered it with a cloth. He said he was going to clean it. My watch hung in that cupboard - I saw him go to the cupboard again and take the watch down - I said "What are you going to do with the watch," he said, it was about four o'clock. He looked wild, I walked towards the door to look for assistance, he came and collared me, I found him too strong for me - he ran up and banged the door and took away my watch. I went up stairs and called Stop thief! but he was gone - I did not see him again till the last day of October, when he was in custody. I never got my watch - I gave twelve guineas for it, it was gold; I had had it thirty years, and bought it second hand - I have been told it would fetch seven or eight guineas.</p>

I lost the articles stated in the indictment while she was with me, at different times; the frock was a child's frock, and cost four guineas and a half; it is Moravian work. I got a search warrant on the 14th of November, and went to search her apartments, near Cornwall-street, and found all the property, some in a drawer and some in a box; some were rough-dried, as I had lost them. She was in custody on another charge at that time. When I missed the frock, she assisted me in looking for it - She was married to a sailor, who is gone to sea - he was never at my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Where were they found - A. In the room she occupied. I know where to find the servant who lived with me before her. I missed the frock a fortnight before the prisoner left.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the frock in your house after the prisoner entered your service - A. I cannot be certain; every thing else was there - she has washed them several times.</p>

I rent part of the house, it is let out in tenements by the landlord, who lives two doors off, but he occupies the cellar under his own house; nobody belonging to him sleeps there. On the 6th of November, a few minutes before nine o'clock, I was in my shop; the sash of the window was forced up, and a pair of shoes taken from it. I saw the window shake as it went up, I ran to the street door and found it was tied outside - I gave it a jerk and broke the cord, ran out, and saw two boys running down the street very fast; I caught hold of one of them, which was Burton - I brought him back and fetched the patrol, he said he knew nothing about it, he and was innocent - nothing was found on him. I examined, and missed the shoes - I let him go as he had nothing, I have since seen my shoes in possession of Sutton, the other boy was rather bigger than Burton, it was not Hall - I only saw two boys; I am sure the window was shut down, they could not get the shoes without throwing it up, they were close to the sash - I have the cord here.</p>

On the 6th of November, he went out about five o'clock without my leave - I was ill in bed at the time, he returned at one o'clock. I asked where he had been, he said, to his father's; I said I should go to his father, but did not. About twelve o'clock the next day, I sent him on an errand, he was gone from twelve o'clock till three, and brought home a rabbit - I asked where he got the money from, he said, going along Air-street-fields, a lady asked him to carry a bundle, and while he carried it, he stole a silk handkerchief out, and sold it for 3 s. At nine o'clock, I told my brother of it, he said, in the prisoner's hearing, he had seen him tie a door in Air-street, and get under the window, and said he would not leave until he got a pair of shoes out; the prisoner said it was no such thing, but it was a handkerchief. Nothing more passed then. Next day, he said, if his mistress liked, he had got a pair of shoes cheap, I asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050013"/>where he got them, he said he tied a door in Air-street, while he pushed the window up, took the shoes out, and pawned them for 18 d.

            . I am brother to the last witness. I believe I am turned sixteen years old; I work at Fleur-de-lis-court. I was coming home, to Parliament-street, on the 6th of November, about half-past eight o'clock, I saw the prisoners and another, (I believe there was three) in Air-street - I called the prisoner, he came to me; I only knew Burton by sight, he was one of the two. I asked Hall if he was coming home, he said No; there was something to come very easy, and he should not leave till he got it. He asked me to jump it, I said "No, I sha'nt; I do not know what you mean." I went to the corner of Air-street, stopped there, and heard the window go up - I then looked and saw him take the shoes out; I then went home directly - it was him who pushed up the window. I told my brother he would hear something before long, and then went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you live with your brother - A. We had moved into a new house which was damp, and I slept in his back room with Hall. I told my brother of it on the Saturday night - Hall was taken on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not tell your brother before - A. He was ill in bed on Tuesday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not tell him on Wednesday - A. I had not time; I go to work at eight o'clock and do not return till nine at night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HALL. Q. Did not you tie the door - A. I did not, nor did I tell you it would be a good scheme.</p>
               <p>Q. You threw the window up and knocked the shoes down - A. I did not indeed; I asked him to come home, he said he should not, and I left.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you carry the shoes part of the way across Air-street-fields, and tell me to take them to my master - A. No; I did not pull out a knife and cut the string the shoes were tied with</p>

The prisoner never stopped out later than ten o'clock, we shut the door at eleven. I know he was at home at half-past five o'clock in the evening, but did not see him after. I never saw him again until he was taken - I locked and bolted the room door, and found it so in the morning.</p>

            . I am a corporal in the first battalion of Grenadier guards - the prisoner was a private in the regiment. On the 27th of November, about six o'clock in the morning, I met him in Coventry-street with a woman on his arm; the sergeant stopped him, and gave him in my charge for being absent from his quarters all night, he wished to go away with the woman - I refused to let him; he said the woman had his watch, I said if she got it by improper means, I would give her in charge, he said, No he gave it her as he had met her, and been with her all night, and she spent some money and he gave it her as security, he asked if I would lend him a shilling, to give her for the watch, I gave him a shilling, and she gave it me - I afterwards produced it to the prosecutrix, who claimed it. I gave it to Jeffery.</p>

I examined the prosecutor's room, there was a wall ten feet high outside, and an iron railing round it - some person must have got on the iron railing, and then over the wall, they could then get on the wash-house, and through the window - the prosecutrix told me the name of the maker of the watch.</p>

            . I live in the parish of Wilsden. On the 25th of October, about nine o'clock in the morning, I went out and left nobody in the house - I took the key with me, and returned at four o'clock, and found the casement window taken out of the back of the house, the coulter of a plough laid by the window, and the shutters open - I tried the key to the front door, and found it was bolted; I had come out at the front door, and locked it - the inside shutters were forced open; I saw marks of the coulter on them, the window is about one yard from the ground, they got into the house through the window, I had left it secure, the casement is lead and nailed in. The coulter belongs to Mr. Denow's plough. On going in I missed a great coat, a close bodied coat, a pair of breeches, and other articles, besides 13 s. 6 d., in money - there was marks of a man's foot about the house, I could not distinguish them to be more than the marks of one person. On Monday the 29th, I caught the prisoner with my coat on at Paddington, opposite the Coach and Horses, public-house, I followed him into the King and Queen, public-house, and got Humphries to take him - he took the coat off when he got into the public-house, it was worth 9 s.; it cost me 18 s., all the things together are worth 3 l.</p>

The common is not enclosed, the clog was old, they sometimes come off - I thought she might have strayed after her colt, which I had sold about a fortnight before, it was at Reigate - I had had the mare four months, and knew her well, she was marked white down her face, and had two white fetlocks, and a large udder.</p>

I put the mare in the Green-yard, and on the 7th Hewett, saw it, and claimed it, and took her away, it appeared quite tired, and was all over clay, as if it had come from the country a considerable distance.</p>

On the 20th of November, about ten o'clock in the evening, I was returning home; I was near a house which was on fire, which alarmed me, and as I got up Brick-lane, the crowd was very great. I had the apprentice-boy with me, and sent him home to see that my husband was at home, as the fire was very near our house. I went up Brick-lane, a young lady accompanied me; I could not get by church in consequence of the crowd, and went down <placeName id="t18211205-31-crimeloc184">Princes-street</placeName>

There was a gaslight over my head, and a number of torches about, I was about fifty or sixty yards from the fire - I noticed the man who held me particularly, the prisoner is the man, I am certain; I knew him the moment I saw him again, and have no doubt of him.</p>
               <p>Q. While he held you, what happened to you - A. My clothes were lifted up and my pocket torn down and picked, it was not cut off - they ran away, the man who held me ran at the same time. A gentleman took hold of me as I fainted away, and I was taken home in a quarter of an hour. About an hour after I got home, I was fetched to the watch-house, and saw eight or ten men there, the prisoner was among them - I knew him immediately, and selected him from the rest as the person who held my pelisse - he was not pointed out to me, I have no doubt that he is the man. I lost a pocket-book, containing one 10 l. and a 5 l. Bank note.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You was in considerable alarm in consequence of the fire - A. Yes; but I am certain of the prisoner, it was done in an instant - I suppose it must be near eleven o'clock when I got to the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say at the watch-house "I cannot tell who robbed me, but he had a blue coat on, if you will examine and find he has a red pocket-book, that is the man" - A. No; I said I could not identify the man who took it, but the man sat there who held me - I did not charge the officer with being one of them at the office; I said one of them had a white coat on, like his, and was much such another man. The gentleman who assisted me said I was robbed; I felt, and missed one of my pockets.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in Union-street, Spitalfields. On the 20th of November, I was a special constable. I went to the fire about twenty minutes before nine o'clock, and saw the prisoner about one hundred and fifty yards from the fire, in company with two young women. I apprehended him about eleven o'clock that evening, not in consequence of any information - I was at the watch-house when Mrs. Wade came, that was between eleven and twelve o'clock. The watch-house was full of people, some standing and some sitting; she pointed out the prisoner herself, and said she believed him to be one who robbed her. I took no particular notice, and did not hear what she said further, as I went to the fire again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She said she believed he was the man - A. I think she said she believed, and at the office there was a man who she believed to be one - I said that was impossible, as I had him in custody at the time she was robbed. After speaking to the prisoner, she turned round to me and said she believed me to be one of them; I said "You do not think I was one," she made no answer - I had a light coat on.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You are sure she said she believed you to be one - A. Yes; she only spoke to the prisoner and another besides me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at a public-house in Lambeth-street, and about half-past ten o'clock, was coming down Brown's-lane, to go home, and in Red Lion-street Miller took me.</p>
               <p>JURY to WADE. Q. Do you know the gentleman who assisted you - A. No; he appeared a respectable tradesman, and had a white apron on. He took me to my door, and called on me the night before last, but I was out.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know the exact time that he left - A. Because the fiddle was to be stopped at a quarter past ten o'clock, and I went to tell the man my master would not let it play any longer. The prisoner was up stairs, sitting at the corner of the table with

Scott was also with them and went out with them - a young man was with her.</p>

More persons left the room with us, but they were not in our company, we three went away by ourselves; I know the girl brought some rum and water, and while I was dancing some gin and water was brought.</p>

Next day, I went to the pasture, between one and two o'clock, and the gelding was not there then - I saw it on Saturday, the 17th, at the Nag's Head, public-house, Whitechapel, in the care of Gibbs, at Mr. Lewis's - I am sure it is mine, I took it home on the Monday, it knew the way home and the place; it had a white face, and its two legs were white up to the hock, and it had a saddle-mark on its back - it was not cropped, it was stiff and tired - I do not know the prisoner.</p>

I said it was very early to take it to Smithfield, he said he did not know but it was - he said he brought from Attfield Broad Oak, and that he belonged to his master; I asked who his master was, he said, "

I live at Broad Oak, about seventeen miles from Chigwell, he worked for me at times, and at times ran away bird's-nesting, and is half silly. I could never make any thing of him, he was frightened at four years old by a hostler, who I had before the Magistrate for doing so - He did farming work, and would go away at particular times. I have worked for - Hampton, Esq. for thirty years. He went away about twelve o'clock last Tuesday three weeks, and was taken up on Friday morning - The fits caused a kicking and trembling.</p>

            . In consequence of what Goddard said, I looked down into the area and saw the two prisoners, I immediately locked the gate, and then went into the hall. Goddard said they had brought the coat out and put it in the cellar. I looked into the cellar but it was not there, there was a coal cellar just by, I did not look there but went back into the servants' hall, but it was not there, I went up and alarmed my master, and when I came back I found it thrown on some lumber in the hall, rolled up; it was not there when I went up. I suppose it was in the coal cellar, which is about a yard and a half from the dust-hole. I do not know the value, it had been in wear two years I should think. I saw it safe at twelve o'clock hanging in the hall.</p>

I left town on the 27th of October, and remained out of town till the 24th of November, my family were with me. I left my apartment locked up safe. I had two rooms, one opened into the gallery, and the other led out of that room into the bed-room. It was not connected with the Nag's Head, public-house. When I came home on 24th of November I found the lock prized open, and the locks of the drawers opened, and the articles stated in the indictment gone, which are worth above 3 l. I knew the prisoner when he was a boy, but had not seen him for years. Clemence produced the property to me in Branch's presence.</p>

            . I am a sawyer. I have the first apartment in the gallery; I saw the prisoner in the gallery, on the 18th of November, in the evening, at the prosecutor's door, going in. I watched him, and thought he wanted to break the door open, he came five different times up and down the gallery. I kept watching, and at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050021"/>last saw him come out of the prosecutor's room with a large bag on his back. I stopped him and asked what he had, he said his own clothes, which he got from his mother, Mrs. M'Gray. I said it was false, for he brought them out of the coachman's room. I took him into Potter's room. When we got to Mrs. M'Gray's room which is in the gallery, he ran into her room and got under the bed, we secured him. I gave Clemence the same property as I took from the prisoner. I found the staple of the outer door forced back, and all the boxes and drawers broken open.</p>

I ran to the window, called Watch, and went down and let him in - they searched the house - the prisoner was found in the next house. The things in the back kitchen dresser drawer were taken out but not taken away. Two keys belonging to the first floor rooms were taken out of the doors, brought down, and left in the passage by the front door. Mr. Jackson's candlesticks were found on the stairs. I found the back kitchen window thrown up, which would enable them to get in. I put it down myself the night before, but I cannot say whether it was fastened. All the other doors were safe, I was the last person that was in the back kitchen that night. The candlesticks are worth 19 s.</p>

I asked what business he had there; he said he had no place to sleep, and went in there to rest; it was an empty house. He had attempted to get up the chimney, and had knocked down all the mantle-piece. A knife, one shilling, and some halfpence were found on him. I charged him with having been in the next house - he did not deny it. There were wet foot marks on the stairs before we went up.</p>

            . I am a horse-slaughterer, and live in Grub-street. On the 26th of May, 1820, I delivered a pony to Jones, at the Bear and Ragged-staff, Smithfield. I received it that day from the prisoner, who gave his name as Ripley, of Charlton. He came to my shop and said he was recommended to me by Hulk and Williams,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050022"/>to sell me a horse, he said it was neither big nor little, that it was alive, and was at Westminster. I went there with him. As we went along, several men who appeared to be soldiers, spoke to him. I asked if he had been in the army, he said he had been a serjeant in the Coldstream Guards, and had his discharge. He took me to the Angel public-house, in Tothill-street; he went out and the mare was brought to the door, he said "Here it is, come over the way, we do not wish every body to hear our business;" he asked 3 l. for it, I said that was too much by half; I gave him 30 s. or 36 s. for it - we went and dined at a cook's-shop, and as I brought it home, the officres surrounded me in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray are you licensed to carry on this business - A. Yes; now, but was not then - I did not give any information to the Magistrate, I did not know it was necessary, I attended at the office a month or five weeks ago, I gave no information before that, all the officers knew it; I gave no information till the 3 d of November last. I went to Tothill-street the day after I bought the mare, and found he had given me a wrong name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell the Magistrate that you made the bargain at the Angel, public-house, but you did not know the name of the street - A. I do not think I did, my examination was read over to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, in the examination, that you did not know the name of the street - A. I recollect I did say that.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Little Rusel-street, Covent-garden. The prisoner came to my shop on the 20th of September, and asked me to advance him 9 s. or 10 s., on this spoon; it having a crest on it, I asked whose it was, he said it was his father's, who lived in Princes-street, very near me, and that he lived with him, but he was an out-door apprentice to Mr. Winstaple, a bedstead-maker, in Drury-lane. I said I wished to see his father before I advanced any money; he then left, to send his father, as I supposed, I sent one of my lads to follow him, he returned and said he had gone to Mr. Houlditch's - he immediately came into the shop again with a young man a little older than himself, saying, he was his brother; he said the lad had called on him, and that he worked at the prosecutor's (Houlditch's), and that the prisoner actually was an apprentice of Mr. Winstaple's, and that the spoon was the property of his father, who had been butler in a family. and had received this with many others, as a reward for his past services, which precisely agreed with what the boy had stated. I then lent him 9 s. on the spoon. On the 12th of October, he came again and brought a set of gig harness, and said Mr. Hinton, his brother, in Long-acre, had requested him to come with it - he said Mr. Hinton kept a shop; I advanced him 1 l. on it. On the 17th, he brought a coach harness, on which I advanced 30 s., after making a great deal of enquiry. On the 24th of October, he came again with two more sets of gig harness, I refused to advance any more till I saw Mr. Hinton; he said he would send him, and in the afternoon he came again with the same man whom he brought about the spoon - he said he came to speak to the correctness of the harness; I said I must see Mr. Hinton, they left, and did not come again, nor did I ever see Hinton.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. NORTON. Q. Was the harness in parts - A. No; it was buckled together all in one set; my house is not five minutes walk from Houlditch's, he was absent about long enough to go there - the man who he brought was about twenty-four years old; I understand he has absconded. The coach-harness was brought all together - it was heavy.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>MR. HOULDITCH. The prisoner's brother is not sixteen years old, he has been a year and a half with me. My brother and I live together, the boys occasionally go into the kitchen, where the spoons are. The value of the coach-harness is three or four guineas, they are not new; our shop and dwelling-house join, they are all one set of premises, but part of this property might be took from our premises over the way - here is one set of coach-harness, I am sure was taken from the house, it is worth above 40 s. I am not certain that it had not been moved - one Clemence was in our employ, has absconded - he is about twenty-five years old.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it customary to take harness over to the other premises - A. Yes; I saw this harness in the loft a few days before he was taken, part of the harness which was buckled to it still remains there. I should think the prisoner could not carry it away all together.</p>

            . I received the harness from the witness. When I apprehended the prisoner, he said two more men used to come to the shop a little after eight o'clock in the evening; they used to take the things away for the night, and bring them to him in the morning, and he pledged them. He said he took the spoon from the kitchen and pawned it, and gave the money to the two men. He took me to a public-house to find them, but no such men were to be found - he mentioned no particular harness, but said they used to come and stand opposite the shop, and he used to give them a harness at a time, and that Clemence, who has absconded, was concerned.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he say from where it was taken - A. From the warehouse.</p>

He went to dinner, I again went down with a candle and found in an iron safe, not in use, four pair of stockings. I sent for Mr. Maynard. When he returned I demanded his reason for rushing from the cellar to the privy, and said he would save himself much trouble by telling; he said he had done nothing to my injury, and was ready to answer it. I took him to the cellar with his father and shewed him the stockings, and asked if he put them there, and said "I presume they are the remains of a dozen," he said "Yes; a man in the street induced him to do it," and he had sold or given them to him.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty at the corner of Watling-street, near St. Paul's; Mines, the constable, beckoned to me to follow some persons; about three o'clock, we saw the prisoners at the corner of Cheapside, next to St. Paul's, in company, together with many others. I watched them towards Queen-street, I heard Miss Williams cry out that she was robbed, she was then down on her knees, and her scarf half off her shoulder. I saw Bartlett snatch the reticule from her hand; Wright was a very little distance from him - I noticed them in company all the way. I immediately seized Bartlett, he threw the reticule to Wright, whom Hughes secured and took it from him; I saw it in his hands. We took them to the watch-house - the reticule fell open as it was snatched.</p>

            . I am a constable. I saw Hoy at the corner of St. Paul's church-yard - I called him to my assistance, we followed a gang; I first saw the prisoners near St. Paul's church-yard. I saw Miss Williams against a door, she complained of having lost her reticule; the prisoners were both near her, I did not see it taken. Foy seized Bartlett and Hughes took Wright - there was a great crowd, I took Wright to the watch-house, the reticule was torn with the violence of the pull - I found 10 s. 6 d. on Wright and a gold ring on his finger.</p>

I received a bag from Greening to take to Lime-street, with a bill and receipt, and received orders not to leave them without the money - I went between one and two o'clock, and the prisoner opened the door to me, I said "I have brought some goods for Mr. Taylor;" he said "Mr. Taylor is not within, he is gone on Change," and would be in in an hour - I said I had orders not to leave them without the money, he said, "You may leave them till you go to your master's, and if he does not like them to be left, call again in an hour, and you shall have the money or goods, as they will be dry and quite safe here, I will take great care of them," this induced me to leave them, he said "I will send the money in an hour, or Mr. Taylor shall call in the course of the afternoon and pay for them" - I left them in consequence of the appearance of the warehouse, thinking it was all right, I told Greening what I had done - I went again in two hours, I did not see the prisoner then, but a dark young man named Ball. The name Taylor and Co. was on the door - I have called three or four times, but can find no Mr. Taylor there - the house was shut up about the 27th. I never saw the prisoner or Taylor until he was taken; I went with Hawkins on the 24th, to No. 12, Lime-street, and saw he prisoner there - I said "That is the man I delivered the goods to," and he took him. I have never seen Taylor nor the goods since.</p>

            . I live in Newgate-street, and am a carpet manufacturer. On Friday, the 26th of October, I went to No. 12, Lime-street, Taylor and Co., was written on both sides of the door - I did not see the prisoner there, I called twice on the same day. On the 27th I went to the house, it was completely closed then, and remains closed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was engaged as clerk to Taylor and Co. The man brought the goods, I received them with a bill and receipt - I said I had not sufficient money, and Mr. Taylor was not within, he said he must take them back, I said, very well; he hesitated for a quarter of an hour, I said "It rains hard if you like to leave them, and ask your master if you may leave them, I will take care of them," he did not return, and at four o'clock I left the warehouse. I told Mr. Taylor the goods were left, he said he would call and pay for them. On Monday and Tuesday, I was helping a man who opened a new shop, on Wednesday I went to the counting-house, and was apprehended - next day Taylor said he had tendered the money - he was taken in custody. Mr. Corf the partner, was arrested, and is in Whitecross-street prison. Taylor lived at Blackheath - I cannot find him.</p>

            . I am a surveyor of the Thames Police. On the 26th of November, about two o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner off Iron-Gate stairs, in Drummond's wherry - I boarded the boat, and said "What are you doing with this boat," it had "J. Drummond, Hermitage-stairs" on it, he said he was going to the Phoenix. I found part of a pair of braces in the boat, and in his trowsers pocket, a pipe key, which he said was the key of his lodging, at the Maze, in Tooley-street - I asked how long he had left White's-yard; he said six weeks. About four or five o'clock in the morning, I went to No. 2, White's-yard, where I knew he lodged, and the key opened the door of the front room - I found a shirt and two handkerchiefs there; a woman was there whom I knew he lived with. I shewed the things, and told him where I found them, he claimed them, and on Wednesday, Knott saw and claimed them - I had seen him at that house before in September.</p>

               <p>MR. DYKE. (Looking at the assignation book for 1815.) The first entry made of this suit, is on the bye day after Trinity Term the 2d of June, 1815, that only shews that the cause was pending. I find by the Court caveat book, that script A. was exibited on the 5th of September, 1815, script B. was propounded on the 22d of November, and repropounded on the 31st of January, 1816 - script A. was propounded in September, and abandoned when B. was produced. Neither A. nor B. bear any date.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was any thing done in the suit before the 26th of September, when script A. was propounded - A. Nothing, but the usual assignations were made, there was an order, that unless further scripts were produced, the Court would pronounce against A. if paper B. had been pronounced, we should have proceeded again on paper A. there was no unnecessary delay with reference to script A. I had notice from the other party, that unless I proceeded on the 5th of September, they should move the Court to grant administration - the notice is dated the 23d of August, and on the 5th of September, A. was exhibited, I gave notice of to my correspondents at Hull. There was no unnecessary delay.</p>

            . Q. You reside at Hull - A. I do; the prisoner also lived there, I have known him since 1810, and some years before that; between that time and the present, I have known him intimately, he came into my service as manager of my white lead works, in 1810, and remained till 1816 - he was principal manager; very important interests were entrusted to him, he always conducted himself exceeding well - he might have defrauded me of thousands of pounds without being detected, and I believe he never defrauded me of a penny, but behaved with fidelity.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. When did he leave you - A. About August, 1816. he went to reside at the end of the town, and commenced business on his own account, as agent for the sale of lead, he might have done business for himself while with me. I gave him 150 l. a year, house rent, taxes, and coals - he had a wife and two children. I knew where he lived. If there was any change in his mode of living after he left me, it was for the worse, there was no improvement. I believe he lived at Hull, up to the present time, except being abroad a short time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then he was forthcoming if any application had been made for him - A. Yes. There was no appearance of his having increased in wealth. He was abroad two or three months.</p>
               <p>The deposition made by the prisoner at Doctor's Commons, was then put in and read: - It stated in answer to the third article of the assignation put in by the opposite party, the deponent says, on the 30th of April, he called on the deceased after dinner, about three o'clock as was his usual custom, and found him ill, of the illness of which he died, the deceased was sitting with Eliza Robinson, and having enquired of him about his health,

               <p>To the fourth article, the deponent refers to what was before deposed, and says that when he left the deceased on the said Sunday he (the deponent) did not consider him to be in any imminent danger, and being much engaged on the following day did not apply to any person to make a more formal will, and on the next day the 2d of May, in the morning, he called at

               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was there incidental to this proceeding, what you call a decree by ways and means - A. Yes; it was respecting a man abroad having a right to oppose, by the assignation book it appears it was ordered on the 8th of December; the termination of the suit was in July, 1816, as the party did not appear in that interval. The letter enclosing script A. is dated the 2d of September. I have no doubt of script B. being the paper pronounced as the will, or that the allegation and depositions refer to that paper, it is deposited in the Prerogative Office with the clerk of the papers before probate. The Registrar receives it from me and hands it over to him, and after probate it goes into the possession of the Record-keeper.</p>

               <p>Q. At all times that was the state of their behaviour - A. At all times. I knew the prisoner perfectly well; after Mr. Robinson's death I was the only servant, I attended the door and did every thing. Mr. Robinson died six or seven months after I went there. I recollect Mr. Saxelbye being there only once in that time. I do not remember whether it was on a Sunday or week day. I do not know what he came for.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at home on Sundays, or had you leave to go out - A. I went out after tea, sometimes every Sunday, and sometimes once a fortnight. It was not usual for Saxelbye to come to see Mr. Robinson on a Sunday. Mr. Robinson was taken ill on Monday, the 1st of May; I remember the day before that (Sunday) Mr. Lockwood was with him most of that day, he came in the morning before ten o'clock, or a little after, and continued till one o'clock, and in the afternoon he came again, a little after two o'clock, and continued till six o'clock. Between twelve and one o'clock, Mr. and Mrs. Ballan called, they might stop half an hour. They dined at half-past one on that Sunday; Mr. Robinson, Mrs. Robinson, Miss

             sat down to dinner. When Lockwood came dinner was off the table - I believe there was some wine on the table. Miss Hewson went away, and Miss Philipson stopped, they continued all in one room together, and drank tea about six o'clock, I never saw Mr. Robinson go out of the room. Mr. Saxelbye never came into the house during that day. Mr. Robinson was not particularly ill on that day - he made no particular complaint, he complained of the coldness of the day. Mr. Martin his attorney called next day, and his clerk came, they both saw Mr. Robinson together. On Monday night, at eleven o'clock, or half-past, he was taken ill, quite deranged, and died on the Monday following; he was generally light-headed all that time, and had a nurse for two days.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after his death did you see Mr. Saxelbye at his house - A. Perhaps six or seven weeks after; he was frequently there, two or three times a week for a long time. I never heard him talk with Mrs. Robinson or any one about the will. I knew Messrs. Galon and Wilson, the attornies, Mr. Galon frequently came to our house, I cannot recollect whether he was ever there when Saxelbye was. I took a note to the prisoner at Mr. Picard's office from Mrs. Robinson, six or seven weeks after Mr. Robinson died, it was before he came to visit so frequently. I was ordered to deliver it into his hands, and ask what time he would call, which I did.</p>

             is dead, Miss Ann is living - Miss Hewson is Mrs. Robinson's sister, and Mrs. Stevenson was another sister, she is also dead. This was the first place I was at in Hull. I saw Saxelbye in the house once before my master died, but did not recollect his person till Mr. Robinson mentioned his name.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw him once when Mr. Robinson was alive, did you at that time know his name was Saxelbye - A. I did afterwards, for I heard Mr. Robinson mention Mr. Saxelbye many times over after he was gone.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT HULLOCK. Q. Mr. Robinson was not particularly ill in April - A. No; he had been ailing some time, he was not very ill, he could go out on business; he was not out on Sunday, but on Saturday he went out airing, in a post-chaise hired for that purpose; he had walked out within a week before.</p>
               <p>Q. How often will you swear he was out walking within a week of the 30th April - A. I will swear he was out once, but will not swear to more than once. I cannot say on what day it was. That was the first time of his going out in a chaise. Mr. Young was his medical attendant. Mr. Robinson had sent me for him once or twice before the 30th of April, it might be a week before, he was not there on the 30th.</p>
               <p>Q. That you swear - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At no period of that day between ten o'clock in the morning and ten at night did you see Mr. Young there - A. No; I did not let him in nor see him, he could not be there without my seeing him.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear distinctly he was not there on the 30th of April - A. I do, nor on Saturday. I was not out after tea on the 30th of April, nor at any time in the day. Mrs. Philipson was there.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did you not go out on that day about three o'clock - A. I did not, nor did she let me in. Mrs. Stevenson has a son, he was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Mr. Robinson having some celery on that day - A. There was no such thing in the house, if there had I must have seen it, I never remember it being sent at any time by Mr. Stevenson, he was not there on that day; nobody could let themselves in and out without my seeing them, for the kitchen door is right opposite the street door, and it was always open, if I shut it my master always opened it; I must see every body who comes in if I am in the kitchen, the street door is the only entrance to the house. Mrs. and Mr. Robinson did not live affectionately together.</p>
               <p>Q. Robinson could have left the house if he liked - A. Yes. They went out airing together. I left Mrs. Robinson in 1819, she died in 1820. I still reside at Hull.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you examined before to day on this matter - A. Not in Court. I was not examined at York, I was there last Assizes, but was not examined before the Grand Jury there, nor at Hull. I have known Mr. Rushworth, the attorney, above a year, I cannot say when I first saw him on this subject, it was better than a year ago; he applied to me - he did not say how he found me out - I had lived with Mrs. Robinson nearly down to this time - I was never asked about this before that. I was here in October on this business - I have been twice before the Grand Jury, but only once before this time. I left Hull last Sunday,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050028"/>and was in London a month or six weeks before on this business, they were the only times. The first time I communicated this to Rushworth was twelve months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate any thing to any one on the subject before you left your mistress's service - A. No; I first mentioned it eight or ten months after. I believe Mr. Lockwood first questioned me about it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did Lockwood come on Sunday - A. A little after ten o'clock, and continued till near one; he returned, and was there till near six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he knew every thing that took place during those hours, and must have known that you knew as well as him what took place - A. Yes; I let him in and out; the first time he applied to me was eight or ten months after I left Mrs. Robinson's. I believe I left at the latter end of April, it might be the 27th, it was on a Thursday. I saw Rushworth about two months after Lockwood applied to me; he came to me, I did not know him before - I told him what I have stated to-day.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You have been examined before the Grand Jury within the last few days - A. Yes; and once before that, only these two times. I did not leave my mistress on any ill terms - I have had no quarrel or dispute with the prisoner. I left my mistress in April, 1819, I did not tell Lockwood or Rushworth about this business till I was enquired of about it. I have been in service ever since I left Mrs. Robinson.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Whose service are you now in - A. Mr. Ansell's, he is single, his wife is dead, she was not living when I went; he has four children - I am the only servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know whether you were out on the 23d of April, 1815 - A. I cannot recollect; nor whether Lockwood was there on that day, he is a merchant. I do not recollect whether there was any company there on that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether you were out on the 17th A.- I do not; I was not out on the 7th of May, there was company on that day, several people came to see Mr. Robinson, some of them saw him. Before I went to Robinson's, I lived in service at York - my father's name is

            , and knew his mother-in-law, Eliza. I first became acquainted with him in 1812; he lived with his mother-in-law occasionally, I was on terms of intimacy with him, and visited him. He sometimes lived in the country, and sometimes with his mother-in-law, principally with her - I visited him frequently there.</p>
               <p>Q. How often before his death, used you to go and see him - A. Perhaps once or twice a week, he came to see me, and I went to see him. I cannot exactly tell when he died, I do not know the day of the week.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at his house a short time before he died - A. Yes, on Sunday, the 30th of April, 1815, and saw him on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after the Tuesday - A. Yes; he was virtually struck with death then, he was not dead, but his senses were taken from him.</p>
               <p>Q. That circumstance enables you to recollect that you were with him on the Sunday preceding - A. It does; I do not recollect being with him on any preceding Sunday, I might be. On Sunday, the 30th of April, I went to his house about half-past ten o'clock, and to the best of my recollection, staid with him till about twelve o'clock, or a quarter past. I went again about two o'clock, and staid till about five o'clock or half-past, to the best of my recollection. Miss Philipson and Miss Hewson were sitting in the room with him. I cannot remember whether they remained there all the time or not - I did not see the prisoner there on that day, I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he was not there between two and half-past five o'clock - A. To the best of my recollection, he was not. I think I met him there once, about twelve months after Mr. Robinson's death. I never remember meeting him there before his death, I was there frequently - I saw Bailey there on the 30th.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you an opportunity of observing on what terms Mr. and Mrs. Robinson lived - A. I thought they were usually quarrelling - I have seen Mr. Robinson write once or twice, and am able to speak to his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the signature to this paper, (script A,) is that his hand-writing - A. I do not believe it is.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Look at the other paper; do you believe that to be his - A. Yes, I do. Will your Lordship allow me to explain. I have sworn now that I believe it not his, but before yesterday, I should have come into Court and have sworn and believed it was his writing, in consequence of the s being entwined in the first part of the R in the high part of the letter R, but when I observed last evening another paper with the same blundering son to the latter part of it, and without a turn, and the T not taken over the ho, I am compelled on my oath to say what I have; that I believe it not to be his writing. I did not visit Mrs. Robinson after his death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. What do you mean by a general commercial agent - A. A broker, I have been so ten years, I think I have seen Mr. Robinson write once or twice - I have seen him sign a cheque to the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. And on that knowledge, you come to prove a man guilty of forgery - A. I do not come to prove a man guilty of forgery, I am come to prove it is not Mr. Roinson's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had not seen some paper yesterday, you would have said you believed it was his - A. Yes. I should; I told the Grand Jury I could not take on myself to swear it was not Mr. Robinson's writing; I only swear it is not now, from the reasons I have given. I have known Mr. Rushworth twenty-two or twenty-three years - I never spoke to him about the hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Now will you swear that - A. Mr. Robinson asked me about it, I might have spoken to him about it. I was a witness before the Grand Jury, at York, last assizes, on an indictment for perjury, it was for perjury on this business altogether, on the facts of it being wrong, I was to prove I was there at the time Saxelbye swore the will was made.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. You told his Lordship he took you down correctly, that you told the Grand Jury, at York, you believed it was not Mr. Robinson's writing - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And did you not say that but for the papers shewn to you yesterday, you should have said you believed it was - A. Yes; before the Grand Jury, at York, there was about fifty documents of his writing. I said, from the difference between them, I must say I did not think it was his writing; it deviated so much from the others. Mr.

               <p>"It is a different way from what my friend Mr. Robinson used to write, and you must judge for yourselves."</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to say he always wrote his name one way - A. Every time I saw him, that was twice, when he sent cheques to the Bank. (The witness was here shewn two letters, some bills and receipts, which he stated to be Mr. Robinson's writing; they were doubled down, so that the signatures could not be seen)</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the names, and say is that the way he always wrote his name - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at these which you have sworn to be his writing, they are different to one of the others - A. Yes; this is a different T.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Now having seen them, do you believe the other to be his writing - A. There wants the turn in the n.</p>
               <p>MR. CURWOOD. Q. Look at these three, are the T's in the way he usually wrote - A. No; the T's are all written the same way the others are.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The letter T on each of these is the same as on the document - A. The very same. In his usual way of writing he turned the letter n over, and it is not done here, and but for that, I should have thought it was his.</p>

Yes; I did not tell him what I was prepared to swear. I first saw the paper last October twelve months, in Doctor's Commons, I saw Rushworth before I came up to see it.

            's, I thought it looked like his writing, as I said before Sir G. Armitage, at York, but that he must have forgotten how to write his name, for he wrote different to what he usually did, I had seen him write twice, and had seen different papers.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You did not see them before you went to the Grand Jury at York - A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT HULLOCK. Q. Do you mean to swear you did not see the papers till you went before the Grand Jury at York - A. No. I saw some before, Rushworth shewed them to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, on your oath, you had not inspected those papers before you went into the Grand Jury room at York - A. No, not one half of them, there was a score of them, I examined about six.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You said there were fifty before the Jury - A. I cannot say how many there were.</p>
               <p>MR. SERJEANT HULLOCK. Q. Do you mean Rushworth only shewed you six, has he not shewn you fifty at different times - A. No; he has not, perhaps he has shewed me half a dozen, I always told the Grand Juries I would not swear it was not Thomas Robinson's writing, and told Rushworth so all along, he might have sent me before the Grand Jury for other facts, I was not sent for that exact purpose. Rushworth's servant paid my expences to town, I never told him I could swear it was not Thomas Robinson's handwriting. Mr. Martin shewed me a paper last night, Mr. Goodey was present, I altered my mind from the signature to that paper. The name at the head of one of these papers would confirm my opinion that it was Robinson's writing, but the others would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Well now, this being the last you have seen, you can swear that the signature to script B. is his writing - A. There is not the turn in the n.</p>

               <p>Q. Well, but till last night you believed it was - A. No; I could not say whether it was or not. When I was before the Jury in October, I gave the same reply, I did not believe it to be his, but I would not swear it was not, I was only once at York, Rushworth paid part of my expences, and Mr. Goodey the rest. My expences at York were about 3 l., I was there a day or a day and a half, the indictment was not tried at the same assize that it was found, I was there twice, Goodey paid my expences the first time, they were within 3 l., or 4 l., I suppose there were six or seven witnesses.

               <p>Q. You said before that you thought one was his, and the other two not - A. Now I think they are all three his writing, and I think the signature to the will may be written by the person who wrote those three documents.</p>

Stamp, went with me - before I went up, I saw his mother-in-law, some conversation passed about a will, in consequence of what she said. I had seen him execute a release before this; I cannot say I was well acquainted with his hand writing, I saw him write six or seven times in 1810, when he was of age, and settled with his father's executors - I can only give an opinion of his writing, from a comparison with other documents; I can speak from my memory of what I saw him write.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SERGEANT HULLOCK. Q. When did you first see this script - A. In the Prerogative Office at the latter end of 1815, I compared it afterwards, it enables me to make up my mind. When I first saw it in Doctor's Commons, I could not give an opinion on it - I compared them together afterwards. - I found a total dissimilarity between that and the signature to my letters, and from that I have come to the conclusion that it was not his writing, it is not at all like his writing, I allude to his writing in 1810, and when I last saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not professionally employed for the next of kin when you went to examine the will - A. Yes, I was desired by my partner Schofield to go and examine it, I think it was in November. I know Rushworth, he was clerk to Mr. Wilson, in Hull - his clerk sent me eight guineas with my subpoena. I was at York in August, on this subject - I was here last October, and gave evidence before the Grand Jury, I saw Goodey and Lockwood last night.</p>
               <p>Q. You made a convert of Lockwood last night - A. He desired to see the documents, he was shewn every signature that I had, and said the paper was a forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard him say that, before last night - A. Yes; not often, perhaps once, I think he said so at York.</p>
               <p>Q. What made him examine the documents last night - A. He gave no reason, he came to me, and requested to see them, Mr. Goodey was with him; I shewed them to him, he was perhaps a quarter of an hour examining them, I do not exactly know what he said.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these receipts, and give me an opinion whose hand-writing the body of them are - A. The deceaseds; I am pretty clear that one of them is the deceaseds writing - I am not so clear about the second, but my belief is that it is also - I am not so clear about the third, but believe it; the first I believe is unequivocally his.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at paper B. compare it with the three receipts, and say on what you ground your opinion of its not being his writing - A. The

             on the top of this, has certainly some resemblance to the signature in the script, and the T in this receipt has the same character as the script, but in the documents I referred to, it is different, and it appears that he had a coxcomical way of writing, he would write Tho at the end of a letter different to what he would write at the beginning of a note.</p>
               <p>Q. If that T had been at the end of the script you would have judged that it was his writing - A. No; the son is distinctly different from the three receipts, and from my documents, the son in the script wants a period, and it is quite different from this. The signatures to my documents are uniform.</p>
               <p>Q. Lockwood said you shewed him a document with a T which changed his opinion - A. I will produce it; the T in that is more like the forgery than any of the others which I have. He appeared to have a great command of his pen.</p>
               <p>Q. You are subscribing witness to some of these documents, perhaps if it was not for that, you would not be so positive to them - A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. These papers which you have attested are written in 1810 - A. Yes, I have a deed which was executed in 1815, it is a lease, release, and a receipt, and was all signed by him on the 1st of May, they have the same variations from the script as the others - all my other papers are dated 1810, they are signed exactly like the deed.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not an attorney always pay the expences - A. They ought.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. And the attorney may be a great loser if he has not somebody to repay him - A. Yes. I think the deceased had a great command of penmanship - when he wrote a letter, the T was very different to when he signed anything, but signatures to his letters were the same characters as these documents I have.</p>
               <p>Q. You examined the script in November, 1815, if at that time you suspected it to be a forgery it would be your duty, to communicate it to your clients - A. A communication was made to them, and we were before the Court, but we could not meet the proof, and did not plead, we had not the means to prove it forged - we could not contradict the prisoner's oath; the documents were in the hands of Mr. Horner, the executor to Robinson's father.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew of that then - A. Yes, but I did not interfere in the suit, my partner conducted the suit. I knew who the deceased's banker was.</p>
               <p>Q. Hold this in your hand, (a stock receipt), and then take the lease, compare the two together, and say if they are not very different hand-writings - A. Yes they are.</p>
               <p>Q. The T at the bottom of the deed, has the head of it continued to a considerable length, but in other respects the hand-writing differs very materially - A. They differ, but not very materially.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the script and say how that differs from the deed - A. The T. on the deed appears to be written from the bottom, and the one on the script from the top, that is the only difference as to the name Thomas, the son at the end of the name is materially different, and the R varies a little, and the o in the script, differs from the deed - the bin appears to be the same character. The deed is signed the same as the lease.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there is the same difference between the one and the other of them - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did his mother-in-law and him live on good terms or otherwise - I believe quite otherwise. I have heard both him and her declare it many times, I have heard them speak very disrespectfully of each other. I know Mr. Robinson's hand-writing, I have seen him write on many occasions. (Looks at the script.) I have seen him write many score times, to the best of my belief this signature is not his writing.

               <p>Q. Who supplied the money for this - I at first supplied him with money, but I found it more than I could do. I am not in advance at all now. One Carter advances the money, he is a gentleman, he did keep a public-house at Hull, and lives in that neighbourhood now; he has advanced all the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go with Carter to try and get 200 l. on the strength of this business - A. No; Carter went. Wilson asked me to join him in a note for it, but I declined. I said the suit would cost 1000 l.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not say it should cost 1000 l. more - A. No; I expect nothing whatever.

               <p>A. You paid some of the expences to town this time - A. Carter gave me money to bring to town to the attorney, when Rushworth told me who to pay it to, I did; I gave him the money, and he returned what I was to pay.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first interfere in the business - A. As soon as the person arrived from abroad. He was an acquaintance of my wife's before he went abroad. I have been married thirteen years, my wife is fifty-two years old, she was intimate with Thomas and Richard - Thomas now lives about four miles from Hull; he never applied to me, nor gave himself any trouble about it; but when Richard came from abroad he called and requested me to enquire about it; that was in February or March, 1820. I applied to Mr. Frost, an attorney, he said he was engaged for the other party. I did not apply to Mr. Rushworth. I have seen Mr. Robinson write letters, and he has shewn them to me, and asked my opinion on them, he has shewn me letters which he had received, and his answer to them, the script is dissimilar to every signature of his letters.</p>
               <p>Q. Then no person who knew his writing could be mistaken - A. I should think not; I said so the moment I saw it. I have compared it with other signatures, and if I could have found one like it I would have done nothing in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these and say whose writing they are - A. I think two of them are his, and two not, I should think they are not all written by one hand. I perceive a complete difference between them and the script, in the T, R, and n, they do not differ so much as other signatures which I have seen, but are still so different that I should give my opinion that it is not his writing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you advance money at any time - A. At first I advanced I think 100 l. in different sums, I never expected to be rewarded unless he succeeded in the suit. I think I met with Carter in June or July, and he paid me what I had advanced; I think he has advanced 500 l. and upwards, besides the 100 l. he paid me. I think he advanced 150 l. before the summer, and about 100 l. in September.</p>
               <p>Q. How much in October - A. I do not recollect, there was an advance, I think, to Mr. Rushworth - He sent up 150 l. by me for this trial. I do not know what bargain Mr. Carter made. I expected nothing besides what I advanced.</p>

            . I believe it began in Doctor's Commons, in May, 1816, or the beginning of June. The prisoner came many times to our office respecting the suit, I had very little to do in the business, and am not able to say when he first came. A paper marked A, was sent up to town, but I never saw it, we corresponded about it with our agent in town. A paper, marked B. was afterwards sent, the prisoner came to the office between the time the first and second were sent, I think he came a month or two after the first was sent up, he was a witness in support of both the testamentary papers, he was at the office several times before the second was sent, I had no communication with him at all, I had nothing to do with the suit. I know he repeatedly fetched the letters from the Post-Office, to our office, and gave them to me, or Mr. Galon, I never knew him open letters, he had no other business at our office that I know of, My partner had the entire management of the business, he died on the 19th of Sepetember, 1817.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence - My LORD - I must request your indulgent permission to read the short statement I have to offer in my defence, because I am wholly incompetent to address you by speaking, not only from being overpowered by the awful situation in which I stand at the bar, but because it is foreign to all the habits of my life to speak before a public Court. My Lord, it is my unhappy lot, at the age of seventy-three years, to be put upon my trial, on an accusation affecting my life and character, before a Court and Jury, far distant from my own home, and far distant from the place where even the fact for which I am to answer is alleged to have been committed, instead of being brought to trial before a jury of my neighbours, who know my conduct and character, and (which would be far more important for my interest,) who equally well know the character of my prosecutors. Although I now stand here before the Court, a poor miserable old man, accused of a most base offence. I have in earlier life known the bounties of fortune, I was once in an easy, and I may say, in a wealthy condition; and although by the vicissitudes incident to men, who are highly engaged in commercial concerns, I am now comparatively poor, yet until this accusation was raised against me, my moral character was never impeached, and so all my neighbours would have known, without producing witnesses, if I had been brought to trial before a Jury selected from amongst them.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, the facts of the case are shortly told; the testator, Mr. Robinson, whose will I am accused of forging, was an intimate friend of mine, and I was in the habit of continual social and friendly intercourse with him. In the early part of the year 1815, he was in declining health, and on Sunday, the 30th of April, in that year, I called upon him, as I frequently did. Finding his situation as I thought precarious, and being alone with him, in friendly talk, I asked him if he had made any dispositions of his property, he said he had not, but that he wished his step-mother to have it. At the same time, he added, he would be glad if I would get a will drawn out for him, as I knew he had very strong aversion to any intercourse with lawyers himself, I promised him I would get it done, and accordingly wrote down on a slip of paper his directions, by way of instructions, from which to get a will formally drawn up, and that is the paper which has been produced in evidence. I believe I wrote as nearly as possible in the very words he uttered, I then read them to him, he said it was right, and signed it. I took away the instructions, meaning to get a formal will drawn up from them, and to bring it to him for his signature. At that time I did not consider Mr. Robinson to be in immediate danger, and being particularly occupied the next day, (Monday,) I had not an opportunity of getting the will prepared. On the following morning, (Tuesday,) I learnt that Mr. Robinson had become delirous, and as he never afterwards recovered from that state of mind, I thought it useless to proceed further. The paper remained unnoticed in my possession, as I conceived it a thing of no value, not then knowing or supposing that a little loose memorandum of that sort could have the force of a formal will.</p>
               <p>A day or two after Mr. Robinson's death, another paper was found in his desk, altogether in his own hand-writing, by which it appears, he bequeathed to Mrs. 
               <persName id="t18211205-45-person560">Robinson</persName>
             the purchase-money of a house, he had then lately sold it, and was doubtful whether the papers did not make Mrs. Robinson universal legatee, and I understand, the opinion of Mr. Hart, the Chancery barrister was, that it bequeathed to her the whole of her son-in-law's property. Under this paper, accordingly Mrs. Robinson claimed Mr. Robinson's property, but the will was deposited in Doctor's Commons, by the testator's relations. On hearing these circumstances, I thought the paper which I had written, under his direction, might be important, and therefore I sought for it but was unable for some time to find it, at last, in the month of September following, I happened to discover it among some loose papers, and I immediately gave it over to Mrs. Robinson. Until that suit was instituted, I never conceived that this little slip of paper would in law amount to a will. Gentlemen, in that suit I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050034"/>called upon to make a deposition, which I did, stating the same circumstances as I have now stated to you; and although that is all I have had to do with the business, I am now called upon to answer, at the hazard of my life, the charge of wilfully having forged that will.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I would ask you, what motive I had to be guilty of such a crime? I got no legacy, nor a farthing benefit under the will. There was nothing improper in the conduct of the testator, in leaving this property to his step-mother in preference to his uncle or aunts; for although he was not the actual son of Mrs. Robinson, yet she was married to his father when he was about a year old; and from that time, until the hour of his death, with the exception of a short absence at Shields, he had continued to live with her. She had, throughout his infancy and youth, been an affectionate mother to him, as he frequently acknowledged, and he, apparently, had all the affection of a son towards his mother; insomuch, that it was not till after I was intimate with him for several years, that I learned she was only his step-mother; and indeed, from their conduct to each other, I had, until then, always supposed her to be his natural parent. The paper which was found, altogether in his hand-writing, will sufficiently prove his affection for her. Of his uncle, Thomas, he had often said, he would waste whatever he had; and with respect to his uncle, Richard, it was not at all unnatural that he should overlook him entirely. In truth, he had known nothing of that uncle, who had been long absent at Botany Bay, to which place he had been transported for a felony, which he had committed many years before, when his nephew was not more than a year or two old. This uncle, and his attorney, Mr. Rushworth, and other persons, disappointed of expected legacies, are my prosecutors. I can believe the uncle may be disappointed at the loss of his nephew's property, but it is awful revenge to seek the destruction of my life and character, because I was the unfortunate hand to write down his nephew's last wishes.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, You will bear in mind that this is not the first time the validity of this paper has been questioned. After a long suit in the Ecclesiastical Court, where all the evidence which my now prosecutors could bring forward to impeach the paper, and shew it to be a forgery, might have been legally heard, and deliberately considered, that Court decreed the paper to be a genuine instrument, and established it as a legal will. Nor did it rest there. Early in the present year, the prosecutors applied to the Ecclesiastical Court, to re-hear the case, but after hearing all the allegations which could be further adduced, the Learned Judge refused the application, and confirmed the former sentence, thereby establishing the genuineness of the instrument.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, after an ample investigation of this matter, before a Court of competent jurisdiction; I should have thought my prosecutors would have been satisfied of my innocence of the crime which they now allege against me, but you may judge from their subsequent harassing conduct towards me, whether they are actuated by motives of justice, or of revenge, for disappointed expectations. Five years after the will had been established, by the Decree of the Ecclesiastical Court, which was in the year 1816, they preferred an indictment for perjury against me and Mr. Stephenson, at the York Assizes, against me for making the deposition of the facts, under which I wrote the paper, and against Mr. Stephenson for deposing that he believed the signature to be the testator's hand-writing - as these indictments were prefered in my own country, where all the parties were known, myself, the prosecutors, and the witnesses, I readily and cheerfully prepared to meet the charge, but the first delay the prosecutor interposed, was the removing the indictment by certiorari, which delayed the trial for the late then assizes - In dus course, however, they stood for trial at the last York Assizes, in August, and again we were ready to meet the charge, but on the evening before the day of trial, the prosecutors withdrew the records - in the mean time they came to London, and at the last September Session, they presented a bill for forgery against me, before the London Grand Jury, but this bill was thrown out - again in the last October Session, they presented another bill, which is the one I now stand here to answer.</p>
               <p>Thus, Gentlemen, I have detailed all the instances of this case, and I earnestly but humbly intreat you to give them your attentive consideration. Consider the disadvantages I am placed under; called upon to answer so heavy an accusation, at a distance from the place where the fact is alleged to have been committed, and before a Jury to whom my former life and character are unknown. Consider too, that my prosecutors have evaded bringing the matter to trial before a Jury of that county, where both they and I are known. Consider also, Gentlemen, that the whole business has been already fully canvassed before a Court of competent jurisdiction, who have patiently heard all that could be adduced against the paper, and that having established it by their decree, they have thereby virtually pronounced that I am Not Guilty of the charge imputed to me by this indictment. But above all, Gentlemen, I pray you to remember the time at which I am called upon to answer for this supposed offence; It is now near seven years since the date of that transaction - in the course of that time, death has removed from my aid three persons who would have been material witnesses for me on this day - Mrs. Robinson, the mother of the testator, Mrs. Stephenson, and Miss 
               <persName id="t18211205-45-person561">
                  Jane 
                  Hewson

            , the two latter were witnesses in the suit, in the Ecclesiastical Court, and spoke to material facts respecting the testator's intercourse with his mother. With regard to Mrs. Robinson, as it is clear I took nothing by the will - it is insinuated I must have had some bribe from her, she rests now in the silence of the grave - death has sealed her lips, and she cannot now give testimony in my favour to prove the falseness of that accusation so long as she lived; no charge whatever was made against me.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, these are the circumstances under which I stand before you, and although I am greatly weighed down, and depressed by the magnitude of the accusation, knowing that both my life and character depended upon the issue of your verdict - yet I do not despair, I have voluntarily surrendered myself to take my trial, I know and feel my own innocence, and I have the firmest reliance on your justice. But above all, knowing that there is a God who judgeth the world in righteousness, I cannot believe he will desert me in my old age, and deliver me a victim to the malice of my disappointed enemies.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live at Hull, and was in the habit of attending Mr. Robinson, professionally, for eight or ten years preceding his death. The family consisted of Mr. and Mrs. Robinson, and the son Thomas, who died in May, 1815, his mother lived with him at that time, I attended him for the last fortnight before his death, at least, twice every day; I can undertake to say I called regularly twice every day for a fortnight, his disorder took an alarming turn about the 26th or 27th of April, I believe he went out on the 26th. On Monday, the 1st of May, he became delirious in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. On the preceding day, (Sunday,) did you call - A. Yes, twice, once before twelve o'clock, and then in the evening. I do not recollect who let me in, for I frequently opened the street door and walked in. I had intimated to him, during his illness, that it was always right to have his affairs settled, this was a few days before the 1st of May, he said he should do so, but never mentioned the nature of the distribution. I have frequently seen him write, and can form an opinion of the general character of his writing. I believe the signature to script B. to be his.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Do you remember being there on Sunday the 30th of April - A. Yes, twice, before twelve o'clock, and between seven and nine o'clock. I have seen the prisoner at the house during his illness. I was examined at Doctors' Commons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not swear in you deposition that you had no recollection of having seen Saxelbye at Mr. Robinson's during his illness - A. If I did, I believed it to be correct at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this paper, do you know whether it is Mr. Robinson's writing - A. I think it like it, I think it resembles the signature to B. I am not accustomed to examine minutely, there is a little difference in some of the letters, but such a difference as I have frequently made in writing my own name.</p>

             the surgeon, he came while I was there, I think it was between eight and nine o'clock, Bailey let him, for I did not, I was in the sitting-room at the time with Mr. Robinson. I knew Bailey was in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. On what terms did Mrs. Robinson and her son live - A. When he was himself, very comfortably, but when he had too much wine they at times quarrelled; she quarrelled with him because he was in that state. She used to fret, and say "Thomas it will ruin you." Mrs. Robinson paid the house-keeping, I have repeatedly heard her say he owed her three years board, and say "Thomas you pay every body but me," and he said, "Well, mother, I shall give you what I have." He had been very poorly for six months.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What relation were you to Mrs. Robinson - A. None. I had a legacy of 20 l. which I have received. They dined at one o'clock on Sundays, and took tea at five o'clock. I think on that Sunday it was a few minutes past five o'clock, as the servant was late. I washed the celery and took it into the room between four and five o'clock, Mr. Robinson eat it then, just as it was, I cannot say how many heads there was, it was a large plate. Mr. Young came about half-past eight o'clock, I think Bayley opened the door to him; when he came in, I went up stairs. I do not remember whether there was any wine on the table when I went in. Nobody drank tea there besides him and me. I went there every night all the week, Mr. Robinson was poorly then, he did not go out, that I know, but I was not there all day. I never missed being there on Sundays.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body there on the Sunday before - A. I think

I was very frequently at the house, they lived on terms of friendship, except when he got a little wine. He was ill some time before his death.

On Sunday, the 30th of April, I was at his house, I got there about one o'clock, and went to dine there, only him and his mother were there, I remained there till three o'clock; after dinner Mr. Stevenson came, and staid about half an hour. Mr. Robinson was regretting that he had not a head of celery at dinner, and Mr. Stevenson sent some, I understand, but I was not there when it came. Before I went away, (about three o'clock,) Mr. Saxelbye came, I let him in, I saw him through the window, and opened the door to him; he went into the parlour where Mr. Robinson was, I left the house a few minutes after, leaving them together. I did not see Mr. Lockwood there. Mr. Robinson was in the front parlour all the time I was there. I have often seen him write (Looks at scripts A. and B.) these signatures are his writing.</p>

Child claimed one key, I found a candlestick in his hat, also a towel and a pillow-case, two pieces of soap, and a pair of scissars. I took him to Guildhall, and observed a lump on his back, one of the marshalmen pulled out a sheet from there, and in his trowsers I found another sheet, and a pillow-case. Child claimed them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You took him the very day he left, and kept him in custody - A. Yes.</p>

On Tuesday, the 16th about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner brought two mares to my back yard, at Ealing. He said he had two useful mares which he thought of service to me; I I said I had plenty, and I did not want any. We at last agreed to swap one, I exchanged one of mine for one he brought, and gave him a 5 l. note, and eight half-crowns to boot; he said he had rode her a great many miles, and could recommend her. I was to give him another 1 l. if is turned out well - he said he had had the mare some time. I do not recollect whether he said how long he had this one.</p>

I was going by Essex-street, and standing at the corner, four young men came up to me, the prisoner was one, he asked me what I wanted to give charge of them for; they had insulted me before, by pushing me about, and kicking me. I threatened to give charge of them, and then went ten or fifteen yards further, and then the prisoner asked what I wanted to give charge of them for, I said, because they kicked, and insulted me; he then struck me with his fist, and knocked me down, the other three picked me up, and as they were doing it, I called out, Watch! the watchman came, and caught the prisoner; we went to Whitechapel watch-house, and I gave charge of him for an assault - he was sent to Spitalfields watch-house, and after that, I found my three pockets turned inside out, and missed 4 s. 6 d., and a few halfpence, which I am sure I had when they first insulted me. I cannot say what time it was taken, as I was almost stunned; I cannot tell what the prisoner did when I was down, they were all four about me, I did not see any of them take my property. I had said I would give charge of them, but I did not call the watch till they knocked me down. I have never recovered my property. They had insulted me near Castle-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. What had you drank - A. Part of three pints of beer, and a glass of gin. My friend keeps the house, in Castle-street; I was alone when this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. The blow appeared from revenge - A. I cannot tell. He said, "Why did you charge me?" and immediately struck me; he was one of those who insulted me, for I I had looked in his face in Castle-street, we had no quarrel at all; I had called watch! the first time, and the watchman came - he ran away. I then went fifteen yards, and they came up again, it was about a quarter of a mile from the public-house, they had to go to another watch-house, as the Whitechapel one was under repair. I found I had lost my money after he was sent to the other watch-house. I had been waiting in the watch-house all the time, as the officer said, he would stop me, if I could not have bail to appear against him, as he did not know me. The watch-house is a quarter of a mile off, only one man went with us, a good many watchmen came up, but did not go to the watch-house. I discovered my loss half an hour after he was taken to the watch-house, I was detained at the first watch-house till ten o'clock, when my bail came. I waited with the officer, I am sure my money was safe after the first time they insulted me, because I looked for it. The prisoner had gone about two doors from where I was knocked down, I had followed, holding him. I am certain he is the man who struck me, I never lost sight of him. My pockets could not have been turned out after he was taken.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 6th of November, there was a cry of watch, I was about ten yards from where the prisoner and prosecutor stood, when I came up they both stood together, the prosecutor had hold of the sleeve of his coat, and gave charge of him for knocking him down. He said, he was certain he was the man, I took him, the watch-house keeper would not take charge of him unless the prosecutor gave bail for his appearing before the Magistrate; I got the prosecutor's friend, who answered for his appearance. Five or ten minutes after he came in, I saw that his right hand breeches pocket, and his waistcoat pocket, were turned inside out; he said he was sure one of the four had stolen 4 s. 6 d. from him, and some halfpence. The prisoner said, he knew nothing about striking the prosecutor, he knew nothing of it. The prosecutor was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not come up till after he was in custody - A. The prosecutor was holding him. I am well acquainted with bad characters; I never knew the prisoner before.</p>

On the 31st of October we had a quarrel about some worsted, I went down to dinner about half past one o'clock, and when I returned, he shewed me a piece of worsted, which he had taken from my part of the shop and said it was his, and was in his possession before, I said it was mine, I went to the loom and caught hold of the worsted, he was working with it, and said, whether it was mine or not I should not have it, I said, I would, and kept my hold, he got out of the loom where he was sitting at work, and dragged me a yard or two, a scuffle ensued, he gave me two or three blows to get my hand loose, I struck him two blows, not more, neither of our blows were very violent, I cannot tell where I hit him, he struck me one or two more, and finding it did not good, he dragged me about two yards backwards, and called for a pair of scissars, he snatched a pair off my master's loom, grasped them in his hand, and thrust them into my breast; I endeavoured to pin his arms behind, but I had not much strength, as the blood came very violent from the wound, he changed the position of the scissars and ran them into my thigh, and then into my arm, in nine places; he then let me go. I was afterwards examined by Mr. Thomas the surgeon. We were not on good terms before, I thought I could beat him, he thought he could beat me; we fought several times, but it was never decided.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by MR. BRODRICK Q. You first went to claim the worsted - A. Yes; be had taken it from my loom, and accused me of taking it from his, he was sitting in the loom when I came up, and shewed me the worsted, he was sitting in the loom when I caught hold of it; I did not strike the first blow, I did not bite him, I did not fetch a pair of scissars when we separated; after he wounded me I got a pair, and said, how could he be so cruel as to run a pair of scissars of that kind into any body; he said, "I am ready for you again."

               <p>Q. Had you a quarrel with one Naggs - A. Yes; I did not threaten to stab him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was he in a great passion at the time - A. Yes; my Lord, the scissars were about two yards from where he sat. Our worsted is not weighed out to us, it did not matter which used it. He got the scissars directly after I struck him, I do not suppose he meant to strike me with them when the quarrel began, he was in a passion at my not letting go of the worsted. I endeavoured to pinion his arms after he struck me, he had the scissars in his hand while he was struggling to get loose.</p>

            . I was in the shop at the time of the quarrel, Wood was at work at his loom, and missed some red worsted and went to look for it while Mattock was out, and when he came up, he said, "What did you take this for?" Mattock insisted on having it, and in the scuffle pulled him out of his loom, and they scuffled down to my master's loom, which was next to them, he found Mattock too strong for him, and got the scissars, but but in the moment of irritation, I suppose, he did not know what he was about. I saw no blows pass between them, they were scuffling for the worsted, I do not think he intended to strike him with the scissars when it first began.</p>

He had a small box in the room, which he kept locked. I saw Mrs. Whiting break it open about six weeks after, and found a duplicate of my property. The coat cost me 4 l. 5 s., and was nearly new, I had only worn it about three weeks. There was only an old shirt and some stockings in his box.</p>

I did not know he was going to leave, he paid me for his lodging, and gave me to understand he was going to stop. I did not see him again till he was in custody, which was about the 17th of November. He had left his box in the room, locked. About five or six weeks after I took it to the ironmongers, they had no instrument that would open it - it was in the same state as when he left it. I at last broke it open in the prosecutor's presence, and found two old shirts, a pair of stockings, and a duplicate of a coat and waistcoat. It was his Sunday great coat and nearly new.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. George's parish. I know Jago. On the 10th October about a quarter past ten o'clock at night, (my beat is on the cast side of the square, by Mr. Ord's door) he called me to him. I saw his wife standing at the area gate, they said they had been down the area and could not get in at the kitchen door, he put the key in the door, and said, "Now it is locked," he unlocked it, and said, "Now I cannot get in." - He tried it once or twice, and told me to try it, which I did, and said it must be fastened inside. We at last got in by breaking the door open. Jago, my brother watchman, and myself all went in, the door had been bolted inside. We went into the housekeeper's room, in the passage, I asked him if all was right; he said, "Yes;" but turned round and said, "This door is not right." The door hung on one screw. Supposing there was thieves inside, we got more watchmen, and went into the back kitchen, saw the window half up and one iron bar loose, this was in the back area. We went into the area, and Jago took hold of the iron bar and pulled it, and said "This is where they have got in." We went up to the hall, and on the first pair of stairs, we found a candle, not a-light, the house was quite in disorder, and a cutlass in the front parlour, and a bundle of keys, some clothes and things were scattered about the room. We went up to the next floor and found all the drawers broken open and the locks forced, the house appeared to have been plundered from bottom to top. We found the scabbard of the cutlass at the top of the house, but could find nobody, though we searched the whole neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. At what time was your attention called to the house - A. About a quarter past ten, it appeared to me to be plundered.</p>

            . I have known Beck six week, or two months, I believe I knew him a week or a fortnight before October last, he came into a chandler's shop where I was, Pugh lodged with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, on any occasion, Beck's letting you into any secret - A. After I bought the duplicate of a coat of him, which was lined with silk, and trimmed with fur, he told me I must get it out, for they were going to make a crack, where it came from. I did not know what that meant then, I have since been told it meant they were going to break into the gentleman's house where it came from.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the night of the 10th of October, last A. I do not know the night, but it was on a Wednesday night; Beck, and the hackney coachman came to my lodging, and brought a bundle each, Beck asked me to lend him 2 s., to pay for the coach, he took the bundles to his lodging, I do not know where they were put at that time, but he took them to his lodging, and then came to my lodging, with a white bundle under his arm, this was the same night, it was a white bundle that I saw both times, this was between eight, and nine, or ten o'clock I believe; I saw the bundle opened, and saw, what I supposed to be a Coronation dress, it was a buff, or white cassimere jacket, trimmed with light blue silk, and a star on it, it was embroidered with silver; there was also a little time-piece, about nine inches long, with a yellow face, and in bronze, and a pistol, about twelve inches long, these things were brought down into the cellar, of No. 19, Vine-street, where I lodge, I held the light. On that same night I received from him a sheet and a table-cloth, marked, H. O.; and I think there were more letters, but I will not be sure. I wanted to pay Beck for them, he was to have 18 s. I took them next morning to the prisoner, Lewis, to raise me money to pay for them, I said, "Lewis, can you dispose of these, for I want to pay the men for them." He said I do not know, but if you will call on me, or meet me at a public-house, in the evening, I will do what I can for you; I left them with him. He was to meet me at the One Tun, public-house, in Chandos-street, in the evening, and did so, he went by the name of Lewis, I always knew him by that name. I have said his name was Jones, I told Pugh so, who was there, he met me and Pugh there, he brought a bit of linen with him, with a mark on it, it was the mark that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050041"/>came off the sheet or table-cloth, he gave it me, and said, "We won't be done." I do not know what he meant.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What are you - A. A tailor. I live in Vine-street, Chandos-street. I have been assisting in a chandler's-shop and coal-shed, for two years. I know Mrs. Toole who lived in the same house as Lewis, I never employed her, I knew her by her lodging there. The sheet and table-cloth were brought about seven o'clock in the morning, on Thursday, I had no part of the contents of the first two bundles; Beck brought them. Lewis lodges about a quarter of a mile from Vine-street. I was apprehended at work, last Friday three weeks, I did not ask to be a witness. I advanced money on the things before I went to Lewis's, I got it from Pugh, and to repay him I took it to Lewis. After I was apprehended, I sent to Lewis to give me a character, if I should want one.</p>

            . I lodged in the same room as Gates. Beck came there about half-past eight o'clock, in the evening of Wednesday, the 10th of October, he brought nothing with him the first time, he had some conversation with Gates, and presently went out. Gates asked me for the key of the cellar, which I gave him, and presently Beck came in with a bundle; they both went into the cellar with the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any second bundle that evening - A. I cannot say, as it was dark; but I believe Beck went out again, and brought in another, but I am not certain. About five minutes after, they both came out of the cellar, and the key was given me, I went from curiosity into the cellar, to see what the things were, and I saw a large table-cloth, loose out of the bundle, I noticed no mark. I saw a large bundle tied up in a cloth, and in it I saw a time-piece, the face was a gold colour, I lifted it up, the cloth appeared very heavy. I was with Gates, at the One Tun, public-house, the next day, the 11th of October, about one, in the day, when I went in Lewis sat there with a pint of beer before him, I did not then know his name; but a few minutes after, Gates told me his name was Jones.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you know Lewis before - A. No; I delivered myself into custody, and told the officers what I seen.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you were there, did any thing pass between Lewis and Gates - A. They had some close conversation between themselves, I did not hear it, I did not see either of them give any thing to the other.</p>

On the 16th of November I took the four prisoners in custody, Gates and Pugh also wished to be taken, and I took them. I was present at the examination of the prisoners before Mr. Dyer, the Magistrate, and heard them tell their different stories, neither threat or promise was held out to them, quite the contrary, for the Magistrate cautioned them. Jago wished to say something to me, but I took him to the Magistrate.

I still objected; in the course of another week she watched me out of the house again, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, as soon as I opened the front door of the house, she rushed in, and insisted on my letting her have something - she went into Mr. Ord's dressing-room, and through that into a passage, and I went with her; she pulled open a drawer in the passage which was not locked - there was a quantity of Court dresses there. I told her that the drawer contained Mr. Ord's clothes, before she opened it - I was induced to do so by her urgent way of insisting on my compliance with her wishes. She took a coat out of the drawer, which was trimmed with fur about the collar and sleeves, and carried it out of the house - I went out with her as far as the Covent-garden Piazza, when I got there, she asked me to go and pledge<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050042"/>the coat, which I said I could not think of doing; she continued to entreat me, and at length prevailed, and I went and pledged the coat at Mr. Lamb's, the pawnbroker, at the corner of Stanhope-street, Clare-market, for 1 l. 10 s., she remained out-side; when I came out I gave her the whole money, and the ticket, we separated - I went to my work in Duke-street, Lincoln's nn-fields.

She said she was acquainted with two or three men, and the best thing I could do to clear myself, would be to let them break into the house before Mr. Ord returned to town - I said I could not consent, this was on a Friday evening, she then proposed that she should come to the house the next day (Saturday,) and that I should let her in, and give her something to pledge, which I refused, and we parted. On the next evening (Saturday,) she watched for me again as I was going home, and asked when she met me, whether I would do what she proposed; I said "No." She then produced three keys, and asked me to try if they would not open some of Mr. Ord's drawers - I told her I could not think of doing such a thing, and that I had done enough for her; in reply she again threatened me with a disclosure if I did not comply. I refused; she then seized me by the collar, and said if I did not comply with her wishes she would immediately carry me to Bow-street, and charge me with having robbed Mr Ord - I then consented to take the keys and try them, she then left me, and I went home. On Sunday I tried one of the keys, and it fitted one of Mr. Ord's drawers; I took a silk pelisse out of the drawer, and locked the drawer again. On the Monday morning following, she waited for me outside the door; and as I was going out, I took the pelisse with me, and gave it to her, and I also returned the three keys; I do not know what she did with the pelisse - I walked with her as far as Bond-street, and then we separated.

I then went up to Mr. Noble's, the Coach and Horses, public-house, in Horse-shoe-yard, Duke-street, Grosvenor-square; I got there about a quarter past eight o'clock, having stopped in my way at Mr. Parrotts the apothecary in Mount-street; I met my wife there, whom I had appointed to meet me there before she quitted home that evening - my wife and I stopped at the Coach and Horses, public-house, till about half-past nine o'clock, when we went back together to Berkely-square. I opened the area gate, and went down, the door below being found bolted, I called out to the watchman for assistance, he forced the door open, and several other watchmen having come to him, the house was searched, and it was found that the door of the cupboard in the housekeeper's room, and several drawers in that part of the house, were broken open; a bunch of keys was also found on the carpet in Mr. Ord's dressing-room, which the watchman tried, and found to fit some of the drawers - there was a trunk broken open in the maid's room, and a bunch of keys found there also; there was nobody found in the house; I know nothing of what articles were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050043"/>taken from the house; my wife was much alarmed, and I appeared to be so. When the first alarm was over, I quitted the house leaving my wife at the next house, and several watchmen about the door, to go down to Mr. Scott, Mr. Ord's brother-in-law, in Downing-street, to let him know what had happened. I arrived at Mr. Scott's about half-past twelve o'clock, and told him, and he said he would go to Bow-street next morning; I then went back to Mr. Ord's house, and Lord Kinnard's servant remained with me all night, while my wife continued at the house adjoining - I went to Bow-street next morning, and hearing Mr. Scott had already been there, I returned home.

We had a pot of beer, and conversed about a quarter of an hour, he asked me if I would sell for him some tickets, as he was in want of money; he then shewed me an immense lot of beads, ear-rings, necklaces, two crosses, (one with hair, and the other garnet set in gold) which I declined doing; he invited me to call on him in Berkely-square, where he wished to converse with me, in the absence of his wife. I expressed my doubt of his having come honestly by all those things, he said he had; that he had possessed them for a long while, and now wished to raise money on them, in consequence of his having a brother who was threatened with an execution for debt, and who he wished to serve; he then told me that the house was No. 17, in Berkely-square, and appointed me to come at four o'clock, I was not able to get there till a little after six o'clock - I knocked and he let me in, he shewed me all over the house, his wife was absent, and he was in a hurry in going over the house with me, for fear she should return; he asked me if I would take away a sword for him, with a cut steel handle, which he said had been made a present of to his wife - I took it to my lodgings, and the next day he came and had it away. I told him I was afraid he was doing something wrong, he said, "Never mind that he wanted money for his brother, and he must have it," A day or two after he brought me a pair of pistols, and asked me if I would sell them for him, which I declined, he then asked if I would tell him a place to sell them at, I told him there were many gunsmiths, where they would buy such things; he then again pressed me to tell him where my sister was, as he said he would be a pound or two in her way, as he was sure she would tell him a place to sell the pistols at; I declined to tell him. In about two days after, he came to me again, and brought me a ticket of a watch, which was in pawn for 5 s., and asked me to take it out for him. I declined; he then left me in my room, the two pair back, saying he would find a person; he returned immediately, I asked him what he had been about, he said he had found a woman at the door whom he knew, and that he had given her the ticket to bring out the watch - shortly after a woman whom I did not know came and knocked at the door, and called to him, she gave him a watch, which he said was the one he had sent for, I then looked at it, it was a gilt one and small, there was a gold key, with a black ribbon to it, he asked me if I knew where he could sell it, I told him if it was his own, he had better pawn it; he took it away, but brought it another day, and I sold it for him for 16 s.

He then, for the first time, said he had been doing something wrong, and he must now go on with it; I asked him if his wife knew any thing of it, he said, "No," I advised his never letting her know. He said upon one occasion, he was afraid she would know by his being in a room which she asked him about, and he satisfied her. I asked him how long the family was to remain out of town, he said about three weeks longer.</p>

            . I lived in Mr. Ord's family. I have reason to believe the piece of cloth produced by Mr. Till, to be a piece of Mrs. Ord's, shawl, she had such a shawl, which was left among other things when the house was robbed. I left town with the family, I know she left a red pelisse behind her, not a green one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You believe the cloth to be part of her shawl, from the colour - A. Yes; it is a common shawl, and here is a sheet, which I am quite confident of, it was in the house when the family left town. I have every reason to believe the table-cloth to be one which was left in the house; one end of it was hemmed by a person in the house. The marks are gone off all the linnen, it appears fresh hemmed where the mark ought to be.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Will you swear they are Mr. Ord's - A. I swear to the sheet, there is none of my work in it; the linen goes out to be washed every week. I left town in June, and returned in October, I have the care of the linen, this is one of the sheets left out for Mrs. Jago's use.</p>
               <p>MR. ORD. I can swear to the breeches being mine. I lost a masquerade dress exactly corresponding with the witnesses description, I also lost a pair of pistols, a sword, a great coat, with a fur collar, and cuffs, two time-pieces, one a gold face, and one not. I know my wife had a puce coat, lined with red, I know nothing of the pelisse.</p>

               <p>THOMAS BECK'S Defence. With great difference, I submit the following statement: I was innocently led into this; Jago called on me where I live, and asked me to sell the duplicate of a coat and waistcoat, which I did, having no suspicion that he came dishonestly by them, as he said they belonged to his wife's brother, who lived in the country - Some days after, he again came, and I gave him the money I sold the duplicate for; he asked me to walk with him to a public-house, he asked me to walk to Berkley-square, where he said he lived, which I declined, he asked me if I could come about eight o'clock; I asked the reason he was so urgent for me to meet him there; he said it was not of much consequence, but if I would, he would be obliged to me; I accordingly went, and met him outside of the door; he said "I expected you sooner," and asked me to carry a bundle home for him; he gave it me, and I carried it home, without knowing the contents, and the next morning he came to me I gave it him. My character, up to this time, was unimpeached; I served three years in a seventy-four gun ship, Captain Sir C. Cole, was then drafted on board the Fly, was servant to Captain Baldwin eighteen months, I was then paid off, and went on board the Bulwark, bound for St. Helena, I then returned to London, and met an officer of the Conqueror, who recommended me to a ship at Woolwich, I could not get money enough, and have been looking for a ship. I declare myself entirely innocent. I implore you to consider my case, and hope my character will induce you to shew me mercy. The whole of Gates's evidence is false.</p>

               <p>That I ever forced in at Mr. Ord's door, and opened the dressing-room drawers, and took away a coat, and repeatedly urged him to let the house be robbed, or could find<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050045"/>men to do it; or that ever I took him by the collar, and threatened to take him to Bow-street, if he did not agree to the robbery; or that ever I fitted three keys for that purpose. I most solemnly, before God, utterly deny it, so much so, that I do not even know where the house is situate, or had any idea of the robbery. I acknowledge I have pledged articles for him, but not with a felonious intent; for he brought them to me, representing them as the gifts of his wife's mistress to his wife, whom he stated to be a lady's maid, and desired me to pledge them; and consequently (having cohabited with him myself for a number of years, and having a family by him,) I was induced to comply, being entirely unconscious that he would draw me into a snare; however, my present unfortunate situation is the result of my ignorance.</p>
               <p>I beg leave also to state, that at the time of my committal for trial, I was actually in the family way, by Jago; and unfortunately, on being removed to my present place of confinement, I miscarried on the road; having also two of his children living, without a mother's protection.</p>
               <p>When we went down to be measured, as I understand is usual, Jago requested me to forgive him, for his false conduct to me, and said that he would not have done it, had he not been urged so to do; and was fully convinced he had done wrong to me, and told me told me to keep up my spirits, and as atonement, he would use every endeavour to cause my acquittal, as also my brother's,

            . I am warehouseman to the prosecutors. On the 5th of December, Forrester came to our warehouse with the prisoner in custody. I went with him to our stable, and on searching the loft, I found a green bag containing about 3 lbs. of green tea, and half a pound of black, it was loose in the bag. I afterwards saw some coffee and tea in the officer's hands; the stables was under the prisoner's care, he had the key. I compared a sample of the tea with ours, it corresponded in my judgment.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Thursday the 4th of December, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I stopped the prisoner in Petticoat-lane, and asked him what he had got; he had 7 lbs. of coffee and 7 lbs. of tea - he told me to follow him - I refused, he would not tell me where was going, nor where he lived, nor his name. I searched and found a key on him. He would give no account how he came by the property. I took him to a public-house and told him to write to his friends, which he did, and from that I found out where he belonged to. I went to the warehouse, the key opened the stable door, it was a very particular key, and in the hay loft the tea was found in a bag, concealed under some hay.</p>

            . In consequence of suspicions entertained by me, I marked two half crowns, eight shillings, and two sixpences, so that I should know them again. Mrs. Chapman brought the purse to me about three o'clock, and I missed one shilling out of it, I called the prisoner to me, he had been sent out to get a watch glass for me. I asked him how much he had paid for it, and gave him a half sovereign, desiring him to give me change, he gave me two half-crowns, one shilling, and sixpence, saying he would give me the remainder afterwards. I instantly perceived that it was that shilling which had been taken out of the purse; it had my mark on both sides, I charged him with the theft, and talked to him some time, on the consequence of such proceedings, and promised never to disclose it; he trembled exceedingly, and sat down. I continued to talk to him, he offered to swear that he had not touched the purse, I said, I was sorry he should say so, as the money was marked. He then said, the housemaid had paid him one shilling that morning, and that must be it; the housemaid was called down, and in his presence, she stated, she had paid him a shilling, but persisted in her innocence. I sent him on an errand, when he returned, he appeared to have been drinking; for he was very violent, and said, he would not live with a thief, and positively fetched an officer to take the girl up. I produce the shilling, I have had it sealed up ever since, I swear positively to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Where is the mark - A. Under the chin; I did it with the point a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. You talked to him about it, and he became frightened, and went to a Justice - A. He became frantic. Mr. Burgess, my fellow curate, called, and he wished him to examine the girl, to try if she would confess; he persisted throughout that he was innocent, I said if he would confess, I would not disclose it, it was his madness and infatuation that made me bring him here.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS to MRS. CHAPMAN. Q. Was not the basket in which your purse was left, in the room the greater part of Sunday and Monday - A. It was accessible to every person in the house. The last time I looked at the purse, was eleven o'clock in the morning, but I remained in the room till a quarter past one o'clock.</p>

On the 29th of June, I was at Hampstead, in a field, I went out of the field at ten o'clock, and laid down in the next field to rest. I fell asleep, and on awaking, at four o'clock, I missed my watch, which was safe when I laid down. I had left the prisoner in the other field mowing, I had known him from a child. At eleven o'clock, I saw him, at the Three Horse Shoes, public-house, Hampstead, and accused him, and another, named Richards, with robbing me. The officers came up and took him, it was not found. Merritt shewed me the watch four days after. The prisoner always denied it.</p>

On the 8th of November, about seven o'clock, in the evening. I was in the Star, public-house, Well-street, the prisoner was in the public-house, and joined my company, he sat in the same box. We continued in company till one o'clock in the morning, drinking all the time; he was quite stupid with liquor, and I was a little intoxicated. I asked him to go to my lodging, he was going, but I found he was so much in liquor, that I endeavoured to leave him.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he walk straight - A. No; I had got about five yards from the public-house, he came after me, insisted on going with me, he caught hold of me by the shawl, and being unpinned, it came off. The watchman came out and took him, I did not tell the watchman that he had robbed me.</p>

            . I am a watchman, of St. George's Hanover-square. My beat is on the East side of the square. On the 10th of October, about a quarter-past ten o'clock in the evening, Jago and his wife called me; Jago said "Watch man, come here, I cannot get into the house." I went up, his wife stood at the door, he put the key in the area door, but could not get in; we broke the door open, the house appeared to be plundered from bottom to top, the drawers and cupboards were broken open. Jago said he supposed they came in at the front door, for it was unbolted top and bottom, the back area window was half up, Jago took hold of the iron bar which was loose, and said "They must have got in here."</p>

I was present when they were taken before the Magistrate, at Marlborough-street - neither promise or threats were used to induce them to make any statement.

            . I am an officer. About seven o'clock in the morning, I was in Whitechapel, and saw the four prisoners, with three or four others, stopping at the corner of George-yard, about twenty-five yards from the waggon, I knew them well before. When I had passed them about fifty yards, I looked back, and saw they had advanced near the waggon, and at that instant, Mason went from the others, and took the box off the shafts, and returned with it on his shoulder to the others. All ran away together as far as George-yard; Mason, Daley, and another, (not in custody,) ran up George-yard with the box. Clark and Hitchings went with the rest up Whitechapel. I informed the man of his loss, and we followed up George-yard, but they turned into a court, and I lost them. I went into Whitechapel, and took Hitchings and Clark in less than five minutes. About an hour after, I apprehended Mason, at the corner of George-yard. Daley was taken on Sunday. I am certain of them all. It was a blue wooden box.</p>

            . I am an umbrella maker, and live in High-street, St. Giles's. The prisoner passed my shop with a man and woman, about two o'clock, they were trying to take Ball's handkerchief, I went out, and watched them to the corner of Charles-street, and saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out of Ball's pocket, and wipe his nose with it. I pushed him into the wine-vaults, and asked where the handkerchief was, (the man and woman were at the corner) he said, "What handkerchief?" I said, "The handkerchief you took out of the gentleman's pocket;" I said he had it when I laid hold of him. I give him in care of the people while I fetched Ball, who returned with me.</p>

I waited till he opened it, and then said, "What are you doing, you have no business here?" he said, he had come to look for Carnelly's son, who owed him a penny. I let him go without searching him, but said I should tell Carnelly, he said I might if I pleased. He was apprehended next day, and told me the things were hid in Lord Coventry's garden.

The prisoner came into our service on the 25th of October, from her mother, she remained four days with us - my watch hung at the head of the bed; I saw it safe at four o'clock in the afternoon, the other things were in a drawer - my father keeps a public-house. At half-past four o'clock, she asked for 1 d. to buy tape, and never returned; I had left the key in the room door. I found my watch next day in pawn, I went with the officer, and found her at her mother's, at Wapping.</p>

I went to a house where she said she slept, and found two handkerchiefs, the dress, and sashes; Allen claimed them in her presence, she then acknowledged taking them, and buying a pair of stays for 9 s. 6 d., of the pawnbroker.</p>

            . I am one of the prosecutors travellers. I went to Long in prison, and told him he had sent a letter to the prosecutor, he said, Yes; I said "It is only an acknowledgement of your guilt, but it gives no explanation" - and I was come to know the extent of the robbery, and if he could tell me who else was concerned. I neither threatened or promised him; I said "Ashman is in custody," he said, "Yes," I said, "Do you think you have stolen five hundred pieces," he said he should think not, but it might be three hundred; that he generally took them out in the morning, and delivered them to Treble in Whitecross-street, and that he carried some home to his own house. Nothing was said about the satin papers in question.</p>

            . I have come from Clerkenwell prison, and am a paper-hanger. I lived at No. 232, Upper Thames-street. About sixteen years ago, I was introduced to Ashman. I was then a clerk in the Crown Office, and he was servant to Miss Thurlow, the late Lord Thurlow's daughter. In 1815, I took him to learn my business, he worked for Mr. Lawrence with me. About the beginning of this year, he asked me to assist in doing some painting at his brother's in Long-lane, Borough, which I did, and while we were there, we agreed to share in what work we each did. The last job we did was at Mr. Fox's, Blackfriar's-road. I procured paper for him to paper a house in Dorset-place, he gave me the job to paper it for him, as a journeyman, at so much a piece. I got the paper from Long, who was then porter to the prosecutors; one room was satin paper, and the rest common. I did not get it all from Long. Ashman afterwards called on me, and said he had five or six houses to paper, for Mr. Clemence, and asked me if Long could procure him some paper; he knew Long was servant to the prosecutors. Long also kept a little chandler's shop, and lived in the back parlour. Ashman knew he did not deal in paper. I said I would speak to him about it, which I did; he said he would procure some, and brought two parcels of twelve pieces each, they were not satin paper. Ashman took the two parcels of common paper away. I lodged at Long's, and on Saturday morning Long brought some satin paper home into my room. On the day before I had seen Ashman, who said he was coming to my place to know if Long had brought the papers. I said he had not; he said he particularly wanted them to finish his job, and would call to-morrow morning for them, and if he could get one of his rooms papered he could get a bill on Clemence for 20 l. or 25 l. Long brought them on Saturday, and about ten o'clock in the morning Ashman came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050052"/>and saw them on the floor; he was to give 5 s. a piece for it. The trade price was 8 s. 6 d. he carried the papers and I carried the paste and kettles, over the water, to Dorset-place. We met Clemence near Kennington chapel. Ashman crossed over and had some conversation with him; they then crossed over, and we shewed him the patterns, of the paper; he said he thought they would do very well. We put the paper up on Monday. I went with him to Clemence's house that day, and waited outside, and when he came out, he said Clemence had accepted the bill, and he would get the money to pay Long; for Fox, in Blackfriar's-road, owed him a bill. I waited while he went to Fox, he came out and said he had got 2 l. on account.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How long have you lived with Long - A. One year. I have only taken goods from him within twelve-months. I have paid him 2 l. or 3 l. at a time for paper. My wife has seen Ashman and Long together, and he has asked my wife to ask Long to get him paper. He never paid for these particular papers. I have sold twenty pieces of paper to 
               <persName id="t18211205-75-person907">Mr. Scuddy</persName>
             of Edmond-place, and to several people.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not held out to them that you could get paper much lower than any one else - A. I have said I could get them as cheap as any one, not 40 per cent. lower.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell Ashman you could get paper much lower on account of your connexion with the tradesmen who built Furnival's Inn - A. No, I worked at Furnival's Inn, I was in custody a week, and applied to be admitted as a witness.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you often go to Long's, where he worked. - A. I never went to the factory, I believe I went with Long that morning to fetch them, he brought them to me at the bottom of Whitecross-street, and I took them to Thames-street. Ashman came and took them away. I lived with Cox and Co. in 1819. I was not turned away. I was walking between Whitecross-street and Golden-lane, when he brought the paper. Ashman always bought the paper, it was his job, he knew how it was got, and knew they could not be got honestly at the price. I have told him the fair price, and he has bought of the makers. I received the paper between Whitecross-street and Golden-lane. I believe it was in the city.</p>

            . I am a builder, and live in Suffolk-street, Borough. Ashman papered three houses for me in Dorset-place. I met him one Saturday while he was about it, on Kennington-common, with Treble, they had some paper and tools, he ran across the road to me, and said he had got the papers at last, and was going to complete the house, and asked me for 25 l. I said I was short, and he asked if he might draw a bill for 20 l. I agreed, we crossed over to Treble, they shewed me a roll of paper which I approved of, and they went on. About two hours after Ashman called with the bill, and I accepted it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. He charged a fair price - A. Yes; 24 l. Mr. Paul had done two houses for me at nearly five per cent. less.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 17th of November I found Ashman at a public house, in the London-road. I asked him to walk out and lay hold of my arm. I told him I had something unpleasant to communicate to him. He asked me what it was. I said, I believed he had pawned some paper in Blackfriar's-road; he said he never pawned any paper in his life. I asked if he had pawned any in the name of Green - He denied that, and after walking some distance towards the pawnbroker's, he said, "I believe I know what you allude to, I received some tickets from Mrs. Treble." I asked if he had the duplicates, or had taken the paper out. He said he had not - he afterwards said he believed he took three pieces out to finish a job; he had said once or twice before, that he knew nothing of the paper or duplicates. I said then you have the duplicates; he said, No, he had burnt them. I got some paper from Slark.</p>

            . These papers are ours. The pattern is quite new, nobody else made it, we only sold twenty pieces, and those went to Edinburgh. The paper on Clemence's drawing-room is ours - I have seen it. The trade price for satin paper is 8 s. 6 d. a piece.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Tradesmen sometimes sell at low prices - A. Yes; but not 40 per cent. below the price.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Ashman made a long defence, the substance of which was that Treble supplied him with the paper, representing that he was able to procure it at a low price, from his connexion with the tradesmen at Furnival's Inn, and that he paid him a fair price.</p>

             - this lead pipe was fixed by two lead straps, to the pales in the yard, to serve the water-butt, there was a brass cock to it. On the 17th of November, at nine o'clock, I found it wrenched off, and in consequence of information, I took Tubbs, Judson, and Ball, in custody, and from what Ball told me I took Tubbs to Reynolds's, and asked him, in Reynold's presence, if he had sold a lead pipe, brass cock, and boss there, both him and Reynolds denied it. I went again at five o'clock, with Ball, who said to Reynolds "I and two others sold you the lead which was melted down in an iron pot, and it weighed 10 lbs., and you gave us 1 s. for it, and 5 d. for the cock and boss;" he said he could not deny it, if he had bought it of them, it was gone, for a cart came every other day and took away all his goods; there was six feet of pipe stolen, worth two pence halfpenny a pound, as old lead - the cock was sound and cost 7 s. five years ago.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What are you - A. A carpenter. I know the value of lead, I have exchanged it for new, reckoning it at twopence half-penny a pound. Reynolds said he dare say he did buy it, I asked if he bought the cock and boss with the pipe, his wife said they did buy it in that way, not joined together.</p>

On the 12th of November, about six o'clock at night, I was with them, we got over the paling of No. 1, Chapel-street, Tubbs proposed it; we broke off the lead pipe with the cock at the end, took it to Tubbs's house, and melted it in an iron pot; his father is a carpenter. We then took it to Reynolds, which is a quarter of a mile off; Tubbs carried it on his shoulder in a basket, he took it in, and said "Mr. Reynolds, will you buy this lead," Reynolds weighed it, and said it was 10 lbs., and gave us 1 s. for it. He then weighed the cock, and gave us 5 d. for that; we came away and divided the money. I was taken up, and told if I spoke the truth, I should be saved.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you all go into the shop - A. No, only Tubbs and I went in, Reynolds was in the shop when we first went in - I am fourteen years old, and was never in trouble before.</p>

I told him he should not have done so, considering Mr. Johnson's situation; he said Mr. Johnson would never get out, and he intended to keep them for his wages.</p>

I informed Furzman, the officer about this, and he took me to Plank. In consequence of what passed, I met him in Rupert-street, on the following Tuesday; I had seen him on Monday, and he agreed to bring me two sovereigns, which I was to buy of him. I received 9 s. from Plank before I went to the house; he asked if I had the money for the two sovereigns; I said I had money for one, but could not take two; he said, "You first said you wanted two, and now only one; I must go out for some little time, and will return and let you have it." He returned in two minutes, and gave it me, I gave him 9 s., as he said he could not sell a single one for less; I said the sovereign was wet, he said Yes; in consequence of my not taking the two, he thought I was going to play him a trick, and he had planted the other outside, in the water spout but now his suspicions were at rest; he asked when I should want more, and told me to advise the person to take more at a time, as it would be very advantageous; I said, I should want three on the following night, and agreed to meet him there for them. I gave the sovereign to Plank, and got 24 s. from him; and on Wednesday evening I met him there. He said, as I did not before take what I wanted, he had only got one; I said, I could not take one, as the person expected three; he said it was of little consequence, as I could meet him next morning and have the two, and wished me to pay for the three, as he had some money to make up by the morning, as he had to meet a party with some at nine o'clock, or forfeit 6 s., if he had not got them. After some conversation, I gave him 24 s. for the three, and took one, which I gave Plank. I went next morning, found he had been there; I met him in two minutes in Jeremy-street, he said he had been to the party, but something had happened in the country, they had not arrived, and he should have them in the evening. I met him in the evening in Rupert-street, he produced five, but said he was going into the country, and could only let me have one. I said in a day or two I would take half a score; he said I could have them on Saturday, and if I enquired at the house in the morning, I should hear if he had left town; I took the one, and was to have the other, with the half score, and was to give him 7 s. each. I went on Saturday, and waited him in; he asked if I wanted the quantity that I said; I said Yes; and he told me to meet him in half an hour; I went out and saw Plank at a house in King-street, and got four crowns, three half-crowns, and seven shilling and a sixpence in marked money from him, and another sixpence, unmarked, to spend. Jefferies and Furzman were there, they followed me to Rupert-street, the prisoner was not there, he came in a few minutes, and asked if I had got the money; I said Yes; he said he was very sorry, but he only had three; I said I must have the quantity I stated, he said, as I had the money, if I waited half an hour, he would return, he left, returned, and said, "Well, I have them for you;" I said, in consequence of his delay, I had been to the person who would only take five; he said, then he could not let me have them for less than 7 s. 6 d. each; I said I only had the money for five, at 7 s. each, and could only give that; he said it was of no consequence whether I had them or not; I said I could not pay 7 s. 6 d. without seeing the person; he said I could not have them at all till he had gone out for half an hour; we both left, I went to Plank, at the end of the street, and got half-a-crown from him; I met the prisoner at the house, he took me into the yard, and asked if I had all the money right for the five. I gave him 1 l. 17 s. and he gave me five sovereigns. (I had no money but what Plank gave me.) He had four more in his hand; I said I expected to have five, and the one I had paid for before, at six o'clock, that evening, to compleat the half score. I paid for some porter with the sixpence, and parted with him at the door, after drinking some beer, for which he paid 1 s.; the moment I got out, Jefferies took me into a printing-office and took the five sovereigns from me.</p>

            . I am officer, of Marlborough-street. Furzeman brought the last witness to me, the Mint directed me to do the best to detect the dealer; and on the 6th of November, in the afternoon, Jefferies was with me, I gave Findley 9 s., to buy a sovereign. I watched him into the Crown and Punch Bowl, public-house, Rupert-street, he came out in a few minutes with the prisoner, they remained a short time in conversation, and then separated. I followed him into Pultney-street, and he gave one a sovereign, which I produce. I saw him next day, at the Marlborough Head, public-house, and gave him 24 s., followed him to the same house, and saw him come out in company with the prisoner; it was then dusk, I saw Findley give him some silver, and heard the prisoner say,"You shall have them in the morning." Findlay said something, and the prisoner said, "I shall loose 6 s., by them." Findlay said, "Then you will let me have them in the afternoon." He said, "Yes, about ten o'clock;" and they parted. Before that, when they first came to the door, the prisoner went away, and I followed him to a house, in Bedfordbury, I went back to Rupert-street, he returned to the Crown and Punch Bowl, public-house; they then came out together, and I heard the conversation I have stated. I followed Findley, and joined him, he delivered me another sovereign. The next day, I saw Findley again, and followed him to the house, in Rupert-street. I saw them come to the door, they parted, Findley gave me another sovereign. On the 10th of September, Furzeman and Jefferys were with me, at a public-house, in King-street, Golden-square; we searched Findley, to see that he had no money, and I gave him four crowns, three half-crowns, seven shillings, and a sixpence, all of which I had marked - I gave him an unmarked sixpence to spend. I saw him go into the Crown and Punch Bowl, public-house, the prisoner went in soon after, and came out in a very short time, I watched him into Coventry-street, and there saw a man speak to him, who was waiting with a bag under his arm; they stepped up by a door, and the man delivered something to the prisoner; they parted, the prisoner went along Coventry-street, he returned in half an hour, and went into the Crown and Punch Bowl, public-house, they remained there half an hour, they then came out and parted. I took the prisoner about twenty yards off, his right hand was in his breeches pocket, I had great difficulty to get it out. I found a sixpence in his left hand, unmarked. I searched him at the office, and in his right hand breeches pocket I found four crowns, marked; four half-crowns, three marked; six shillings, and a sixpence, marked; it was the money I gave Findley, one shilling was wanting. Furzeman took four sovereigns from his left hand pocket. I went to the Crown and Punch Bowl, public-house, the landlady gave me a shilling, which was one I had given Findley. The prisoner said he lived in Bury-street, with his mother, and attended on gentlemen, who lodged there, and got the silver from them, and the gold he had had some time. He said he had been at the Crown and Punch Bowl, public-house, with Findley.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You went to his mother - A. Yes; he did live there, his friends are respectable. I lost sight of him when he came out on Saturday, there is a court opposite the house. The house in Bedfordbury is a most desperate place.</p>

In August, last he employed me to assist him in papering a house for Mr. Mullin's, we did the job together; he was to receive the money and pay me. I got the paper from Long that the job was done with, by Ashman's desire. He knew Long was the prosecutors <rs id="t18211205-86-deflabel534" type="occupation">porter</rs>, I am certain of it, for I have told him so. I then lodged in Upper Thames-street. Ashman and I took the paper from Thames-street, Long had brought it to my apartment. A flock border was also put round the room, which was obtained from Long. Ashman was to pay 8 s. a piece for it, the trade price was 25 s. He was to give 5 s. a piece for the paper, the trade price for which was 8 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Who made the bargain with Mullins - A. Ashman. I was to share the profit, but I appeared as the journeyman. I took some patterns. I have a memorandum in my book which enables me to say it was in August, (reads) "10th of August, received of Ashman, 1 l." That was the day the rooms were finished. I am sure Ashman took it from Thames-street. I never delivered him a bill made out as bought of me. My friends advised me to become a witness, and I sent to Mr. Harmer offering to be a witness. Ashman told me he was have 20 l. each for two houses he was to do for Clemence.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Whose hand-writing is this book - A. Ashman's; it is the book he kept to enter up the account. Here is an entry, (reads) "11th of August, paper to Mullins's job, 20 s. cash, to Treble." This tallies with my book, I altered my book on comparing it with his, as he said mine was wrong.</p>

            . I know Ashman. I recollect when Treble was taken up; about that time Ashman spoke to me on the subject. When Treble brought the paper to the house, I told him I did not think Treble got it honestly. He said if he did not he paid a fair price for it. I said he would get himself into trouble. He said if he did, he did not care, they could do nothing to him but transport him. This was a few days before he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I wish to fix you to some time - A. I cannot say the day. I did not know Treble was taken till the 17th of November; he has worked in my house occasionally, but not for twelve months. I never liked him.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you - A. A widow, I live at No. 1, Prospect-place.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you were not intimate - have you not lived together - A. I said I was not intimate with Treble. I lived eight years with Ashman; he left me ten months ago, and has married another woman. I told him when he came that there had been a search warrant in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you caution him before the search warrant - A. Yes; repeatedly. I never knew he was married till after he was apprehended. I did not cause any communication to be made to Messrs. Cox and Co. I never told Mr. Gude that I had given information to them. Mr. Gude called on me and said Ashman was surprised at my not attending to his letter. I said I had taken advice, and could take no notice of any letter. Mr. Gude said Ashman had reason to believe I was at the bottom of the communication to Messrs. Cox and Co. I said "If he is not guilty, and has harboured that opinion, let it rest so."</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. You often admonished him on the danger of associating with Treble - A. Yes. Ashman came to me on the 17th, he said he had heard Treble was in trouble and that he himself must be off, and asked if I had any money, I had half-a-crown, which I gave him, and told him I had told the gentleman I should be at five minutes call if I was wanted; and he said</p>

            . My evidence given last night is correct.</p>
               <p>MR. COX. The papers are all our patterns. Here is a pattern of the satin paper which was on one of Mullins's room, and is our manufacture. The other is Treis paper, it is 14 d. a yard, or 14 s. a piece; the border was 28 s. a piece. The room had not been papered above five months.</p>
               <p>ASHMAN'S Defence. My Lord's, and Gentlemen of the Jury - After the proceedings of last night I did not expect to appear at this bar again, but if the prosecutors are determined to proceed, I must submit. I know I can expect justice at your hands, after the trial of last night; but when all the ingenuity of talent, and all the perfidy of this man and the ingenuity of his wife have failed, I cannot expect you will receive that evidence again, unless supported by witnesses of character and reputation, which I am happy to say it is impossible to produce. Treble preyed upon my credulity, I never had any dealings with Long. I am very sorry the prosecutors have introduced an unfortunate woman to strengthen their case; I trust her evidence has not injured me, and I shall therefore not attempt to expose her.</p>

I had directions to read a paper to them, to invite them to return on the old terms; they met in a field near the Dock, there were nearly three hundred of them. I read this paper audibly to them: (reads.) "Notice to extra coopers, employed in the West India Docks. Those men who do not answer to their names, and come to work as usual, will not be again employed in the Docks." They appeared to consult among themselves. I called Armsworth out from among them, to answer; he came from the body, and told me the men would not come to wait the ten minutes beyond the time; and, if ever they did come to work, they would have 6 s. a-day, instead of 5 s., which they were paid before. Their hours for work, were from eight till four. I gave no answer to it, but walked away with my officers about me; they remained some time assembled, and as I passed by them, they cheered once or twice, I think three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the first time you knew of any general dissatisfaction - A. I had given notice on the 4th, they expressed dissatisfaction before that, Saturday was the first day. The rum and sugar coopers are under different officers; this regulation did not apply to the rum coopers. We were very busy at the time. I think there were as many men employed as I ever remember.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. You are minister to the Dock Company, at the sugar department - A. I am principal cooper; I had the foreman of the coopers with me. The order for them to stay till ten minutes past four o'clock, was issued on Saturday, the 4th; they walked out at four o'clock, on hearing the order, without a murmur, they would not stop. They had 6 s. a-day from 1812 to 1816; the Dock-master then gave me an order to pay them 5 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Having first reduced their wages, they then cut them off to half days sometimes - A. They did reduce them to half days, they were first paid for a quarter of a day, and then for half a-day. After reading the paper, I saw them consulting together, and called Armsworth out, as he was a man of intelligence; he was one of the sugar coopers, he was generally active, and was so that morning, he was one of the most active. I did not see any of the defendants when I read the paper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How long have you been in the Company's service - A. From 1802. Captain Parish came into the service five years ago; he has done a great deal of good for the coopers.</p>
               <p>Q. He did away with the quarter of days, and did not allow refreshment from the masters of the ships to the coopers. - A. That was never allowed. We pay the men by the day; if they only work one day, many of them want their money, but if they expect employ to the end of the week, they wait. The permanent men are paid at the end of the week. I only know Smith by name. I believe neither of the other defendants were ever in the Company's employ. I know they were not at that time when the 1 s. a-day was added in 1812; it was done by the men petitioning. I never heard of their petitioning against it, when it was taken off. Petitions are sent to the Dock-house. I do not remember Smith and Kirk delivering me a petition in 1816.</p>
               <p>Q. After the dispute, the men on the rum side, continued at work - A. Yes; a paper was handed about among them. Petitions are sent to the Dock-house, that is the mode in which the men state their complaints.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. There was a paper handed about in 1816 - A. I do not recollect it; a paper was handed about in the rum department, the men wanted 6 s. a-day. Captain Parish is principal man in the Docks, the 1 s. a day was taken off in 1816; when he came into the employ; the half days were made about that time, and the men were thankful for it.</p>
               <p>Q. They insisted on their stopping ten minutes, and then the murmuring began - A. There had been papers handed about before, but there was no regular murmuring, they murmured when they were reduced from 6 s. to 5 s. Some of them continued in the employ, they are only extra men who could not get work elsewhere.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any murmuring till they were kept ten minutes longer - A. No. The men were discharged on the 7th, a constable was stationed at the gates on the 7th.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell what the three hundred men assembled near the gate for? on your oath was it not to go to work - A. No; for they gave it out that they would not come to work, they did not attempt any violence to the docks, they said the night before, they would not come to work without another shilling.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050060"/>Q. Who did you hear say so - A. One Keamer and Armsworth, he was generally a prominent man, I cannot say how long Smith has been in the service of the Company - I never heard any complaint against him.</p>

               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. To how many warehouses did this order apply - A. There are eleven, one was unoccupied, the order applied to the five beyond the clock, the most distant from the gate. I have the order here, it is dated 7th of August, 1821, and addressed to myself, signed Charles Parish; (reads) "You will give orders to the foreman of the coopers, at No. 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10, that any cooper who declines to wait at the warehouse, where he has been employed, till his name has been called in the usual way; is to be informed he will not be employed on the following day, and is to be paid that day for the work already performed."</p>
               <p>Q, They assembled on the 8th, and said they would not come to work without another shilling, was that said by Keamer and Armsworth among a number of them - A. They were in the ring, and spoke for the whole of them.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The side the order was made for was not Smith's - A. No. I do not know whether he was among the men.</p>

            . I am principal Dock-master at the West India Dock. I have the charge of the warehouses, and property therein, I am answerable for the subordination and sobriety of the men. The order produced was written by me, in consequence of what I understood to be an objection on the part of the coopers; my first order was that they should not proceed to the gate from the middle of the dock, till ten minutes after the bell rang, to prevent too great a crush; the bell rings at four o'clock; we had 300 men in the docks at the time, besides revenue officers - the coopers had resisted the search at the gate, and had collared the constable, it is usual to search every labourer as he leaves the gate - there are two narrow, and one large gate. The order was to prevent too great a crush to prevent a search, they were not to work during the ten minutes; it is usual to call over the men's names going in, and coming out, to see that they have been at work all day. The order was issued on the 4th of August, we had one hundred more men in the docks then, than was ever employed in my time before; we had fifty ships laden with sugar unloaded on the 4th.</p>
               <p>Q. Between the 4th and 7th was any intimation given to you by the coopers - A. None whatever, the first intimation I had, was on the morning of the 7th after twelve o'clock, and I sent Adams down to explain to them the intent of the order, that it was for their comfort as well as the regulation of the Dock. There was about three hundred less at work on the 8th, than on the 7th, we had occasion for an equal number, the deficiency continued fifteen days and during the time, ships came in daily; there was ninety-four ships when the body returned, some few men returned before that; we worked from six o'clock till six, instead of four o'clock, to make up the deficiency. At this time orders were issued to get coopers from Bristol, and Liverpool, Thompson and Newman were sent down for that purpose, and about ninety men came up from the two Ports; I gave an order to the foreman of the rum coopers, for them to assist on the sugar side, they declined it to a man. I received orders to employ any coopers who offered themselves, and put a notice up at the gate to that effect - I have a copy of it, the orignal was torn down, and I have not seen it since; I had forty or fifty copies of it from the printer; twelve were stuck up, and I gave some to be sent to places where coopers resorted. I will swear this is one of those the printer sent me, for I have had it ever since. (reads.)</p>
               <p>Notice, A communication having been laid before the Court of Directors, purporting to contain the grounds of the coopers leaving the Company's service, and the terms they intend to return to their duty. Notice is hereby given that the coopers having been dismissed, is not true, and those who chose to return at the original pay are welcome to do so, but the Directors will not pledge themselves to any other terms.</p>
               <p>H. LONGMAN.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. When did you first come into the Company's service - A. In June, 1816. I have authority to make orders, for regularity, I issued the order for the ten minutes extra, myself; I made regulations, which I thought for the improvement on the Dock. I ordered the half days as an improvement on the quarter days, in consequence of a representation made to me by the principal cooper. I did not make an order for the quarter day. The order for staying ten minutes, applied to about one hundred and forty men out of three hundred; I never heard of a petition about the half, and quarter day. When I entered the service, the men had 6 s., a day, being the war wages; they were not allowed to work over time then; the wages were reduced by an order of the Court, about six months after I entered the Company's employ, I have no authority to reduce wages, I made no representation to the Court previous to the reduction. Petitions go through my hands, I heard of none on the subject.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Dock gate shut against the men in the morning - A. No; there was always two constables at the gate. I gave orders, that unless they returned to work they would not be admitted.</p>
               <p>Q. What had they done the night before - A. Run away from work, and rushed out at the gate the moment the bell rang.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they not refused admission in the morning - A. Nobody applied, they kept at a distance from the gate, to make a treaty.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What office do you hold - A. I am called principal dock-master, and sometimes principal store-keeper; I am called captain from courtesy. Smith was in the service when I entered it, he was on the rum side, I gave an order for the rum coopers to work over time, and they did, for two or three day, that was a few days before the coopers returned, or a few days after, I am not sure which. The act of parliament is imperative, that the men shall work eight hours a days without cessation, a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes, is given by the officer, for refreshment. I presume, some of them came from a considerable distance, I considered it my duty to order them to remain ten minutes, to prevent them being crushed, or resisting the search.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear of a resistance before the order was made - A. The resistance was in consequence of the order; they collared the constable on the third,, the day before the order, they would not be rubbed down. Most men on the rum side have been on the sugar side;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050061"/>I believe Smith is a good workman, I do not remember his bringing me a petition when the wages were reduced, it must have been years after, I never had any intercourse with him about the reduction; I have some recollection of him, and Kirk bringing a petition, about three years ago, which caused two men to be made permanent. Smith was discharged about three weeks ago, by his foreman, he was one of those who worked overtime, I had no occasion to find fault with him; I had given orders, that the one hundred and forty men should not come to work, some of them came for their tools.</p>
               <p>WR. WALFORD. Q. On the 3rd, a report was made to you of a great pressure and disturbance at the gate - A. Yes; that was the sole reason of my issuing the order. I believe the men had drank too much beer, the rum coopers worked two or three days over time on their own side, and were paid for day and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the order about half days - A. In the busy time, every man who came was employed, and when we were not busy, we could not employ all; good workmen could get employ in the trade, and indifferent ones stand at the gate every day for employ. Our work is very precarious, and at times we want a man in the middle of the day; if they worked an hour, they were only paid for an hour; my order was, that they should be paid for half a day, if they worked at all, and that they should be employed for half a-day or the whole, if they worked more than half a day, they were paid for the whole day.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know the regulations about half days and hours, before you came to have the superintendance - A. When I came they were paid for the time they worked, these regulations do not apply to permanent coopers, they are always paid, whether they work or not.</p>

            . I was employed in the West India Docks, as sugar cooper, in August last. On the morning of the 8th, there was a meeting of the coopers, near the Dock gate, there were upwards of three hundred men, I was there; Adams spoke to me. On the next evening, Thursday, I attended a meeting, at the Lord Hood, public-house, (on the 8th,) there were a great many coopers there, but none of the defendants. On Thursday, the 9th, there was a meeting, at the Angel, public-house, in the Minories, there was so many, the room would not hold them; I was in the room, I do not know how many there were outside, there was more than hundred in the room; Smith was there. I saw the other defendants down stairs, I think I saw Hall at the door, but only saw Smith in the room. I am not positive that I saw the others, it was after seven o'clock, in the evening. I took the part of conducting the sugar coopers, I sat in the chair, the proposition was about supporting the men, several strangers spoke. Smith proprosed, that the men should have 3 s. a day, for the time they were out of employ; the proposition was carried. Some said 3 s. was too much, they could not meet the demand. I did not hear Smith say any more, he stood on the bench to propose it, and when carried, he got down. The purpose they met for, was to be supported while they were out employ, on the sugar side of the West India Docks. The money was to be rose by subscription, men were proposed to go round to the different shops, cooperages, brewhouses, and vinegar yards, and all trades that required coopers; and the men in work were to pay 2 s. 6 d., a week, to make the fund. It was said at the meeting, that the rum coopers were likewise to contribute, they were not to strike, but work, and support us while we were out of employ; I do not know who made this proposal, it was carried. We met again, on Saturday night, the 11th, at the same place, to receive 7 s. a man, which was to be distributed, I saw Hucks, Smith, and Hall there, no chair was taken, Forman was not there. I received 8 l. 15 s., at the rate of 7 s. a man, for my twenty-five men, who belonged to the warehouse, No. 9, on the sugar side, I received it off the table, Hucks counted it out. I went and gave it to my men.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you belong to the Cooper's Union, or Philanthrophic - A. I have entered it since that. We met again, the next Saturday night, the 18th, at the same place, Hucks was there, but I am not sure that I saw Smith, nor either of the others, there were thirty or forty in the room, they were coming and going. I received 4 s., for twenty-three of my men, I received for two short, as they had got employ, or had left. I attended a meeting, at the Angel and Trumpet, Stepney-green, on Monday, the 13th; Hucks was there, I cannot say who else, it was a meeting, to distribute 2 s. a man, I received for twenty-two or twenty-three, money was distributed for all the warehouses. I attended another meeting, at the Ship, Bethnal-green, on the 22d, the day before we returned to work, and received 2 s. each for my men there. I saw several men go in and come out with money. Smith was there, I saw none of the others. I saw Hall on the green in the day time; nothing passed at that time. I attended at the

            , public-house, Stepney, every one of the fifteen days that we were away. On the second Monday, in the morning, I saw Hall in the tea-gardens of the house, there were two or three hundred sugar coopers assembled, and Hall came in with fifteen or twenty men who had come from Bristol and Liverpool. Hall said he had brought the men who had come up by coach for the Dock Company, and we must take care of them, they were taken from there, and refreshment given them. Hall went away with them. On that day week, after we returned to work, I attended a meeting at the Angel, public-house, and saw Smith, Hall, and Hucks there. Forman was not there, there were nearly two hundred coopers. Smith presided, the business was for the sugar coopers to subscribe 2 s. 6 d. a week, to refund back to the Philanthropic Society, the money paid to the men; which they had advanced, different persons brought in accounts of money advanced to the Philanthropic Society. Hall claimed, and had allowed him 5 s. a day for his loss of time in conducting the Liverpool and Bristol men to the Ben Johnson public-house, and from there to the coaches, and for maintaining them whilst they were in his charge. I believe he also brought in a bill of 45 l. besides, for expences. I took a memorandum of it, (producing it) I took it to satisfy the sugar coopers that the money had been faithfully distributed. 5 l. 18 s. 6 d. was claimed on the part of Foreman, for his expences to Bristol and back, he went to inform the coopers that the West India Dock coopers were discharged, and that there were more coopers out of employ in London than could find work, he was not present. Hucks made the same<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050062"/>claim as Hall for time and expences in attending in Lambeth-street, in consequence of a warrant issued against him by Bull and Hawkins, who, he said, charged him with carrying them from the Dock gates as they were going in to work. He was allowed 2 l. expences, and 11 l. for the lawyer's bill. Price in the Commercial-road was his lawyer. The money was voted to him, and he said he was satisfied. Hall was with Hucks at Lambeth-street. I was appointed by the meeting to inform the sugar coopers at the West India Docks of the expenditure of the money, and solicit their 2 s. 6 d. subscription.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this paper? - A. This is a paper I got from the meeting, where the accounts were adjusted; it is the receipt and expenditure of the money - it was just written when it was delivered to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q.Don't you think you were one of the worst among them? - A. I am not my own judge: I heard of no meeting at which I was not present.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose service are you now in? - A. When at home I am at my own service, now I am at your service. I am not in the employ of the Dock Company. I returned for about a fortnight, and then went away because I did not like to stop. I gave information when I was stopped from going into the Docks; they did not receive me, but ordered me to go to the Dock House: I went and worked three days after the men went in. I was never here before.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps never in any other Court? - A. I have been in Chancery.</p>
               <p>Q. Any other? - A. I am but a single individual, if you come to the point I will give you an answer; if you flurry me I may perjure myself. I have been at Hick's Hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you the gentleman who was convicted at Hick's Hall of knocking down your own father? - A. I was convicted of an assault; but it was through three prostitutes whom my father knew: the Lord Chancellor is in the possession of the whole of it. I always thought, that by the laws of this country, a man was not to be told of conviction. It was eight years ago. I was tried for a libel in charging my father with murder.</p>
               <p>Q. You were spokesman at the Dock gate? - A. Yes, I was picked out by the principal master cooper; I did not set myself up to speak for them, they quite forced me to it. The same men attended at the meeting, and they put me in the chair. I did not assume the power of keeping order, I was quite a novice at it. I stated to the meeting, that the object was to get a livelihood; others spoke before me. The meeting was in such a confused state I sat in a chair; but was not aware that I was to rule when the people belonging to the club were there; mine was like another chair, only larger, but too low for me to be chairman. They were all speakers at one time, and no hearers; the club might assemble without my knowledge, they did not always inform me; they sent a man to Bristol without my knowledge. I was present when it was agreed for one to go to Bristol and one to Liverpool. When I was sent for I went.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to the club, intending to betray whom? - A. Oh! dear Sir, quite the reverse, my principle is, I had rather be convicted.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been forced to be a witness? - A. By the law I am forced to be here.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned to work, did you not tell the men, that as you had headed them out you would head them in? A. I said, "As we all came out together, let us go in together:" I never used the word heading.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever propose going to Liverpool or Bristol free of expense, to prevent the coopers from coming up? - A. I said, "If you are such a lover of your trade, I would go for nothing." I addressed the whole meeting; I told them I could not go down, as I had a law suit to attend to. A committee of eleven was appointed, but not by me. I was appointed first; the whole body of coopers forced me into the chair.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. After you were accused of assaulting your father, were you imprisoned twelve months? - A. Yes. He was dead when I came out.</p>
               <p>Q. You was on the sugar side? - A. Yes: I worked beyond the clock. The order applied to me - I was not a permanent man. I was there when the Dock was built in 1802.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not stimulate the coopers to resist the order, and say, if they did not resist there would be further encroachments? - A. I told the foreman I was subject to the rheumatism, and could not stop, for I was always in a perspiration when I left work, and if I stood ten minutes I should be laid up. I disapproved of the order. I recommended no man to resist. I said I could not put up with it, as I was subject to the rheumatism; but they might do as they liked. I was determined to leave the employment as my health would not admit of it. The order was, that if we did not obey we must be dismissed. Several men said they would take their money and not come again. I went to the gate next morning for my money, and went into the Dock to fetch my tools. The body of them left the service. I was not addressing the men when Adams selected me; he said they were all speaking, and he could not hear them, and selected me: three or four men came to me and said tell him this, and I told him they would not come to work unless they had 6 s. a day. I did not propose to lead them to any public house, nor propose that the rum men should be invited to join us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend before any of the directors when Read was there about a petition? - A. I did; and told the committee that the Docks were considered a disgrace to the slave market in the West Indies. I was sent by the men, who desired me to repeat those words: it met the general approbation of the men. A gentleman named Hurcott interfered; I was censured for concurring with him in getting the men back. I said the rum coopers were determined we should not go in, and I had been very ill used by some of them, and said I would leave it altogether, and went to Hurcott. I was ill treated and knocked down for persuading them to go in. I did not urge the men to resist the efforts which Read and Raven were making to get them to go back, not to my recollection: I said, "Stick altogether, all go in, or all stay out, don't go away to different places; as we all come out let us all go in together." A list was to be made of who would go in or stop out: I said I was determined to go in, and at last the list was turn up, and all were going in. The rum coopers wanted us to stop out another day. I asked the rum men if they would throw away a day; they said no: then, said I, "We will not:" this was the night before we went in. I did not make a speech to the men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Can you write? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050063"/>Q. Look at this and say if you ever saw it before? - A. It is not my writing, I never saw it before to the best of my knowledge. I was convicted of assaulting my father in 1813; he was 70 years old. He owned on his death bed that he purchased the witnesses against me. I have been tried twice for common assaults. I was not forced to go to the meeting, I was appointed by the men to go, and went to serve them. I believe I spoke once or twice at the Angel.</p>
               <p>Q. It was all unwillingly? - A. Unwillingly; I never heard about the advance till I was out of the Docks. I did not make a speech at the gardens when the Bristol and Liverpool men came. Hall came and asked me to request the men to give them three cheers, for it was a great victory obtained in falling in with them from the different coaches; we gave three cheers, and the countrymen returned it. I attended a committee of the Dock Company after Hurcott interfered: the committee said I espoused the cause too warm.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever go to the newspaper office about this business? - A. Yes; to put three advertisements in; I did it at the request of the body. Smith said the rum coopers were to stop in and contribute alike to support the others. He did not tell me to advise them to petition.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. Q. Have you been paid your wages? - A. Yes; only what was due to me for work.</p>

            . I am a cooper employed on the sugar-quay. I worked in warehouse No. 4. I attended a meeting at the Angel three days after the strike, on a Friday morning. I saw Farnworth in the chair; a man named Smith was there. Farnworth was chairman, and was holding forth before them all what was best to be done. Several persons spoke; and one called Smith said,</p>
               <p>"You certainly men have been very ill used, but if you are willing to enter into a subscription for these men who stand out for wages, they shall have at the rate of 3 s. a day." Farnworth said, "How is this to be supported, and from whence to come?" - Smith said, "I make a motion that the whole trade shall support it, as we have a bye-law that those men who are in work shall subscribe 2 s. 6 l. a week to support those who are not, to protect the rights and privileges of the trade." - Farnsworth said, "How is the money to be made up? I think there are 250 or 300, more or less." - Smith proposed that those present who were in work should subscribe, and said, "For my part, I will give 2 s. 6 d." Farnworth said he would give the same. I don't know whether he said 2 s. 6 d. or 3 s. The room was crowded. Two or three men at the further end said, "You, Mr. Smith, I want to know what you rum coopers are going to do, whether you intend to strike or not." Smith said "I beg you will not have so much to say about the rum coopers, we shall do as we like; we are not going to satisfy you whether we strike or not. I know who you are, thought I cannot get near you; you are a wrangle some fellow, and have always bred a great deal of disturbance." I returned to work on the day her Majesty was buried. I usually worked at No. 4, but I went to No. 10. I met with no difficulty in returning to work.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. Farnsworth was in the chair? - A. Yes: he was entirely spokesman, and the whole body seemed to be led by him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did Farnsworth hold forth? - A. Yes; and he said it was requisite that the coopers should gain their ends, which was impossible, unless the run coopers struck as well as them. Smith (pointing to him), begged one or two to hold their tongues about the rum coopers, as they would do as they thought proper; and I think he said they had drawn up a petition, and presented it to the Dock Company, and would not strike, but wait the issue of the Company's answer. Farnsworth held forth with great violence.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were called on as a conscientious man to say who was the most violent, who would you say? - A. I have seen Farnsworth very busy at many meetings, and think him the most violent man in the company. I only saw Smith at one meeting. Farnsworth was always the most violent, and there is no doubt but all the men were led by him. I returned to work before the rest, and went to several meetings afterwards, but they would not admit me, as they said I was a spy. Farnsworth certainly urged several men to stand out; he begged of me to suffer death sooner than return.</p>

            . I am a cooper and worked in the sugar quay. I was occasionally employed by the company. I attended the first meeting after the strike; I saw Smith there soon after the business commenced; he assured the men present, that 3 s. a day would be allowed during their absence from the West India Docks: one Richards objected to it; but Smith assured the meeting that 3 s. a day would be allowed. I did not hear how the money was to be got. I received some money at the Three Lords, Minories; the first payment was 7 s. the second 2 s. and I received 4 s. afterwards from a man named Munn. I was one of those who struck. There were a great many at the meeting.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. Who was chairman? - A. Farnsworth, he opened the business and conducted it.</p>

            . I was one of the extra coopers. I attended a meeting at the Green Dragon, Stepney, on the 8th; it was attended by a great many. I saw none of the defendants there. I attended another at the Ben Johnson next day, nobody in particular was in the chair; but Farnsworth generally held forth. None of the Defendants were there to my knowledge. The meeting was concerning the infringement of time made by the Company; that was their grievance; they absented themselves on that account; we met there every day till it was settled. I have seen Hall and Smith there. I received money at the Angel to pay 42 men, belonging to my warehouse, No. 4, at 7 s. each; there were 30 or 40 people there. I saw Hall in the room, also Forman and Smith. The money was ready told out on the table with my number to it; I always received the money when the company paid us, and so I received this. I attended to receive it in consequence of a note; Farnsworth I believe told us to go there, and there would be money for us. I received a second sum the following Saturday, at the same place; Smith was there, and I think Forman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. Were you intimate with any of the men? - A. Yes: many had wives and large families.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Farnsworth was generally spokesman? - A. Yes. I have known Smith 5 or 6 years. I never heard his character subject to the slightest reproach; no man could work more industriously. He was on the rum side; the rum men did not strike.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then the rum men had nothing to do with it? - A. No: the men had 5 s. a day.</p>

            . I am permanent foreman cooper in the West India Docks. On the Sunday after the strike, Adams sent me to meet the Bristol coach, six coopers came. I was to suffer them to remain in town if they thought proper, and to convey them to the Docks on the next morning. I appointed to meet them on Tower-hill on Monday morning, but they did not come. I went towards the Plough, in Smithfield, where I had left them, and met them in Cheapside, Hall was with them. I told them they were behind their time; they said they had seen some of the trade, and did not intend to go to work. I don't know whether Hall heard them, he was in front, and had a man on each side; he walked on. I remonstrated with them, and finding them straggling towards the east, I was fearful of losing them all, so I moved on with them, and got only two of them to the Docks - there appeared about eighteen altogether.</p>

            . I am an extra cooper in the Docks; Thompson hired me at Bristol at the Hole-in-the-Wall, where the coopers sometimes meet. I saw the defendant Forman there on the 18th, after Thompson had come down to hire men. He said in the presence of about forty coopers, that none of the men on the rum quay had struck, for when they received their week's money it went to support the club till such time as the Company submitted.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you to do with the coopers striking? - A. I went to see some of the coopers off, and saw nineteen go off, and had spoken to Thompson about going myself. I saw two men by the Post-office, who had partly agreed to go, and what they said led me to the Hole-in-the-Wall. Forman came in afterwards, and one of these men said he was sent down by the society of coopers to prevent their coming up, and that all the coopers on the rum quay were at work. I saw him afterwards on the Bristol quay, with

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. The cooper's trade requires an apprenticeship? - A. Yes, seven years. I have 3 s. 6 d. a day at Bristol, and work from six to six.</p>

            . I was a cooper of Liverpool. I was engaged to come to the West India Docks. I came to Ladlane by coach, and met Hall and Hicks there; they asked if we were from Liverpool. There were ten of us in one coach and three in another. We said we did come from Liverpool. They told us to come with them. They took us to the Angel in the Minories, into a large room, and said there was a regular strike among the coopers, and they hoped we would not go to work till they saw further into it. They gave us something to eat and drink; there was nobody but ourselves in the room; they found us at the Peacock, in Whitechapel; we all lodged there two nights. I don't know who paid our expences, we did not. After being there two days we went to Mr. Adams's office, told him what had passed. Five of us went to work on Wednesday and four afterwards.</p>

            . I am a cooper in the West India Docks. Smith was a rum cooper. During the time of the strike, he told me there was to be a meeting at the Shipwrights' Arms. I went to the second meeting; Smith was there, and was proposed by the general class there to be speaker. He said it was requisite to know what the rum coopers intended to do, whether they intended to strike, or what way to proceed, as it was time to come to some decision; but for his part, he would recommend the rum coopers not to strike, and that there might he means taken, such as supporting the men, and sending in an humble petition to the board. Some were for striking and some were not, and the permanent men would have nothing to do with it. They decided, that there should be a collection made of 3 s. each man, to support the men on the sugar side; the resolution was carried. I opposed it, and was roughly treated, and told I was afraid of losing my situation. Davenport also opposed it. Smith recommended the rum coopers not to go over to the sugar quay till they had a satisfactory answer to the petition, which was not then written.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Smith's advice was to petition? - A. Yes: each man was to pay 3 s.; a number of men had large families, who were distressed.</p>
               <p>Q. The subscription was to keep them and their families from starving? - A. Yes. I told Mr. Longman that Smith advised the men not to strike.</p>
               <p>MR. WALFORD. Q. When did you tell Mr. Longman that? - A. After the strike.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You are asked if they had large families; they might have had work in the Docks if they liked? - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a permanent rum cooper in the Docks. I remember the sugar coopers striking. I was never at any meeting. Smith asked me for money for the coopers who were standing out, about a week after the strike; I said, I thought the permanent coopers had nothing to do in it, and gave him none; he said it was a general thing throughout the Dock that all the coopers were to pay to it: I said I would have nothing to do with it. We were applied to, to assist on the sugar quay.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Would you believe Parish if he swore that Smith worked over his time during the strike? - A. I believe he did two nights on the rum quay: I have known him a long time, and never heard any thing against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever suspended? - A. I am now suspended on suspicion of being concerned with a man detected in taking rum.</p>

            . I am a cooper at the Docks. At the time of the strike, Smith told me there was a disturbance among the coopers on the sugar side. He called a meeting of the rum coopers at the Shipwrights' Arms; he was there. He and Cook demanded 2 s. 6 d. each from us to support the sugar coopers. The resolution was carried; I paid my 2 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember when it was proposed to the rum coopers to work on the sugar quay? - A. Yes; Smith was there. A letter was read from the Directors stating, that if we went and worked on the sugar side we should have 7 s. 6 d. a day. Several of them murmured, and said, No, no. Mr. Sturts, who read the order, said, "Not one man." Smith said, "No, not half a man."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. There was a great murmur before he spoke? - A. Yes; the proposal was not to quit our side, but to work the over hours on the sugar side. Smith has been seven or eight years in the service, and bears a good character. I was only off work one day, that was a month or six weeks ago; it was on account of this strike. I was sent down to Captain Parish.</p>
               <p>MR. WALFORD. Q. Is it the practice with the coopers to work with other coopers when they leave in the afternoon? A. Yes, I have done it myself, but now work is slack.</p>

            . I am a cooper, in the service of Barclay and Co.</p>
               <p>Q. In August last, was any information given you to collect from Barclay's men? - A. Yes: (looks at a book); I collected 2 l. 12 s. 6 d. I paid it myself on the 13th of August, at the Angel, Minories, to a person who sat there; Hucks signed the book as a receipt for the money. I afterwards attended a meeting to audit the accounts at the Angel; (looks at a paper), this is the account; I copied it from a paper which was handed round at the meeting.</p>
               <p>[This account was here read. It was a statement of cash received from different persons amounting to 177 l. 1 s. and of expenses amounting to 69 l. 10 s.]</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any other collection? - A. Yes; and paid it at the Rose and Ram, Southwark, to one Hall (not the defendant), for coopers out of work.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know Farnsworth? - A. By sight; I saw him at the Angel. I attended no meeting till after they returned to work. Farnsworth sat next to me when the accounts were audited, and took a very active part. Smith came in at the close of the business. If a cooper is any thing of a hand he can earn 7 s. a day; and if a good one, from 9 s. to 10 s.</p>
               <p>- LONGMAN, ESQ. I am Secretary to the West Docks. I remember a petition being brought in on the 20th of August, it was laid before the Court on the 21st of 
               <persName id="t18211205-89-person1056">August. After</persName>
             that, I went down to the Docks, and saw Smith, it was between the 21st and 23th of 
               <persName id="t18211205-89-person1057">August. Smith</persName>
             was sent merely to ascertain whether the petition was to be considered as coming from the permanent rum coopers as well as the extra, or from extra coopers only: he avowed it to be the petition of both permanent and extra. The Directors desired that two of the permanent men should be sent for, I believe the officers of the department selected Smith.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You were desired to ascertain from whom it came - A. Yes; Smith was discharged three or four days before this indictment was found.</p>
               <p>The Petition was here read for an advance from 5 s. to 6 s. a day.</p>
               <p>MR. PARISH. The petition was brought down to me. I was desired to enquire if it was from the extra men or both, and to select two to meet the directors. Smith and another man were deputed by the permanent men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did the rum coopers strike - A. No; I heard they were wavering. The rum quay is the most important branch.</p>

I served them with some calico; they were about half an hour in the shop, and left together. We suspected, but did not stop them. I followed them soon after, but did not overtake them, and on returning, I missed a piece of Irish linen. I found them in custody with it.</p>

            . I am shopman to Messrs. Bonner and Rees, who live about a quarter of a mile from Mr. Poole. The prisoners came in about half-past three o'clock, and in consequence of suspicion I pursued them, and said I wanted an explanation about a piece of Irish cloth. I stopped Jenkins, she denied having any thing. I found a piece of cloth concealed between her back and the wall, she was leaning against it. Quinion had walked away but I secured her. Jenkins said Quinion had bought it and given it to her. Poole claimed it. Quinion said it was hers, and she had bought it.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 27th of October, about two o'clock in the morning, I was in Wentworth-street, Whitechapel, and saw a hackney chariot come down Gulstone-street, from Whitechapel, driving very slow, as the road was bad, I looked at it as it passed me, and could see nobody in it. I followed it down Bell-lane, it turned up a short street out of Bell-lane, and stopped at the third door, the coachman was then off his box, and the coach door opened, I cannot say by whom. I had seen Myers following the coach down the street, about forty yards behind. Day is the coachman. When it stopped, I saw them one on each side the coach door, I went up and collared Myers - he begged of me to stash it, which means say nothing about it, he offered me 2 l. to let the property go into the house. Day was present, I said neither 2 l. nor 20 l. would do. I sprung my rattle, another person then came out of the house. I found nobody was coming to my assistance. Myers still pressed me to let it go into the house, and I should have a share in the swag. I said it was of no use, he must go with me, and ordered the coachman to back, which he did. I told him to turn his horses heads and follow me, which he did. I took him up Bell-lane and Winfield-street, and gave my partner charge of Day and the coach. I had Myers by the collar all the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. They both went quietly to the watch-house - A. They did. Myers was not in the coach - he had not stopped half a minute. The person who came out of the house walked off directly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. The coachman took no part in the business - A. No; he followed me down the street when I told him, without being held. The property was all loose in the coach.</p>

In consequence of an anonymous letter, we employed Clinton and Sergeant to watch our premises; and in in consequence of a message which Sergeant sent me, I went to the Lion and Lamb, public-house, Golden-lane, and there saw Ridout; it was about a hundred and thirty yards from our premises. Ridout and his wife were present when we searched the house, and found a paper parcel under the counter in the bar; it contained five pieces of paper-hangings, of rather a common sort, worth 22 s.; I knew it to be our property. We had sent none of it out by Long that day; it is a pattern which only ourselves make. The officer said Long had just brought it in; Ridout said nothing; the officer asked if he was the landlord; of the house; he said, Yes; we went up stairs and found a man named Wayman in bed; I found four pieces of paper-hangings, and some other paper and canvas of ours; and the house was all papered with our paper; about seventeen pieces, and two hundred and four yards of border were hung in all.

            . I am a city officer, I was applied to watch the proceedings of Long, I began to watch on the 5th or 6th, I saw him go from his masters' to the Lion and Lamb public-house, he dined there with Ridout, and his wife and Wayman; I saw him go in there and dine on the 8th also. On the 7th, I saw him carry something there, which he brought out of his masters' house, when he got there he put it under the counter, in the presence of Ridout and his wife, and left it there. On the 12th, I saw him go again, he brought something from his masters, house, and left it with Mrs. Ridout, in Ridout's presence. He took it through the door-way, into the private part of the house. On the 13th, I was on the watch, and at a quarter before nine o'clock, I saw Long come out of his masters' house, he looked up and down the street, to see if he was watched; I was out of sight; he then returned into his masters' house, and came out in a minute or two with a bundle of paper under his arm; I and Sergeant followed close behind him, into the Lion and Lamb public-house; he put the paper on the counter, to Ridout, who put it on a shelf under the counter; Long then went out of the house. I called for a glass of beer, and sat down opposite the counter; waited while Sergeant, the officer went for Mr. Cox, the paper remained under the counter. Ellis and Sergeant came in with a search warrant. When Mr. Cox came, I opened the wicket, and went behind the counter; no person was there but Ridout. I asked him, if he was the landlord; he said Yes; I put my hand to the parcel, and asked who it belonged to; he said, he did not know. I asked if it was his; he said No; his wife came into the bar; Ridout said to her, "Do you know who this parcel belongs to - "she said, No; I said, It was nonsense denying it, for I had seen him receive it. I gave it to Sergeants, and told him to go into the parlour with the prosecutor, to see if it was his property; they were a short time there, and Ridout left the bar as if to go up stairs. I said the officer had better go up with him, they went, and I said below with the prisoner. I went into the back yard, and saw a colour-pot full of colouring; I said "I believe that is something like the colour-pot which Long brought here the other morning." Ridout's wife said, in his hearing, she believed it was, Long brought it on the 9th, and she had put some red lead in to colour the white, it had been white lead. Ridout said, "That is my property, I bought it and paid for it." Long lived at the corner of Addle-hill and Thames-street.</p>

We went up stairs, and found in a cupboard in a front room, four pieces of paper hanging, a quantity of remnants, and two or three pieces of canvas.

               <p>MR. COX. In consequence of information, I went to the Lion and Lamb, public-house, on the 13th of November; Ellis had a search warrant; Ridout and his wife were in the bar, his wife said to him, "You are a ruined man, I wished you to have nothing to do with Long," I and Ellis went up stairs, and in the front room on the first floor. I saw Wayman in bed, we told him we suspected he had some of my property there, he said we might search - Ellis found a parcel containing four pieces of paper, and a large quantity of remnants, in Wayman's room, and some hessing; we went up stairs, and found a large quantity of hessing there, it was all put together, and brought down stairs, there was thirty-seven yards of hessing. On Wayman's seeing we had got the hessing, he said "We have bought these of Long, and gave him 4 d. a yard for it;" Ridout's wife said, "No, we gave 5 d. a yard for it," she said she had bought it, and paid for it, and it was entered in the book; they had no bill of parcels of it. The lowest price we pay for it, is from 8 1/2 d., to 10 1/2 d., a yard to sell again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. The house was papered - A. Yes. Wayman's room was newly papered with my paper, it was perfect paper - the remnants were pieces which were cut off; the hessing is not used in papering, it is for packing. Wayman produced a bill for papering the rooms, and said Long sold it them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. When he said they bought it, Ridout's wife was present - A. Yes; I cannot say whether Ridout was present then.</p>
               <p>MR. AOLPHUS. Q. Did Wayman say who Long was - A. No. The whole pieces of paper were in Wayman's room.</p>

            . I was employed by Messrs. Cox, to watch the proceedings of Long. On the 7th of November, a little after six o'clock in the evening, I saw Long come out of his master's house with an iron pan, and a large bundle, which he took to Golden-lane, it was very heavy, and in canvas - I followed him into the Lion and Lamb, public-house, he opened the wicket of the bar, and put the bundle down behind the counter, and sat himself down; he took his apron, and wiped his hands as if they were dirty; Mrs Ridout gave him a glass of rum and water, and two or three more glasses, before he left the bar; Wayman came into the bar in his shirt sleeves, Long nodded to him, and he (Wayman) immediately stooped down, and picked up the parcel, and carried it out of the bar; he put his foot behind him and shut the door after him - in about half an hour after, Wayman came out of the house with a two gallon stone bottle on his shoulder, and went up Golden-lane. I staid there till a quarter past nine o'clock, when Long left. When he came from behind the bar, he called for a glass of rum to keep the cold out. On the 13th I went there again, and kept below till Mr. Cox came down, and said in Ridouts presence, that he was afraid Wayman would get away, I went up, and found him leaning with his arm on the pillow; I said, "I am astonished you should lay there, we cannot leave without you," he said, "I know that gentleman perfectly well, it is Mr. Cox, and I know his brother, they are respectable gentleman living close by here." Mr. Cox said, "These are officers, and must do their duty." I found a paint pot below, containing white lead, with red lead added to it - I asked Mrs. Ridout if it was not the pot Long brought that morning, she said Long brought it on the 9th, Ridout immediately said, "No that is mine, I bought it, and paid for it." I went and apprehended Long.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. All this property could not be in that bundle - A. No; it was the colouring tied up in hessing. Mrs. Ridout swept away the dirt which came through it.</p>

            . On the 13th of November, I went to the house; and went into the room where Wayman was in bed, and in the cupboard of one of the front rooms, I found two pieces of hessing, four pieces of paper-hanging, and a quantity of remnants. While he was dressing, he opened a drawer in which was another piece of hessing, I asked where he got it, he said he had had it sometime, and bought it of Long for 4 d., a yard; he afterwards admitted that he knew Long to be Mr. Cox's porter. On his coming down stairs all the articles were shewn to him, and he was brought away - I told Mrs. Ridout in his presence, that he said he gave 4 d., a yard for it, she said, "No, we gave<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050069"/>5 d.," she then said to her husband, "I advised you to have nothing to do with Long, you are a ruined man".</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Wayman put in a long written defence, stating, that Ridout had the care of his business, and it was usual for customers to leave parhels to be taken care of; that Longs parcels were always in wrappers, and he never knew the contents. and that Long offered to paper the house, stating that his master allowed him a profit on it.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. COX. Q. Were the rooms papered with the same pattern as the four pieces - A. No; the remnants might be the same pattern.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Ashbridge. of Broad-street, Ratcliffe. While I was at dinner, six shoes were pawned, I did not see who by; and the next time the prisoner came, I accused her with pawning them, and produced them, saying, I suspected they were stolen, being odd ones. She said, a man, who was gone to sea, gave them to her. Clough claimed them.</p>

            . I am a grocer, and live in Archer-street. A little girl told me, three boys were lurking about the prosecutor's door; I looked, and in a few minutes, one boy left the other, and went behind some bricks, then returned, and went into Mousley's shop, and came out with the bacon. The prisoners were two of the boys, I do not know which of three, went in, I went and told the prosecutor, and he missed the bacon; they were then at the end of the house; I am certain they were all three together, he went after the man who took the bacon. I took the prisoners coming across a market gardeners ground, they run as hard as they could.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I was looking out of window, on the 28th of October, between ten and eleven o'clock, in the morning, and saw the prisoner, looking out at the garden door of Mr. Bound's house.

I saw another standing behind the water-closet, he came to him, and both went into the house, In two minutes, they both came to the door, the other man got on the area wall, and the prisoner handed the lead up to him, (it was an unfinished house,) he was going into the next house with it, but on seeing me, he threw it into the area of the next house; I took him.</p>

I went home, and he walked with me, arm in arm, and kept me in conversation. Another man walked about six yards before me, and at the top of the street, the other man made a full stop, the prisoner immediately put his hand to my pocket, and ran off. I felt, and found he had turned it inside out; I pursued him, calling Stop thief! The office stopped him. I know him to be the man, he ran very quick, and I kept close to him all the way.

            . Between twelve and one o'clock in the morning of the 5th of November, I walked round Middle-row, and saw the prosecutrix sitting on a step, and the prisoner standing half bent over her, undoing the handkerchief on her neck - I seized him and asked what he was doing; he said the woman was tipsy, and he was trying to get her home. She jumped up and screamed out that her bonnet was gone. He said he knew nothing of it. I said I shall take you to the watch-house, if you do not tell me; he then said it is at No. 43, George-street. I took him there, and found two women sitting at the fire. He asked them where the bonnet was which he threw into the house; the women said, "On the table," and gave it me. I took him to the watch-house, and found the comb out of her hair in his waistcoat pocket. She was perfectly sober.</p>

            . On Wednesday, the 28th of November; a person came to the shop and gave me information. I went to the door and found the prisoners on the step; it was about ten o'clock at night. They went away on seeing me, but came back in about twenty minutes, and a person came in to sell flints and steels. While I was trying to get him away, the prisoner, Schofield, ran on the step of the door, and took three pair of stockings; both were in company - he saw me and dropped them on the pavement. I ran and took him, the other was taken directly.</p>

The first I saw was Cook, who laid hold of Sir Charles's coat tail and lifted it up, and appeared taking something out, I seized them both. Mash stood a little behind. A third person got away directly among the coaches, whom I took to be in their company. Sir Charles missed his property. Nobody was between them and Sir Charles.</p>

            . I went to Charles-street, with Baker, and found Duggatt's mother did not live there, we went to Wise's; Duggett said the person she had them from was on the two pair of stairs; she had before said it was a one pair, I went there, and found Turner, Bury, and a woman named Todd, I searched Turner, and found two duplicates in his pocket, one for a watch, pawned in the name of

I fetched Duggett from Mr. Wise's, when I took her into the room, I asked her if either of them were the men, she said No; she did not know them. I had previously asked if she knew the baker's name, she said "No;" and turned round, and Bury took the advantage of that and ran to her. I suspected them, and then the said young man's name was Davis, who gave her the spoons to pawn. After they had been examined, the prisoner, Davis, came to the office, to ask about a hat, which had been brought away, with the name of Davis, made it, I said I could not part with it, but shewed it to him, he said it was his. I went with him to No. 4, Charles-street, and found Todd there, I took her and him into custody.</p>

            , I live at No. 4, Charles-street, I know all the prisoners. On the Saturday night I was out, and came home about eleven o'clock, I heard nothing of the spoons till Friday morning, when one of the young men asked Duggett if he would pledge five tea-spoons, I do not know which it was, but they were all there, she said she did not like. One of them again asked her to pawn them for 30 s., she took them, and returned, saying, the pawnbroker would not let her have so much; one of them sent her with two table-spoons to pawn for 1 l. I cannot say who gave them to her. Duggett lived on the first floor, with Bury; I live on the second floor, with Davis. Turner was a stranger, he only came the night before.</p>

She sat down again, got up, and stood against the window, and said she should like to see the cork boots; I handed them to her.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He said I should go away that night, and so I took him at his word. I sent my things home. The spoons were safe after I left. I went the next night for my money, this woman called me to the pawnbroker's and asked me pawn a spoon for her.</p>

I found a parcel of people on the first, second, or third floor, I cannot tell which, and the prisoners among them. The three prisoners were standing together in the loft, and when Raven saw me, he put his hands up to his face and cried bitterly. I think he was ashamed, as I knew him before. There was a ladder there which led to the roof; I told him I was astonished at his injuring me when I was a friend to him; he made no answer. I went on the roof and missed a quantity of lead which was fixed to the building. They were taken to the watch-house. I slept in the next house, and heard a rumbling noise in the course of that night.</p>

            . On the 14th of November, about three o'clock, I saw a cart unloading next to my house, the prisoner was in it unloading it - I was at the window; he put his hand into a bundle, took out two or three things, looked at them, and put them in again; this excited my suspicion; he then opened a drawer in a chest, while the man and boy were assisting in getting the things in. As he opened the drawer, he took out a book, looked at it, and put it in again, he then took a ball of string, and put<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050079"/>it in again, he took out the book again; and concealed it under the straw in the cart - I continued to watch him, he took out another drawer, and overhauled that; took out a gown, as I thought, held it up, and stuffed it into his bosom, and buttoned his coat over it. I gave them information.</p>

             is my brother-in-law. I was receiving the goods from the prisoner, Mr. Duncan gave me information - I jumped into the cart, and saw the prisoner's coat bulky, I kept my eye on him, the people kept looking at him, which I supposed made him think himself suspected; I saw him unbutton his coat, the gown was under it, he dropped it as if he wished to conceal it; and then said, "Here is a gown laying here." I said, "Yes, and it was under your coat just this minute," he asked what good it would do him, to conceal it under his coat; I said just as much as any other thief - I charged him with having a book, he denied it; I sent for an officer, he jumped out of the cart, took the book out of his bosom, and threw it up to me, and said,</p>

On the 26th of November, about six o'clock at night, I stopped the prisoner on that road by the five mile stone, and took him to the Green Man, public-house, and found a chisel and knife on him. He had left the fowls at the Green Man, public-house, the people are not here, the landlady's son said in his presence, that he left some fowls there in the course of that day - he brought out seven fowls tied in a pair of trowsers, and a pair of chaise reins; the prisoner did not deny leaving them then, but said they were his own, the fowls were dead and picked, and a bloody knife was found on him.</p>

            . I live with my father, who keeps a chandlers' shop in Buckeringe-street, Bloomsbury; the prisoner lived in the neighbourhood; I pawned the snuff box at Wises, on the 26th of October, which I had bought of the prisoner three or four months before; I did not know it was gold, I gave him 5 s. for it; he came to me on a Sunday afternoon, and asked me to buy it, I said, I did not want such a thing; he came again on Monday, and asked me to have the goodness to buy it, and I bought it; he said he found it at the corner of James's-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell Wise that it belonged to a relation of yours, and you had recently redeemed it - A. Yes, I do not know why I came to say so. I told the truth when I was taken up.</p>

I went out, and on returning the prisoner stood at the door of the White Bear; we went into the parlour; Felton was not there; I asked where he was: the prisoner said he was not well, and was gone into the yard: and he had told Felton he had some cattle to pay for in the market, and it would save him going to Bethnall-green for it, and that Felton authorized him to come to me for what sum he wanted; I asked what sum: he said I might let him have two sovereigns: and then he said it was not enough, I might let him have another, which I gave him; he put them in his pocket. He then nudged my elbow, and told me not to tell Felton, and he would return them on Saturday; he then got up, and said he would see me and Felton in a day or two, for if he was not in the market at 3 o'clock he should be fined 10 l.</p>

I went to him and told him our business; he proposed to let me have a house at 25 l. a year, or 40 l. a year if furnished; we looked at it, and agreed to take it furnished. I gave him 2 l. deposit, and produced his receipt; he said nothing about security. We were to take possession on the 7th of November. Next morning Wallis and Bolton informed me of this, and said he had promised to return it on Saturday at ten o'clock; he did not come, and I went to his house, but could not find him; but I met him on Wednesday by appointment at the Black Bull, Smithfield. On the 7th he brought me a bill for 15 l. he said it was for a forfeit of 10 l. in not having the house ready, and 2 l. deposit. I asked what the other three was for, he would not explain, but I told him; he then said "Did Bolton tell you of that;" I said "Yes: and I will stick to you as tight as wax."</p>
               <p>Q. On the 1st of November did he tell you he had some cattle to pay for at Smithfield, and ask you to advance him 3 l. - A. No: I never authorized him to ask Bolton for what he wanted, or any thing of the kind. She does not live with me. I have known her parents for years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you summons me? - A. Yes, for the deposit; not for the 3 l.</p>

Harvey came into the parlour and said Felton had authorized him to have what money he wanted from her, and he wanted 2 l. then he said another would do, for it would serve him going home, and save him 10 l. in the market; he nudged her elbows, told her not to tell Felton, and he would bring it her on Saturday morning.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 10th of November, about half-past 8 o'clock, Fletcher employed me at Ratcliff-cross-stairs; he said he wanted me to fetch some timber from Blackwall. I rowed him by the Foley House, and stopped there an hour and a half, till the water floated the timber, he then shoved five pieces out; we rowed them up to Jessop's Wharf, and got there between two and three o'clock in the morning; he told me to call next morning on Jessop, who paid me.</p>

I found four whole pieces of timber and three lengths, which appeared to have been cut from one piece, and marked S X B. and B K.; he said he bought them of Fletcher, and produced the bill and receipt.

I did not go, and between seven and eight he came and knocked me up. I went, and agreed for four pieces at 2 l. 15 s. a load, and 2 s. wharfage.</p>

I called stop thief - nobody would assist me; but the publican said he would get me 9 l. back by Monday; but he put me off till Wednesday, and then told me I should find the prisoner in Long-alley, but I could not.

            . I am landlord of the Star, and have kept it six months. The prosecutrix was there with three women and her son. They had two glasses of rum, the prosecutrix said she would pay for it, and gave her son 2 s. He said that was not enough. She turned round to give him some more, and said her purse was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner there? - A. He was an hour before. She said, "Bill, you have my purse." He denied it. She then went into the tap-room and said she was robbed of 40 l. I ran to the office and brought three officers, and she told them so, she then reduced it to 12 l. I saw nobody run out.</p>

            . I am a painter and glazier. On the 30th of October I was in Oxford-street, and saw the prisoner with another at an upholsterer's shop below Dean-street, looking at the door; they passed me and went up to the prosecutor's door. Two chairs stood in front of the shop, the prisoner took them and ran into Chapel-street. I followed and took them from him. I heard him tell the boy to watch while he went in the other shop.</p>

He walked further into the shop and laid hold of a phaeton knee boot. I seized him; he asked me to let him go, and said he really did not cut it off, and that he was going to bring it to me - a knife was found on him.</p>

At three o'clock in the afternoon the prisoner came and borrowed a shovel and pick-axe of me; he worked at the next building to Chandler's; he returned it about four o'clock, and asked if I would have any thing to drink; we went and had a pot of beer; he went out while I was was drinking with my wife, and I suppose he thought I was going to remain at the public house, but in five minutes, as it was getting dark, I went to the back of the building, found a board taken down, and missed the lead from its place, and found it a few yards off. I went to the public house, he came over, and I saw sand on his shoes; I had seen footmarks on the sand by the board. In about an hour he returned to the premises, and took up the lead, lifted it on his shoulder, and I seized him.</p>

I stopped Williams and Flood, and found the paper on Williams. Before I secured them they went along Hart-street together, and stood a few minutes, then ran up Phoenix-yard; I ran round and secured them in Hanover-street. Flood said he would have his regulars out of Williams. Bryand's father brought him to the office, on hearing he was wanted; I took them to Brown, who missed the paper; I know his name is Williams.</p>

I did not go to the vessel again till the 25th of October, and found him and the things gone. I found him at Soderberg's house, in New Gravel-lane; it is a lodging house for sailors; Anderson was living there with him. I asked Saunders where my chest was; he said it was in the house, but I could not have it, for the master of the house was at Gravesend. I said if he would be there next day I would come for them; he said he would. I went next day, and he was out; I saw Ander- who said my chest was safe, in the room, but the master and mistress were out, and I could not have it. I met Saunders in Ratcliff highway; he said the person of the house was out, and had got the key; I took him to the office, and went with Morant to search the house, and found Anderson, and asked her for the key; she said she had not got it; but we insisted on having it; and, after a good deal of hesitation; she produced it from her pocket; she was in the front room, ground floor; the key opened the back room. I found my trunk there, the locks forced, and the articles stated in the indictment, gone, and a quantity of other things. My night-cap and tooth-pick were found in Anderson's pocket, with a parcel of duplicates.</p>

I found a tooth-pick, and a night-cap on Anderson, with R. Manners at full length on it; also some duplicates. On the 29th, I apprehended Sodeberg and his wife at the office, where they came. In a cupboard, in the back parlour, I found a pair of sheets a pillow-case, nineteen waistcoats, three pair of drawers, ten pair and a half of hose, five pair of stockings, two shirts and a towel; and, on the front parlour floor, I found a pair of sheets, and two waistcoats, and four pair of stockings. I found a quantity of property at Mount's, the pawnbrokers, and four sheets at Kernall's. Anderson said she pawned part of them. I found the cot up stairs, between the sacking of a bed; and the blankets were in use on different beds.</p>

In the beginning of October, the prisoner called at my house, saying he was a watchmaker; and asked me if I had any thing to repair; he was a stranger. I gave him a clock to repair; he said he lived in Great James's-street, Lisson-green; he brought the clock back the same day. I gave him a time-piece, he brought that home the same day, or the day after, and I then gave him two watches; I do not think he asked for them, they were both silver, old, and worth 50 s.; he never returned them; I did not go to Lisson-green; I made inquiry after him, but could not find him. I saw one of my watches in pawn, about six weeks after, the other was produced by a pawnbroker at the office. I never gave him authority to pawn them. When I saw him in custody, I said, "I am sorry to see you in this situation;" he said, "He was very sorry too, and that great distress caused him to be there." His wife appeared at the office with a family.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. What is the value of the two time pieces - A.1 l., the clock was worth 4 l., they were both returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he say he pawned them to relieve his necessity, but never intended to steal them - A. He said something of the kind; I paid him for the clock; we made an agreement for the watches and time-pieces together.</p>

               <p>MR. BRODRICK contended that it was clear that the prisoner had a special possession of the property, and that a subsequent taking could not be a felony, and cited 2 d. vol. East's Reports, chap. 16, sec. 109, p. 682 and 683; also, 1st. vol. Hawkins's Reports, chap. 33, sec. 2.</p>

            . I did not find the duplicate on him, but received it from Mr. Richards, of Bridgewater-square; he said that the duplicate of Perkins' watch was at Richards's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley rose the same objection as Mr. Brodrick.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Richards persuaded me to take a shop in the City; my friends promised me money to commence business, but did not fulfil that promise. I was obliged to have goods on credit, and sold them on credit; sea captains frequented the shop, I took their bills, which were dishonoured. I was arrested for 22 l. and pawned the watch to give the officers money to leave the house till the afternoon, when I should have the money. I could not redeem it, and next day had an execution in my house, I gave Richards the duplicates, hoping to redeem them, but never had it in my power.</p>

I said I am an officer, and suspect you have not come honestly by this copper - I wish to know where you got it from, and where are you going to take tt;" the other said to the prisoner, "Never mind any b - y officer, you follow me" - he walked off, I seized the prisoner with the copper, and gave him to a person to hold, and followed the other, and when I seized him, he threw a ripping chisel at me, and knocked me down, and ran off, I could not pursue any further; he was secured, and brought back to me; I found the key of the stable in his pocket, with some skeleton keys; I handcuffed them both together, and within one hundred yards of the watch-house, he slipped his hands out, and escaped. I was wounded in the head and temples with the chisel, and could not follow. My house is five minutes walk from the prosecutor's.</p>

            , the original proprietor, concurred in the exchange, and the prisoners were acting in concurrence with him; or, in other words, whether the owner of the goods, in acting with them, could be considered as stealing this property. Another question was, whether it could be considered as a robbery, when the intention was not so much to defraud Marsh and Co. as to cheat and defraud the King. Both questions have been carefully considered, and the majority of the Judges are of opinion, that this is a larceny, and that the prisoners are properly found guilty of stealing the property, describing it to be the property of Marsh and Co. A person may have a temporary and a special ownership in particular property; one man may be the general owner, and the other special owner for a particular purpose, and if the general owner steal from the special owner, the law considers it as a theft. In this case it is clear that Marsh and Co., for a special purpose, were temporary owners of the property, till it should reach the ship; they had great interest at stake, and were liable to the forfeiture of their bond, if it did not reach its destination; and any one stealing the property during that interval, would be liable to be indicted for stealing it, as their property, and it would be a robbery, though the general owner concurred in the robbery; they had no right to divest Marsh and Co. of the possession of the property at that time. This point is not entirely new, for the question whether the general owner of goods could be guilty of a theft by stealing them from the special owner, is laid down in Mr. Justice Foster's Reports, p. 123 and 124. That a man under some accusations may be guilty of larceny in stealing his property. Therefore the objection, that 
               <persName id="o18211205-1-person1775">Wm. Marsden</persName>
             coneurred in the theft of the property, does not (on the authority just referred to) make it the less a theft; and it is not the less a theft, because the intent was not so much to cheat and defraud Marsh and Co., as to cheat and defraud the Crown. If the object was to steal, it is not the less theft, because the principal object was to effect some other fraudulent purpose. In this case, therefore, inasmuch as Marsh and Co. had the dominion over the goods from the time they were on board their lighter till they reached the ship, and as the prisoners, together with 
               <persName id="o18211205-1-person1776">Wm. </persName>
            Marsden, the original owner, concurred in stealing it from the possession of Marsh and Co. against their will and knowledge, they took the property animo furandi, for in point of fact, they did steal it from Marsh and Co. and all the consequences of theft attach on it. This is the opinion of the majority of the Judges, and the reasons are from my own opinion of the subject. The Judges are of opinion that the prisoners are properly convicted, and sentence will be passed at the usual period."</p>
